2018-09-10-T-001-S-00001,2018-09-10-T-001,1,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"asked the Minister for National Development with the recent announcements of the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme, Home Improvement Programme II and relaxation of CPF rules for purchase of older flats, to what extent do these measures address the concerns on the lease decay issue and how do the measures support long-term urban planning in Singapore."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00002,2018-09-10-T-001,2,Alex Yam,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether he can provide more information about the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS); (b) what is the projected timeframe for its implementation; (c) which are the precincts that will be eligible; and (d) how will the compensation package be computed.
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00003,2018-09-10-T-001,3,Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Government's offer to buy back HDB flats older than 70 years extends to all flats or only selected ones; (b) what will be the selection criteria for the eligible VERS precincts; and (c) what options will residents have if they fail to get VERS for their flat.
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00004,2018-09-10-T-001,4,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the factors considered in the planning phase for the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme; and (b) whether the private developers will have a role in the redevelopment programme and, if so, can more details be shared."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00005,2018-09-10-T-001,5,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I would like to take Question Nos 1 to 4 together?"
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00006,2018-09-10-T-001,6,Speaker,Please do.
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00007,2018-09-10-T-001,7,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, over the last 50 years, HDB home ownership has uplifted generations of Singaporeans, and given them a stake in the nation’s progress. The Government is committed to strengthen our institution of public housing and home ownership, so that it continues to bring tangible benefits to current and future generations of Singaporeans."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00008,2018-09-10-T-001,8,Lawrence Wong,"This is why at the recent National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted MND's plans to systematically upgrade older HDB flats through HIP and HIP II, and to progressively renew and rebuild older HDB towns through the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS)."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00009,2018-09-10-T-001,9,Lawrence Wong,"Various Members have asked about the details of VERS. VERS will be launched in about 20 years’ time to pace out the redevelopment of our older towns. Some of our older housing estates were built up in a hurry to meet the housing needs of Singaporeans at that time. By spreading out the redevelopment of these towns over a span of 20 to 30 years through VERS, we can avoid having to rebuild entire towns in a similar hurry, which would be highly disruptive."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00010,2018-09-10-T-001,10,Lawrence Wong,"This large-scale redevelopment effort is a good opportunity not only to rebuild some of our older precincts, but also to introduce new and exciting concepts of living in our newer towns into our older towns. To achieve this, we will need to carefully study how to select the precincts and stage the redevelopment, precinct by precinct, town by town."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00011,2018-09-10-T-001,11,Lawrence Wong,"We have already explained the broad concept of VERS and how it is different from SERS. SERS is limited to precincts where there is high development value to be unlocked. Because of the value unlocked, we share this value with residents through generous compensation, and the acquisition can be made compulsory."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00012,2018-09-10-T-001,12,Lawrence Wong,"In the case of VERS, we expect more flats to be eligible, as the intention is to space out the redevelopment of the town. But the compensation terms for VERS will be less generous than SERS, because we will be redeveloping land that is more built up. Hence, VERS will be offered on a voluntary basis and residents will get to vote."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00013,2018-09-10-T-001,13,Lawrence Wong,"We have outlined the broad concept of VERS. But there are still many details to work out, and we will need time to do so. This includes the extent of coverage of VERS and how the compensation will be computed. In particular, we will ensure that we implement VERS in a fiscally sustainable way, so that it does not become a burden for the next generation."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00014,2018-09-10-T-001,14,Lawrence Wong,"For residents who do not get VERS for their flat, or who do not poll in favour of VERS, they will continue to live in their flats which would have benefited from two rounds of upgrading. If they need a place at the end of the lease, the Government will help them get another flat to live in. It could be a new flat from HDB for those who are eligible; a resale flat on a shorter lease; or a 2-room flexi-flat for retirement. So, we will have various options to cater to diverse needs."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00015,2018-09-10-T-001,15,Lawrence Wong,"Miss Cheryl Chan has asked whether private developers will have a role in the redevelopment programme. In fact, in the case of SERS today, we already from time to time, inject some private development in the redevelopment process. So, for VERS, going forward, I will not rule out the possibility of having private developers being involved; and we will study her suggestion carefully. But let us be very clear -- our aim is to redevelop public housing estates. So, we will ensure that any redevelopment is done in a way that preservers the character of our HDB towns and supports HDB's mission to provide affordable and quality homes for Singaporeans."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00016,2018-09-10-T-001,16,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, the Government has put in place ambitious housing plans for the next few decades. Whether they come to pass depends on our external, economic and financial situation. But this Government has a track record of delivering on our commitments. We will continue to work with all Singaporeans to translate our plans into reality and build a better Singapore for the future."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00017,2018-09-10-T-001,17,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister two supplementary questions. The first is the guidelines for selecting the precincts for VERS. Is it purely based on age or are there other factors? The second question is what percentage of votes will be considered successful during the polling in VERS, in order to qualify for it."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00018,2018-09-10-T-001,18,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I can understand the interest in VERS and these are detailed questions that Miss Chan and several Members have asked as well  what are the criteria for selection, what is the threshold for voting. I am afraid these are details that we will have to study and I do not have a reply today. I think it would be premature to talk about such details now, because we are indeed going through a very thorough study of how to go about implementing VERS. These issues will be incorporated into our study."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00019,2018-09-10-T-001,19,Saktiandi Supaat,"To the Minister, I would like to follow up on a point mentioned earlier his speech. I know it is going to be 20 years more before you are going to share what VERS is. But can you share in terms of timeline; how soon will the residents who would potentially be in the precinct be informed of the potential of their precincts being included in the VERS selection? How soon would it be? Would it be 18 years? Two years before 20 years? Five years before 20 years?"
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00020,2018-09-10-T-001,20,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, again, I think we are getting into a level of detail. I can understand the Member's concerns. Residents may be wondering whether their flats are eligible and when HDB will inform. So, these are issues that we will study and we will take into consideration  timelines, and ensuring that if and when we are ready for VERS, we provide adequate time to notify the residents who are affected."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00021,2018-09-10-T-001,21,Alex Yam,"I thank the Minister and I understand many details need to be worked out. So, I will ask a question in reverse of the hon Members Mr Saktiandi. How long would this study take and when can we expect that the Ministry will come back to the House to share more details once the study is concluded?"
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00022,2018-09-10-T-001,22,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I would not want to restrict or indicate now specific deadlines but we have been looking at this issue for quite some time. We have already indicated the broad roadmap, if you will, for how we think about housing redevelopment. From now, going forward, there are quite a number of major items that have to be put in place. First of all, in the more immediate plans, we are talking about extending HIP which is already a major programme. We are talking about the next batch of flats that are built between 1987 and 1997. After that, we are looking at the older flats when they reach 60 years to do the second round of HIP. That is a major programme, assuming we have budget for it, to roll out HIP II. After that, we have VERS, and as I said earlier, we will study how best to go about implementing VERS – the precincts that will be selected, the compensation amounts, the threshold, the mechanism for voting. These are details that will have to be looked at."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00023,2018-09-10-T-001,23,Lawrence Wong,"When we put all these in place, it is really quite a major series of initiatives and programmes that will have to be implemented. We will do it step by step, systematically."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00024,2018-09-10-T-001,24,Speaker,Dr Lily Neo.
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00025,2018-09-10-T-001,25,Lily Neo,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Two supplementary questions, please. May I ask the Minister whether SERS will be affected or delayed due to the announcement of VERS? Secondly, will the Government be burdened financially with this VERS programme?"
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00026,2018-09-10-T-001,26,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, there will not be any delay in SERS. For SERS, we have already selected many of the sites with high development potential. For SERS, I think there are a few more sites. And we will continue to implement SERS in the coming years. We do not intend to hold back the SERS programme."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00027,2018-09-10-T-001,27,Lawrence Wong,"On financial sustainability, I think that is a very important point that Dr Lily Neo has mentioned. And as I said earlier, we are committed to ensuring that even as we have laid out the broad roadmap for public housing going forward, we are committed to ensuring that whatever we do, it is done in a way that it is sustainable over the long term."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00028,2018-09-10-T-001,28,Speaker,Ms Denise Phua.
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00029,2018-09-10-T-001,29,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Taking reference from enbloc sales in private estates, how would Government prevent the high possibility of the VERS exercise becoming very acrimonious? Also, how does Government then intend to protect the rights of minority who might object to the exercise, just like in the private sector?"
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00030,2018-09-10-T-001,30,Denise Phua Lay Peng,The Government must have thought through before announcing VERS. What lessons can be drawn from private enbloc exercises and what could be prevented to make sure that these problems do not occur or recur similarly in the public housing exercise?
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00031,2018-09-10-T-001,31,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, as Ms Denise Phua has said, it is indeed a concern that we have picked up and people have shared with us. They worry that the process of voting for VERS can end up with an acrimonious situation amongst neighbours. So, we are mindful of the concerns but I would say this process of getting votes for upgrading is not new. HDB has done it before; of course, under more limited upgrading programmes like Lift Upgrading, HIP. We do have a mechanism to get residents to vote for upgrading. We have some experience. We will build on that experience. We will see what had been done in the private sector and we will work out what is the best possible arrangement for VERS in order to achieve the outcomes that we want while minimising some of the downsides that the Member has highlighted."
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00032,2018-09-10-T-001,32,Speaker,"Minister, just to clarify, were you planning to take Question No 5 together with the first four? Or treat them separately?"
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00033,2018-09-10-T-001,33,Lawrence Wong,I will take Question Nos 5 and 6 later.
2018-09-10-T-001-S-00034,2018-09-10-T-001,34,Speaker,Okay. Question No 5.
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00035,2018-09-10-T-002,35,Ong Teng Koon,asked the Minister for National Development whether more details can be provided regarding the usage of CPF funds for buying HDB flats with remaining leases of less than 60 years.
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00036,2018-09-10-T-002,36,Chong Kee Hiong,"asked the Minister for National Development in view of the increasing number of elderly Singaporeans with HDB flats and private properties with leases of less than 60 years and the restrictions on the use of CPF for such properties, what measures are in place to assist such owners who have difficulty selling their properties to downgrade to smaller flats or properties."
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00037,2018-09-10-T-002,37,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, let me now take Question Nos 5 and 6 together."
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00038,2018-09-10-T-002,38,Speaker,Please do.
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00039,2018-09-10-T-002,39,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, owners of older HDB flats and private residential properties are generally still able to sell their flats in the resale market today. Potential buyers of such properties come from a wide spectrum of life stages and circumstances, and have different housing needs. For example, elderly buyers, or families who are not yet ready to commit to a longer lease, may choose to buy a residential property with a shorter lease. Older residential properties are also attractive to some buyers as they are usually more centrally located and served by established amenities."
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00040,2018-09-10-T-002,40,Lawrence Wong,MND is also working with CPF Board on how we can provide more flexibility on the use of CPF monies to purchase flats with shorter leases while safeguarding retirement adequacy. We are working out the details of these changes and will share them when ready.
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00041,2018-09-10-T-002,41,Lawrence Wong,"Besides selling their HDB flats or private residential properties, elderly homeowners can consider other monetisation options to unlock the value of their properties. These options include renting out their spare bedrooms or the whole property, or selling back part of their lease to HDB under the Lease Buyback Scheme. As Members would be familiar, we have just recently announced the extension of the Lease Buyback Scheme to 5-room flats and larger HDB flats so that more Singaporeans can benefit from this scheme."
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00042,2018-09-10-T-002,42,Ong Teng Koon,"I thank the Minister for the answer. Mr Speaker, the way that the percentage of CPF that is allowed to finance a flat with less than 60 years of lease, the number of years remaining when a person has turned 55, divided by the number of years remaining in the lease when he just bought a flat. The last time I looked at it, for a person who is 21 years old, to buy a flat of 60 years left, he can only finance 40%-odd of the lease. Would the Minister consider putting in a higher percentage or can he do something to help the ""financiability"" of older flats?"
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00043,2018-09-10-T-002,43,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I thank Mr Ong for his suggestions and comments. As I mentioned, there are a series of CPF rules today pertaining to the purchase of shorter lease flats. First of all, one restriction is that your age and the lease of your flat must meet the minimum of 80 years, which is a point that the Member alluded to. Another restriction is that for a flat with a lease that is shorter than 60 years, there is a proration formula that kicks in. These are the existing rules today. We are reviewing these rules and when ready, we will be able to share with the public what the revised rules are and the timeframe for when the new rules can be implemented, bearing in mind that with CPF changes, it is not just about policy changes, but we also have to amend or update the IT system for CPF. So, it may take some time but we will be able to share when we are ready with our review."
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00044,2018-09-10-T-002,44,Pritam Singh,Can I clarify with the Minister if there are any plans to review the attractiveness of the Lease Buyback Scheme in view of the relatively low take up to-date?
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00045,2018-09-10-T-002,45,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, the Lease Buyback Scheme is an option that we make available to seniors. Inherently, the amount that you can unlock from the Lease Buyback Scheme, particularly for larger flats, may be smaller than the amount that you can get if you were to sell the flat in the resale market and right-size. That is understandable because if you sell the entire flat, you get larger proceeds; but with Lease Buyback Scheme, you are selling only part of the lease. There will be differences in the proceeds that a senior can get from right-sizing versus Lease Buyback. That is to be expected. The point is we are trying to make available more options so that seniors can decide, one way or the other, whatever their circumstances are. Some may prefer to right-size and move out, but some may actually prefer to say, ""I want to live in my present flat and age-in-place""."
2018-09-10-T-002-S-00046,2018-09-10-T-002,46,Lawrence Wong,"Therefore, if that is your preference, we allow you an option, which is the Lease Buyback Scheme, and we are now expanding that option so that it is universal; so that it is not just confined to those staying in 4-room or smaller flats, but anyone in an HDB flat can have access to it. I think that is the basis for our thinking around these schemes, and we will, as I have mentioned earlier, continue to review them and make sure that Singaporeans in HDB flats will have a range of options to unlock the value of their flats for retirement."
2018-09-10-T-003-S-00047,2018-09-10-T-003,47,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether he can provide an update on the extent that our SMEs have applied and commercialised the technologies developed by A*STAR and its research entities; and (b) what are the key challenges and obstacles faced by SMEs in their attempt to apply and commercialise A*STAR technologies.
2018-09-10-T-003-S-00048,2018-09-10-T-003,48,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, A*STAR supports our SMEs in technology commercialisation in several ways. First, SMEs license intellectual property (IP) from A*STAR for deployment and commercialisation. Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) programme, the number of licences taken up by SMEs grew from 129 licences in FY16 to 178 licences in FY17. This builds on A*STAR efforts under RIE2015, where A*STAR issued 627 licences to SMEs from FY11 to FY15."
2018-09-10-T-003-S-00049,2018-09-10-T-003,49,Chee Hong Tat,"Second, technology transfer to SMEs also takes place through the attachment of A*STAR researchers. Under the Technology for Enterprise Capability Upgrading (T-Up) scheme, A*STAR seconds its researchers to SMEs to help build in-house Research & Development (R&D) and technical capabilities. Since the launch of the scheme in 2003, A*STAR has seconded 769 researchers to SMEs, and this has benefited 678 SMEs."
2018-09-10-T-003-S-00050,2018-09-10-T-003,50,Chee Hong Tat,"SMEs can also tap on A*STAR capabilities and facilities without owning or licensing the technologies. Under A*STAR's Tech Access programme, SMEs can make use of A*STAR equipment and technological know-how to prototype new products, qualify new processes and test out new applications. Since the launch of the scheme in 2017, 30 companies have been supported under this programme."
2018-09-10-T-003-S-00051,2018-09-10-T-003,51,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the challenges faced by our SMEs in applying and commercialising technologies are two-fold. First, many SMEs lack the resources to make full use of technology in their existing business strategies. To address this, A*STAR provides assistance to our SMEs to help them develop their technology strategies through the Operation & Technology Roadmapping (OTR) programme. This helps companies make better-informed decisions in their firm-level innovation strategies, including decisions related to R&D and IP. It also identifies potential R&D partners within and outside of A*STAR who can work with the SMEs. A*STAR aims to achieve 400 OTRs from FY17 to FY20. Since 1 April 2017 to 31 July 2018, a total of 178 companies have joined the programme."
2018-09-10-T-003-S-00052,2018-09-10-T-003,52,Chee Hong Tat,"Second, many SMEs are not familiar with managing and commercialising IP. The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore has put in place several initiatives to help our SMEs grow their enterprise through intangible assets, including IP from A*STAR and other sources. This includes complimentary legal and business clinics, where SMEs can receive advice from IP consultants and lawyers. Around 600 companies have benefitted from the programme since its launch in 2015."
2018-09-10-T-003-S-00053,2018-09-10-T-003,53,Chee Hong Tat,"To expedite the commercialisation of IP, the Singapore National IP Protocol for Publicly Funded R&D was updated in April this year. The enhanced IP framework will facilitate collaborations between industry and public sector researchers, including research spin-outs, joint labs with industry and industry-academia consortia."
2018-09-10-T-003-S-00054,2018-09-10-T-003,54,Chee Hong Tat,"The answer is ""yes"". We will consider the outcome of these cooperation projects. These are not one-off efforts. The Government is investing in R&D and collaborating with companies to commercialise the R&D outcomes. We want to help SMEs to transform and improve their competitiveness, so that they can compete more effectively in overseas markets. We will continue to support these projects, and carefully evaluate the outcomes."
2018-09-10-T-004-S-00055,2018-09-10-T-004,55,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in light of the price of water having increased by 30% effective July 2018 (a) what has been the feedback from industries and businesses with high water usage; and (b) how can the Government help to address the impact on the challenges faced by our industries and businesses in respect of the SMEs' competitiveness.
2018-09-10-T-004-S-00056,2018-09-10-T-004,56,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, Sir. Government economic agencies regularly engage businesses and monitor feedback on the cost of doing business. This includes costs arising from both external and domestic price developments."
2018-09-10-T-004-S-00057,2018-09-10-T-004,57,Chee Hong Tat,"As overall business costs include components such as labour and rental, the costs of water and electricity constitute a small percentage of total business costs for most companies. The rise in water price since July 2017 is estimated to increase total business costs in the chemicals industry by 0.10%, general manufacturing industry by 0.12%, accommodation industry by 0.17%, and the food services industry by 0.26%."
2018-09-10-T-004-S-00058,2018-09-10-T-004,58,Chee Hong Tat,"Government agencies have been working with our industry partners to help companies reduce their water usage, which will reduce their water bills. For instance, EDB and PUB are working with businesses to implement water efficiency measures and to tap on alternative sources of water, such as seawater, for process cooling. The Singapore Food Manufacturers' Association is exploring a partnership with the Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore to adopt food waste digesters for water recycling."
2018-09-10-T-004-S-00059,2018-09-10-T-004,59,Chee Hong Tat,"Businesses looking to improve water efficiency can tap on PUB's Water Efficiency Fund to implement water saving measures. For more customised capability building solutions, including the adoption of water efficiency standards, businesses may tap on Enterprise Singapore's Capability Development Grant (CDG), which defrays up to 70% of qualifying project costs."
2018-09-10-T-004-S-00060,2018-09-10-T-004,60,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I encourage businesses to use the available schemes and adopt measures to save water and improve productivity. And if you are successful in achieving cost savings, you can then share some of these savings with your workers and with your customers."
2018-09-10-T-005-S-00061,2018-09-10-T-005,61,K Thanaletchimi,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether hospitalisation leave issued directly by community hospitals to an employee is recognised as hospitalisation leave by the employer; and (b) whether the Employment Act will provide for such recognition in light of increasing follow-up visits made by patients with community hospitals directly.
2018-09-10-T-005-S-00062,2018-09-10-T-005,62,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, in our reply to a similar question previously filed by the Member, we explained that in general, community hospitals receive patients who are referred from acute hospitals. Hospitalisation leave certified by a doctor from an acute hospital remains valid under the Employment Act (EA), even if the patient is subsequently transferred to a community hospital. This remains the typical route by which patients enter the community hospital."
2018-09-10-T-005-S-00063,2018-09-10-T-005,63,Josephine Teo,"Hospitalisation leave issued for patients directly admitted to a community hospital should be recognised under the Employment Act, similar to stays in other public hospitals. However, we understand that only a very small proportion of community hospital patients are directly admitted – that is, admitted without being referred by an acute hospital. Such patients are typically referred by nursing homes or home care providers, and would not be employees in need of hospitalisation leave."
2018-09-10-T-005-S-00064,2018-09-10-T-005,64,Josephine Teo,"Currently, the Employment Act does not name the community hospitals as among the list of approved medical institutions for certifying hospitalisation leave. MOM intends to work with the Ministry of Health to update this list, and will consult the tripartite partners before finalising it."
2018-09-10-T-005-S-00065,2018-09-10-T-005,65,K Thanaletchimi,I must thank the Minister for Ministry for Manpower for that. I would just like to know the timeline for that revision to happen.
2018-09-10-T-005-S-00066,2018-09-10-T-005,66,Josephine Teo,"The review is on-going and when we are ready, we will update Members."
2018-09-10-T-005-S-00067,2018-09-10-T-005,67,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"It is good news to hear that from the Minister. I would also like to put in a suggestion, as part of the review, to look at registered TCM practitioners by MOH."
2018-09-10-T-005-S-00068,2018-09-10-T-005,68,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, we note the Member's suggestion. We will certainly take it up with MOH."
2018-09-10-T-005-S-00069,2018-09-10-T-005,69,K Thanaletchimi,"I would also like to ask the Minister if the Primary Care Network clinics are considered to be on par with the GP clinics, so that under the Employment Act, the medical certificates (MC) are recognised and also, they are able to get reimbursements from the employers."
2018-09-10-T-005-S-00070,2018-09-10-T-005,70,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, the recognition of medical certificates for paid sick leave as provided for in the Employment Act has two parts to it. One part of it is that if it is issued by a Government medical officer, it will be recognised for the purposes of paid sick leave. Alternatively, if the medical practitioner is registered under the Medical Registration Act, and is part of a panel of company-approved practitioners, then the medical certificates are also recognised for paid sick leave. So, in the case of the Primary Care Network, if it falls into these two categories, then the answer is yes."
2018-09-10-T-006-S-00071,2018-09-10-T-006,71,Ganesh Rajaram,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he can provide an update on the investigation into the possible misuse of funds at National Football League side Tiong Bahru FC.
2018-09-10-T-006-S-00072,2018-09-10-T-006,72,Amrin Amin,"Police investigations into Tiong Bahru Football Club and various other entities associated with the case are in their final phase. The recommendations will be submitted to the Attorney-General’s Chambers in due course. For now, it is not appropriate for me to comment further."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00073,2018-09-10-T-007,73,Kok Heng Leun,asked the Minister for Communications and Information what is the standard operating procedure for the declassification of Government documents.
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00074,2018-09-10-T-007,74,Sim Ann,"Mr Speaker, under the NLB Act, public records which are more than 25 years old become a part of the public archives. The National Archives facilitates the public's access to the archived government documents for the purpose of reference or research, subject to conditions or restrictions imposed by public agencies."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00075,2018-09-10-T-007,75,Sim Ann,The standard operating procedure for the declassification of Government documents is as follows
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00076,2018-09-10-T-007,76,Sim Ann,"(a) The National Archives of Singapore (NAS) digitises Government documents in their existing formats, whether they are microfilm or paper records."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00077,2018-09-10-T-007,77,Sim Ann,(b) NAS sends the digitised Government documents to the relevant agency for declassification.
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00078,2018-09-10-T-007,78,Sim Ann,"(c) The agency will review the Government documents and decide if the documents can be released for viewing, citation and reproduction."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00079,2018-09-10-T-007,79,Sim Ann,"(d) During the review of documents, the agency will take into account national security concerns, confidentiality obligations and personal privacy considerations."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00080,2018-09-10-T-007,80,Sim Ann,"(e) If the documents can be released, their metadata will be made available through NAS' Archives Online, so that the documents can be made searchable."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00081,2018-09-10-T-007,81,Kok Heng Leun,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I have some supplementary questions. I think I ask this question in light of all the interest on history debate, and I have heard from historians that they would like to have more access. So, are there actually barriers for researchers to access this information? If there are, what are the kinds of barriers that come about?"
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00082,2018-09-10-T-007,82,Kok Heng Leun,"Secondly, are these documents categorised in terms of sensitivities? So, for some that the agencies may think are sensitive at this moment, are there timelines to look at declassifying them?"
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00083,2018-09-10-T-007,83,Kok Heng Leun,"Thirdly, would it be possible that instead of not allowing public access, some of the documents can be redacted, so that the sensitive parts can be covered up and then people can access it."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00084,2018-09-10-T-007,84,Kok Heng Leun,The last question  have all Government documents been passed to the National Archives over the years?
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00085,2018-09-10-T-007,85,Sim Ann,"Sir, the answer to Mr Kok Heng Leun's supplementary questions, actually, the first three are all related. In terms of the researchers' request when they make a request to view documents, the public agencies that originated the documents will have to be consulted. The criteria I have talked about  these are to do with national security concerns, confidentiality obligations and personal privacy considerations. So, once these have been decided upon, then the documents can be declassified and then made available for public search and also made available to the researcher for reviewing and for study."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00086,2018-09-10-T-007,86,Sim Ann,"For his fourth question, as I have explained, the public records which are more than 25 years old become a part of the public archives. If the researchers go onto our NAS' archives online and they cannot find what they are looking for, they can make a request and the process of them contacting the agency and also seeking the agencies' views as to whether or not the various considerations used – security and privacy, and so forth – have been dealt with, will commence."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00087,2018-09-10-T-007,87,Kok Heng Leun,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. Can I check, is it true that certain documents would only be allowed for certain researchers to look through, that you actually do select researchers and not open to all researchers?"
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00088,2018-09-10-T-007,88,Sim Ann,"Mr Speaker, I do not know that to be true."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00089,2018-09-10-T-007,89,Leon Perera,"Would the Senior Minister of State be able to comment on roughly what proportion of documents actually make their way onto the NAS Online as opposed to documents that are withheld and are not available online, say, in the past five years?"
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00090,2018-09-10-T-007,90,Sim Ann,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the question was about standard operating procedures which I believe I have explained to the Member Mr Kok. I do not have the information that Mr Leon Perera has asked for."
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00091,2018-09-10-T-007,91,Pritam Singh,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for sharing details of the SOP. Just to clarify a point about the 25-year guideline – the public record is reviewed, it is then sent to the agency concerned and the agency will comment on national security matters, personal issues and so on. Are those matters then redacted and the documents still released to the National Archives or is the document, because of certain national security concerns, not released at all?"
2018-09-10-T-007-S-00092,2018-09-10-T-007,92,Sim Ann,"Mr Speaker, Sir, we will release documents that have met or have addressed the concerns that I have listed before, which deal with national security, personal privacy, as well as confidentiality obligations."
2018-09-10-T-008-S-00093,2018-09-10-T-008,93,Kok Heng Leun,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) since 2014, how many complaints have been received by NLB over books with homosexual content; (b) how many of these are in the children's section, and adult and other sections respectively and what are their titles; (c) what have been the actions taken in response and what are the books that have been pulped, removed from the library, or moved from one section to another; (d) how many complaints are there about books with religious, racial and other content and what are the actions taken in light of the complaints; and (e) what is the overall policy on such books."
2018-09-10-T-008-S-00094,2018-09-10-T-008,94,S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, Sir, since 2014, the National Library Board (NLB) has received 11 complaints from members of the public over titles with homosexual content. Eight of these titles were moved to sections for older readers, while three were assessed to be suitable to remain in the original collection for children and young adults. The NLB also received feedback on 23 titles due to race, religion and other topics. Of these, seven were moved to sections for older readers, and eight were retained in their original collection. A series of eight Malay children’s titles –"
2018-09-10-T-008-S-00095,2018-09-10-T-008,95,S Iswaran,"NLB brings in an average of 86,000 new titles for the 26 public libraries each year to ensure that library collections remain updated and relevant for Singaporeans of all ages. Titles are selected based on a collection policy which aims to provide age-appropriate and diverse reading material. The collection policy also takes reference from IMDA's general Content Guidelines for Imported Publications. The broad guidelines of the collection policy and selection criteria are available on NLB's website."
2018-09-10-T-008-S-00096,2018-09-10-T-008,96,S Iswaran,"NLB seeks to balance the need for a wide-ranging library collection with sensitivity towards our community norms. Beyond its team of book selectors, the NLB also relies on pre-publication information from publishers and vendors, and reviews from library journals. In some instances, review copies are requested so that the NLB can assess these books in greater detail. In addition, the Library Consultative Panel (LCP), comprising citizens from a wide cross-section of our society, was established in 2015 to provide diverse community perspectives and recommendations to NLB on books which are being reviewed due to content concerns raised by members of the public."
2018-09-10-T-009-S-00097,2018-09-10-T-009,97,K Thanaletchimi,"asked the Minister for Education (a) how many schools are currently equipped with elderly-friendly facilities like lifts or escalators to cater to the ageing teaching workforce and those who have mobility issues; and (b) for those schools without these facilities, whether there are any plans to install such facilities."
2018-09-10-T-009-S-00098,2018-09-10-T-009,98,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, MOE includes barrier-free accessibility enhancements, including lifts, whenever new schools are built or existing schools undergo major upgrading. About 70% of our Government Primary and Secondary schools are currently fitted with lifts."
2018-09-10-T-009-S-00099,2018-09-10-T-009,99,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The remaining schools would be provided with lifts over the next five years, either as part of their scheduled major upgrading works, or else as a special lift upgrading programme."
2018-09-10-T-009-S-00100,2018-09-10-T-009,100,K Thanaletchimi,"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. I just wish to know, when lifts are built, are the teachers consulted on the locations where the lifts are to be built? Is there any consultation or review with the teachers in the school before it has been planned to be built?"
2018-09-10-T-009-S-00101,2018-09-10-T-009,101,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Sir, I thank the Member for the supplementary question. Yes, certainly, we not only consult the teachers, we also look at the demographics, the students' profile and the teaching needs availability and requirement of the people who work within the school as well as those who use the facilities. We will continue to do this to ensure that it provides as much as possible barrier-free accessibility to all the stakeholders."
2018-09-10-T-009-S-00102,2018-09-10-T-009,102,K Thanaletchimi,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I just wish to highlight that one or two of the schools, they built lifts near to the gym. Gym is supposed to be where students exercise and they are supposed to be climbing the stairways, but instead the lifts are built alongside and not at the mainstream classrooms' column. So, I just wonder whether a lot of consultation have gone in before even planning the lifts' location."
2018-09-10-T-009-S-00103,2018-09-10-T-009,103,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"I thank the Member again for the supplementary question. I think this is a very specific case. I will get further details from her. Nevertheless, as I mentioned earlier, this is something that we always look out for. We speak to the teaching community in the school and, at the same time, there may be issues of greater priority that we want to tackle in certain schools, which I may be able to share with the Member later."
2018-09-10-T-010-S-00104,2018-09-10-T-010,104,Ganesh Rajaram,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether Sport Singapore and national sports associations have developed programmes and training to advise talented Singapore athletes who may be considering professional sporting careers; and (b) if so, whether there is a comprehensive support system for athletes that advises them on preparations, what to expect and contract negotiations and whether Singaporean athletes are aware of such training and support systems."
2018-09-10-T-010-S-00105,2018-09-10-T-010,105,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Sports have the power to rally and unite a nation, and we want to see Singaporeans achieve their full potential. One of MCCY's priorities is to enable our Team Singapore athletes to reach their full potential and achieve sporting success when they represent Singapore in international competitions, such as the Olympics and Southeast Asian Games. Sport Singapore (SportSG) partners stakeholders such as the National Sports Associations (NSAs) to support our athletes by providing financial grants, coaching, sports science and sports medicine expertise, as well as overseas training and competition opportunities. SportSG also supports the personal development of Team Singapore athletes through its Athlete Life Management (ALM) programme, which helps athletes cope with the demands of high performance sports, while pursuing education goals and preparing for a successful transition to a post-sport career."
2018-09-10-T-010-S-00106,2018-09-10-T-010,106,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In 2013, the Singapore Sports Institute (SSI) set up the Sports Excellence Business (spexBusiness) Network to offer career development opportunities to active and retired Team Singapore athletes, including internships, apprenticeships, part-time positions, as well as permanent positions with flexible work arrangements. There are now 58 corporate partners in the network, and over 220 Team Singapore athletes have benefited from the network. They include former national athletes, such as shuttler Derek Wong who has made a successful transition to a post-sport career with Deloitte."
2018-09-10-T-010-S-00107,2018-09-10-T-010,107,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In addition, SSI has partnered 12 Institutes of Higher Learning under its spexEducation Scheme to support student-athletes with flexible academic arrangements to help them balance the demands of both sport and academic development. Athlete Life Coaching is also provided to guide athletes in their education pathway, as well as support for schools' admission and scholarship applications. To date, over 400 student-athletes have benefited from this scheme."
2018-09-10-T-010-S-00108,2018-09-10-T-010,108,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In the course of striving for sporting excellence, some athletes may consider pursuing professional sporting careers. As the decision to turn professional is a personal choice, this is best left to the athlete to decide in consultation with the family, the manager, if he or she has appointed one, and the respective NSA. SportSG shares with the athletes the key considerations for turning professional and provides resources. In 2016, SSI partnered Deloitte to develop a reference guide for Team Singapore athletes on how to secure, maintain and retain corporate sponsorships as a professional athlete."
2018-09-10-T-010-S-00109,2018-09-10-T-010,109,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Our Team Singapore athletes are aware that they can avail themselves of all these programmes we have put in place to support their overall well-being as they pursue excellence in sports.
2018-09-10-T-011-S-00110,2018-09-10-T-011,110,K Thanaletchimi,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there is a special committee formed to address the training needs, programmes and programme accreditation for jobs identified under the Healthcare Industry Transformation Maps; and (b) whether the Ministry is supportive of union participation in the committee with the involvement of the three healthcare clusters to form a training council so as to address the training needs of all categories of healthcare staff involved."
2018-09-10-T-011-S-00111,2018-09-10-T-011,111,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) are a tripartite effort to set out our industry transformation plan through the three pillars of Enhancing Jobs and Skills, Raising Productivity and Catalysing Innovation. MOH would like to thank the Healthcare Services Employees’ Union (HSEU) for working closely with us on the Healthcare ITMs."
2018-09-10-T-011-S-00112,2018-09-10-T-011,112,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"MOH takes a holistic approach towards manpower development for the various healthcare professions where training is considered together with regulatory policies, professional practices and job re-design."
2018-09-10-T-011-S-00113,2018-09-10-T-011,113,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For major professions, such as Nursing, we have set up dedicated committees to look into these issues. For example, the MOH National Nursing Taskforce and the Future Nursing Career Review Committee which the union is represented in. We have also set up committees on specific areas which require more focused attention, such as the Skills Framework Steering Committee, which has engaged the union on the development of the Skills Framework for Healthcare."
2018-09-10-T-011-S-00114,2018-09-10-T-011,114,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Skills Framework will document emerging healthcare roles and skills according to the strategic directions outlined in the healthcare ITM. It will also map training programmes to the associated competencies.
2018-09-10-T-011-S-00115,2018-09-10-T-011,115,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The Skills Framework for Healthcare will be completed this year, and it represents an opportunity to strengthen the tripartite relationship between MOH, the healthcare clusters and the union to prepare our workforce for the future."
2018-09-10-T-011-S-00116,2018-09-10-T-011,116,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"MOH will continue to engage HSEU and our clusters at appropriate fora to identify training needs, particularly of workers preparing to take on emerging roles, and organise training programmes to address them. To this end, we note that HSEU and NTUC Learning Hub launched the HSEU Healthcare Academy as a collaborative effort to provide some of this training."
2018-09-10-T-011-S-00117,2018-09-10-T-011,117,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We are happy to work with the Labour Movement further to strengthen and deepen our links on workforce training and development. These efforts at tripartite dialogue with union and employers can take place at all levels without a formal training council, and we look forward to continuing our journey with HSEU in this area."
2018-09-10-T-011-S-00118,2018-09-10-T-011,118,K Thanaletchimi,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor for the reply. Dr Khor mentioned that the Skills Framework will be out at the end of this year. May I know which profession or category of jobs in the Skills Framework will be out? Is it particularly nursing, allied health or all the other categories of jobs?"
2018-09-10-T-011-S-00119,2018-09-10-T-011,119,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The categories of jobs or occupations that are covered under the Skills Framework, we will be launching for a number of them in the first instance and these will generally be the nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech therapists, pharmacy technicians, support care staff, patient service associates."
2018-09-10-T-012-S-00120,2018-09-10-T-012,120,Kok Heng Leun,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether any assistance has been provided to the vendors displaced from the Kreta Ayer weekend market; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider allowing vendors to resume their activities at the weekend market once renovations are completed.
2018-09-10-T-012-S-00121,2018-09-10-T-012,121,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Kreta Ayer Flea Market was organised and operated by the Kreta Ayer Community Centre Management Committee (KA CCMC). The vendors operating at the flea market were registered with and managed by KA CCMC. KA CCMC had applied for and was issued a temporary fair permit by NEA to hold the flea market in an open public area.
2018-09-10-T-012-S-00122,2018-09-10-T-012,122,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In June this year, KA CCMC informed NEA that the flea market would be affected by construction works and would, therefore, cease operations from 2 July 2018. Accordingly, the temporary fair permit was cancelled. Prior to the market’s closure, we understand that KA CCMC, as the operator of the flea market, had reached out to individual vendors about a month ahead of the closure to explain the decision and address the vendors’ concerns. KA CCMC further offered financial support and referred some of them to temporary flea markets at other precincts. There are also various Government-funded training programmes for those who wish to pick up new skills and seek more stable forms of employment."
2018-09-10-T-012-S-00123,2018-09-10-T-012,123,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"NEA has not received any new application for a trade fair permit to restart the Kreta Ayer Flea Market. NEA will assess such applications on a case by case basis, taking into consideration the potential impact on fair competition for the surrounding shops and the need to minimise disamenities to residents in the vicinity."
2018-09-10-T-013-S-00124,2018-09-10-T-013,124,Zainal Sapari,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of workers who have lodged a complaint against their employers for failing to provide itemised payslips since the time such payslips were made mandatory on 1 April 2016; (b) how many companies have failed to issue itemised payslips to their workers; and (c) what measures are being taken to educate and help employers, especially those in small-to-medium enterprises, in complying with the legislation to issue itemised payslips to their employees."
2018-09-10-T-013-S-00125,2018-09-10-T-013,125,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, over the past two years, MOM has received about 500 complaints against employers for not issuing itemised payslips. Through proactive inspections on employers, another 1,200 employers were formally informed to rectify their practices."
2018-09-10-T-013-S-00126,2018-09-10-T-013,126,Zaqy Mohamad,"Employers were given sufficient time to prepare with ample access to solutions and resources to comply. When the requirement was introduced, MOM worked with tripartite partners and industry associations, such as the NTUC U Care Centre, U SME, Federation of Merchants’ Associations Singapore, and the Association of Small & Medium Enterprises, to increase awareness and offer solutions. Guidebooks on complying with the requirements and templates for the payslips have been distributed to about 180,000 employers so far. In fact, these templates can be downloaded from the MOM website in four verncular languages. Small and Medium Enterprises can also tap on the HR Shared Services providers, such as those appointed under Enterprise Singapore’s HR Shared Services scheme, to help them to be in full compliance with the law."
2018-09-10-T-013-S-00127,2018-09-10-T-013,127,Zainal Sapari,"Mr Speaker, I have three supplementary questions for the Minister of State. First, what were some of the main reasons cited by the employers for not issuing the payslips? Second, would MOM expect these errant employers to issue backdated payslips to their workers to ensure they were properly remunerated? Third, does MOM know what proportion of employers have adopted the issuance of itemised payslips today?"
2018-09-10-T-013-S-00128,2018-09-10-T-013,128,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for his three supplementary questions. On the first question, one of the most common reasons given to us in terms of those who are found to have contravened the regulation is that they have a lack of resources or expertise on the ground to implement itemised payslips. MOM has continued to educate by putting in more effort into education to help employers, especially our Small and Medium Enterprises, to comply with the requirement. We have also worked with the likes of Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), Singapore Business Federation, Association of Small & Medium Enterprises (ASME), Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and others, to include seminars and workshops to educate them on the requirement and provide, as I have mentioned earlier, blank basic templates that they can use and download quite easily. In addition, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) has also appointed a pool of service providers that can help provide outsourcing of data processing and HR-related administration, and the aim is to help SMEs comply with the law as well. That is the first question."
2018-09-10-T-013-S-00129,2018-09-10-T-013,129,Zaqy Mohamad,"Second, with regard to whether MOM requires back-printing of payslips, at this point, we do not have that requirement. But MOM does get into details in the event of a dispute, in terms of asking the employer to provide various information, such as past payments, as well as other information, such as timesheets, long medical leave and other benefits that the employee may require. So, we do not make them print out and backdate the payslips. But in the event that they are required, the employee can ask the employer or come to MOM or the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) for mediation, if need be."
2018-09-10-T-013-S-00130,2018-09-10-T-013,130,Zaqy Mohamad,"On the last item, the proportion of employers who issue itemised payslips, based on MOM's survey since its inception in 2016, the vast majority or 95% of private establishments provide itemised payslips to their employees in 2017. The survey was done for private establishments with at least 25 employees. So, it is quite substantial. We have seen 95% come on board. But we also recognise that there is some non-compliance, that last 5%. This is where MOM will continue to reinforce the requirement in our communication to employers through various channels, including proactive inspections as part of our WorkRight Initiative. But going forward, we will also strengthen our enforcement against establishments that fail to issue itemised payslips. So, these establishments will be required to attend corrective clinics which will be conducted by TAFEP and the tripartite partners. Establishments which persistently fail to rectify their practices will be issued with relevant penalties."
2018-09-10-T-014-S-00131,2018-09-10-T-014,131,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Manpower how successful has the Foreign Workers Ambassador programme been in increasing the well-being of foreign workers.
2018-09-10-T-014-S-00132,2018-09-10-T-014,132,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, the Foreign Worker Ambassador programme is a volunteer scheme introduced by MOM in November 2014 for foreign workers to provide peer support to each other."
2018-09-10-T-014-S-00133,2018-09-10-T-014,133,Zaqy Mohamad,"To date, in partnership with the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC), MOM has grown this pool of Foreign Worker Ambassadors from about 300 in November 2014 to 2,600 in September 2018. We are encouraged that more foreign workers have come forward to volunteer to be trained as Ambassadors."
2018-09-10-T-014-S-00134,2018-09-10-T-014,134,Zaqy Mohamad,"Many of our Foreign Worker Ambassadors have said that they wish to ""pay it forward"", having received help from MOM and other Ambassadors previously. Many of them have also expressed an interest to help their fellow countrymen after settling in Singapore. Having been briefed by MOM on employment rights and regulations, work safety practices and social norms, the Ambassadors act on their own initiative to reach out to fellow foreign workers. Here are some examples."
2018-09-10-T-014-S-00135,2018-09-10-T-014,135,Zaqy Mohamad,"(a) Mr Molla Mohammad Saifullah, or Saiful, conducts briefing sessions on employment rights and regulations for construction workers like himself. We understand that more than 1,000 foreign workers have benefited from his efforts so far."
2018-09-10-T-014-S-00136,2018-09-10-T-014,136,Zaqy Mohamad,"(b) Mr Sulthan Kabeer Sahib Bava Bahrudeen, or Bava, together with fellow Ambassadors from the same dormitory, has been going around from one dormitory room to another on weekends to raise awareness amongst foreign workers on a variety of issues. These range from employment-related matters to the prevention of dengue, adherence to traffic rules and how to save water."
2018-09-10-T-014-S-00137,2018-09-10-T-014,137,Zaqy Mohamad,"(c) Mr Veluchamy Muniapparaj, or Raj, voluntarily provides advice on salary issues to fellow foreign workers, having gone through a wage dispute before. He has helped at least two of them seek assistance from MOM and recover their salaries successfully. We were heartened to know that these two individuals signed up as Foreign Worker Ambassadors thereafter. To further his outreach, Raj started taking Mandarin classes in 2017 to connect with Chinese workers, too."
2018-09-10-T-014-S-00138,2018-09-10-T-014,138,Zaqy Mohamad,MOM will continue to work with MWC to grow this pool of Foreign Worker Ambassadors to strengthen peer support networks amongst our foreign workers.
2018-09-10-T-015-S-00139,2018-09-10-T-015,139,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what enforcement actions have been taken against agencies who charge foreign workers more than the maximum cap for agency fees; (b) how have these enforcement actions benefited the relevant employees; (c) what can be done to prevent a person from incurring overly burdensome debts to come to Singapore to work; and (d) what can be done to ensure that deductions from employees' salaries made by employers are legitimate.
2018-09-10-T-015-S-00140,2018-09-10-T-015,140,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, it is me again. Employment Agencies (EAs) operating in Singapore are not allowed to collect fees exceeding one month of a worker's salary for each year of contracted service here, capped at two months' salary."
2018-09-10-T-015-S-00141,2018-09-10-T-015,141,Zaqy Mohamad,"Between 2015 to 2017, MOM took action against 23 errant EAs for violating this rule. Three were prosecuted and had their licences revoked while the remaining were given written warnings or had composition fines imposed on them. MOM also helped the workers who were in Singapore to recover their excess agency fees in full."
2018-09-10-T-015-S-00142,2018-09-10-T-015,142,Zaqy Mohamad,"While the Ministry has prohibited the EAs in Singapore from charging workers beyond the stipulated fee cap, it is also beyond our jurisdiction to regulate agents in the workers' home countries. However, whenever MOM's investigations reveal suspicious or irregular fee practices, we do not hesitate to share pertinent information with the foreign embassies to enlist their help to combat any malpractices in their respective countries."
2018-09-10-T-015-S-00143,2018-09-10-T-015,143,Zaqy Mohamad,"When applying for Work Permits, employers are required to declare key salary terms, in particular, basic and fixed monthly salary, and salary deductions, to prospective foreign workers. These terms are stated in the In-Principle Approval (IPA) letters, which are available in the workers' native languages, and must be sent to the workers prior to their departure to Singapore."
2018-09-10-T-015-S-00144,2018-09-10-T-015,144,Zaqy Mohamad,"Employers are not allowed to increase salary deductions from what is stated in the IPA, unless they have obtained the workers' written agreement and notified MOM of the revisions. In addition, these deductions must comply with the maximum deductions allowable under the Employment Act. Foreign workers who have had their salaries deducted without their written consent, or beyond what is allowable under the law, should report this to MOM as early as possible. This point will be made clear through the Settling-in Programme which will be rolled out to all new non-Malaysian foreign workers in Singapore starting with those in the construction sector from this year – October 2018."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00145,2018-09-10-T-016,145,Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Transport in light of the high prices of motorcycle COEs in recent biddings (a) whether the Ministry is concerned about the COE increase; (b) whether there is any market manipulation or any party who is keeping the COE prices up; (c) who bid for the nearly 400 bids that came in during the last moment before the tender closed at 4pm on 8 August 2018; (d) whether this high COE price has adversely impacted those who rely on motorcycles as a mode of transport or for their job; and (e) whether the Ministry will consider increasing the bid deposit and shorten its validity period.
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00146,2018-09-10-T-016,146,Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, for auctions with a fixed end time, it is common to see a spike in bidding activity near the closing time. We have seen this effect in COE bidding over the years and across all COE categories."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00147,2018-09-10-T-016,147,Lam Pin Min,"For the COE bidding session ending on 8 August 2018, 305 bids were received for Category D for motorcycles in the last two minutes. These were submitted by 25 different bidders and the bid numbers were generally small. Only one bidder submitted two block bids of 25 each. The bids also came in at different price points, which does not suggest any price collusion."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00148,2018-09-10-T-016,148,Lam Pin Min,"The Member has suggested raising the COE bid deposit and shortening the validity period for motorcycle Temporary COEs (TCOEs). Both suggestions are not cost-free to the motorcycle buyers. While raising the bid deposit may encourage dealers to be more prudent in submitting the bids, the higher bid deposit will raise costs for dealers. If the Temporary COE (TCOE) validity period is shortened, dealers may need to maintain a larger inventory of motorcycles to meet demand. This will increase business costs. High business costs will mean higher prices for the buyers. Shorter TCOEs may also make it more difficult for buyers to obtain motorcycles immediately."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00149,2018-09-10-T-016,149,Lam Pin Min,"In designing the COE system, we are mindful that motorcycle owners have different needs from owners of commercial and private cars. Our COE system therefore sets aside a separate Category D for motorcycle buyers so that they need not compete with commercial and private car owners. The cessation of the contribution by Category D to the Open Category since May 2017 has helped to stabilise the supply of motorcycle COEs. The majority of motorcycles also attract a much lower Additional Registration Fee (ARF) of 15% of the Open Market Value of motorcycles, compared to at least 100% for cars."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00150,2018-09-10-T-016,150,Lam Pin Min,"COE prices fluctuate based on demand and supply. In fact, Category D COE prices have been falling steadily this year, from approximately $8,000 in February to $4,390 in the latest September bidding cycle."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00151,2018-09-10-T-016,151,Lam Pin Min,"While we have not observed any irregular bidding activity or market manipulation, LTA will continue to monitor the situation closely. We are mindful of the needs of motorcycle owners and businesses, and are prepared to review the COE regulations if and when warranted."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00152,2018-09-10-T-016,152,Speaker,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00153,2018-09-10-T-016,153,Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Sir. I have one supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. According to my resident, the COE bidding was $1 up to the last three minutes and then suddenly, 400 bids came in and pushed the COE to $5,514. And a lot of my residents who depend on motorcycles for their transport as well as their job, like despatch rider, they are very concerned with this trend. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State  are there any measures that can be taken to address the concern of residents who depend on motorcycles as a mode of transport and their job"
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00154,2018-09-10-T-016,154,Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for the supplementary question. As I have mentioned in my reply, the last minute bids that come in towards the end of the bidding cycle is a common practice, not just only in Category D COE but also in all classes of COEs, and this is not unusual. In fact, COE prices, like I mentioned, fluctuate based on the supply and demand. And like I have mentioned in my reply, the COE prices have come down from $8,000 to about $4,300 in the most recent September bidding cycle."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00155,2018-09-10-T-016,155,Lam Pin Min,"With the tiered Additional Registration Fee, we have a very progressive ownership tax structure that favours buyers of motorcycles with a low Open Market Value. And I have also mentioned that we have already stopped the contribution of COEs from Category D to the Open Category. This also increases the supply of motorcycle COEs in the market. And I think, more importantly, besides our concern about the occasional increase in COE prices, the Government will also continue to enhance our public transport network and promote active mobility to create more commuting options for Singaporeans."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00156,2018-09-10-T-016,156,Speaker,Mr Faisal Manap.
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00157,2018-09-10-T-016,157,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. I just want a particular clarification. I just want to know from the Senior Minister of State whether there are any other cases of such similar situation that happened, in terms of last minute bids in the recent years."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00158,2018-09-10-T-016,158,Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary question. Like I have mentioned, it is not uncommon practice for bidders to come in at the last minute to bid for additional COEs. In fact, if I look at the bidding patterns, just over the last two to three months, about 20% to 26% of the bids were actually submitted in the last two minutes of most of the bidding cycles."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00159,2018-09-10-T-016,159,Speaker,Mr Murali.
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00160,2018-09-10-T-016,160,Murali Pillai,May I ask the Senior Minister of State whether the Ministry has any intention to prevent block biddings at the last minute.
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00161,2018-09-10-T-016,161,Lam Pin Min,"I thank the Member for the supplementary question. I think at this point in time, we do not have intention to prevent that. But, of course, the Ministry will continue to monitor the bidding patterns and, if necessary, we may make changes in the future."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00162,2018-09-10-T-016,162,Speaker,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00163,2018-09-10-T-016,163,Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Sir. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether for those who bid for $1, do they pay for their COE $1 or follow the rest. If not, can the Ministry study, just pay for what they bid for. Then, that would prevent the last minute coming in at high price."
2018-09-10-T-016-S-00164,2018-09-10-T-016,164,Lam Pin Min,"I would like to Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for that suggestion. I think the COE bidding system does not work this way. But nonetheless, we can take back and take a look and see what we can do about it."
2018-09-10-T-017-S-00165,2018-09-10-T-017,165,Ang Hin Kee,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry is aware of apps-based operators or operators offering courier services using private-hire vehicles and taxis; (b) whether LTA checks that such vehicles come with relevant commercial accident insurance; and (c) what is the progress on the National Taxi Association and National Private Hire Vehicles Association's calls for reviewing of regulations that allow their vehicles to do courier services.
2018-09-10-T-017-S-00166,2018-09-10-T-017,166,Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, Sir, taxis and private hire cars (PHCs) are meant to carry passengers for hire and reward, and should not be used for the conveyance of goods for reward without LTA's prior approval. This is to ensure that taxi and PHCs remain available to provide point-to-point (P2P) services for commuters. Drivers found violating these rules may have their vocational licenses revoked. Thus far, LTA has not found any driver in violation of these rules. LTA will actively enforce against such offences and will not hesitate to take firm action against the perpetrators."
2018-09-10-T-017-S-00167,2018-09-10-T-017,167,Janil Puthucheary,"Taxi and PHC operators that are interested in allowing their drivers to perform courier services on a limited trial basis may approach LTA to discuss such a possibility. LTA will work with them to assess the feasibility of a trial, how it should be scoped to ensure minimal impact on P2P availability, as well as the conditions necessary to safeguard commuter interests, for example, ensuring the vehicles have the appropriate third-party insurance coverage required under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act."
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00168,2018-09-10-T-018,168,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Defence for each year in the past five years (a) how many full-time National Servicemen (NSF) have requested assistance due to financial hardship after enlistment; (b) how many NSF receive SAF financial assistance; (c) what is the average dollar quantum and type of assistance provided to such applicants; (d) what is the average duration of time for processing and addressing such cases; and (e) how many cases of NSF Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL) charges have been associated with financial hardship.
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00169,2018-09-10-T-018,169,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Speaker, NSFs who require financial support can apply for Term Financial Assistance (TFA), which is monthly assistance that can be provided for as long as the NSFs are serving their full-time NS. The TFA eligibility criteria and quantum provided are similar to public financial assistance schemes. Family size, income and expenditure needs are considered and additional support is provided for families with school-going children and/or members with recurrent medical conditions."
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00170,2018-09-10-T-018,170,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"In processing applications, commanders conduct interviews and home visits to better understand the NSFs' family situation. About 80% of the applications are approved and on average, about 120 NSFs receive the TFA. Sums range from under a hundred to a few thousand dollars each month and for an average of eight months. The TFA grants were given to most recipients within two weeks of submitting the completed application."
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00171,2018-09-10-T-018,171,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"In addition to the TFA, their Commanding Officer (CO) or Department Head can extend quick financial aid in the form of a one-off Contingency Grant of up to $500, or the Welfare Grant for higher amounts. These schemes benefit more than 50 NSFs each year."
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00172,2018-09-10-T-018,172,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Over the last five years, a minority of NSF AWOL offenders convicted in the General Court Martial cited financial hardship as the main reason; about 28 cases a year, constituting about 14% of all offenders."
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00173,2018-09-10-T-018,173,Speaker,Mr Perera.
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00174,2018-09-10-T-018,174,Leon Perera,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. Just a few supplementary questions. The instances of NSFs who are charged for AWOL, who cite the financial difficulties, are there also cases of those individuals who go on to re-offend, to commit AWOLs subsequently, and what proportion go on to re-offend and also citing financial hardships."
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00175,2018-09-10-T-018,175,Leon Perera,"And then, secondly, in cases of re-offenders who repeatedly offend for AWOL because of financial hardship, what action is taken to more decisively address the issue or to look into the concern."
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00176,2018-09-10-T-018,176,Leon Perera,"And my third supplementary question is really on whether there are NSFs who are charged for taking up paid work in the hours when they are not on duty, when they are off duty as it were. Are there charges in such cases and how many of such cases will there be?"
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00177,2018-09-10-T-018,177,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me say about AWOL. AWOL is a serious offence so MINDEF, SAF will continue to take stern disciplinary action against servicemen who commit AWOL offences. With that we also understand that, as I mentioned earlier, a small proportion of our AWOLees cite financial reasons. Of the cases in 2017, for example, only one went on to commit AWOL offence despite receiving financial assistance; so the number is very small. As I mentioned, overall, about 14% cite financial reasons as the main reason why they offend."
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00178,2018-09-10-T-018,178,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"What do we do and what can we do to help them? While we take stern action against them, we also continue to assess their financial needs and we offer the financial assistance I have mentioned earlier. We counsel them. We look at the whole family situation. Where necessary, we make referrals to the other help agencies around. I must assure Members that financial assistance is not just provided by the SAF to these families. Often times, we know that there are many different touchpoints that families face, whether it is touchpoints – may be the schools, may be the hospitals, may be the community – so we look at where these touchpoints are and we help them. From the SAF perspective, we will continue to help these NSFs wherever we can, and as I mentioned earlier, once help is given, it is given throughout the period of service, whichever is lesser, for up to 12 months at any one time."
2018-09-10-T-018-S-00179,2018-09-10-T-018,179,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"On NSFs taking paid work, they know they are not supposed to take paid work. We are not aware of the details of NSFs taking paid work, but upon enlistment, we inform NSFs that at any point in time where they need financial assistance, they can come to their Commanding Officers, their OCs (Officers Commanding), their commanders to seek help, wherever necessary."
2018-09-10-T-019-S-00180,2018-09-10-T-019,180,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider allowing those who are disabled and insured under CareShield Life to make claims and commence receiving a prorated one-third of their monthly payouts upon their inability to perform one Activity of Daily Living (ADL) independently instead of waiting till they are unable to perform three or more ADLs independently before receiving payouts.
2018-09-10-T-019-S-00181,2018-09-10-T-019,181,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, CareShield Life will protect Singaporeans against the long-term care costs of severe disability by providing monthly cash payouts when a policyholder is unable to perform three or more Activities of Daily Living (ADL). To keep the scheme sustainable and premiums affordable for all, it is targeted at severe disability, given that the needs and costs for caring with someone with severe disability are most significant."
2018-09-10-T-019-S-00182,2018-09-10-T-019,182,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Should the scheme be expanded to cover mild to moderate disabilities, premiums will be significantly higher and affordability will be affected. Allowing policyholders to receive payouts, whether full or partial, once they are unable to perform one ADL will result in higher premiums. To illustrate, if policyholders are able to receive payouts once they are unable to perform two ADLs, premiums will need to increase by about one-third. If we loosen the claims criterion further to one ADL, premiums will increase even more significantly. Reducing the payouts by two-thirds at one ADL will not fully offset the premium increase required to cover the individuals who are unable to perform one ADL, as there will still be more claimants overall."
2018-09-10-T-019-S-00183,2018-09-10-T-019,183,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Singaporeans who wish to be have better coverage, including making a claim when they are unable to perform two ADLs, can consider purchasing Supplement policies from the private insurers, which is currently already available under the existing ElderShield. We also have other Government assistance schemes such as the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund as well as Government-funded safety nets such as MediFund and ComCare, to complement personal savings and family support to help Singaporeans with mild or moderate disabilities and who are facing financial difficulties."
2018-09-10-T-019-S-00184,2018-09-10-T-019,184,Speaker,Mr Gan Thiam Poh.
2018-09-10-T-019-S-00185,2018-09-10-T-019,185,Gan Thiam Poh,"Is it possible that Ministry will consider to give it as an option to all Singaporeans to consider, even though it is lower payout or higher premium, for one ADL, rather than wait for the three to be fulfilled?"
2018-09-10-T-019-S-00186,2018-09-10-T-019,186,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"This will be taken into account when designing the CareShield premiums. But as I said, if you take a leaf out of the ElderShield scheme, there is already coverage by way of supplements for those who have less than three ADLs."
2018-09-10-T-020-S-00187,2018-09-10-T-020,187,Chia Shi-Lu,asked the Minister for Health (a) how many children under the age of 18 have undergone cosmetic surgeries in each of the last five years in our private and public hospitals; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider implementing more precautionary measures to protect these children and educate their parents or guardians about the risks involved as they are still growing.
2018-09-10-T-020-S-00188,2018-09-10-T-020,188,Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, over the last five years, one person under the age of 18 had undergone a cosmetic surgery procedure, namely a double-eyelid creation, in our public hospitals. MOH does not track cosmetic surgeries done in the private hospitals."
2018-09-10-T-020-S-00189,2018-09-10-T-020,189,Lam Pin Min,"The Singapore Medical Council's (SMC) Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines stipulate that minors, defined as those under the age of 21, have to obtain their parents' or legal guardians' written consent prior to undergoing invasive procedures. This requirement applies to both public and private hospitals. For aesthetic procedures in particular, SMC's ethical guidelines stipulate that doctors must give patients a ""cooling off"" period to reconsider their decision before proceeding with the treatment. Also, they must not offer aesthetic procedures to minors, unless independent professional assessments indicate that these procedures are truly in their best interest. MOH's assessment is that these safeguards are appropriate."
2018-09-10-T-020-S-00190,2018-09-10-T-020,190,Chia Shi-Lu,"I thank Senior Minister of State for his replies. Just two supplementary questions  number one, would the Ministry consider collecting data on plastic surgery done on minors, 18 years and below or 21 years and below, in the private sector as well. I think he would understand that the impetus for this Parliamentary Question came from a recent newspaper report where some private plastic surgeons actually did mention that there were significant increases in the number of minors seeking plastic surgery and then even with their parents' support."
2018-09-10-T-020-S-00191,2018-09-10-T-020,191,Chia Shi-Lu,"My second supplementary question is whether the Ministry would consider in addition to the ethics codes and various guidelines for cosmetic procedures, whether they would consider coming up with guidelines specifically for plastic surgery in minors. Because if you look at the literature, the reasons for plastic surgery in minors versus adults can be quite different. For example, in minors, it is more to fit in; in adults more to stand out. That is just one example. And also because minors are still growing, the risks are also different. It may affect their development. So, I think it is a special group of patients and I just would like MOH to consider looking at this."
2018-09-10-T-020-S-00192,2018-09-10-T-020,192,Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Dr Chia for those two suggestions. As to the first one, whether we will consider collecting a data of minors undergoing aesthetic or cosmetic surgery in private hospitals, we will look at this suggestion. As for the guidelines for cosmetic or aesthetic surgery for minors, I think we will consult the Academy of Medicine whether this would be feasible."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00193,2018-09-10-T-021,193,Rahayu Mahzam,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) from 2012 to date, what is the number of complaints received regarding job discrimination faced by people with disabilities; (b) whether the Ministry has received feedback from individuals or organisations on job discrimination faced by people with disabilities during this period; (c) what are the main examples of discrimination; and (d) whether the Ministry will study the need for an anti-discrimination law to protect such persons."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00194,2018-09-10-T-021,194,,"In the past five years, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) received about 1,600 complaints on workplace issues, of which, four complaints were allegations of discrimination against persons with disabilities. Upon investigation, TAFEP found no evidence of discrimination, but that the main reason for such complaints was due to poor communication and lack of sensitivity when working with persons with disabilities. All the four cases were closed after TAFEP provided advice to the employers to improve their employment practices."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00195,2018-09-10-T-021,195,,We urge all individuals who feel that they have been discriminated against to approach TAFEP for advice and assistance. MOM will not hesitate to take actions against offending companies and curtail their work pass privileges.
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00196,2018-09-10-T-021,196,,"There is no conclusive evidence that anti-discrimination laws necessarily improve employability of persons with disabilities. In fact, such laws may have the unintended consequence of deterring employers from hiring them in the first instance. This may happen when employers are fearful that workers cannot be dismissed even with legitimate reasons or that their actions would be misconstrued as being unlawful."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00197,2018-09-10-T-021,197,,"The key to addressing discrimination is to change mindsets, and the effective tools for achieving this goes beyond legislation. For example, MOM supports employers through the Open Door Programme and Special Employment Credit scheme to improve employment outcomes for persons with disabilities. TAFEP also promotes fair and inclusive employment practices, and contribute to better employment outcomes for persons with disabilities."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00198,2018-09-10-T-021,198,Speaker,Ms Rahayu Mahzam.
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00199,2018-09-10-T-021,199,Rahayu Mahzam,"I thank the Minister of State for the explanation. I would just like to refer Minister of State to the recent study conducted by the Disabled People's Association together with IPS and the insights that they had discovered with regards to the unfair practices against people with disabilities. I am wondering what the Ministry's position on it is. I note that the numbers are not big but it does tell or show towards some discrimination which are not spoken of or where it is not clear whether there is discrimination, especially when no reasons are given when they are not given promotion or where they are not given the jobs. So, I am also wondering what the Ministry's position is on that. And I appreciate the difficulties and the counter-effect of having legislation but without legislation it is very difficult to enforce or implement certain policies. I am wondering if there is a middle ground to this. We could impose certain requirements or policies where you would require some sort of transparency when we speak about promotion or in employing people of disabilities."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00200,2018-09-10-T-021,200,Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. Firstly, MOM takes a very strict view; we take every discriminatory practice, whether for persons with disabilities or otherwise, very seriously. But, in fact, recently, the Tripartite Partners have also launched two tripartite standards that will help encourage companies not to have discriminatory practices, including against persons with disabilities. One was launched last November when we launched the Tripartite Standards of Recruitment Practices; the other one was in October when we launched the Tripartite Standards on Grievance Handling. These efforts are complemented by more specific measures by MOM, SGEnable and PWOs to help persons with disabilities gain employment and support employers to hire persons with disabilities through programmes such as Open-door Programme."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00201,2018-09-10-T-021,201,Zaqy Mohamad,"But I think, more importantly, the law today covers those who are disabled and those who are not under the Employment Act. Under the Employment Act, individuals who feel that they are wrongfully dismissed, including due to the disability, may appeal to MOM. If substantiated, MOM will take action against the employer, including requiring the errant employer to compensate the individual. Wrongful dismissal claims will be heard by the Employment Claims Tribunal in April 2019, after the Employment Act is amended later this year. We urge all individuals who feel that they have been wrongfully dismissed to approach MOM for advice and assistance as soon as possible."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00202,2018-09-10-T-021,202,Speaker,"Mr Melvin Yong, keep it short."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00203,2018-09-10-T-021,203,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. On occasions, we have also heard of employers who have made special arrangements for their disabled employees. Would MOM consider working with the Labour Movement and NGOs such as the Disabled People's Association to raise awareness on the best practices by these enlightened employers with disabled employees? And secondly, would MOM consider working with the Tripartite Partners to have such best practices put together as Tripartite Guidelines or even a Tripartite Standard."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00204,2018-09-10-T-021,204,Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. To help address discrimination against persons with disabilities, the Government takes a holistic and comprehensive approach through the Third Enabling Master Plan and this is done in collaboration by MOM with MSF and SGEnable to maximise the potential and opportunities for persons with disabilities."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00205,2018-09-10-T-021,205,Zaqy Mohamad,The Third Enabling Master Plan (EMP3) serves as a road map for Singapore to build a more inclusive society where persons with disabilities are empowered to contribute and realise their potential. Initiatives under the EMP3 include the Workplace Disability Inclusive Index which is an online assessment tool that helps employers assess their readiness to hire persons with disabilities and to identify areas for improvement. Second one is the Job Placement and Job Support Programme which provides vocational assessment and job-matching in open employment and post-placement support for up to 12 months and the Bi-annual Enabling Employers Award and Inclusive Business Forum which recognises and propagate progressive employment practices among employers.
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00206,2018-09-10-T-021,206,Zaqy Mohamad,"I am also glad that the Member asked about the involvement of Tripartite Partners because, as I alluded to Member Rahayu's questions earlier, in addition to supporting the EMP3, MOM launched two Tripartite Standards to Promote Inclusive Hiring Practice and Manage Workplace Grievances. As part of the Tripartite Standard of Recruitment Practices, the Standard encourages fair, merit-based and inclusive hiring practices for persons with disabilities, among other groups. As of the end of August 2018, about 700 employers with about 375,000 employees have adopted this Standard."
2018-09-10-T-021-S-00207,2018-09-10-T-021,207,Zaqy Mohamad,"Last October, when we launched the Tripartite Standard for Grievance Handling, the standard applied specifies a set of variable and actionable employment practices for companies to manage workplace grievances, including allegations of discrimination more effectively. Employers adopting this standard commit to put in place clear processes for handling employees' grievances to ensure that these are adequately dealt with. As of end August, about 750 employers with close to 430,000 employees have signed up for the Standard. MOM's focus is now to encourage more employers to adopt this standard and we will certainly support our Tripartite Partners in this endeavour."

2018-09-10-T-031-S-00229,2018-09-10-T-031,229,Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Transport, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00230,2018-09-10-T-031,230,Lam Pin Min,"LTA undertakes a very wide range of functions which have grown over time. Among others, LTA regulates public transport operators, develops and maintains our road and path networks, regulates vehicles and devices used on our roads and public paths, and enforces against a wide range of transport-related offences."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00231,2018-09-10-T-031,231,Lam Pin Min,"LTA is also faced with a constantly changing transport landscape. In particular, the increased use of active mobility in recent years has required LTA to step up its enforcement efforts to strike the right balance between promoting active mobility and ensuring the safety of other users of public paths and roads."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00232,2018-09-10-T-031,232,Lam Pin Min,"The Land Transport (Enforcement Measures) Bill (LTEM Bill) therefore amends seven different land transport-related Acts to strengthen LTA's enforcement capacity and enhance safety on our public paths and roads. These seven Acts are  (i) the Active Mobility Act (AMA), (ii) the Bus Services Industry Act (BSIA), (iii) the Land Transport Authority of Singapore Act (LTA Act), (iv) the Parking Places Act (PPA), (v) the Rapid Transit Systems Act (RTSA), (vi) the Road Traffic Act (RTA), and (vii) the Street Works Act (SWA)."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00233,2018-09-10-T-031,233,Lam Pin Min,This Bill has five main components
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00234,2018-09-10-T-031,234,Lam Pin Min,"The first enhances our laws to improve active mobility safety, including introducing a PMD registration regime."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00235,2018-09-10-T-031,235,Lam Pin Min,"The second augments LTA's enforcement capacity by empowering outsourced enforcement officers to exercise certain powers of LTA officers, in particular for certain active mobility offences."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00236,2018-09-10-T-031,236,Lam Pin Min,The third increases the penalties for persons who cause damage to public streets.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00237,2018-09-10-T-031,237,Lam Pin Min,"The fourth facilitates LTA's efforts to serve notices electronically; and lastly, the Bill makes miscellaneous amendments to update provisions in the various Acts."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00238,2018-09-10-T-031,238,Lam Pin Min,Let me explain each of these changes in turn.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00239,2018-09-10-T-031,239,Lam Pin Min,"The first set of amendments enhances our laws to improve active mobility safety. Active mobility, which includes walking, cycling, and the use of personal mobility devices (PMDs) and personal mobility aids (PMAs), has brought benefits and additional transport options to many Singaporeans. Some individuals use PMDs to take on food or package delivery jobs, while the elderly and those with walking difficulties use PMAs to get around more easily."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00240,2018-09-10-T-031,240,Lam Pin Min,"The AMA came into force in May this year. This laid down the framework of path-sharing rules and regulations, such as where devices can be used and what speed limits they have to adhere to. This was based on the recommendations made by the Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) in 2016 after extensive public consultation."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00241,2018-09-10-T-031,241,Lam Pin Min,"There are many responsible device users and cyclists who watch out for other path users, ride at safe speeds, and dismount and push their devices at crowded areas and at traffic junctions. We have also undertaken many efforts to educate and encourage safe riding practices. Since February 2018, there have been some 9,000 participants in the Safe Riding Programme."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00242,2018-09-10-T-031,242,Lam Pin Min,"Unfortunately, there are still reckless and inconsiderate riders who endanger the safety of others. Much concern has been expressed, including by Members of this House, about the increase in the number of accidents on public paths. To address this, LTA has stepped up its enforcement efforts since last year and has detected over 1,300 offences since May 2018. Several riders who have caused hurt in accidents have also been charged and sentenced in Court."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00243,2018-09-10-T-031,243,Lam Pin Min,"To further support effective enforcement against reckless behaviour on public paths, I had earlier announced that LTA will be introducing a registration regime for electric scooters (e-scooters) at AMAP’s recommendation. Clause 11 of the Bill thus introduces a new Part 3A to the AMA, consisting of new sections 28A to 28G, which lays out the legislative framework for a PMD registration regime."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00244,2018-09-10-T-031,244,Lam Pin Min,"The registration regime will help instil a greater sense of responsibility among owners and users of PMDs, deter reckless riding behaviour and facilitate the identification of errant users."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00245,2018-09-10-T-031,245,Lam Pin Min,"The new Part 3A make registration mandatory for the types of PMDs that the Minister prescribes in subsidiary legislation. As recommended by AMAP, we will start with the mandatory registration of e-scooters, which are motorised PMDs with handle-bars. It will be an offence to ride, or to cause or permit to ride, an unregistered e-scooter on public paths, knowing that, or reckless as to whether, the e-scooter is unregistered."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00246,2018-09-10-T-031,246,Lam Pin Min,"The applicant will be required to provide his personal particulars which will be stored in a register. This will facilitate the tracing of the person responsible when investigating offences involving a particular e-scooter. The applicant will also be required to declare that his e-scooter is compliant with the width, weight and maximum motorised speed restrictions for PMDs. This will ensure that only compliant e-scooters are ridden on our public paths. It will be an offence to make a false declaration during the registration process."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00247,2018-09-10-T-031,247,Lam Pin Min,"Once an e-scooter is registered, the registrant will be issued with a registration mark containing a unique registration number assigned to the e-scooter. The registrant will also be required to make and affix an identification mark, in the form of a sticker, prominently on the e-scooter. Under the new section 20A of the AMA, it will be an offence to ride the e-scooter on public paths without displaying the registration mark or identification sticker. This will make e-scooters more easily identifiable to enforcement officers and to the general public."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00248,2018-09-10-T-031,248,Lam Pin Min,"The new section 59A in the AMA also introduces a rebuttable presumption regime for certain active mobility offences. This is similar to the provisions under the RTA for driver-related traffic offences. If the individual owner of a bicycle, power-assisted bicycle, PMD, motorised wheelchair or mobility scooter fails to provide enforcement officers with information about the rider after a certain offence involving that device has been committed, the owner will be presumed to have been the rider who committed the offence. The owner can rebut this presumption by proving that he was not the rider at the time of the offence, such as by showing proof that he was then overseas. This reinforces the duty of owners to ensure the responsible use of their devices, and to assist with the administration of justice."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00249,2018-09-10-T-031,249,Lam Pin Min,"The Bill also makes amendments to the regulatory regime for motorised PMAs, that is, motorised wheelchairs and mobility scooters. PMAs enable the elderly and individuals with walking difficulties to move around. In recognition of this need, today’s law imposes fewer restrictions on PMAs. For example, there are currently no restrictions on the width, weight and device speed for motorised PMAs, and they are allowed to be ridden on pedestrian-only paths."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00250,2018-09-10-T-031,250,Lam Pin Min,"Unfortunately, some people have tried to take advantage of this. Irresponsible retailers have been falsely advertising non-compliant PMDs, such as overweight e-scooters with seats, as mobility scooters to circumvent our PMD regulations. This is despite the fact that these non-compliant PMDs are not designed to meet the usual specifications of mobility scooters, which have seats with back support and substantial footrests as their purpose is to carry individuals who are unable to walk or have walking difficulties. In addition to irresponsible retailers, some able-bodied users are also using PMAs to circumvent the restrictions on PMDs. This problem will likely worsen if left unchecked."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00251,2018-09-10-T-031,251,Lam Pin Min,"We have therefore accepted AMAP's recommendation to impose a maximum device speed limit of 10km/h on motorised PMAs. This will reduce the incentive for able-bodied users to switch to motorised PMAs, and safeguard the use of such devices for those who have genuine needs."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00252,2018-09-10-T-031,252,Lam Pin Min,"At the same time, this 10km/h device speed limit will not significantly impact genuine users. Most of the PMAs available today already comply with this speed limit. LTA will work closely with retailers, hospitals and voluntary welfare organisations to help PMA users adjust to the regulation."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00253,2018-09-10-T-031,253,Lam Pin Min,"To implement this, the Bill amends section 2 of the AMA to introduce a definition of a ""non-compliant mobility vehicle"" as a mobility scooter or motorised wheelchair that does not comply with regulations as to the construction of the device. The Bill also amends the AMA to prohibit the use of non-compliant mobility vehicles on public paths, and to prohibit the sale of such devices by retailers for use on public paths. This is similar to the treatment of non-compliant PMDs."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00254,2018-09-10-T-031,254,Lam Pin Min,"Apart from improving safety on public paths, we are also concerned about the issue of fire safety. There have been more than 80 fire incidents involving motorised PMDs since 2016. These pose serious public safety concerns."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00255,2018-09-10-T-031,255,Lam Pin Min,"Currently, many of the motorised PMDs sold in Singapore do not conform to any reliable safety standard. LTA has studied the safety standards available today, and determined that the UL2272 standard is suitable for application for motorised PMDs in Singapore. UL2272 is developed by an independent US certification company. Conformity with the standard under UL2272 can significantly improve the safety of motorised PMDs against fire and electrical hazards."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00256,2018-09-10-T-031,256,Lam Pin Min,"For public safety, we intend to require all motorised PMDs intended for use on public paths to conform to the UL2272 standard. We intend to prohibit retailers from selling motorised PMDs which are not UL2272 compliant from July 2019 onwards. Existing owners of motorised PMDs which are not UL2272 compliant can continue to use their devices until end-2020. Clause 4 of the Bill introduces a new section 19(3) into the AMA to allow the stipulation of such a grace period of usage. The use of motorised PMDs that are not UL2272 compliant on public paths will be illegal from January 2021 onwards."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00257,2018-09-10-T-031,257,Lam Pin Min,"To facilitate the introduction of UL2272 as a technical standard for motorised PMDs, Clause 35 introduces a new section 67A into the AMA. This allows LTA to refer to external technical standards without having to reproduce the text of the external material as part of the rule in Singapore. We will then prescribe the requirement for motorised PMDs to comply with the UL2272 standard as a device criterion under the Active Mobility Regulations."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00258,2018-09-10-T-031,258,Lam Pin Min,"Meanwhile, we strongly encourage owners of motorised PMDs to switch to UL2272-compliant devices as soon as possible in order to minimise the fire risk of their devices. When purchasing PMDs, consumers should try to buy from reputable sources and look out for fire safety standards. Consumers should also avoid overcharging batteries, modifying their PMDs or tampering with the electrical components of the PMDs."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00259,2018-09-10-T-031,259,Lam Pin Min,The second set of amendments will strengthen LTA’s enforcement capacity.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00260,2018-09-10-T-031,260,Lam Pin Min,"Today, LTA has a team of over 50 Active Mobility Enforcement Officers and cross-trained officers who enforce against errant active mobility users and indiscriminate bicycle parking across the island. However, LTA’s active mobility enforcement demands have grown tremendously over the past few years, and will continue to rise as active mobility becomes more popular."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00261,2018-09-10-T-031,261,Lam Pin Min,"To meet LTA’s increasing enforcement needs, Clause 39 introduces new sections 11, 11A and 11B to the LTA Act to allow LTA to appoint outsourced enforcement officers (OEOs) to exercise limited enforcement powers. LTA will be able to contract suitable individuals to exercise limited enforcement powers against selected offences such as indiscriminate parking of bicycles. Another example is that the OEOs are conferred the power to examine vehicles used on public paths to ensure compliance with the AMA."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00262,2018-09-10-T-031,262,Lam Pin Min,"The Bill demarcates what powers these OEOs can exercise. In addition, the Chief Executive of LTA will have to explicitly authorise which of the OEOs can exercise which of these powers. The Chief Executive of LTA will also have the power to specify where and when these OEOs can exercise these powers. The Bill expressly prohibits an OEO from exercising any power of arrest. It also requires them to be in uniform and show their identification cards when exercising their powers."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00263,2018-09-10-T-031,263,Lam Pin Min,The third group of amendments increases penalties for persons who damage public streets.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00264,2018-09-10-T-031,264,Lam Pin Min,"There have been several major oil spills and collisions between over-height vehicles and overhead structures such as pedestrian overhead bridges in recent years. These endanger the safety of road users, disrupt traffic, and incur high repair costs."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00265,2018-09-10-T-031,265,Lam Pin Min,"Under the SWA today, it is an offence to cause damage to public streets wilfully, but it is not an offence if the action in question is reckless or negligent. To deter such behaviour, clause 74 of the Bill changes sections 33 and 34 of the SWA in two ways"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00266,2018-09-10-T-031,266,Lam Pin Min,"First, it will be an offence to recklessly or negligently engage in conduct causing damage, with a penalty of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment up to six months."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00267,2018-09-10-T-031,267,Lam Pin Min,"Second, the maximum fine for intentionally engaging in conduct causing damage is correspondingly increased from $10,000 to $100,000. There is no change to the maximum jail term of six months."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00268,2018-09-10-T-031,268,Lam Pin Min,LTA retains the option of suing for the full cost of repair.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00269,2018-09-10-T-031,269,Lam Pin Min,The fourth set of amendments facilitates LTA’s efforts to serve notices electronically.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00270,2018-09-10-T-031,270,Lam Pin Min,"With advances in technology, many transactions and notifications can now be done via electronic means like email and SMS. In line with our Smart Nation and Digital Government strategies, the Bill amends the various land-transport Acts to allow LTA to serve notices through electronic means, instead of solely through hard-copy letters. This will simplify the notification process and enable faster response by the recipients. LTA will obtain the person’s consent, whether express or implied, for the use of the electronic mode of service before issuing electronic notices to the person."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00271,2018-09-10-T-031,271,Lam Pin Min,"To facilitate this, LTA will also expand the use of its Vehicle Registration and Licensing System (VRLS), which currently allows persons to submit RTA applications and documents electronically to LTA, and allows LTA to serve RTA notices electronically through the system. New sections 43 and 43A of the LTA Act will expand the scope of VRLS to cover applications, documents and notices under all land transport legislation administered by LTA."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00272,2018-09-10-T-031,272,Lam Pin Min,The final set of amendments are miscellaneous amendments to update provisions in certain Acts or to bring them in line with other Acts.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00273,2018-09-10-T-031,273,Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, this Bill will make LTA more effective in enforcing, managing and regulating the transport system. This will provide a better and safer transport landscape for all Singaporeans."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00274,2018-09-10-T-031,274,Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, I beg to move."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00275,2018-09-10-T-031,275,Lam Pin Min,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00276,2018-09-10-T-031,276,Ang Hin Kee,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. With easier access to rental bicycles and personal mobility devices (PMDs) that the Minister has spoken about, people are finding it more convenient to move around. I agree with him that many users are responsible. But, we too know of incidents whereby pedestrians were knocked down by cyclists or PMD users who were reckless; or fires which occurred due to overheating of batteries while these devices were being charged."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00277,2018-09-10-T-031,277,Ang Hin Kee,"It is important for device owners and users to exercise greater responsibility and ensure safety of others beyond the convenience of themselves. So, beyond the recommendations made by the Active Mobility Advisory Panel such as reducing speed limits or wearing of helmets by cyclists, I have four suggestions to make."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00278,2018-09-10-T-031,278,Ang Hin Kee,"Firstly, infrastructure. Sir, our residential estates are densely built up with inter-connected roads and narrow footpaths. The challenge is how to best redesign existing lanes or add on new ones to accommodate all types of users. It also includes erecting more signages and clearer warning signs where it is either prohibited to use certain devices or where restrictions exist. In this regard, I am pleased that at least in Ang Mo Kio Town, we have received support from the MND to improve our town. We will be adding more dedicated lanes for cyclists and PMD users; we will be able to install clearer and standardised signages, expand existing footpaths as well as cater for more parking facilities. I hope that soon more such improvements will be made across the Island."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00279,2018-09-10-T-031,279,Ang Hin Kee,"In this year’s Committee of Supply (COS) Debate, I also asked MOT to speed up the Silver Zone implementation so that more estates with elderly residents can have additional traffic-calming measures. I am glad that the roads around the two markets in my constituency will soon be revamped to be Silver Zones, and similarly, I hope MOT can implement more Silver Zones in more older estates sooner."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00280,2018-09-10-T-031,280,Ang Hin Kee,"With better designed roads and pavements, more traffic-calming features, clearer signages; I think, one part of the equation to have a safer and more pleasant commute for everybody will be in place."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00281,2018-09-10-T-031,281,Ang Hin Kee,"Secondly, what about insurance and protection? Early, the Senior Minister of State spoke about the increased number of people who were involved in accidents whereby users of PMDs, electric-bikes and so on, were the main cause of accidents."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00282,2018-09-10-T-031,282,Ang Hin Kee,"It is currently not mandatory for PMD users to buy insurance although back in 2016, a local insurance firm launched a first-of-its-kind insurance plan that covered accidental deaths, permanent disabilities, medical expenses against injuries and third-party liabilities for that accident when riding, mounting or dismounting a bicycle or PMD. PMD users, especially frequent daily users such as, those who use it to deliver food, couriers, should take out such insurance."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00283,2018-09-10-T-031,283,Ang Hin Kee,"On the other hand, many households are likely to be cycling or using PMDs only on a recreational basis, or infrequently. Hence, to make such insurance plans more affordable and flexible may be the way to go. So, I hope that the AMAP can work with the insurance companies to design more flexible insurance packages and coverage so that more users, whether the regular users who use them for their work or the recreational users who use them for the family, can find it easier to buy such insurance. It will be particularly important for users to be insured so that if there is an unfortunate incident of accident, the coverage can allow claims to be made from the insurance."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00284,2018-09-10-T-031,284,Ang Hin Kee,"Thirdly, earlier we heard about enforcement against errant users and retailers. Accidents involving PMD users or bike-cyclists sometimes can involve minor injuries, at times serious injuries, and even deaths. LTA has been issuing advisories, summons, to many cyclists and PMD users for unsafe riding. I think I want to commend them for their greater and more visible enforcement actions. It has helped to highlight the importance of having people who obey and have proper riding behaviour, rather than those who are errant in their behaviour."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00285,2018-09-10-T-031,285,Ang Hin Kee,"On the other hand, we also hear of efforts against errants retailers of PMDs and Power Assisted Bicycles (PABs) who are not compliant. I think such operations by the LTA and the Traffic Police are important and should be encouraged."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00286,2018-09-10-T-031,286,Ang Hin Kee,"Similarly, I would like to call upon LTA to offer a listing of more than just reputable sources of retailers – a listing to which all users can go through, knowing that any items that are sold will be those that are compliant. So beyond reputable sources, I hope the Senior Minister of State can work with MOT or LTA to give a listing to assure all consumers that any devices that they purchase in Singapore will be compliant. This will enable our users to have peace of mind knowing that they have bought from retailers in Singapore who have complied with all the rules and regulations."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00287,2018-09-10-T-031,287,Ang Hin Kee,"Finally, on educating users and general public, the Safe Riding Programme is a useful approach to education not only the young but the old and all users. I think this programme can work closer with the Traffic Police who similarly have other related programmes. If both agencies can partner and pool their resources togther, I am quite sure the 9,000 or more users or commuters who will learn and benefit from such safe riding programmes will multiple-fold in a shorter time period."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00288,2018-09-10-T-031,288,Ang Hin Kee,"Sir, for a car-lite society to take off, we need pedestrians, cyclists, PMD users and drivers to have the right mindset when sharing public spaces, pavements and roads. So, beyond legislation and enforcement measures, what is of utmost importance is for every pedestrian, driver or PMD user to be more considerate to other users while adhering to the rules and regulations of our roads."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00289,2018-09-10-T-031,289,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, earlier this year, an elderly gentleman by the name Wu Kher said to me that our regime for safe cycling has declined, pointing to the fact that in the earlier years, it was mandatory for bicycle owners to register their bicycles."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00290,2018-09-10-T-031,290,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"The irony of what this elderly man had said was not lost on me at all. Last year, electric bikes, otherwise knowns in our statutes as power-assisted bicycles or PABs, are required to be registered and every legal e-bike must have a number plate. Today, we are asked to pass a Bill requiring ownership of PMDs to be registered. I hope it will encourage all owners to adopt a more responsible and safe usage of their PMDs, though the extent to it remains to be seen."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00291,2018-09-10-T-031,291,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I read from the Explanatory Statement to the Bill that if the registration of a registrable PMD or PAB has been cancelled, the person last registered will be treated as the owner. This seems to differ from vehicle registration and it seems to be at odds with property law principles. If the previous registered owner sells the PMD to another person, who registered it under his name, but for some reason, the registration was cancelled, it would be odd and illogical for the previous owner to be regarded as the owner again by virtue of this law alone. He would have been paid a fair price by the new owner or buyer. It may also not be fair if such previous owner has to bear any legal consequences arising from the use of the PMD which has nothing to do with him."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00292,2018-09-10-T-031,292,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Also, assuming that a person has sold his PMD to another person, can the owner deregister himself unilaterally and after that legally, he would have nothing to do with what the new owner does with the PMD? Or does the owner have to make sure that the new owner registers himself? Which would not seem to be practicable again."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00293,2018-09-10-T-031,293,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State to clarify the exact position under this provision.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00294,2018-09-10-T-031,294,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Next, this Bill seems to have put the presumptive onus and burden of proof on owners in respect of their devices' technical compliance with the requirements of the law. May I ask the Senior Minister of State what recourse is available for owners who have purchased their devices from errant sellers who have wilfully misrepresented the device specifications? Also, are there any agencies or appointed operators or even fact-checking websites or apps which owners can approach to seek verification of technical compliance of their devices prior to purchase?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00295,2018-09-10-T-031,295,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"This Bill does not consider providing an age restriction to the use of PMDs. Two months ago, I filed a Parliamentary Question on this. But MOT has rejected my suggestion for the use of PMDs to be restricted to those who are 18 and above. May I ask the Senior Minister of State, in practice, how differently does the law treat an under-aged PMD owner or user in breach of any existing provisions of the Active Mobility Act, and of the Bill today? Does or will the under-aged offender receive the same punishment as an adult offender?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00296,2018-09-10-T-031,296,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"The Bill makes it an offence under the Road Traffic Act to drive a motorised wheelchair or mobility scooter on the road. While the illegal use of PMDs on roads may have grabbed all the media attention, the use of motorised wheelchair or mobility scooters on roads is not an infrequent occurrence. During the Committee of Supply debates in 2016, I said in my MOT cut, and I quote, ""for the suggested ban on use of PMAs on roads to work effectively and reasonably, there must be user-friendly pavements on every road, otherwise, such a ban will not be practical or fair."" Personality Mobility Aids or PMAs were previously the preferred legislative synonyms for motorised wheelchairs or mobility scooters."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00297,2018-09-10-T-031,297,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Two years down the road, I still see motorised wheelchairs or mobility scooters on the roads. Near where I live, there is an elderly uncle who often rides his mobility scooter on the roads. He rides ever so slowly along the road as I wait patiently behind him in my car or sliding to the left to let him pass by. I feel so stressed for him, while he rides by calmly and oblivious to the risks which I see."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00298,2018-09-10-T-031,298,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"While I agree that motorised wheelchairs or mobility scooters should not be allowed on roads for safety reasons, I am quite concerned that many times, such users may be forced to use the roads because of the lack of access or constraints in access on supposed pavements or footpaths along the road. We should also take care that when there are roadworks or curb-side works, access must not be limited or be blocked at all. Will contractors be required by authorities to provide alternative off-road access for motorised wheelchairs or mobility scooters?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00299,2018-09-10-T-031,299,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I would also like to ask the Government that in the case where a motorised wheelchair or mobility scooter user can prove that he was forced to access a road because the pavement or footpath has been obstructed in any way, will that be a complete defence and will he be let off?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00300,2018-09-10-T-031,300,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"And finally, what are the authorities' efforts to ensure that access on footpath or pavement remains unobstructed?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00301,2018-09-10-T-031,301,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, I had previously said in Parliament that we need to create a culture of legal, safe and considerate use of bicycles and PMDs, and consistent enforcement and adequate public education are two key elements required for creating such a culture. The Active Mobility Advisory Panel has recommended to reduce the speed limit for bicycles and PMDs on footpaths from 15 km/h to 10 km/h. this proposal has received much negative response from cyclists. As a cyclist, I can understand why cyclists feel that 10 km/h may be too slow for many cyclists. But let us not also forget that until recently, the law did not even allow bicycles on footpaths. But for the fact that this law was never adequately enforced, just as we still often see many cyclists continue to cycle against the traffic or beating the red light."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00302,2018-09-10-T-031,302,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"The recent change in law allowing bicycles on footpaths also coincided with the proliferation of PMDs. The poor cycling culture coupled by the lack of enforcement by authorities over the years meant that we need to create from scratch a new culture of safe and considerate use of bicycles and PMDs. This has proven to be a huge challenge. We need to engender this culture not just amongst cyclists and PMD users, but also pedestrians and other footpath users. For example, how do we get people walking on footpaths or Connectors to keep left or keep a proper look-out for other users? Public education is therefore paramount for all. Are we doing enough to educate everyone and not just cyclists and PMD users? The Active Mobility Act allows different usage of different paths by different types of bicycles or mobility devices. However, how many people are actually aware of the restrictions for each type of bicycles and mobility devices, and who and what is allowed on which paths?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00303,2018-09-10-T-031,303,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I am not just referring to cyclists or mobility device owners. Walk around an HDB estate or a public park, and try asking residents or park users what are the new rules under the Active Mobility Act, and who and what is allowed on which paths? We should not be surprised to find out that many still do not know the answers. When new rules requiring members of the public to make changes to their behaviour in public, authorities have to make sure that information reach members of the public and indeed different types of path users through various means. It should never just be assumed that people must be taken to know the rule change without ensuring that the communication had been successfully done."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00304,2018-09-10-T-031,304,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I will give a few examples. More than half year ago, a park connector near my home had its lines re-drawn between Kembangan MRT station and the East Coast Parkway by Marine Terrace. Most parts of the park connector had a line drawn across one-third of the path. At certain intervals along the connector, on the narrow side, there is a diagram of a person walking, painted in yellow on the path. The wider side of the path is marked with the initials PCN. Before these new lines and markings were added, most people and cyclists kept left when heading one way or the other along the connector. Since the re-drawing of lines, some who walk along the connector try to stay on the narrower part of the connector. But this part is really narrow and cannot accommodate more than two persons walking abreast. The keep left practice seems to have been abandoned by many and there is often a spill-over to the PCN part when people walked past each other in the opposite direction. Meanwhile, many continue to walk on the PCN part, including some with their pet dogs or strollers. Cyclists and PMD users are left wading through the traffic on both sides of the line, frequently unsafely, and not always through any fault of their own, depending on the traffic flow of those walking or jogging."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00305,2018-09-10-T-031,305,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"So, what is actually the appropriate way for the different users to use the park connector with the lines drawn in this way? To makes things worse or more confusing, between 20 m and 100 m before a road crossing, the lines and the markings completely disappear. So, what are people supposed to do when the markings disappear? Pretend that there is an invisible line and similar markings? Or we go back to keeping left? If a change is expected for such a short distance, it can be pretty chaotic too."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00306,2018-09-10-T-031,306,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"More importantly, how do the authorities educate the public and ensure that people get used to using such paths according to the law and in a safe and predictable manner? Since the lines and markings were first painted, I have been looking out for advisories to the public placed along the connector. I have yet to see one."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00307,2018-09-10-T-031,307,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Adopting an attitude of ignorance of the law may not be an excuse, it is not going to make things better and safer for all. Those in charge will only be kidding themselves if they do."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00308,2018-09-10-T-031,308,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Last month, I filed a Parliamentary Question (PQ) to the Minister for Transport asking whether any action is taken to ensure that owners of bicycles with handle-bars exceeding 700 mm length are made aware that such bicycles are not allowed on footpaths and walkways, and whether owners are given reasonable opportunity to change the handle-bars without their bicycles being impounded immediately when they are found on footpaths or walkways. I filed the PQ after some cyclist wrote to me, citing that many are still unaware of the rule change. In the Minister's answer to my PQ, Mr Khaw said amongst other things that the width limit of 700 mm has been widely publicised by LTA since 2016 through numerous platforms including videos, posters, banners, and that LTA also works with retailers, interest groups and active mobility patrol volunteers to reach out to the public about this width limit. Participants in the Safe Riding Programme developed by LTA and the Singapore Road Safety Council are also informed of this width limit."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00309,2018-09-10-T-031,309,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"It sounds good but has enough been done? Why are people still surprised to hear the rule change, and worse still, had their bicycles confiscated without knowing the rule change? Besides the cyclists and mobility device owners who must know the changes in law, the pedestrians and other users of footpaths must also know. This will in turn enable everyone to assert their rights, promote mutual respect and consideration between different users and hopefully, in the process, with time, bring about this change and culture. I hope the Government will consider enhancing its efforts in public education beyond its current efforts to reach out to cyclists and PMD users."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00310,2018-09-10-T-031,310,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Speaker, I would like to continue in Mandarin please."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00311,2018-09-10-T-031,311,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"(In Mandarin)  Mr Speaker, in the past two and a half years, there has been various debates in Parliament on the issue of the regulation of PMDs, electric bikes and other bicycles, as well as the introduction of shared use of footpaths by bicycles and PMDs We passed the Active Mobility Act in January 2017 which came into force earlier this year. Today we are back here again with yet more amendments to existing statutes mostly relating to the regulation of PMDs and bicycles as well as shared use of footpaths."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00312,2018-09-10-T-031,312,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"In recent years, as PMDs become more popular, there have been more news about accidents involving errant riders on roads and footpaths. Today, what we are debating is whether we should make registration mandatory for PMD owners. Earlier this year, an elderly man told me that he feels that the cycling regime is not as safe as before. What he meant was, in the earlier years, bicycle owners must register their bicycles. Perhaps some of still may still remember what the licence plates look like."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00313,2018-09-10-T-031,313,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I have spoken before in Parliament that creating a safe riding culture for PMD users and cyclists is very important. I also mentioned that we should do it through two methods. The first is through consistent enforcement of the law, and the second is through adequate public education."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00314,2018-09-10-T-031,314,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"To encourage citizens to abide by the law, enforcement must be as consistent as possible so that people understand that they will not get away easily with any infraction."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00315,2018-09-10-T-031,315,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Because we currently have different regulations targeting the different types of PMDs and bicycles, it is important to educate the various types of device users. Is the current scope of public education enough to cover riders of all ages?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00316,2018-09-10-T-031,316,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"We now run some public education courses, such as the safe riding courses organised by LTA and Singapore Road Safety Council. However, if riders are unwilling or not required to attend these courses, can they still receive the safe-riding messages?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00317,2018-09-10-T-031,317,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Besides targeting riders, public education should also target pedestrians and footpath users. Our public education must be extensive, so that regardless of age, race and culture, all will have access and not just limited to those who wish to know about these messages."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00318,2018-09-10-T-031,318,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Many elderly people are terrified of getting into accidents with PMDs while they are walking along the void decks or walkways. But how many people actually know what are the requirements prescribed by the law, for example, what devices are allowed to be used on which surfaces, what are the speed limits? Besides online information on the requirements of Active Mobility statutes, are such information given out at exhibitions and courses alone? Are such information given out in hard copies to every household? Are such literature in Chinese, Malay and Tamil in addition to being in English? I feel that there is still much for us to do to achieve a safe riding culture where there is a culture of safe and considerate use of PMDs and bicycles."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00319,2018-09-10-T-031,319,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, notwithstanding the concerns that I have raised, I support this Bill."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00320,2018-09-10-T-031,320,Lee Bee Wah,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. It is indeed regrettable that in our effort to improve the mobility of residents and encourage people to enjoy the outdoors without relying on the use of traditional transport like motor cars and other petrol or diesel vehicles. We are today confronted with another set of problems."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00321,2018-09-10-T-031,321,Lee Bee Wah,"The issues that confront us is clearly placed into two categories. First, it is the lack of civic mindedness on the part of those who use these new generation mobility devices; and, two, it is the lack of strategic and forward planning on the part of the transport authorities in allowing the owners of these personal mobility devices free-reign to the public pathways and pedestrians walkways."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00322,2018-09-10-T-031,322,Lee Bee Wah,"I feel compelled to say this of the authorities as I read the Bill which states ""REGISTRATION OF REGISTRABLE PERSONAL MOBILITY DEVICES - Purpose of this Part 528A""."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00323,2018-09-10-T-031,323,Lee Bee Wah,"The purpose of this Part is to provide for the registration of personal mobility devices – (a) to enable the use of personal mobility devices on public paths to be regulated for reasons of safety and law enforcement. Yes, we should have thought of safety long before these 20-40 kg missiles go crashing into innocent pedestrians."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00324,2018-09-10-T-031,324,Lee Bee Wah,"Now, we are constantly playing catch-up though I would say it is better than turning a blind eye or a deaf ear to the public outcry for protection against those who use their PMD recklessly."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00325,2018-09-10-T-031,325,Lee Bee Wah,"Many residents told me that it is no longer safe to walk in Singapore. They say that they can be knocked down by PMD, bicycles anytime, anywhere. Are we too hasty to be car-lite when the mindset of our people and the infrastructure is not ready?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00326,2018-09-10-T-031,326,Lee Bee Wah,"The Active Mobility Act seems to favour cyclists and PMD users. Why do I say that? At areas where there is high pedestrian traffic and narrow passageway, I am sure you will agree with me that it is near impossible to have both cyclists and pedestrians to co-exist. Hence, in Nee Soon South, we put up ""Dismount and Push"" or ""No Cycling"" signages, and this is to remind cyclists to refrain from cycling through these narrow passages. From time to time, there is joint enforcement action by Police and Town Council, and this is to ensure the safety of our residents in common spaces."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00327,2018-09-10-T-031,327,Lee Bee Wah,"Recently, one resident challenged our enforcement action when he was issued with a ticket. He said he worked in LTA and he is in Active Mobility Team, and he knows that all these ""No Cycling"" signages are no longer legal, no longer applicable. In short, what Town Council is doing is ""Tak Pa Kai"". My question is  does this Active Mobility Team member like him understand the ground? Does he care about the need on the ground? Or is he more interested to push through the Act and encourage cycling at all costs?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00328,2018-09-10-T-031,328,Lee Bee Wah,"I hope my favourite Minister can review the Act and put in place more equitable law for public safety. I think we should have heavier penalties for offenders who ride recklessly and cause serious injury to the victims. I do not think the proposed fine of $2,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both under section 28(3) is adequate. The penalties must have a stronger bite to wake up the would-be offenders. Also, I would like to ask  whether the Minister will consider imposing a ban for those who cause the victims to suffer serious debilitating permanent injury or death? I ask this because the victims cannot seek any compensation for the medical treatment and the continued expenses that would be incurred in looking after someone who becomes an invalid, or to be compensated for loss of a loved one."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00329,2018-09-10-T-031,329,Lee Bee Wah,"Given that accidents involving e-scooters or PMDs can cause serious injuries to pedestrians, what is the reason for the delay in the implementation of liability insurance? How can the registration of PMDs help the victims in accidents in the claim for compensation?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00330,2018-09-10-T-031,330,Lee Bee Wah,"Another area we need to look into is the need to take enforcement action against shops or anyone selling these PMDs, which do not comply with the new regulations or which perform illegal modifications on these devices. A strong enforcement action must be done to swoop on these outlets, some of whom may still be holding stocks of devices which do not comply with the law, and some operate out of HDB flats."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00331,2018-09-10-T-031,331,Lee Bee Wah,Another area that I want to raise is what about those who use their handphones when they are riding on their PMDs? Would action be taken against them? I have seen on several occasions riders looking at their handphones while they cruised down the pathways. This is another reckless behaviour that can result in an accident.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00332,2018-09-10-T-031,332,Lee Bee Wah,"I would also like to point out that there are elderly people on their motorised wheelchairs whom I have seen watching video clips while riding on pathways. Again, this must be put to a stop. Should a pillion rider be allowed on PMD at all? The weight of one or more persons may undermine the effectiveness of the PMD braking system. Will the Minister restrict this pillion riding?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00333,2018-09-10-T-031,333,Lee Bee Wah,"Quite often, I see very young kids, barely six to eight years old, riding as pillions on PMDs. Should we not protect these young kids? And I think it is also timely to remind all PMD users, as well as drivers of motor vehicles that they should observe the traffic rules and take precaution when on the road, at traffic light junctions, or near pedestrian crossings. This also applies to pedestrians. They should not take for granted that the other party knows or will do what you think they would do to give way, or to have right of way. Road safety and precaution must be practised by everyone."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00334,2018-09-10-T-031,334,Lee Bee Wah,"Another question I would like to raise is  if there will be an age limit to allow a person to register a PMD? In the case of a driver’s licence, anyone aged 65 years and above needs to go for medical check-up to get a licence. Will this apply to those using PMDs in the interest of the public? In fact, it may be important for the riders to be sure they are able to manage their PMD or motorised wheelchair for their own safety, especially if they have weak eyesight, or are on medication which can impair their judgement or cause drowsiness."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00335,2018-09-10-T-031,335,Lee Bee Wah,"Recently, there was one accident. The rider rode the PMD down a flight of staircase and injured himself. When he was sent to hospital, it was found that actually he has dementia."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00336,2018-09-10-T-031,336,Lee Bee Wah,"Next, I would like to ask under section 28D – the Authority may cancel the registration of a registrable personal mobility device if (a) the Authority is satisfied that the personal mobility device"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00337,2018-09-10-T-031,337,Lee Bee Wah,(i) has ceased to be used on any footpath or shared path in Singapore;
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00338,2018-09-10-T-031,338,Lee Bee Wah,(ii) has become wholly unfit for further use.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00339,2018-09-10-T-031,339,Lee Bee Wah,"Can the Minister clarify how will the authorities determine if a device has ceased to be used on any footpath? Is it the onus of the owner to declare that he does not intend to use it outside his house and so he can sort of ""hang up"" his PMD? Secondly, can the Minister clarify when will the authorities know if the device is ""wholly unfit for further use""? After all, the device is not subject to any annual inspection?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00340,2018-09-10-T-031,340,Lee Bee Wah,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin, please."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00341,2018-09-10-T-031,341,Lee Bee Wah,"(In Mandarin) 	It is said that better late than never. I am pleased that, finally, we will have laws to regulate these PMDs."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00342,2018-09-10-T-031,342,Lee Bee Wah,"However, I think we need stiffer laws in several areas. For example, is the current fine of $2,000 enough to deter dangerous behaviours? Using handphones on a PMD should be treated as the same as using phones while driving, and should be banned."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00343,2018-09-10-T-031,343,Lee Bee Wah,"Allowing a pillion rider on the PMD will cause higher impact on pedestrians in an accident. If the pillion rider is a child, the child's life could also be endangered."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00344,2018-09-10-T-031,344,Lee Bee Wah,"In addition, the health condition and age of the PMD rider, and how well the PMD is being maintained, are areas that the Government is not checking regularly. I hope our laws can take these into consideration."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00345,2018-09-10-T-031,345,Lee Bee Wah,"Earlier, it seemed that we had rushed to allow these PMDs on roads without considering that our infrastructure is not yet ready, and this has posed danger to pedestrians. Even the current Bill has areas that are not covered. I hope the Government can amend as soon as possible to keep our pedestrians safe."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00346,2018-09-10-T-031,346,Lee Bee Wah,"(In English)  Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00347,2018-09-10-T-031,347,Randolph Tan,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Sir, this is an important Bill that recognises the need to update and improve enforcement measures relating to land transport usage."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00348,2018-09-10-T-031,348,Randolph Tan,"Most notably, a large part of this Bill is related to the Active Mobility Act, which only came into force earlier this year. This is a positive sign, I believe, of the Government’s commitment to being responsive to the evolving challenges in this new area of land transport management."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00349,2018-09-10-T-031,349,Randolph Tan,"Since the Active Mobility Act was passed last year, the challenges associated with the regulation of the use of bicycles and PMDs have become even more noticeable, sharpening public debate on both sides. It is very difficult not to encounter such devices in public spaces, regardless of whether one is travelling as a pedestrian, a driver or a public transport user. This brings up the question of whether the impact of the use of such devices, as well as bicycles, power-assisted bicycles (PABs) and PMDs on the majority of road users has been a positive or negative one, and whether the way we manage the use of these so-transport alternatives is on a sustainable path. There is little arguing that the movement to encourage Active Mobility has tremendous potential. And it is a worthwhile attempt to work towards the ultimate goal to promote more effective last-mile connectivity and reduce our heavy dependence on private car usage as a nation."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00350,2018-09-10-T-031,350,Randolph Tan,"Despite the best of intentions, however, Sir, one of the most intractable problems we face as a nation with a heavy dependence on cars, is not the cars themselves, but the negative habits associated with heavy car usage."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00351,2018-09-10-T-031,351,Randolph Tan,"These habits are familiar ones – indiscriminate parking, a lack of consideration for other road users, a refusal to adhere to rules and regulations about road use, dangerous driving, a refusal to give way, and the list goes on. These habits are not caused by the cars themselves. I have no doubt that they can just as easily, if not already, become grafted onto any forms of transport alternative, and the problems will not only persist, but grow."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00352,2018-09-10-T-031,352,Randolph Tan,"Sir, what this Bill gives, a hint of already is that the challenges of enforcement of rules and regulations aimed at keeping PMDs and other devices safe for all road users are non-trivial."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00353,2018-09-10-T-031,353,Randolph Tan,"At the same time, the cost of enforcement, including the outsourcing the policing work, is going to rise, as the rules are made more intricate. My understanding, Sir, is that PMDs and similar devices are meant to promote last-mile connectivity, but it seems clear that a lot of the issues that we see arise precisely because some users choose these devices as their main and preferred mode of transport."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00354,2018-09-10-T-031,354,Randolph Tan,"The two are very different. Given our space constraints, the rise of PMDs and similar devices as the primary mode for making a full journey from point to point means that they have become the alternative to what had earlier been to the main modes of transport. This convenience to these individuals comes at a cost to other road users."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00355,2018-09-10-T-031,355,Randolph Tan,"With this in mind, Sir, what I am concerned about is whether there has been a clear analysis of the costs and benefits involved, whether there is any reliable study into how the majority of road users have been impacted, and whether these changes are desirable. Even with the enforcement updates contained in this Bill, it is not clear if they will be up to addressing the increasingly complex challenges associated with changing usage patterns of PMDs and similar devices. It is not difficult to observe these changes and some of them cause tremendous concern. Let me just cite a few."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00356,2018-09-10-T-031,356,Randolph Tan,"At any time during the night at various parts of the island, it is now not uncommon to observe groups of riders, many of them young, gathering in their helmets and e-scooters, often smoking with their electronic devices ever-ready, decked out for what appears to be long journeys in convoys that stretch and proceed at speeds that would be uncomfortably high to any pedestrian out for a night stroll. Even if these large groups of users were mostly confined to footpaths, it is hard for drivers not to notice them when they go against the flow of traffic, because of the glare of their bright headlights. Many of these groups seem to be quite uncompromising in their lack of desire to give way, as many reported incidents already show."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00357,2018-09-10-T-031,357,Randolph Tan,"There is another phenomenon that I had already noticed and which I asked the hon Minister for Transport about, in an earlier Parliamentary Question at a previous Sitting. And this is a habit which appears to be becoming increasingly prevalent and which the hon Member Er Dr Lee Bee Wah earlier alluded to. This is the carrying of pillion riders. Although the Minister already clarified that the carrying of pillion riders is not prohibited under current regulations, the question as to whether it is safe for PMDs to be used to carry pillions and how it affects other road users, especially elderly and vulnerable pedestrians, cannot be dissociated from the way PMDs are currently being used."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00358,2018-09-10-T-031,358,Randolph Tan,"Who will be responsible if children being ferried as pillion riders are hurt when a rider misjudges the stopping distance of his extra load, for instance?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00359,2018-09-10-T-031,359,Randolph Tan,"Thus, I would like to urge the Ministry to continue to look into these enforcement issues early and to ensure that a framework that all users can benefit from in a manageable, yet cost-effective way for enforcement, becomes available earlier on."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00360,2018-09-10-T-031,360,Zainal Sapari,"Mr Speaker, I support the Land Transport (Enforcement Measures) Bill. In particular, I welcome the greater regulation in the use of PMDs in Singapore in a manner that will ultimately benefit both commuters and pedestrians where safety is concerned."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00361,2018-09-10-T-031,361,Zainal Sapari,"In a report by The Straits Times, there were 19 reported cases of accidents involving PMDs, bicycles or electric bikes on public paths. In 2016, the figure increased to 42 and went up to 128 last year. These accidents, even if it is not fatal, can still result in serious injury as I have seen in PMD accidents that happened in my constituency. One fatal or serious accident would be one accident too many."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00362,2018-09-10-T-031,362,Zainal Sapari,"An accident is an experience that would be very traumatising for those involved, but further issues like compensation and civil lawsuits can further complicate the situation. Just like my parliamentary colleague, hon Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, I would like to urge the Government to consider mandating users to possess a personal liability insurance which would be tied to the registration of their PMD."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00363,2018-09-10-T-031,363,Zainal Sapari,"Already in Japan, Osaka City and Nagoya City require bicycle riders to have liability insurance as a condition for riding in the city. I believe this issue of having PMD users to have a liability insurance should be studied, and we could model after Japan's practice, considering Japan is far ahead in possessing a ""riding culture"" amongst its many commuters."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00364,2018-09-10-T-031,364,Zainal Sapari,"Even with the recent proposals to cut speed limit of PMD users using footpath from 15 km/hour to 10 km/hour, there has been a lot of scepticisms on its effectiveness due to challenges in enforcement and the difficulty for an average PMD user to be able to gauge its speed."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00365,2018-09-10-T-031,365,Zainal Sapari,"As such, accidents involving PMD users can still result in serious injuries. Broken bones may require expensive surgeries. Accidentally brushing against a car can incur thousands of dollars in compensation for repair costs. Given the younger profile of several PMD users in Singapore, an attempt to recoup thousands of dollars in damages would pose a heavy financial burden for both victim and accused, not to mention the costs involved in pursuing recourse, such as civil lawsuits."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00366,2018-09-10-T-031,366,Zainal Sapari,"As such, mandating personal liability insurance would not only provide better liability coverage for PMD users, but victims of accidents are able to seek proper recourse to claim their damages. Using a PMD in the presence of other pedestrians entails certain responsibilities, and I strongly believe that having a personal liability insurance is one of them."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00367,2018-09-10-T-031,367,Zainal Sapari,"I would go further to suggest leveraging on technology to notify users of the need to renew their insurance together with their PMD registrations annually, if such liability insurance is made mandatory. Insurance companies can tier their premium for such liability insurance depending on the risks involved in insuring different age groups."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00368,2018-09-10-T-031,368,Zainal Sapari,"Mr Speaker, in Malay."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00369,2018-09-10-T-031,369,Zainal Sapari,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  I support the Land Transport (Enforcement Measures) Bill, particularly amendments that will be made to the Active Mobility Act. However, I would like to urge the Government to take the opportunity from this amendment to mandate the purchase of personal accident insurance coverage for users of PMDs. This is important to ensure that those who are involved in PMD accidents, particularly pedestrians, can make the necessary compensation claims for their injuries. The purchase of personal accident insurance for the usage of PMDs was introduced in several cities in Japan, and we can learn from their experience in this issue to create a safer environment for both PMD users and pedestrians."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00370,2018-09-10-T-031,370,Zainal Sapari,"(In English)  PMDs may be a key feature in our active mobility landscape and I do not deny their value in providing alternative commuting methods for Singaporeans. However, as with the introduction of all new cultures that come with technological advancement, proper care must be taken so that we can have a greater peace of mind for all Singaporeans that share the same space. Singapore may be small, but I dare say we are not so small that we cannot cultivate a proper, responsible riding culture here as well, like those that are found in other countries."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00371,2018-09-10-T-031,371,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I rise in support of this Bill which updates the regime governing mobility vehicles and introduces a new registration requirement for certain PMDs. Mobility vehicles are sustainable alternatives that have evolved to meet the transport needs of an urban environment. When used responsibly and safely, they provide greater convenience, promote public transportation by providing first- and last-mile connections, and are themselves a form of recreation."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00372,2018-09-10-T-031,372,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,How the different users navigate and share public spaces in land-scarce Singapore can be a significant source of friction. Mobility vehicles are perceived as competing with pedestrians for space and posing threats to pedestrian safety. My residents regularly provide feedback about these dangers and want the Government to do more to protect residents and pedestrians. My residents also regularly see me when they get fined and say the Government is enforcing too much and needs to relax a bit when it comes to mobility vehicles. They feel there are too many restrictions.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00373,2018-09-10-T-031,373,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"We need to find a middle ground. As Gavin Chan highlighted to me on Facebook, we should think about longer term social norms we want to inculcate for public path and road use, whilst addressing short term pain points through legislative reforms and refinements. This should be done with the participation of all users."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00374,2018-09-10-T-031,374,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"To this end, I note and welcome incremental, consultative, and education-based approach the Government is taking in its regulation of mobility devices. Many of these amendments are based on observations from the implementation of the Active Mobility Act (AMA), which came into effect this year. The AMA Panel has also been very active, just recently releasing their second recommendation report. I am thus supportive of these amendments, which are based on extensive consultations, and I have just a number of clarifications to make."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00375,2018-09-10-T-031,375,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I have some clarifications on the scope and implementation of the PMD registration requirement under the new Part 3A. Firstly, can the Minister clarify whether the provisions relating to registration contemplates a corporate body or company being an owner of a PMD on the register? Would it be possible, for instance, for a food delivery company to own a fleet of PMDs?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00376,2018-09-10-T-031,376,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Next, can the Minister clarify whether there is an obligation on the registered responsible person to update the register upon a change of ownership or when the PMD ceases to be used? Further, can the Authority refuse registration of a PMD on the basis that the applicant had previously been convicted of mobility vehicle-related offences?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00377,2018-09-10-T-031,377,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I also understand that the obligations of an owner of a PMD or PAB continue even after cancelling their registration, as the person last registered will be treated as the owner under the definition of ""owner"" if the registration has been cancelled. How can owners safeguard themselves against continuing liability for offences relating to a PMD or PAB, even after cancelling their registration?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00378,2018-09-10-T-031,378,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Next, enforcement powers under sections 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 and 50 have been extended to outsourced enforcement officers. Can the Minister clarify whether enforcement powers exercised by these outsourced enforcement officers, public path wardens and volunteer path wardens are public powers that would be similarly amenable to judicial review?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00379,2018-09-10-T-031,379,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Next, clause 27 amends the current section 53(2) of the Active Mobility Act to remove the requirement to make reasonable inquiry to locate the owner of a vehicle before disposing it. Can the Minister clarify the rationale for removing this requirement? Has this requirement been proven to be too onerous for LTA?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00380,2018-09-10-T-031,380,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Given the new registration requirement for PMDs, it would surely be easier to locate the owner for this class of mobility vehicles. Also, the reasonable inquiry requirement might have provided a counter-balance to the expansion of the power of disposal now conferred on outsourced enforcement officers under the new section 50 of the Active Mobility Act."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00381,2018-09-10-T-031,381,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Lastly, clause 3 amends section 18 of the Active Mobility Act, which includes the use of PMDs on footpaths. I support these amendments. Last year, Minister Khaw responded to a Parliamentary Question stating that footpaths in Singapore are wide enough to accommodate both pedestrians and cyclists at the same time. He stated that most of the country's footpaths are at least 1.5 metres wide, while footpaths near town centres and MRT stations are generally wider, between 2.4 metres and 3.6 metres."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00382,2018-09-10-T-031,382,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In his response, Minister Khaw considered that such width is sufficient to accommodate both pedestrians and cyclists. Given that mobility devices are now permitted up to a width of 0.7 m, this leaves barely enough space when two mobility devices pass each other on a footpath that is 1.5 m wide. It needs about 0.1 m."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00383,2018-09-10-T-031,383,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thus, beyond these amendments, is the Ministry reviewing the minimum width of existing and new footpaths? Further, can the Minister provide an update on any works it has undertaken to widen footpaths that might be too narrow to safely accommodate both pedestrians and mobility vehicles?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00384,2018-09-10-T-031,384,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, clarifications notwithstanding, I stand in support of this Bill and the wider efforts to promote harmonious and safe use of our public paths by all."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00385,2018-09-10-T-031,385,K Thanaletchimi,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the Bill. In general, the amendments in the first part of the Act aimed to expand the restrictions to include mobility vehicles and motorised wheelchair, ban on all shared paths and footpath, increase accountability through registration and empower outsourced enforcement. These four areas are critical to help reduce the incidence of accidents involving PMDs, PABs, mobility vehicles and motorised wheelchairs. Nevertheless, the amendments are in line with the overall goal of encouraging more Singaporeans to adopt an active lifestyle by encouraging more alternative forms of transport in their daily commute."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00386,2018-09-10-T-031,386,K Thanaletchimi,"On the amendments on section 41, clause 20, sufficient information ought to be circulated to the public to inform them of the conferment of power on outsourced enforcement officers. It is important that the public know and recognise the authority given to Active Mobility Patrol (AMP) and Public Path Wardens (PPW) to facilitate law enforcement. One of the difficulties faced by such volunteers was convincing people of their authority despite having LTA card. Quite a handful of cyclists and riders of PMDs do not believe that the AMP volunteers have the power to stop them. This is worrying. Recognising such authority is pivotal for the officers to carry out their jobs without fear and prejudice. Additionally, information on how to recognise and distinguish between what classifies as a PMD, PAB, or motorised wheelchair should be stepped up, to encourage awareness among the public on what is allowed for acceptable use. Public education is imperative. Sellers too need to be educated and are required to provide and display such information in a reasonably visible manner when one purchases such device."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00387,2018-09-10-T-031,387,K Thanaletchimi,"On the amendments on section 67(2) in clause 34, the minimum age for a person to be registered should be thoroughly reviewed in tandem with evidenced based data. For example, we should look at the demographics of the individuals that were involved in accidents and then peg the pseudo legal age. We should also note that the requirement for critical judgement when riding the PMDs is no less than that required of a driver."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00388,2018-09-10-T-031,388,K Thanaletchimi,"Food for thought to be considered. While it is a straightforward solution to ban PMDs on shared paths and footpaths, we should question the impact on people who rely on PMDs to commute to work or use it for work, such as in the case of some food delivery personnel. Additionally, we also must take special care to ensure that these new regulations do not affect users of PABs and motorised wheelchairs, which rely on these vehicles as their primary mobility aid. Instead of banning it altogether, we can consider a system where PMDs can be used on footpath during off-peak hours where human traffic flow is minimal, to minimise disruption to users with legitimate needs and uses."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00389,2018-09-10-T-031,389,K Thanaletchimi,"In conclusion, the amendments and Bills focused extensively on fines and penalties. Moving forward, could we also consider looking towards an incentive-based scheme or system that rewards people who conform to these rules and regulations and have a clean record? To put things in perspective, instead of giving summons when one has erred, an incentive-based system could be the situation where upon registration of the mobility vehicle, a lump sum disguised as tax is collected. Upon end of every work year, should individual not err, the lump sum will be returned to that individual. Perhaps, this may invoke a healthier habit of keeping safe and conforming to the rules, rather than people trying to evade punishments."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00390,2018-09-10-T-031,390,K Thanaletchimi,"Sir, with this, I support the Bill. Thank you."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00391,2018-09-10-T-031,391,Gan Thiam Poh,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the reckless users of PMDs continue to be a major public safety concern, posing risks to road users and pedestrians alike. I have witnessed some of these riders myself, speeding on their e-scooters on the road without consideration for other road users and motorists, risking their own lives and the safety of others."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00392,2018-09-10-T-031,392,Gan Thiam Poh,"Enforcement remains key. Due to the prevalence of PMDs and the wide areas of coverage, we need more enforcement officers on the ground to monitor users and ensure compliance. Hence, I welcome the introduction of outsourced enforcement officers in this Bill, which I think will be very useful and helpful for the very labour intensive task of enforcement."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00393,2018-09-10-T-031,393,Gan Thiam Poh,"We should complement and augment the efforts of our manpower resources with technology aids, such as street cameras, other high-tech devices and artificial intelligence (AI) to deter reckless users. I would like to ask the Minister if we will be tapping on technological innovations to monitor how shared paths are used and to deter all these reckless PMD riders. Besides speeding and inconsiderate riding, some riders actually break the law by using unauthorised PMDs. One of the common reasons given by such users who were caught was that they had always presumed that it was the sellers’ responsibility to ensure compliance of the devices with LTA’s regulations."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00394,2018-09-10-T-031,394,Gan Thiam Poh,"Hence, I would like to ask how LTA is going to enforce strict compliance from sellers, including online sales, so that only authorised dealers or models are imported into Singapore. This Bill will require that all e-scooters are registered and they have to display the registration mark. Does this mean that the Government intends to inspect all models available in the Singapore market? Will the process of certification of approved models also include testing of the batteries and their level of safety in the view of the number of fires due to e-scooters with substandard batteries?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00395,2018-09-10-T-031,395,Gan Thiam Poh,"Moving forward, we have to reach out to PMD users and potential users to educate them on considerate and safe riding, how to do so, the new regulations and the consequences of violating the law, including the impact on those they injure or kill, the fines and potential civil liabilities. They should also learn from where and how to buy approved PMDs. Would the Ministry share with us what other public educational measures will be implemented to reach out to all individuals and households?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00396,2018-09-10-T-031,396,Gan Thiam Poh,"Mr Speaker, in Mandarin."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00397,2018-09-10-T-031,397,Gan Thiam Poh,"(In Mandarin)  In the past few years, accidents caused by reckless riders of PMDs have been increasing. I have personally seen, at several occasions, youngsters riding e-scooters recklessly, posing risks to road users. My residents have also given me feedback about this."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00398,2018-09-10-T-031,398,Gan Thiam Poh,"The new regulations that this Bill will implement will help improve the current situation. Firstly, all PMDs must be registered and display the registration label. As a result, the number of non-compliant ones should be greatly reduced. However, I am still worried that the Government cannot ban all illegal PMDs, so I would like to ask the Minister if there is any countermeasure."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00399,2018-09-10-T-031,399,Gan Thiam Poh,"Secondly, the authorities will be able to outsource enforcement, which will help supervise usage of PMDs and ensure that they comply with regulations. Since enforcement work is very labour-intensive, I suggest that the Government adopts more high-tech auxiliary equipment, including artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of supervision. To make our shared paths safer, it is not a one-night process. I hope that the Government can launch more public education programmes to teach riders how to use PMDs on shared paths safely and politely. I support this Bill."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00400,2018-09-10-T-031,400,Joan Pereira,"Mr Speaker, the increasing use of PMDs, especially among the younger crowd, has been both a boon and a bane. For the users, the devices reduce walking effort and time significantly, but the black sheep amongst them have caused injury to pedestrians, many of which go unreported."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00401,2018-09-10-T-031,401,Joan Pereira,"I note with alarm the rapid increase in the number of reported accidents involving PMDs, bicycles or e-bikes on public paths from 19 cases in 2015, to 42 in 2016, and 128 in 2017. Hence, the amendments are timely. They will allow the LTA to outsource enforcement to boost the team of officers and ensure compliance with the Active Mobility Act. We will need more enforcement officers in order to have sufficient deterrent effect against errant PMD users and cyclists. So far, the enforcement has been a bit of a hit-and-miss. It is not easy to catch errant ones as there are so many users and they are everywhere, even riding their devices along common corridors and void decks of our HDB blocks, shopping malls, hawker centres, and even community centres and MRT stations."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00402,2018-09-10-T-031,402,Joan Pereira,"In my constituency, we have many elderly residents who have been complaining to me about all the near-misses they have experienced. Near the Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre, there is a short cut to access a housing estate and many PMD users zip around and through the food centre. The situation is so bad that even the stallholders complain to me. When the e-scooter users are advised not to use them in the market, some of them become aggressive. There is a palpable sense of entitlement and to them, pedestrians are obstacles which should move out of the way at the sound of their bells, if they bother to ring them."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00403,2018-09-10-T-031,403,Joan Pereira,"It is unfortunate that residents no longer feel safe on shared paths. Gone are the days of leisurely walks on park connectors. One has to be perpetually on the lookout and “look-over”, that is, look over your shoulder if you do not want to be knocked down. My seniors tell me that they feel tense when they go on walks. They feel even more tense when they bring their grandchildren out. They are aware that their eyesight and hearing are no longer as good and their reactions are slower. They worry about their ability to protect the young ones in the prams and keep active toddlers out of the way of cyclists and e-scooter riders who can appear very suddenly."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00404,2018-09-10-T-031,404,Joan Pereira,"Some senior citizens ask me why the Government is promoting the use of PMDs. Should we not be walking more? Allowing the proliferation of PMDs seems to go against our current drive to promote a healthy lifestyle. Many of us will remember the National Steps Challenge, which encourages the average Singaporean to walk 10,000 steps a day. Even for non-PMD users, reaching 5,000 steps is already quite difficult to achieve.  For PMD users, the number of steps would definitely be far lower. I ask the Government to reconsider our stand on the use of PMDs in the context of national health and the potential disease burden."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00405,2018-09-10-T-031,405,Joan Pereira,"Sir, in Mandarin."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00406,2018-09-10-T-031,406,Joan Pereira,"(In Mandarin)  Personal mobility devices are becoming more common. In the past two years, the accidents caused by the black sheep amongst them have caused many people to be seriously injured and even unconscious, making many of us feel very angry and upset."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00407,2018-09-10-T-031,407,Joan Pereira,"In my constituency, many senior citizens complained to me that they were almost knocked down by personal mobility devices. These riders are ubiquitous, in the corridors and void decks of HDB flats, department stores, food courts, and even community centres and subway stations."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00408,2018-09-10-T-031,408,Joan Pereira,"In the hawker centres in my area, there are often PMD riders going through and around. Many of them are young people and ride very fast. The situation is very bad, even the stall owners complained to me. If someone try to dissuade them, some riders will become fierce in their reaction. For them, it is a given that pedestrians should always give way to them."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00409,2018-09-10-T-031,409,Joan Pereira,"Unfortunately, our pedestrians no longer feel safe in sharing walkways. The old folks tell me that when they walk, they always feel very nervous, and they take every step with great apprehension."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00410,2018-09-10-T-031,410,Joan Pereira,"Some older people also asked me why the Government is promoting the use of personal mobility devices. Is this not going against our healthy lifestyle movement? I ask the Government to re-examine the role of personal mobility devices, taking into account national health care and future disease burdens."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00411,2018-09-10-T-031,411,Joan Pereira,"(In English)  Sir, I would like to propose that we strengthen enforcement on the ground substantially. The relative lack of enforcement relative to the number of PMD users is a weak link and must be addressed. Repeat offenders must be banned from using such devices and we must have effective ways of ensuring that they comply with such bans. To ensure that we do not penalise the good riders, we can consider installing microchips with GPS in PMDs so that we have a way of tracking the usage of such devices."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00412,2018-09-10-T-031,412,Joan Pereira,"I am very pleased that the Bill will make it compulsory for all e-scooters to be registered and higher fire safety standards will be introduced for motorised PMDs. There have been regular incidents involving e-scooters and many of my residents are very worried that, one day, a neighbour’s PMD will lead to fires which will engulf their homes."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00413,2018-09-10-T-031,413,Joan Pereira,"Sir, safety is paramount for our residents, and while I urge for even more stringent measures to regulate PMDs, I appreciate the measures taken in the Bill which are steps in the right direction. I support the Bill."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00414,2018-09-10-T-031,414,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Speaker,  I would like to focus my comments on the amendments to the Active Mobility Act 2017. The Active Mobility Act is an important piece of legislation that has allowed our society to take another positive step towards achieving the vision of a car-lite Singapore, with a sustainable public transportation system that is affordable, convenient and efficient for Singaporeans."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00415,2018-09-10-T-031,415,Rahayu Mahzam,"Personal mobility devices, power-assisted bicycles and bicycles have enabled Singaporeans, young and old, to get around with ease, improving first- and last-mile connectivity. The little to no emissions also lead to a cleaner and healthier living environment. However, pedestrians, cyclists and users of PMDs and PABs with differing needs are now using public paths that were predominantly used by pedestrians. It is, therefore, critical that a good balance is struck between the diverse needs of the various users."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00416,2018-09-10-T-031,416,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Active Mobility Act paved some way towards regulating the conduct of the different users of the public paths. However, months after the enactment of the Act, there is still much buzz on the ground about the issues faced by various path users. This proposed Bill, which brings with it more specific legislation, is, therefore, important. I would like to make some brief comments on them and revisit some of the issues raised during the last debate on the Active Mobility Bill."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00417,2018-09-10-T-031,417,Rahayu Mahzam,"The mandatory registration of certain personal mobility devices is a welcome enhancement. I note that starting with e-scooters, such process ensures that the devices are safe before they are used on the public path system. This allows for some monitoring of the mobility devices and vehicles that populate our paths. I would like to seek clarification on whether an inspection process at reasonable intervals, annually or biennially, is envisioned. These inspections may be useful to ensure continued compliance with the regulations."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00418,2018-09-10-T-031,418,Rahayu Mahzam,"There are also proposed amendments to sections 30-34 of the Act to extend the scope of the ban on display, requirement to issue warning notices, advertisement and sale of non-compliant devices and vehicles. I note that during the last debate in this House before the Active Mobility Bill was passed, there were some discussions regarding online sales and the challenges of enforcing these provisions on those sales. I note the Ministry’s position during the debate. I also note that this legislation relates to conduct in the course of business and does not currently seem to cover individuals who advertise their products through social media or through platforms like Carousell. I would like to seek clarification on this. If it does not cover individual sellers and those who carry out sales online, would the Ministry consider extending these provisions to address such sales?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00419,2018-09-10-T-031,419,Rahayu Mahzam,"There were also some discussions previously on compulsory insurance for riders of mobility devices or vehicles. I would like to revisit this point again. I believe that if personal mobility devices and mobility vehicles are here to stay, we may want to reconsider setting up requirements for compulsory insurance by the owners and riders. In 2017, it was reported there were 128 accidents involving PMDs on public paths. When such accidents take place, they inadvertently result in injuries and property damage. However, currently, the riders and users of PMDs or mobility vehicles are unlikely to be insured. If they are found to personally liable for the damages and do not have funds to cover payment for compensation or injuries and damages, the injured pedestrian may be left out in the cold. Compulsory insurance is, therefore, protection for both the rider and the injured pedestrian. It is also likely that the claims for personal injury and property damage are likely to be of small quantum and the current process and cost of filing a civil claim for personal injury could be prohibitive in nature. It might be useful to consider if personal injury claims below $ 20,000 can be decided at the Small Claims Tribunal. In any case, it would be prudent, as part of the education, for PMD users to be informed of insurance available."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00420,2018-09-10-T-031,420,Rahayu Mahzam,"Active Mobility is a lifestyle choice and it must be supported by a culture of graciousness and considerate behaviour on the part of all users of public paths. All path users, be it the cyclists, PMD or PAB users or pedestrians, have a part to play to create a safe mobility culture in Singapore. I note that there had been some grouses on the ground from riders regarding the rules on modification and speed limits. I believe there would be continued efforts in educating the public about the need to be safe on the public paths so that they may appreciate the importance of these legislation and work together to build a positive culture within our community."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00421,2018-09-10-T-031,421,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Speaker, notwithstanding my comments, I support the Bill."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00422,2018-09-10-T-031,422,Cheng Li Hui,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. There are currently two major groups of PMD users – the leisure users and the people who need them as a tool for their daily work. Most commonly seen on the streets are food delivery persons. The current proposed registration regime requiring all users to affix an identification mark prominently on their device is the first step towards striking down errant users and penalising them for their reckless riding habits and behaviour. The feedback I have heard from my residents is that it is often the food delivery riders who speed and ride more recklessly. It might be because they are remunerated on a per-trip basis."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00423,2018-09-10-T-031,423,Cheng Li Hui,"I would, therefore, like to suggest that the food delivery service providers also play their part in taking responsibilities towards the riding culture of their representatives. For example, they should provide third-party liability insurance for their riders. We know that incidents caused by PMDs can be fatal or cause very serious injuries. The victims' medical bills can run high. Therefore, mandating some form of insurance coverage for users who utilise PMDs as a tool for work is beneficial for all stakeholders. Delivery service providers should also take charge of their riders and incentivise or penalise them according to their track records. It is the basic right of everyone to feel safe on our footpaths. Every injury or fatality caused by PMDs is unnecessary and avoidable. I, therefore, support measures to enhance enforcement capabilities. Of course, we ideally hope to live in a society where everyone is a considerate and gracious road and path users. But the current state of affairs is such that more enforcement is needed to curb errant PMD users and improve the safety of our footpaths."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00424,2018-09-10-T-031,424,Cheng Li Hui,"Mr Speaker, safety issues regarding PMDs are not confined to the pathways. We have seen frequent cases of PMD-related fires and there was such a fire case in ward just last month. The mattress caught fire from the battery which was charging. Fortunately, the residents were home and put the fire out and no one was injured. On the ground, we have been advising residents not to overcharge devices or leave them charging overnight. We need to do more to educate good safety and user habits."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00425,2018-09-10-T-031,425,Cheng Li Hui,"Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding my suggestions, this Bill is a step in the right direction and I support it."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00426,2018-09-10-T-031,426,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill. With the increase in disamenities arising from the explosive growth of Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) and the introduction of bicycle sharing into our land transport landscape, it is timely that we make the necessary amendments to our laws to tighten enforcement and safeguard public interest. We need to ensure a safe and harmonious sharing of public amenities, such as roads and pathways, for our people. However, I would like to seek some clarifications and I have some suggestions for the Ministry to consider."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00427,2018-09-10-T-031,427,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"First, Mr Speaker, I broadly agree with the intent of outsourcing enforcement actions. The new laws can only be effective if they are supported by sustained enforcement actions. The outsourced enforcement officers can be an important supplementary force when it comes to enforcement, as it would not be prudent for the LTA to employ hundreds more enforcement officers. It is, therefore, important that these officers be adequately trained as an authorised representative of LTA as they represent Government authority when carrying out their duties. Under section 11(1)(d) of the proposed amendments to the LTA Act, Outsourced Enforcement Officers “must have suitable qualifications or experience”. I would like to clarify what would constitute “suitable qualification or experience” that the LTA has deemed suitable for this job."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00428,2018-09-10-T-031,428,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Mr Speaker, LTA rolled out the Volunteer Public Path Wardens Programme last year to build up a core group of volunteers with enforcement powers and cultivate good riding habits through the community. Was this programme successful? What lessons have LTA learnt from the programme? I am of the view that Volunteer Wardens and the Outsourced Enforcement Officers can, and should complement each other in keeping our shared pathways safe for all users. That said, will the LTA also consider using technology to reduce the reliance on manpower for enforcement? For example, having a common fleet management system to track and monitor the use of all active mobility devices could better aid in the deployment of the limited ground resources."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00429,2018-09-10-T-031,429,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"On the topic of PMDs, I note that the Ministry has recently accepted the Active Mobility Advisory Panel’s recommendations to require cyclists and PMD users to stop at road crossings and look out for vehicles before resuming their journeys. I welcome this move, as between 2016 and 2018, 80% of accidents involving PMDs were due to PMD collisions with vehicles. Videos of PMDs speeding across crossings, even when the traffic lights were not in their favour, have been widely circulated on social media. However, if the proposed measure to stop and look out for vehicles at road crossings fails to yield a reduction in the number of accidents at such road crossings, would the Ministry consider introducing rules to mandate dismounting the PMD at road and zebra crossings?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00430,2018-09-10-T-031,430,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Mr Speaker, the active enforcement of safety rules must be done together with adequate and proper training of PMD users, including young users, to prevent avoidable accidents. Much like how we would be required to pass a test before being allowed to drive a motor vehicle, would the LTA consider making training mandatory for PMD users? For a start, to minimise costs and administrative work, training could be conducted online, with users taking a quiz to ensure that they have sufficient safety knowledge prior to registration and riding of a PMD."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00431,2018-09-10-T-031,431,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Alternatively, introducing signs, such as “stop and look out for oncoming traffic” at suitable road crossings could potentially help in reminding PMD users to take ownership to ride safely and work towards the safe sharing of pathways for the people around them."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00432,2018-09-10-T-031,432,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Mr Speaker, there is an average of three accidents a month involving pedestrians and PMD users. Some of the pedestrians involved in these accidents had suffered very serious injuries. This begs the question on whether third-party liability insurance should be made mandatory for PMD users. The virtue of mandatory insurance would ensure that victims would get a justified amount of compensation and the offending PMD users would not escape the consequences of their action. Adopting a similar liability and compensation framework as per motor vehicles could go a long way in ensuring that the victims would not be overly burdened by medical expenses in the event of a serious accident."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00433,2018-09-10-T-031,433,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"In the overall active mobility ecosystem, PMD retailers play a crucial role as a gatekeeper of compliant models into the market. Section 32 of the Active Mobility Act acknowledges this, and the Bill makes further refinements on what the retailer can advertise. However, the regulations seem to place the emphasis solely on physical brick-and-mortar retail shops which, presumably, are easier to enforce against. But what about online retailers selling non-compliant devices?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00434,2018-09-10-T-031,434,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Some weeks back, The Straits Times featured a story about an online seller operating out of a HDB flat in Yishun and he had more than 40 e-scooters stocked up in the 4-room HDB flat. In the article, a buyer commented that his e-scooter battery bought from this online retailer became faulty after just 10 days, while a neighbour was worried about the possibility of a fire breaking out in this ""home warehouse"". I too share the same worries. We have already seen an increasing number of cases where PMDs, presumably non-compliant ones, had caught fire when their batteries were charging. I urge the Ministry to put in place measures to block the online sale of such non-compliant PMDs."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00435,2018-09-10-T-031,435,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Mr Speaker, the strict rules governing PMDs have seen some unscrupulous retailers turning to selling motorised wheelchairs as PMDs to circumvent these restrictions. Motorised wheelchairs are meant for use by the disabled and the elderly. These motorised wheelchairs can be costly to purchase, particularly for those with severe conditions and have financial constraints. Expanding the Active Mobility Act to govern these motorised wheelchairs could therefore have a negative impact on the most disadvantaged within our society. I would like to ask the Minister, how many of the current models of motorised wheelchairs would be considered as non-compliant, and if the LTA would have an appeal board to evaluate and grant exemptions on a case-to-case basis or deserving cases."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00436,2018-09-10-T-031,436,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Mr Speaker, incidents that damage road infrastructure and cause massive disruptions to our road transport network often come with high costs. Besides the large repair bill, there is significant impact to work productivity and economic opportunities. I therefore support the Bill's proposal to increase the maximum fine for intentionally causing significant damage, from $10,000 today to $100,000. However, this sum can be minor especially if charged against big companies. I would like to ask if the Ministry would consider an option to impose a multiple factor in the penalty for large corporations, so that we can better deter such incidents from happening."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00437,2018-09-10-T-031,437,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"In conclusion, as a former police officer, I deeply understand the challenges faced in enforcement work. It is not easy. Where possible, we should embrace Smart enforcement and reduce our reliance on manpower. Educating our growing number of PMD users through some form of mandatory training would also go a long way in ensuring that safety remains a key priority even as the PMD users are scooting about Singapore. With that, I support the Bill."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00438,2018-09-10-T-031,438,Speaker,Senior Minister of State Dr Lam.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00439,2018-09-10-T-031,439,Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Members for their queries, suggestions and support for the Bill. Let me first address Members' concerns about active mobility in general before moving on to the specifics of the Bill."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00440,2018-09-10-T-031,440,Lam Pin Min,"Several Members of the House have emphasised the importance of safety on public paths – I cannot agree more. When the Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) released its recommendations on measures to enhance path safety in end-August and when the Government announced our acceptance of the recommendations in early September, we similarly heard many comments about path safety, with some members of the public advocating for personal mobility devices (PMDs) to be completely banned from public paths."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00441,2018-09-10-T-031,441,Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, to address Assoc Prof Randolph Tan's question, our view is that active mobility has brought benefits to many Singaporeans. It provides more first-last mile options, and complements the more traditional modes of transport. Active mobility devices provide new mobility options to those with walking difficulties and relatively cheap and convenient options for commuting or even for the purpose of work. Many Members of the House, including Mr Zainal Sapari, Mr Louis Ng and Ms Rahayu Mahzam, have acknowledged these benefits."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00442,2018-09-10-T-031,442,Lam Pin Min,"Rather than banning these devices, we should strike a balance to allow us to harness the potential of active mobility while mitigating the disamenities. We have therefore put in place a system of rules and regulations to govern the usage of devices on public paths. Each measure should not be seen in isolation. We also complement these with strict enforcement efforts, widespread education measures and infrastructural improvements where we can."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00443,2018-09-10-T-031,443,Lam Pin Min,"We recently accepted AMAP's recommendations to further improve the safety of path-sharing. This includes mandating the registration of e-scooters, implementing a device speed limit of 10km/h on personal mobility aids (PMAs), mandating helmets for active mobility device users on roads, and mandating ""stop and look"" at traffic crossings."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00444,2018-09-10-T-031,444,Lam Pin Min,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Zainal Sapari, Ms Rahayu Mahzam, and Mr Melvin Yong called for third-party liability insurance to be made mandatory. AMAP had considered the impact of this on the diverse group of active mobility users, and determined that it was ultimately more important to prevent accidents from happening in the first place. We agree with the Panel and will instead strengthen regulations to safeguard the safety of path users. With regard to Ms Rahayu Mahzam's suggestion of tapping on the Small Claims Tribunal for personal injury claims up to $20,000, we understand that the Tribunal does not hear personal injury claims. Instead, we have accepted the Panel's recommendation to raise awareness of, and accessibility to, existing avenues of seeking compensation, such as working with the Singapore Mediation Centre on making mediation more readily accessible."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00445,2018-09-10-T-031,445,Lam Pin Min,"As Mr Ang Hin Kee and Miss Cheng Li Hui have suggested, we will continue to strongly encourage and promote the take-up of third party liability insurance, focusing on large employers of active mobility device users such as food delivery companies. Some companies, such as Deliveroo, already provide insurance for their riders and we encourage all other companies to do so as well."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00446,2018-09-10-T-031,446,Lam Pin Min,"Miss Cheng Li Hui pointed out that food delivery companies also need to play their part to ensure their riders ride safely. We agree – this is part of their duty under the Workplace Safety and Health Act. The Ministry of Manpower, LTA and the Traffic Police have issued a joint circular to delivery companies with concrete suggestions of steps they can take. Delivery companies should monitor the riding behaviour of their riders, for instance, by providing an avenue for public reporting, and also train and educate their riders on the active mobility regulations and safe riding behaviours."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00447,2018-09-10-T-031,447,Lam Pin Min,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Joan Pereira also spoke about increasing penalties for riders who cause serious injury to victims. Under the Active Mobility Act, individuals who ride recklessly can face up to $5,000 in fines and up to six months' imprisonment. Those who cause grievous hurt can face even higher penalties under the Penal Code – in the case of a rider riding rashly, he can face up to $10,000 in fines and up to four years' imprisonment. To answer Mr Dennis Tan's query, the criminal justice system has different mechanisms for dealing with offenders who are under the age of 21."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00448,2018-09-10-T-031,448,Lam Pin Min,"I thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Ms Thanaletchimi for raising other potential areas for review, including pillion riders, handphone restrictions and an incentive-based system to encourage safe riding. While these issues lie outside the scope of this Bill, I assure Members that we work closely with AMAP to continually review our active mobility rules and regulations, and we will take these suggestions into account when discussing the key areas of review with AMAP. I would also like to reassure Mr Melvin Yong that we will certainly monitor the situation after AMAP's recommendations are implemented, and review the measures as necessary, depending on the prevailing situation."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00449,2018-09-10-T-031,449,Lam Pin Min,"I would like to assure Ms Joan Pereira and Miss Cheng Li Hui that we also undertake strong enforcement efforts. LTA's team of 50 Active Mobility Enforcement Officers (AMEOs) have issued over 3,000 advisories for unsafe riding on paths. With enhanced enforcement powers under the AMA since May 2018, LTA has stepped up its enforcement efforts and has detected over 1,300 active mobility offences between 1 May and 15 August 2018. The measures in this Bill, including the PMD registration regime and the empowerment of outsourced enforcement officers, will further strengthen our enforcement efforts."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00450,2018-09-10-T-031,450,Lam Pin Min,"I thank Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Melvin Yong for their suggestions to adopt technology in our enforcement efforts. LTA is conducting a trial to study the effectiveness of mobile close circuit televisions (CCTVs) in identifying and reducing errant riding behaviours along public paths. We will continue to explore how technology can enhance and complement our enforcement efforts, so as to allow us to be effective while being manpower-lean."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00451,2018-09-10-T-031,451,Lam Pin Min,"We enforce strictly against retailers in Singapore that sell non-compliant devices for use on public paths. LTA recently conducted an enforcement blitz against 18 retailers, and seized a total of 18 PMDs and two power-assisted bicycles (PABs) for non-compliance. We agree with Er Dr Lee Bee Wah on the need to continue to enforce against such errant retailers and will continue to take a strong enforcement stance towards them. We also wish to inform Ms Thanaletchimi that LTA can require retailers to display notices about the different types of devices and the relevant device criteria at their premises. To address Mr Dennis Tan's concern, members of the public are encouraged to report retailers who wilfully misrepresent the device specifications to LTA and we will not hesitate to take firm action against such retailers."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00452,2018-09-10-T-031,452,Lam Pin Min,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Mr Melvin Yong have asked about online retailers of PMDs. Where feasible, LTA engages online marketplace operators to remove postings of non-compliant devices, most of which are agreeable to doing so. However, some online retailers are based overseas which limits our ability to enforce against them. Ultimately, PMD users must also exercise caution and take personal responsibility in choosing the device to buy and ride on public paths. It is in the consumers' interest to check that the devices they buy comply with the device criteria. Non-compliant devices will not be allowed to be registered, and those used on public paths will be confiscated."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00453,2018-09-10-T-031,453,Lam Pin Min,"We will continue to monitor the situation, including studying Mr Ang Hin Kee and Mr Dennis Tan's suggestions to raise public awareness of the legitimate retailers who sell compliant devices and of the popular device models which comply with our device criteria."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00454,2018-09-10-T-031,454,Lam Pin Min,"As Mr Ang Hin Kee, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Ms Rahayu Mahzam have highlighted, educational efforts are important to cultivate a culture of safe and gracious path sharing. We have rolled out several public education outreach initiatives along with the Safe Riding Programme (SRP) for active mobility users. As I earlier mentioned, over 9,000 riders have gone through the SRP since it was launched in February this year. Delivery riders, such as those from Deliveroo, have also attended the programme. We encourage all active mobility device users to attend the SRP to learn and practise safe riding behaviours."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00455,2018-09-10-T-031,455,Lam Pin Min,"Let me also reassure Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Melvin Yong that we will continue to do our utmost to educate active mobility interest groups, schools, and the migrant worker community on safe riding. It is probably not necessary at the moment to have mandatory training, but we will certainly expand our outreach and engagement efforts to all members of the public."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00456,2018-09-10-T-031,456,Lam Pin Min,"Our active mobility infrastructure also helps to safeguard the safety of path users. I would like to reassure Mr Melvin Yong that we have already started implementing measures such as appropriate signs reminding active mobility device users to slow down or watch out for traffic. We will continue to do so. Mr Louis Ng asked about the width of footpaths. New footpaths with no adjacent cycling paths will now be 1.8 metres wide, wider than the previous minimum width of 1.5 metres. Apart from this, we are building dedicated cycling infrastructure where possible, and introducing pedestrian priority zones (PPZ) at locations along cycling paths with potentially high pedestrian-cyclist interactions. We will continue to improve our infrastructure island-wide, but these will take time to implement."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00457,2018-09-10-T-031,457,Lam Pin Min,"I would also like to thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for the clarification on an example of disallowing the use of PMDs in Town Council areas. I would be happy to get more details from her on the case and advise her accordingly. But it will be sufficient for me to remind Members of the House that the Active Mobility Act serves to ensure that all public paths are made available for the use of active mobility users, and that rules are applied consistently so that users will not be confused with different rules at different areas."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00458,2018-09-10-T-031,458,Lam Pin Min,"I hope I have addressed the Members' concerns about active mobility safety. As with the introduction of any new mode of transport, it will take time for all user groups to adjust. As Mr Ang Hin Kee and Mr Louis Ng pointed out, ultimately, the key is for Singapore to develop a safe and gracious sharing culture for our public paths, where everyone plays a part in keeping our paths safe."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00459,2018-09-10-T-031,459,Lam Pin Min,"I will now move on to address the Members' questions on the Bill. I thank Members for their support of the e-scooter registration regime. As mentioned earlier, applicants will have to declare that their device is compliant with the device criteria upon registration. Ms Rahayu Mahzam had suggested undertaking measures to ensure continued compliance with the device criteria. We will consider appropriate measures and will continue to enforce against non-compliant devices found on public paths."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00460,2018-09-10-T-031,460,Lam Pin Min,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Louis Ng asked about the parties that can register PMDs. Companies can own and register PMDs. We will take into account Er Dr Lee and Ms Thanaletchimi's feedback when deciding on the age for individuals who wish to register PMDs.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00461,2018-09-10-T-031,461,Lam Pin Min,"Mr Louis Ng asked whether LTA can refuse to register PMDs for individuals who were previously convicted of active mobility-related offences. However, prohibiting the individual from registering a PMD does not prevent them from riding PMDs that they rent or borrow. Instead, it is better to educate them on safe riding behaviours. This is why we have made it mandatory for reckless riders to attend the Safe Riding Programme before they may compound their offence."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00462,2018-09-10-T-031,462,,"asked about circumstances in which PMDs can be deregistered. We expect the bulk of deregistrations to be due to applications by the registrant, and LTA de-registering non-compliant PMDs. Legislatively, we have also provided for deregistration if LTA is satisfied that the device has ceased to be used on any footpath or shared path, and if the device is wholly unfit for further use. This is intended to cover scenarios like a deceased person's next-of-kin applying to deregister a PMD with sufficient proof of disposal, or when the PMD has deteriorated and is no longer serviceable."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00463,2018-09-10-T-031,463,,"Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Louis Ng asked how registrants should deal with changes of ownership or when their PMDs cease to be used. If the registrant has sold his PMD to another person, he should apply to LTA to transfer the registration to the buyer. If the registrant has ceased to use the PMD, there is currently no legal obligation for him to deregister the PMD. However, it is in his interest to do so as he would otherwise continue to be held responsible for the PMD. LTA will facilitate this by reminding registrants to deregister their devices if they are no longer being used. Owners should also ensure that their PMDs are properly disposed of to prevent subsequent misuse. This will ensure that they do not face the situation of continuing liability that Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Louis Ng highlighted."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00464,2018-09-10-T-031,464,,"Mr Melvin Yong asked how the 10km/h device speed limit will impact genuine users of PMAs. We share his concern, too. This is why AMAP has consulted agencies involved in eldercare and with the disability community. We understand that occupational therapists do not generally recommend devices that travel above 10km/h for the patients' own safety. AMAP also found that the vast majority of PMAs available in the market today already comply with this device speed limit. Thus, genuine users of PMAs should have little difficulty in complying with the new criterion. For those users that may require more assistance to comply, we will explore what we can do to assist them."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00465,2018-09-10-T-031,465,,"Mr Dennis Tan also asked about whether PMA users would be allowed on roads if the footpaths are obstructed. It is not an offence for PMA or PMD users to ride on roads in such a situation, but they should travel along the road only for the distance necessary to avoid the obstruction."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00466,2018-09-10-T-031,466,,"Ms Joan Pereira, Miss Cheng Li Hui and Mr Melvin Yong expressed concern about fires caused by motorised PMDs. As earlier mentioned, we intend to require all motorised PMDs used on public paths to conform to the UL2272 standard. We intend to prohibit the sale of devices that do not comply with UL2272 from July 2019, and use of these devices on public paths from January 2021. I would also like to clarify with Mr Gan Thiam Poh that this is a separate initiative from the e-scooter registration regime. Devices will be certified according to UL's testing requirements."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00467,2018-09-10-T-031,467,,"I thank Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Melvin Yong for their support for the amendments relating to outsourced enforcement officers (OEOs). I would like to reassure Members that we have put in place many safeguards to prevent the abuse of powers. I have earlier mentioned the explicit authorisation that they will have to receive from the Chief Executive of LTA on the powers they can exercise. They have to be in uniform and display their identification card."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00468,2018-09-10-T-031,468,,"To address Ms Thanaletchimi’s concern, uniforms will make the OEOs more recognisable to the general public. We will also undertake publicity measures to ensure the public is aware of the powers conferred on the OEOs. To answer Mr Louis Ng’s question, OEOs are subject to broader checks and balances when exercising their statutory powers, including possible judicial review, as are other enforcement officers, such as the Police and LTA officers."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00469,2018-09-10-T-031,469,,"Mr Melvin Yong asked about the qualifications and training of OEOs. Suitable qualifications include the private security guard licence as well as relevant security industry certifications, such as WSQ qualifications. LTA will also ensure that the OEOs are suitably trained and have the necessary skillsets to carry out their functions safely and efficiently."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00470,2018-09-10-T-031,470,,"I would also like to clarify with Mr Louis Ng that the amendment to section 50 of the AMA provides OEOs with the power to seize vehicles which are connected with offences under the AMA, such as non-compliant PMDs. OEOs will not be granted powers of disposal under the AMA. Mr Louis Ng also asked why the Bill removes the need for LTA to locate the owner prior to disposing of a vehicle under section 53 of the AMA. This is because section 50 of the AMA already requires LTA to notify the owner, if known, of the seizure."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00471,2018-09-10-T-031,471,,"asked whether the proposed penalties for causing damage to road infrastructure are sufficient to deter companies. Apart from raising the fine for intentionally engaging in conduct causing damage from $10,000 to $100,000, LTA also retains the option of suing for the full cost of repairs."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00472,2018-09-10-T-031,472,,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank all the Members who have spoken on this Bill and the many valuable suggestions and comments they have given. In summary, this Bill supports our vision for a better and safer transport system by enhancing LTA's enforcement and regulatory powers. Mr Speaker, I beg to move."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00473,2018-09-10-T-031,473,Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Sir. I have two clarifications. Just now, the Senior Minister of State talked about compensation via mediation and this is provided both parties agree to attend the mediation. My question is  what if one party refuses to attend the mediation or the end result of mediation is not satisfactory? What recourse does the injured party have, besides taking legal action?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00474,2018-09-10-T-031,474,Lee Bee Wah,"Second question is, Nee Soon Town Council has our by-law where no cycling is allowed in open spaces and common areas. Can this continue to be implemented under the new Active Mobility Act (AMA) or otherwise?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00475,2018-09-10-T-031,475,Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for the two supplementary questions. On her first question on compensation avenues, currently there are three ways where the victim of accidents can seek compensation. The one which Er Dr Lee Bee Wah mentioned was through a private settlement via mediation. Of course, if the parties can reach an agreement, such an agreement can be enforced via a contract. The other possible avenue where victims can seek compensation is through civil action, that is, to pursue a civil claim. For this, the victim may have to initiate legal proceedings against the cyclist or the person who caused the injury. And if the court rules in favour of the victim, then the court will order the defendant to pay damages to the plaintiff. The last modality where victims can seek redress is to file a police report of the incident and the police will then carry out investigations to establish the cause and liability and, depending on the outcome of the investigation, the offender may be charged for offences like speeding or reckless riding under the AMA or for causing grievous hurt to others by a rash act under the Penal Code. If the offender is found guilty, then the court may also decide on the compensation amount that the injured person will receive."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00476,2018-09-10-T-031,476,Lam Pin Min,"On the second question on the town council by-laws, the Active Mobility Act applies to all public paths, including paths in town council areas. Therefore, town councils are not allowed to ban PMDs on paths or enforce any by-laws that defer from the provisions in the AMA. The AMA will take precedence. The only exception to this are void decks. Void decks are excluded from the AMA because they are not critical for connectivity and the safety concerns at void decks are also stronger because of the layout such as pillars. There may be many blind spots present. And for this, Town Councils can choose to enact their own by-laws relating to the use of active mobility devices in void decks. Like I have said, LTA will be happy to find out the details from Er Dr Lee Bee Wah on the incident or the example that she brought up, and we will work with the Town Council to see how we can better address some of the safety concerns in those areas mentioned by the Member."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00477,2018-09-10-T-031,477,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just a clarification to what the Senior Minister of State has just said about the right to commence action in court. Yes, there is such a right to commence action in court. But if the injuries are not very serious, the legal cost of commencing such an action may not be very worthwhile for parties to commence action in court. So, in effect, for many people who suffered injuries which are not very serious in such incidents, the right of recourse to the courts may well be just an academic one."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00478,2018-09-10-T-031,478,Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Mr Dennis Tan for that clarification. Indeed, he is right. Other than those avenues that I have mentioned, most importantly, we need to educate road users, path users as well as PMD users on the right etiquette to ride responsibly and safely. With that, we hope that such incidents or accidents can be minimised."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00479,2018-09-10-T-031,479,Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Sir. I would like to reiterate. As I have mentioned in my speech, there are areas where there are very narrow passageways, not at the void decks. It could be between two coffeeshops or between two supermarkets. I think LTA should give town councils more leeway to manage the town council area. They know which are the areas that are dangerous and which are the areas that have high pedestrian traffic. I hope that LTA can amend the Active Mobility Act in this aspect so that the residents are safe at all times."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00480,2018-09-10-T-031,480,Lam Pin Min,"I thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for the comment and I agree with her that safety of the users is paramount. I have also mentioned that we will work with her to see how we can address some of these concerns. There can be other mitigating measures like making those vulnerable areas Pedestrian Priority Zones (PPZ) so that PMD users will exercise due diligence and caution when approaching such places and also, for road users or pathway users, to exercise caution as well to prevent potential incidents from happening. I take it that Er Dr Lee Bee Wah is very passionate about this issue and that she is very concerned about the safety of her residents and so are we; and we will work with her to see how we can best address these concerns."
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00481,2018-09-10-T-031,481,Speaker,Mr Zainal Sapari.
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00482,2018-09-10-T-031,482,Zainal Sapari,"I think even with the best education, it only requires one irresponsible PMD user to cause an accident. If let us say, the amount of compensation is huge, even after taking a legal recourse, the PMD users might not be able to pay that kind of compensation due to financial difficulty. What recourse then would the accident victims have in such a situation?"
2018-09-10-T-031-S-00483,2018-09-10-T-031,483,Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Mr Zainal Sapari for the supplementary question. And, indeed, these are issues that LTA, together with MOT, do grapple with to see how we can best address them and, of course, one of the ways to address this issue is to encourage PMD users to purchase third party liability insurance. We will work with the General Insurance Association as well as insurance companies to explore ways to make third party insurance more affordable and more accessible. We are also considering whether we can include the option of bundling third party liability insurance into the sale of the PMDs so that when PMD users purchase their PMDs, it comes with third party liability insurance as well."

2018-09-10-T-032-S-00493,2018-09-10-T-032,493,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time""."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00494,2018-09-10-T-032,494,Lawrence Wong,The Stamp Duties (Amendment) Bill 2018 will give legislative effect to four main categories of changes to the Stamp Duties Act.
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00495,2018-09-10-T-032,495,Lawrence Wong,"First, in line with our Smart Nation efforts, the Stamp Duties Act will be amended to provide for stamp duty to be levied on electronic records that effect a transfer of interest in immovable properties and shares. Currently, such transfers are done via physical records, and stamp duty is levied where applicable. With the pervasive use of digital technology, there is potential for more of such transactions to be effected electronically, bringing greater convenience to citizens and businesses."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00496,2018-09-10-T-032,496,Lawrence Wong,"Today, the Stamp Duties Act does not expressly provide that an “instrument” has to be a physical instrument to be dutiable. Given its legislative history and the fact that some provisions in the Act operate on the basis of an “instrument” being in a physical form, the amendments will update the provisions and provide for how they are to apply to electronic records. This will ensure that our legislation keeps pace with digitalisation and safeguards Singapore’s revenue where transfers are effected without a physical instrument. We have provided a validation clause to address any potential dispute over past payment and collection of stamp duties that have been made in relation to an electronic record."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00497,2018-09-10-T-032,497,Lawrence Wong,"The second change is to provide in the Act that the Minister can recover interest from a taxpayer who fails to comply with the remission conditions, in respect of upfront stamp duty remission that had been granted to him. The existing Act does not restrict the conditions that the Minister may impose when granting remissions, and it is an established practice today that remissions are granted on the basis of certain conditions. Failure to fulfil these remission conditions would result in recovery of the stamp duty that had been remitted, with interest."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00498,2018-09-10-T-032,498,Lawrence Wong,"When applying for upfront stamp duty remissions, taxpayers today sign an undertaking agreeing that interest is recoverable should they fail to comply with the remission conditions. Such cases mainly involve housing developers, who are granted upfront remission of the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty for their purchase of land for housing development. The key terms of the remission conditions require the developers to commence, complete and sell the development within a specified timeframe, failing which, the stamp duty earlier remitted will be recovered, together with interest. And that compensates the Government for the opportunity cost of the duties it would have received, had the remission not been granted. While the current arrangements have worked well so far, we are making this amendment to make clear that the Government can recover interest when a taxpayer fails to comply with any of the remission conditions. We have provided a validation clause, to again address any potential dispute over the past payment and recovery of interest for a failure to comply with remission conditions."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00499,2018-09-10-T-032,499,Lawrence Wong,"Third, we will make amendments to section 15 of the Act, which provides relief from stamp duty for corporate restructuring where there is no substantial change in beneficial interest of the transferred assets. The amendments will align our legislation with changes made to the stamp duty regime in recent years. For example, a firm is currently not able to enjoy relief from share duty, if its conversion to a Limited Liability Partnership attracts the Additional Conveyance Duty. Given that the policy intent remains not to charge duties under such circumstances, we have amended the legislation to provide relief from share duty under such circumstances."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00500,2018-09-10-T-032,500,Lawrence Wong,"The last category of change pertains to technical amendments arising from the Ministry of Finance’s periodic review to improve tax policy and administration. Today, IRAS has an E-stamping system, which is an online portal for taxpayers to declare and pay stamp duties. Currently, the Act requires IRAS to seek the Minister’s approval for changes to the administration of the system, such as determining the information to be furnished by taxpayers under the E-stamping system. We will amend the relevant provisions of the Act, to give IRAS the flexibility to make these changes without having to seek the Minister’s approval each time. This will enhance IRAS’ flexibility and nimbleness to meet its operational needs. Mr Speaker, I beg to move."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00501,2018-09-10-T-032,501,Lawrence Wong,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00502,2018-09-10-T-032,502,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I stand in support of this Bill. Last year, stamp duty comprised some 7% of all taxes collected. In a time of rising social and healthcare spending, it is important that we secure this revenue base. At the same time, we should also always aspire towards providing more options and greater clarity to liable taxpayers. I am confident that this Bill will help the Government achieve these goals. The Bill provides for the Stamp Duties Act to be applied to electronic records and details specific rules for its application."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00503,2018-09-10-T-032,503,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"This is a significant step towards a regulatory framework built around a digitised economy. The digital world moves quickly, and that creates both opportunity and confusion for Singaporeans."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00504,2018-09-10-T-032,504,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I have two points of clarification."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00505,2018-09-10-T-032,505,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,The first point centres on blockchain. Can the Minister clarify the Government’s regulatory stance towards “proptech” start-ups that use blockchain to decentralise the electronic records of property transactions? Can the Minister also share what efforts it has made or will make to educate Singaporeans about the legality of these services?
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00506,2018-09-10-T-032,506,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Over the past few years, Singapore has seen the rise of the fintech industry. What has gone less noticed is the rise of a property tech, or proptech industry. A 2017 media article profiled several Singapore-based proptech firms, each vowing to transform Singapore's real estate sector with new technology."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00507,2018-09-10-T-032,507,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Several claim to use blockchain, a technology that decentralises control and ownership. One of the start-ups, Averspace, has an app that connects renters and leasers. Its app offers templates for rental contracts that are signed online and stored using blockchain. Two other start-ups, Reidao and FundPlaces, allow users to own properties using blockchain in conjunction with complex currency changes or Special Purpose Vehicles, though their services have yet to extend to properties located in Singapore. Yet, another start-up, InvestaCrowd, is planning to launch a crowdfunding model for Singapore property."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00508,2018-09-10-T-032,508,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"A HSBC report states that 89% of recent homeowners look for properties online. Yet consumers may find themselves unclear on the legalities of these models. In 2017, the MAS said only that it was ""closely watching"" the space. That same year, Reidao's Chief Executive told the media that it had reached out to the MAS when he started the business. He claimed that MAS did not, I quote, ""make any real comments"" to him because it ""lacked legislation to instruct the process""."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00509,2018-09-10-T-032,509,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Young digital firms have showed that they can bring excitement to Singaporeans but also headaches for regulators, as we have seen with the likes of Grab. Taking a proactive approach, especially where Singaporeans' nest-eggs are concerned, may be worthwhile. As such, clarifications on the legality of blockchain-based property dealers would provide very useful guidance for Singaporeans navigating these digital frontiers."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00510,2018-09-10-T-032,510,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Secondly, and on the other hand, I would like to clarify how the Government plans to overcome any possible scepticism towards the use of electronic records in property transactions."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00511,2018-09-10-T-032,511,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"A commentary written by Lee Liat Yang, senior partner of Dentons Rodyk, suggested that while electronic contracts might become the norm in lower value rental contracts, people may still shy from them when buying and selling property over safety concerns."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00512,2018-09-10-T-032,512,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I am heartened that the Stamp Duties Act outlines clear penalties against the falsification of records and that the Bill defines terms such as electronic signatures.
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00513,2018-09-10-T-032,513,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Does the Government have plans to go beyond these measures to promote awareness of and address concerns about the security and reliability of using electronic records to execute real estate transactions? In this and in many other digital areas, consumers are charting new waters, and there is enough importance in housing that the Government should provide a lighthouse, if not a map, for the people."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00514,2018-09-10-T-032,514,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Notwithstanding these clarifications, Sir, I am in support of this Bill that keeps our property regulatory framework up-to-date with developments on the digital frontier."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00515,2018-09-10-T-032,515,Speaker,Minister Lawrence Wong.
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00516,2018-09-10-T-032,516,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I thank Mr Louis Ng for his support for the Bill. He raised two important issues. They are not exactly specific to the amendments that are being proposed but they are, nevertheless, important issues which I will touch on."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00517,2018-09-10-T-032,517,Lawrence Wong,"First, the Government does recognise the rapid pace of technological developments, including in the emerging proptech sector and the use of blockchains for transactions, be it in financial industry or in the property market."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00518,2018-09-10-T-032,518,Lawrence Wong,Businesses and consumers would indeed benefit from greater legal clarity and certainty over such new technologies. And that is why Government agencies are separately studying the legislative framework for electronic transactions in Singapore as well as how best to streamline and digitalise property transaction processes.
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00519,2018-09-10-T-032,519,Lawrence Wong,"In particular, the Electronics Transactions Act (ETA) was first enacted in 1998 to create a legislative framework for electronic transactions in Singapore. Amongst other things, it provides for the legal recognition and usage of electronic signatures and electronic records, giving predictability and certainty to electronic transactions and facilitating e-commerce."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00520,2018-09-10-T-032,520,Lawrence Wong,"MCI and IMDA are currently reviewing the ETA. The review includes the relevance of the current scope of the ETA and how to improve clarity with respect to emerging technological developments, like the ones Mr Ng talked about, and business models. We will consult and obtain the views of the industry and public before revisions are made to the ETA."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00521,2018-09-10-T-032,521,Lawrence Wong,"The second issue that Mr Ng raised was about the Government's plan to address concerns on security and reliability of using electronic records to execute real estate transactions. We have a Real Estate Industry Transformation Map (ITM), and under this framework, the various stakeholders from the Government and the private sector have been coming together to discuss how best to streamline and digitalise property transactions processes, and the implementation roadmap to go about doing this work."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00522,2018-09-10-T-032,522,Lawrence Wong,"The workgroup consists of key Government agencies and industry representatives across the real estate value chain. The aim of the workgroup is to look into the feasibility of enabling property transactions to be conducted electronically from start to finish, but importantly, to do so in a secure and verifiable way."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00523,2018-09-10-T-032,523,Lawrence Wong,"Given the typical sizes of property transactions which the Member also alluded to, this would require very careful study in consultation with the industry and regulators. We believe that such a collaboration will help ensure that the interests of property buyers and sellers can be adequately protected, and we can then build confidence in digitalised property transactions."
2018-09-10-T-032-S-00524,2018-09-10-T-032,524,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I believe I have answered the Member's queries and I beg to move."

2018-09-10-T-033-S-00530,2018-09-10-T-033,530,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Environment and Water Resources, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00531,2018-09-10-T-033,531,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Smoking is a significant and longstanding public health challenge in Singapore. Although smoking rates have dipped from a high of 23% in 1977 to 12% today, its associated diseases continue to claim the lives of more than 2,000 Singaporeans each year, or an average of six persons every day."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00532,2018-09-10-T-033,532,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The social cost of smoking is not small, amounting to some S$600 million in lost productivity and direct healthcare costs annually. The health effects from exposure to second-hand smoke are also well-documented. To tackle tobacco addiction, the Government adopts a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach which involves curtailing access to cigarettes, sustaining public education and cessation efforts, and restricting where one can smoke."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00533,2018-09-10-T-033,533,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have been a global front-runner in tobacco control, and were one of the first countries to prohibit smoking in public places. Today, curbs on tobacco advertising and a minimum legal age for smoking are in force, and more than 32,000 places have been made smoke-free. Our vision is to become a smoke-free nation where tobacco use is discouraged, and people can enjoy clean air and a conducive living environment, free from passive smoke. We continue to press on towards this goal."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00534,2018-09-10-T-033,534,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Last year, we announced plans to turn the Orchard Road precinct into a ""No-Smoking Zone"" or NSZ. The shopping belt was chosen because of the heavy footfall it experiences year round both from locals and tourists."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00535,2018-09-10-T-033,535,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As a destination attraction, Orchard Road draws large crowds. We want to ensure that pedestrians, particularly families with young children and elderly, are protected from passive tobacco smoke along the busy thoroughfare."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00536,2018-09-10-T-033,536,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Many businesses operating in the NSZ have expressed support for this initiative, which is in line with their plans to ramp up new offerings and activities along the shopping belt. My thanks go out to the Orchard Road Business Association (ORBA) in particular for facilitating the preparations for the NSZ."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00537,2018-09-10-T-033,537,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But the journey to quit smoking is a challenging one, and smokers need time to wean themselves off the habit. We recognise this, and will make provisions for smoking at certain designated areas. This pragmatic approach maintains a balance between the interests of smokers and non-smokers, even as we discourage tobacco consumption."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00538,2018-09-10-T-033,538,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The Bill before us today therefore proposes amendments to the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act, or referred to ""the Act"" later, to strike this balance."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00539,2018-09-10-T-033,539,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We will introduce a new section 3A to expand the scope of the Act so that the National Environment Agency (NEA), with the approval of the Minister can, in addition to prescribing any specific place as a smoking-prohibited place, prescribe a geographical area as an NSZ. Once designated an NSZ, every publicly-accessible place within the NSZ will become smoking-prohibited, including along uncovered footpaths and pedestrian crossings."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00540,2018-09-10-T-033,540,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"It will be an offence to smoke at these places. The existing smoking-prohibited places, such as the shopping malls and the common areas of commercial office buildings, will remain smoke-free. The penalty for unlawful smoking within an NSZ will be no different from that imposed in any other smoking-prohibited place."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00541,2018-09-10-T-033,541,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Under the new section 3C, it will be made clear that managers of premises may set up designated smoking areas (DSAs) within their compounds. These facilities must conform to prescribed requirements in respect of their design, amenities and location."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00542,2018-09-10-T-033,542,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For example, DSAs must not be located in certain types of smoking-prohibited places, and must not obstruct public walkways and cause dis-amenities. We will periodically review the requirements to guard against a proliferation of DSAs and ensure that these facilities serve their purpose."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00543,2018-09-10-T-033,543,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Ahead of the establishment of the Orchard Road NSZ, businesses and premises owners have worked with NEA to identify suitable locations for DSAs, away from the main thoroughfare. The various DSAs are spaced out for convenient access."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00544,2018-09-10-T-033,544,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Between October 2016 and December 2017, MEWR had studied the effectiveness of DSAs in the Orchard Road area in reducing smoking activities along the pedestrian thoroughfare. We found that the DSAs led to a one-third decline in the number of smokers along the main thoroughfare. Seventy percent of the non-smokers interviewed also felt that passive tobacco smoke along the main thoroughfare had been reduced after the DSAs were set up. These findings are encouraging. When the NSZ is in operation, Singaporeans and tourists can look forward to cleaner air along Orchard Road."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00545,2018-09-10-T-033,545,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Sir, the next set of amendments aim to strengthen NEA's operational effectiveness in enforcing the smoking ban. Under the existing Act, the managers of smoking prohibited places are responsible for ensuring the ban is observed within their premises. The vast majority do so, including those managing coffee shops and food courts, and I appreciate their efforts in safeguarding a smoke-free environment."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00546,2018-09-10-T-033,546,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"However, from time to time, there is a minority who disregard their responsibilities. NEA has faced challenges in investigating complaints about smoking violations at smoking-prohibited places where access is restricted, particularly in public entertainment outlets such as nightclubs and pubs."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00547,2018-09-10-T-033,547,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Currently, to investigate complaints about smoking violations, NEA enters and inspects the premises with the manager’s consent. While most have been cooperative, some managers have hindered investigations by denying NEA’s authorised officers entry into their premises, which prevents timely, effective investigation and enforcement. This is unsatisfactory."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00548,2018-09-10-T-033,548,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We are therefore introducing new sections 4A and 4B to explicitly provide NEA's authorised officers the powers to enter, without warrants, smoking-prohibited places to investigate feedbacks on related infractions."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00549,2018-09-10-T-033,549,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For common areas of residential premises, NEA can enter only if there is reasonable belief that an offence under the Act has been committed there or that evidence of an offence can be found there, such as upon receiving public feedback about unlawful smoking. For all other smoking-prohibited places, NEA can invoke the power of entry at all reasonable times, such as the operating hours of the place, or at any time if there is reasonable belief that an offence under the Act has been committed there, or that evidence of an offence can be found there."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00550,2018-09-10-T-033,550,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"It will also become an offence to obstruct, hinder or delay authorised officers exercising these powers. The new sections allow NEA to prosecute uncooperative managers for refusing entry or for obstructing its officers in the course of their duty."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00551,2018-09-10-T-033,551,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"NEA’s authorised officers enforcing the smoking ban at times encounter belligerent smokers who turn aggressive. The provisions in section 4B will explicitly make it an offence to obstruct, hinder, or delay these authorised officers in the performance of their duties. Those who verbally or physically abuse an authorised officer will also be liable under these provisions. Penalties will likewise be levied on those who furnish false or misleading information, including those who withhold identification."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00552,2018-09-10-T-033,552,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"These amendments aim to deter uncooperative smokers from hindering the agency’s enforcement efforts, and underscores our firm stance against abusive and uncivil behaviour. Similar offences can be found in other laws such as the Environmental Public Health Act and the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00553,2018-09-10-T-033,553,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The Bill will also clarify that NEA can obtain audio, visual, or physical evidence from a smoking-prohibited place necessary for prosecuting suspected breaches in that place. We will ensure that only authorised personnel such as NEA officers involved directly in the investigations would have access to evidence collected during investigations."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00554,2018-09-10-T-033,554,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The remaining clauses 5 to 8 in the Bill are technical in nature, and are made for clarity."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00555,2018-09-10-T-033,555,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, smoking continues to exact a heavy toll on the health of smokers and non-smokers. The proposals in this Bill serve to discourage smoking and enable us to protect more Singaporeans against secondhand smoke exposure."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00556,2018-09-10-T-033,556,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Following the implementation of the No-Smoking Zone in Orchard Road, we will monitor its effectiveness before considering whether to extend the regime to other areas. Nonetheless, smoking is likely to continue in Singapore and around the world for some time to come and we must take a practical approach towards regulating smoking activities. There are no quick solutions. Our smoke-free vision is a work in progress and we will continue to press on."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00557,2018-09-10-T-033,557,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"While enforcement measures are being augmented, the efforts of the community remain key to fostering considerate behaviour amongst smokers and nudging them towards kicking the habit. I therefore seek Members’ support for this Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00558,2018-09-10-T-033,558,Amy Khor Lean Suan,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00559,2018-09-10-T-033,559,Lee Bee Wah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, more than three decades have passed since the official beginnings of our journey towards a nation of non-smokers. Way back in 1986, posters already warned that smoking causes lung cancer and heart attacks. Over the years, as more research and statistics about the health risks of smoking and second-hand smoke surfaced, public awareness campaigns all over the world have also become increasingly graphic and aggressive. Nevertheless, the effect is limited, especially on those who have already picked up the habit. For those of us who have friends and family members who smoke, many of them are kind enough to walk away when they need a puff. They clearly understand the effects of smoking, and they do not wish to cause harm to their loved ones, yet they are doing this to themselves."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00560,2018-09-10-T-033,560,Lee Bee Wah,"That is the battle against cigarette addiction that forms the backdrop to what we discuss today. There are several aspects of the Bill I welcome wholeheartedly and several places it can go further. With the amendments to the Bill that will help designate most of the Orchard Road precinct as a smoke-free area, I believe more Singaporeans and tourists, especially families with children, can look forward to having a more comfortable leisure and shopping experience. The increased powers to manage prohibited smoking spots is hopefully an indication that there are further plans to implement smoking prohibition in more places, not just at Orchard Road."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00561,2018-09-10-T-033,561,Lee Bee Wah,"I am pleased that the Bill takes into consideration the welfare of our NEA officers. Certainly, uncooperative offenders who abuse our officers deserve to be apprehended."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00562,2018-09-10-T-033,562,Lee Bee Wah,"However, even if we enhance enforcement powers and prohibit smoking in more places, it is pointless if people continue to light up where they should not if they believe they can get away with it. Lack of enforcement continues to be a problem that undermines the effectiveness of this policy. It is a difficult task to catch a smoker red-handed. Most people do not smoke beyond a few minutes, so even if a report is made, by the time an NEA officer comes, the smoker would have left. Most people are afraid to take front-view pictures of smokers because it may escalate into a conflict, so requesting for pictorial evidence of illegal smoking too has its limitations. And, despite the numerous CCTVs installed in public areas, these devices are meant to monitor and deter crimes. This is even happening in HDB estates, where the offender is a resident. Despite numerous reports from other affected residents, the NEA officers are unable to book the offender red-handed so the smoker continues to get away scot-free."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00563,2018-09-10-T-033,563,Lee Bee Wah,I hope the authorities will address the difficulties of catching and penalising smoking at prohibited areas.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00564,2018-09-10-T-033,564,Lee Bee Wah,"Moreover, I am disappointed to learn that residential homes remain out of the authorities’ regulation when it comes to smoking. Now, I understand the challenges. Everyone deserves the freedom to do what he or she likes in their own homes, as long as we do not break the law or harm anyone. So, the question we need to ask is  Does smoking in one’s own house cause harm or is injurious to anyone’s health? When they smoke in the presence of family members, especially young children, without a doubt, the answer is yes. When the smoke drifts out of the window and infiltrates a neighbour’s house, that is another definite yes. Conflicts between HDB neighbours over cigarette smoke crossing over into other houses are increasingly on the rise."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00565,2018-09-10-T-033,565,Lee Bee Wah,"Sir, not only do we have to do more, we also have to move fast. Like all addictions, once smoking takes root, it is challenging to be smoke-free. So many countries are trying, and failing. One can argue that if other countries cannot do it, why should we be so “kia-su” and so ""kia-si""? We can rest our laurels and wait for someone to work out a solution and then we adapt it for our own use. But no, we are Singapore, a small nation capable of accomplishing lofty ambitions. We eradicated opium smoking, despite one in four Chinese adults being addicted to opium in 1933. Undesirable and common habits like spitting and vandalism by way of chewing gum are shadows of the past. I am confident that we can eradicate smoking that affects neighbours if the authorities are firm about it."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00566,2018-09-10-T-033,566,Lee Bee Wah,"If accessibility to cigarettes is greatly reduced, then we need not worry about enforcement. It is high time to look into heavily restricting tobacco sales in Singapore."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00567,2018-09-10-T-033,567,Lee Bee Wah,"We can start with a gradual approach by rationing the amount of sales and drastically increasing taxes on cigarettes. We can channel the extra taxes back into programmes that help people quit smoking. We need not ban the act of smoking itself, but we can make cigarettes much less available."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00568,2018-09-10-T-033,568,Lee Bee Wah,"In the interim, more support and assistance must be available for smokers across all demographics to help them kick the habit, if they wish to. However, in raising the legal smoking age, some young smokers who have been smoking illegally may be afraid to come forward to seek help, so this is something to consider. Perhaps, we need to strengthen education on the ills of smoking in Primary schools and Secondary schools. May I suggest to also to give the principals and teachers more free hand to mete out measures that are deemed appropriate for each cash."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00569,2018-09-10-T-033,569,Lee Bee Wah,"Mr Speaker Sir, in Mandarin please."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00570,2018-09-10-T-033,570,Lee Bee Wah,"(In Mandarin)  This Bill will allow the Government to set up more designated smoking areas, and better protect the NEA officers who are enforcing the law. These are all good ideas. However, even with these regulations, smokers can still light up at smoking-prohibited areas and get away with it. This is because many people are afraid to take a front shot of the smoker's face and the enforcement officers may not be able to reach there before the smoker stubs out. I hope the Government can explore how to address these enforcement challenges."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00571,2018-09-10-T-033,571,Lee Bee Wah,"What is more, many people smoke in their own homes, posing a risk to their family members, especially the children. It will also affect the living environment of the neighbours. Recently, there have been many conflicts caused by this problem. This is also something that the Government should look into."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00572,2018-09-10-T-033,572,Lee Bee Wah,"Once the smoker is addicted, it will be very difficult to kick the habit. Hence, we should have more drastic reforms. We should consider restricting tobacco sales even more and increase tobacco tax. With the additional tax revenue, we can help smokers to stop smoking."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00573,2018-09-10-T-033,573,Lee Bee Wah,"These measures seem very bold, but compared to the harm done by smoking and second-hand smoking to people's health, they are worthy of our serious consideration."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00574,2018-09-10-T-033,574,Lee Bee Wah,"(In English)  But we need stronger measures to fulfil our vision of a smoke-free nation. Not for the glory of being the first nation to achieve it, not to become another glowing statistic, but for the well-being of the current generation of Singaporeans and beyond."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00575,2018-09-10-T-033,575,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, we have been progressively expanding the list of smoke-free places in Singapore, moving step by step towards our vision of prohibiting smoking in all public places."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00576,2018-09-10-T-033,576,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I understand that NEA’s goal is to move the policy from a prohibitive list to a positive list, which states places where smoking is allowed. This Bill is a step in that direction and I stand in full support of it."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00577,2018-09-10-T-033,577,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"As a former smoker who smoked for 17 years, I am passionate about fighting against the dangers of smoking. As a father, I am now doing all I can to protect my three daughters against the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. 85% to 90% of smoke in every cigarette ends up as second-hand smoke and there is no risk-free level of exposure to second-hand smoke.  The World Health Organisation has reported that second-hand smoke contains at least 60 cancer-causing chemicals. Those who are exposed to second-hand smoke face similar health risks as a smoker. These include eye, nose and throat irritations, respiratory tract infections, heart disease, and cancers. Children and pregnant women are particularly susceptible to the effects of secondhand smoke.  Further, children of smokers are more likely to pick up smoking themselves."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00578,2018-09-10-T-033,578,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Sir I am in strong support of this Bill and my only hope is that we can do more. We are now doing a lot to protect people from second-hand smoke in public areas but the concern which Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has just mentioned is that there has been raised also previously in this House is what are we doing to protect people from second-hand smoke in their own homes? It would seem at odds to protect people from second-hand smoke in the public areas where they spend less time and not protect them at home where they spend more time.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00579,2018-09-10-T-033,579,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Many of my residents complain about being affected by second-hand smoke when their neighbours smoke at their windows or balconies. As HDB units are close to each other, what happens next door inadvertently affects neighbours. For those who live next to, or above, chain smokers, the problem can be very acute. Imagine being exposed to and having to tolerate second-hand smoke from your neighbours everyday for years with the only reprieve being moving out altogether. This is the reality faced by some of my residents, which I am sure is shared by many others."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00580,2018-09-10-T-033,580,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I understand that the Act currently covers smoking in private vehicles in cases where windows are not fully wound up and smoke is expelled into smoking prohibited places. I understand that it also covers any area within five metres of windows, exits and entrances to buildings where smoking is prohibited. These restrictions are based on the logic that cigarette smoke can be expelled up to five metres away. As such, applying the same logic, can the law be extended to prohibit smoking in private homes where the smoker is smoking at a window or door within five metres of their neighbour’s windows and doors? This might not be the prefect solution but my hope is that the Ministry studies this issue further, does a public consultation about it and tries to find a middle ground."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00581,2018-09-10-T-033,581,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I appreciate that the Senior Minister of State's reply will be what she said previously that “Smoking within residential premises, in the home, in private space is beyond the jurisdiction of the Government.” But we do have regulations that cover what you do in your home, in your own private space. For example, we have regulations that prohibit making excessive noise in your own house. We have regulations saying you cannot be naked in your own house. Under section 27A of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, a person cannot be naked in a private space while being exposed to public view.  I also want to add that it was reported just last month that the US implemented a ban on smoking inside public housing to improve indoor air quality, to reduce residents’ exposure to second-hand smoke, and to help smokers be more successful at quitting."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00582,2018-09-10-T-033,582,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"According to a nationwide study they conducted, people who lived in homes where smoking was prohibited were 60% more likely to quit smoking for at least 30 days as compared to people without this prohibition."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00583,2018-09-10-T-033,583,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Next, Sir, in a Facebook comment, Mr Loh shared with me the very common experience of pedestrians forced to breathe in second-hand smoke when they walk behind smokers who smoke while on the move. Chiyoda-ku City in Tokyo has banned smoking while walking. New York City is now also considering a Bill that would similarly prohibit people from smoking while walking on sidewalks. Would the Ministry consider a ban on smoking while walking, which would stamp out the unpleasant situation highlighted by Mr Loh that many of us have faced? Such a ban could be piloted on major streets with heavy pedestrian footfall such as those in the Central Business District and the Civic District."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00584,2018-09-10-T-033,584,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Further, earlier this year Senior Minister of State Amy Khor shared that the Ministry is exploring the feasibility of expanding the designated smoking area scheme first implemented in Orchard Road to other parts of Singapore. Senior Minister of State mentioned this in her opening speech. Can the Ministry provide more updates on this review and share if there are plans to scale up the scheme?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00585,2018-09-10-T-033,585,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Can I also ask what would be the guidelines used in determining the suitability of the locating a smoking facility under section 3B? This would be very important. I raise this as some of the current eateries where there is a designated smoking area, it really does not matter where you sit as you will get the second-hand smoke whether you are in the designated smoking area or not."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00586,2018-09-10-T-033,586,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Lastly, I refer to the new section 4A which provides authorised officers with certain powers of entry. More specifically, to ascertain if a place has contravened the Act, officers are able to enter, inspect and search places, seize documents or materials, take possession of belongings, and photograph or film without a warrant. Maximum fine of $2,000 is imposed on first offenders and $5,000 on repeat offenders who obstruct authorised officers exercising these powers.  While some powers of entry are necessary for effective enforcement and to achieve better outcomes for people affected by second-hand smoke, the scope of powers and maximum fine imposed might appear to some to be excessive. Further, these powers may be exercised by non-uniformed public officers as with many of the other Bills passed recently. I understand the need to empower nonuniformed public officers, in this case NEA officers, to help with enforcement. Nonetheless, this has to be balanced against privacy concerns, and I would like to ask what measures would be in place to prevent the abuse of such broad powers."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00587,2018-09-10-T-033,587,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, notwithstanding these comments, I stand in full support of this Bill as it signals a strong resolve by the Government to protect citizens against second-hand smoke. It is a firm step towards our vision of a smoke-free lifestyle in Singapore."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00588,2018-09-10-T-033,588,K Thanaletchimi,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. I support the move on the general expansion of places to be prescribed as specific places with the intent to have more smoke-free public areas, in line with the overall goal of discouraging smoking among the population and with the hope that with such restrictions protect the rights of the non-smokers to breathe clean air, that is, smoke-free air and for non-smokers to gradually reduce smoking and eventually give up the habit. Smoke-free areas will help reduce a non-smoker’s exposure to harmful second-hand cigarette smoke."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00589,2018-09-10-T-033,589,K Thanaletchimi,"Sir, I understand that the Government’s long-term policy goal is to prohibit smoking in all public areas except at Designated Smoking Areas, to protect the non-smokers from the harmful effects of second-hand tobacco smoke."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00590,2018-09-10-T-033,590,K Thanaletchimi,"In this case enforcement is going to be a real challenge even though it is an offence for a person to smoke in these smoke-free areas. Therefore the onus must be on the operators and premises managers to stop patrons, visitors, customers and staff from smoking in such prohibited areas or request that they leave the premises which may affect their businesses. There must be public education to encourage and empower non-smokers to step up by reminding smokers not to light up in smoking prohibited areas. There are also concerns that if the community were to be bold enough to do so they can inevitably be abused by the smokers. Therefore it is important that we also educate our smokers to smoke responsibly with the community in mind and to do so in smoking areas only."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00591,2018-09-10-T-033,591,K Thanaletchimi,"Sir, though I support the Bill, I have the following comments and clarifications."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00592,2018-09-10-T-033,592,K Thanaletchimi,"Sufficient time should be provided for managers and owners of the specified places to set up a designated smoking facility. Many conscious non-smokers are of the view that having a designated smoking facility is indeed a compromise by the authority and that the Government should work towards removing such provision, completely, in the long term."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00593,2018-09-10-T-033,593,K Thanaletchimi,"In anticipation of backlash among some segments of the population, there is also a need to explain the caveat that comes with no-smoking zone which prohibited areas, and that there will be designated areas where smoking is still permitted."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00594,2018-09-10-T-033,594,K Thanaletchimi,"A generic concern would be  when we prohibit the sales of a commodity, there will be a likelihood of a black market. Applying the same concept, by further restricting the areas that people can smoke, are we inevitably creating “black zones”?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00595,2018-09-10-T-033,595,K Thanaletchimi,"How can we ensure a good balance of prohibition, regulation, and enforcement to ensure that smokers comply with the regulations without having to dramatically increase enforcement officer presence? If we are very serious about making the large part of Singapore a smoke-free city, can we make use of latest technology, predictive analytical programmes as well as AI to identify violations and potential violations by smokers as well as errant operators? Similar to Snap Safe apps introduced by MOM for snapping unsafe work practices, we can also create Snap Smoking apps to empower Singaporeans to report such violations real time."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00596,2018-09-10-T-033,596,K Thanaletchimi,There is a need to review the level of penalty for those who breach the law. The current penalty does not send a stern warning to those who are affecting the non-smokers who are in most danger of passive smoke.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00597,2018-09-10-T-033,597,K Thanaletchimi,"Sir, notwithstanding this, I thank the Government for making this an important subject to ensure every Singaporean have the right to live in a clean and green environment and that they are also entitled to breathe smoke-free air. This would also serve to help us with our endeavour to be environmentally friendly."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00598,2018-09-10-T-033,598,Gan Thiam Poh,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am in full support of this Bill which will move us closer to our goal of a cleaner, smoke-free environment and a healthier nation. With the amendments to increase the number of places where smoking is banned and to entrust our enforcement officers with additional powers, I am confident we will see further progress in our fight against the scourge of smoking."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00599,2018-09-10-T-033,599,Gan Thiam Poh,"In popular and crowded places such as the Orchard Road shopping belt, legislation to designate all public areas within as part of a no-smoking zone (NSZ) will allow everyone, young and old, to enjoy cleaner air free from pollution. Smokers need not despair – there are designated smoking areas in a NSZ which will provide them with an outlet."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00600,2018-09-10-T-033,600,Gan Thiam Poh,"Enforcement is key to ensure law compliance. Additional powers of entry, taking photographs and videos will enable our officers to carry out their duties more effectively and are necessary to conduct proper investigations."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00601,2018-09-10-T-033,601,Gan Thiam Poh,"I would like to ask what measures, especially the use of technology, that the Ministry has and will be using to facilitate and increase the efficiency of enforcement, especially the common issue of neighbours’ smoke drifting into other homes in our housing estates, as shared by earlier on by few hon Members, right. I think I also want to share this picture from The Straits Times in case Members missed it after the National Day Rally."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00602,2018-09-10-T-033,602,Gan Thiam Poh,"It is a very interesting one after Prime Minister had mentioned HIP II, the wish list from residents. So the wish list is that can they have a fan to blow harmful second-hand smoke back into the smoker's face. Just in case you miss it. That is the wish list of HIP II."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00603,2018-09-10-T-033,603,Gan Thiam Poh,"For years, I think non-smokers have been complaining about neighbours smoking at their window ledges, along common corridors and at landings between staircase. I think this is a common issue that all of us faced as Members of Parliament, I think, during the MPS sessions, right. The resultant air pollution not only causes discomfort, for residents with health problems, the smoke can even trigger an asthma attack That is why I got smoke, Sir. Families with vulnerable young children and elderly members are particularly concerned. Non-smokers also complain about smoking at coffee shops and inconsiderate smokers smoking in the public lifts. Smoking is one of the main causes of friction in our community and disputes among neighbours, as pointed out by Members earlier on."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00604,2018-09-10-T-033,604,Gan Thiam Poh,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in Mandarin."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00605,2018-09-10-T-033,605,Gan Thiam Poh,"(In Mandarin)  Unfortunately, despite public knowledge about the harmful effects of smoking and the additional problems created by second-hand and third-hand smoke, the number of smokers in our midst have not gone down as much as we would like. In the last 10 years, our population’s smoking rate had been hovering between 12% and 14%. Last year, it was at 12%, the lowest to date."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00606,2018-09-10-T-033,606,Gan Thiam Poh,"I have been receiving feedback from smokers who are very unhappy and who are asking for a limit to the number of measures against smoking, including increasing the tobacco excise duty by 10% in this year’s Budget. They ask for understanding from non-smokers and protest the deprivation of their spaces of freedom and enjoyment. On the other hand, non-smokers are calling for a total ban. They are against environments with smoke pollution."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00607,2018-09-10-T-033,607,Gan Thiam Poh,"I think we can consider effective measures and best practices in other countries to strike a balance between the two groups. For example, setting up smoking rooms with air filters or purification machines in public facilities, office buildings and shopping malls."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00608,2018-09-10-T-033,608,Gan Thiam Poh,"At the same time, we must persist in continuing our public education to let our citizens understand the harm of smoking more deeply. We have to pay special attention to our younger generation to prevent them from picking up the bad habit of smoking or follow in the footsteps of older smokers."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00609,2018-09-10-T-033,609,Gan Thiam Poh,"I believe that some smokers, influenced by our environment, will see the light sooner or later, and once they understand, they will naturally be determined to abandon this bad habit which is harmful to others and themselves. With all these measures, before long, we will definitely be able to reach a smoking rate below 10%."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00610,2018-09-10-T-033,610,Joan Pereira,"Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I have long been concerned about the dangerous effects of smoking and thus strongly support the amendments to the Bill which I hope will help to reduce the prevalence of smoking."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00611,2018-09-10-T-033,611,Joan Pereira,"Tobacco is a slow and silent killer with an extensive reach. Its fumes blight all who inhale, including unwilling victims through secondhand smoke. Its menace lingers in a vicinity long after the smoker has left, through thirdhand smoke which clings to surfaces, posing a health hazard to anyone exposed to it."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00612,2018-09-10-T-033,612,Joan Pereira,"One of the key amendments in the Bill will allow the Government to designate no-smoking zones (NSZ). I hope in future, we can go even further by turning our entire island into a smoke-free zone where smokers could only smoke in designated smoking areas. Clean, unpolluted air is a precious resource which is everyone’s right."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00613,2018-09-10-T-033,613,Joan Pereira,"Naturally, I also support the move to provide stronger regulatory powers to our enforcement officers to conduct thorough investigations without hindrance, such as the powers of entry and permits to take photographs and videos as part of their inspections."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00614,2018-09-10-T-033,614,Joan Pereira,"Smoking is addictive and harmful. Yet, despite awareness about smoking’s impact on health, a significant number of Singaporeans and residents cannot get rid of their nicotine addiction. Their smoking habit caused much discomfort to those around them. Many residents complain to me about neighbours who smoke. Smoke spreads out from the smokers’ windows and pollute neighbouring homes and the public corridors. Smoking in stairwells and elevators are also a problem. In coffee shops, the fumes from the smokers who sit in the outdoor area blow into the indoor dining area. Some smokers also litter. The cigarette butts are not only dirty and unsanitary, they pose a fire hazard."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00615,2018-09-10-T-033,615,Joan Pereira,"I have a proposal that I hope the Minister can consider. We should forbid the spread of cigarette smoke in residential areas. Anyone who wants to smoke in their homes must ensure that their cigarette smoke does not escape from their apartments and flats to pollute the environment outside their homes. In other words, windows and doors should be closed when smoking. Smokers may consider installing an air filter in their rooms. They should not be standing near the windows, doors or corridors to smoke. If smoke is detected outside of the flat, the resident should then be considered to have violated the law. As a first step, neighbours should try to persuade the neighbours who are smoking to smoke in a more considerate way, either by talking to them directly or through relevant agencies. If it does not work, then they may ask the enforcement officers to step in."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00616,2018-09-10-T-033,616,Joan Pereira,"Another suggestion is to set up a smoking room in a coffee shop near a walkway that is frequently used. Residents complain that on the way to the MRT station, shops or clinic, they have to hold their breath when passing by coffee shops. Setting up smoking rooms in these coffee shops is a win-win solution, allowing smokers and non-smokers to co-exist in harmony."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00617,2018-09-10-T-033,617,Joan Pereira,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00618,2018-09-10-T-033,618,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome the impending changes that will be introduced to the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Amendment Bill. While it may still be a long while before we become a smoke-free society, it is a step forward when we broaden the scope to have more designated no-smoking zones and enhancing the responsibilities as well as enforcement that can be carried out by specific appointed groups beyond the agencies."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00619,2018-09-10-T-033,619,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Second-hand smoke is known to pose health hazard and researchers have shown that it does contain the same harmful chemicals that smokers inhale. There is just no safe level of exposure for second-hand smoke and it is known to cause cancer apart from other health issues.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00620,2018-09-10-T-033,620,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Why then does this become a social issue? Simply because this is a topic beyond personal choices but rather it encompasses infringement of the rights of others. For the young children and those who are non-smokers, they surely have a right of not being constantly exposed to second-hand smoke."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00621,2018-09-10-T-033,621,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Let me cite two examples to illustrate how helpless some people will feel under such circumstances. Both incidents were during my house visits at different locations.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00622,2018-09-10-T-033,622,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"I recalled the first incident was when I was walking down a common corridor at one of the HDB flats. The distinct smell of tobacco was lingering in the air. As I was entering one of the flats, that smell was clearly overpowering over that unit. For a moment, I thought there must be some heavy chain smoker living in that unit. But, that was not the case. The lady owner, a mother of two young children, actually pointed out to me, and had an aggrieved look, when she said this. She said that she she had to seal up all the front windows facing the common corridor, shut her main door and turn on the air-conditioning for many hours each day, whenever her pre-schoolers were at home. She simply had no choice as several members of her immediate neighbouring units are chain smokers. The crux of the issue was her neighbours would not be smoking within their unit and preferred to do so along the common corridor or even along the common staircase."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00623,2018-09-10-T-033,623,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"At another block of flats, other residents raised similar concerns but this time it is about smoking at the stairwell and by non-residents. They have identified some of these smokers as underaged youths and others were tenants who lived in the rented flats. The secondary issue that resulted from their smoking is the random littering of cigarette butts at the stairwell and parapets. Now, the question becomes one of fairness and enforcement. Do the others who are non-smokers have to bear with the inconsiderate actions of the smokers and do the cleaners have to suffer from picking up after the smokers?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00624,2018-09-10-T-033,624,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"With this context in mind and for better understanding of how the amendments will subsequently be instituted, I would like to seek several clarifications from the Minister."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00625,2018-09-10-T-033,625,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"One, what are the public areas in Singapore that will be prioritised by NEA to be designated as no-smoking zones? Can the Minister share the guidelines of how this will be decided?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00626,2018-09-10-T-033,626,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Two, is there a time-frame in which the new no-smoking zones will be implemented throughout Singapore?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00627,2018-09-10-T-033,627,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Three, for residential estates, are we likely to see an increase of designated smoking facilities and what are the guidelines for a smoking facility to be considered complying to acceptable standards?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00628,2018-09-10-T-033,628,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Four, to reduce the probability of secondhand smoke in residential estates, especially the HDB dwellings, will the common staircases and common corridors be marked as no-smoking zone for a start?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00629,2018-09-10-T-033,629,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Five, the Bill stated that a manager of a specified place who fails to ensure that the smoking facility in the specified place complies with the prescribed requirement commits an offence. As these individuals are likely to be the managing agent or volunteers of the MCST, what enforcement powers will be conferred to the individual who is carrying out his or her duties in order to protect them?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00630,2018-09-10-T-033,630,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"And lastly, for implementation of the Bill within the private condominiums after it is enacted, is there a requirement for the MCST to gain consensus and pass resolution for this addition to their by-law before a specific room or place within their compound can be designated as a no-smoking zone? In cases where MCST is unable to gain majority consensus for the resolution, what recourse can members supportive of the Act have?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00631,2018-09-10-T-033,631,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"As reflected in the clarifications that I sought, the implementation will be critical when the Bill is passed. Only time will tell how much effect the Bill will bring about, how smokers and non-smokers can live within the shared spaces, and what pressure will society impress upon smokers as the general population becomes aware of the harmful effects to health."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00632,2018-09-10-T-033,632,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, while I support the Bill, I believe that social responsibilities of individuals have more bearing in improving the situation as there is never sufficient enforcement that can be carried out on the ground. Nevertheless, I look forward to the implementation of the Bill as it will bring about the necessary changes that impacts others on a topic which is not one of preference, but a changing social attitude in our country."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00633,2018-09-10-T-033,633,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to firstly commend the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources as well as the National Environment Agency, for all the efforts thus far in gradually extending smoke-free areas in Singapore. This is clearly not good news to all the smokers but for the majority who crave for clean air wherever they go, the national effort in creating and promoting a smoke-free lifestyle in Singapore is a welcome one."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00634,2018-09-10-T-033,634,Rahayu Mahzam,"I would like to take this opportunity though to convey some of the issues on the ground reflecting the challenges in the enforcement of the Act as it stands, together with the proposed amendments."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00635,2018-09-10-T-033,635,Rahayu Mahzam,"Firstly, a common complaint that many of us, as Members of Parliament, would have received is the feedback on the smoking occurring within residential units. This issue had been discussed in Parliament before was also raised by my colleagues earlier. Smoking within residential homes is understandably not prohibited. In fact, with all the extension of smoke-free areas, the home is probably one of the few spaces left for the smoker to smoke in peace. However, the problem occurs when the resident smokes while standing at his or her window or balcony. The smoke and often, the ash travels to his or her neighbours’ homes. This causes much grievance to other residents in the block."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00636,2018-09-10-T-033,636,Rahayu Mahzam,"I recall that one of my residents who complained about this issue, lamented that; it is ironical that with so much regulation to create smoke-free environment in public spaces, he and his family members are unable to enjoy a smoke-free environment in their own homes. On one occasion, I received a poignant plea from a resident living in a condominium. He is a lung cancer survivor and is naturally concerned about breathing in passive smoke. His neighbour, however, has a habit of smoking at his window. So this resident had to constantly close his windows and stuff cloth at the bottom of his main door, just so that the smoke does not travel into his unit. He begged for the managing agent, MSCT and NEA to intervene. There was little that could be done save for advising and encouraging the neighbour to stop smoking from the window. The situation improved after some time but would recur once in a while. My grassroots leaders and the managing agent would try their best to assist to address the feedback whenever it is raised. But this is clearly not the most ideal resolution of the matter."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00637,2018-09-10-T-033,637,Rahayu Mahzam,"The second issue that I would like to highlight is the lack of cooperation of smokers in the absence of enforcement. From the feedback that I have received on the ground, smokers do not appear to comply with the rules and can be quite defiant when reminded by others not to smoke in certain places. Some can be seen smoking in the parks within the housing estates and when told not to do so by passers-by, will arrogantly state that there is no one around to issue them the summons. I have received this feedback from many residents and friends."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00638,2018-09-10-T-033,638,,"there seems to be a lack of understanding about the rules relating to smoking in sheltered walkways or drop-off points. Some smokers seem to think that when it rains, it is unreasonable to disallow them to smoke in covered spaces when it is raining. I have received feedback from people who see smokers at sheltered walkways during the rain and also appeals from those who feel that they should not be penalised if they were caught smoking while seeking refuge from the rain."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00639,2018-09-10-T-033,639,,"In light of the feedback mentioned above, I believe there is still some way to go for us to look into beefing up enforcement and more importantly, educating people about the efforts in creating a smoke-free environment for all, especially our future generation."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00640,2018-09-10-T-033,640,,"seek some clarification on the current strength of the enforcement team. I note the efforts in recruiting volunteer enforcement officers. I would like to know if there is a sensing of the enforcement capacity required to match the growing smoke-free areas. Would the current capacity be sufficient to deal with the patrolling and enforcement that need to be carried out at the new specified places where smoking will be prohibited? If not, what are the efforts to build on this capacity? Has the current effort in tapping on volunteers been successful?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00641,2018-09-10-T-033,641,,"In relation to the issue of smoking in residential homes, are there any enhancement to rules that could be put in place to regulate conduct of smokers in private spaces which impact on others? I understand that this is extremely difficult to control and there are various views on the matter. There are residents, who feel strongly that there should not be regulation that impinges on what they can or cannot do at home. However, I feel that what needs to be emphasised is the adverse impact to others. In this regard, could we consider some penalties when second-hand tobacco smoke is expelled out of a residential home? I understand that the matter is quite straightforward. For example, the enforcement of this would require evidence which may be tricky to obtain. I feel though, if someone repeatedly commits the offence, it would be possible to track the unit from which the smoke comes from and issue a notice. I also feel that the enforcement approach could be in phases, with an issuance of a warning first. In any case, the legislation would send a strong message about the seriousness of the matter and deter residents from smoking at the windows or balconies."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00642,2018-09-10-T-033,642,,"At the end of the day, I feel that public education is the most important in encouraging people to embrace the importance and value of the smoke-free environment. I truly appreciate the current efforts already in place. One message we could amplify is the impact of smoking on others. Smokers do not appear to appreciate the value of the rules in place but are rather, only triggered by the fear of enforcement. The softer and tandem approach of educating and supporting them to quit smoking should be enhanced and amplified to reach out to more."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00643,2018-09-10-T-033,643,,"I understand that there are many challenges and I truly appreciate the effort and multiple approaches taken by the Ministry and NEA in tackling the issue. Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of this Bill."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00644,2018-09-10-T-033,644,Deputy Speaker,Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00645,2018-09-10-T-033,645,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Members for speaking in support of the Bill. Let me now address their queries in turn."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00646,2018-09-10-T-033,646,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Members have voiced concerns about the harm posed by passive cigarette smoke to vulnerable groups such as the young and the elderly, and asked what more can be done. Some, including Miss Cheryl Chan, have also asked whether more No-Smoking Zones are being planned."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00647,2018-09-10-T-033,647,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The No-Smoking Zone (NSZ) in Orchard Road is a new initiative. We decided on the shopping belt because the area experiences significant and dense pedestrian traffic, and is a site for alfresco activities."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00648,2018-09-10-T-033,648,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Support from stakeholders was another consideration. We had strong backing for our plans from businesses and building owners, led by the Orchard Road Business Association."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00649,2018-09-10-T-033,649,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We also considered the availability of suitable locations for Designated Smoking Areas (DSAs), given that the NSZ would cover a relatively large area with numerous commercial premises. Since 2015, NEA has been working with building owners in Orchard Road to allocate sufficient space for DSAs. Today, about 40 DSAs can be found across the prospective NSZ. As far as possible, these DSAs are located away from the main thoroughfare along Orchard Road, to ensure smoking is contained and not done in clear view of passers-by, especially impressionable youths. This will help protect public health and avoid normalising smoking."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00650,2018-09-10-T-033,650,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Like Ms K Thanaletchimi, I hope that DSAs would become unnecessary one day. But we must be practical in our approach given the large number of visitors and tourists along Orchard Road."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00651,2018-09-10-T-033,651,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Louis Ng suggested a pilot to prohibit smoking while on the move. Once the Orchard Road NSZ is in force, every public place within the zone would be smoking-prohibited, and smokers would not be able to light up while walking along the shopping belt. Outside of the NSZ, smoking is already disallowed in many public places. This includes sheltered pedestrian walkways, overhead bridges, and the corridors of public estates."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00652,2018-09-10-T-033,652,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Our priority is to implement the NSZ well, monitor the outcomes and make any necessary improvements. We will then assess the impact of the Orchard Road NSZ and its DSAs, before considering whether to replicate it elsewhere. The NSZ will be brought into force in the coming months and details will be provided in due course."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00653,2018-09-10-T-033,653,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Louis Ng and Miss Cheryl Chan asked if we plan to provide DSAs in places beyond Orchard Road, such as in our housing estates. Unlike Orchard Road, our heartlands are where our homes and schools are, and where our young children and youths spend their time daily. DSAs typically serve as congregation points for smokers. The daily sight of people gathering to smoke at DSAs at residential areas may give our young the impression that it is normal to smoke. As much as possible, we want to avoid this."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00654,2018-09-10-T-033,654,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Furthermore, given the design of our housing estates where HDB blocks are well-connected and dense, it may be challenging to find suitable locations that ensure that DSAs are not too conspicuous."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00655,2018-09-10-T-033,655,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Hence, our approach has instead been to extend the smoking prohibition to as many areas as possible within housing estates where members of the public frequent, including sheltered walkways, exercise areas and playgrounds. We will continue to monitor and enforce against smoking violations in these areas."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00656,2018-09-10-T-033,656,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Members have also called for restrictions on smoking in homes, including imposing penalties when smoke wafts out of a residential unit. Indeed, indiscriminate smoking can be distressing, and I empathise with all those who are affected."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00657,2018-09-10-T-033,657,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Nevertheless, homes are private spaces; we need to be mindful that not everyone would support the view that the Government should intrude into one’s private space on the issue of smoking. And, indeed, the Member Ms Rahayu had alluded to that earlier. We have witnessed disputes in some private estates over the management committee’s right to prohibit smoking in one’s balcony – a private space. As Mr Ng rightly pointed out, regulation must be balanced against privacy concerns."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00658,2018-09-10-T-033,658,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Moreover, if we were to prohibit smoking in one’s own home, it would inevitably entail bringing to bear the necessary investigation and enforcement powers in our homes. We must not take this lightly. Such an intrusive regulatory approach to tackling neighbourly issues could ultimately be even more detrimental to community harmony and ownership."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00659,2018-09-10-T-033,659,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Ng cited a recent US ban on smoking within public housing estate as an example of how a comparable regime could be implemented in Singapore. The US smoking ban does not apply to all homes, but only to public housing estate for low-income residents, through the imposition of conditions in the tenancy agreements. Tenants who do not wish to comply with the smoking ban may have to look for alternative housing. The context of the US smoking ban is very different and we do need to consider our local circumstances before adapting practices from abroad."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00660,2018-09-10-T-033,660,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have been pro-actively addressing second-hand smoke in our housing estates. Over the years, we have disallowed smoking at common areas, including at the lift lobbies, corridors and staircase landings. In response to Ms Rahayu Mahzam’s comment that there is a lack of understanding about the rules relating to smoking in sheltered walkways or drop-off points, especially during rain, we would like to clarify that the smoking prohibition applies regardless of the weather."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00661,2018-09-10-T-033,661,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Ultimately, living in the community is about give and take. I urge all smokers to be considerate and to refrain from smoking in a way that would negatively affect others. Families and friends of the smokers as well as the public, in general, could help to reinforce the right social norms, through nudges and reminders, in order to help address this issue. In the spirit of good neighbourliness, we should try to understand one another’s concerns, communicate and resolve disputes amicably. If professional assistance is required, residents can approach the Community Mediation Centre."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00662,2018-09-10-T-033,662,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Ms Rahayu Mahzam highlighted the frustrations of non-smokers faced with inconsiderate smokers around their neighbourhood. They have asked about enforcement capacity, and how we plan to make enforcement more effective and efficient in light of the growing number of smoke-free places."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00663,2018-09-10-T-033,663,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"NEA has been engaging business owners about the Orchard Road NSZ, and will calibrate its enforcement capacity according to the situation on the ground."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00664,2018-09-10-T-033,664,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Enforcement is necessary, but not the silver bullet. Instead, our deeper aim is to foster social norms that promote health and well-being. We need the community to help us remind smokers where they should not be smoking. Smokers must also play their part and be mindful of those around them before lighting up."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00665,2018-09-10-T-033,665,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Ms Thanaletchimi also asked how technology can be further leveraged to facilitate reporting of unlawful smoking and errant managers. Members of the public can notify NEA about smoking violations through the myENV and OneService mobile applications.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00666,2018-09-10-T-033,666,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"NEA is also exploring the use of thermal cameras to deter indiscriminate smoking, such as the one that Miss Cheryl Chan raised earlier, especially at corridors, lift lobbies and staircase landings, which other Members had also raised. These cameras are equipped with heat-detection capabilities that can detect smoking activity and can be operated remotely. When deployed, these cameras will be able to capture images of the smoking infringement and facilitate NEA’s investigations."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00667,2018-09-10-T-033,667,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In response to Ms Rahayu Mahzam’s question whether the Community Volunteer programme has enhanced enforcement of the smoking prohibition, let me clarify that the Community Volunteers (CVs) are not deployed to supplement NEA’s enforcement officers."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00668,2018-09-10-T-033,668,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The CVs’ primary role is to educate environmental offenders and promote environmental consciousness in the community. CVs can only ask for the particulars of uncooperative offenders and can give the information to NEA for investigation. CVs have been deployed in Orchard Road to raise awareness of the upcoming NSZ and help ease smokers into the regime when it comes into operation.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00669,2018-09-10-T-033,669,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"These efforts should also go some way in minimising smoking violations within the newly prohibited places, a concern raised by Ms Thanaletchimi."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00670,2018-09-10-T-033,670,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We should adopt a whole-of-society approach towards encouraging gracious behaviour. This way, we can all enjoy clean air in the shared spaces around us, while building a stronger community. I agree with Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Ms Thanaletchimi that public education is a critical plank in our efforts to create a smoke-free environment, and we will explore ways to further enhance that."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00671,2018-09-10-T-033,671,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Beyond encouraging smokers to be considerate, we also want to help them quit smoking. The Health Promotion Board will expand its outreach and support network through its ""I Quit"" campaign. The campaign will raise awareness about the harms of smoking, and encourage smokers to kick the habit for the sake of their families."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00672,2018-09-10-T-033,672,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Ms Joan Pereira suggested providing smoking rooms in premises such as office buildings, public facilities, and coffee shops. While smoking rooms may reduce exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, they cannot eliminate it completely. The smoke can still seep into other parts of the building where people do not smoke. Hence, we have restricted where and how smoking rooms can be set up."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00673,2018-09-10-T-033,673,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Smoking rooms are only allowed in certain premises such as office buildings and public entertainment outlets. However, the smoking room has to meet requirements such as having separate ventilation and must not be used by any employee for work."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00674,2018-09-10-T-033,674,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Ng and Ms Chan asked about the guidelines for smoking facilities. Within the Orchard Road NSZ, a DSA must be demarcated clearly and be provided with at least one cigarette waste bin. The DSA must not be located where smoking is currently prohibited and must not obstruct public walkways or cause disamenities. An example of a DSA that complies with these requirements is the one located at Far East Shopping Centre currently. There, the DSA is inconspicuously located at a distance from the pedestrian thoroughfare and in the open, so second-hand smoke does not accumulate."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00675,2018-09-10-T-033,675,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked that time be given to managers who are required to set up smoking facilities. NEA will give sufficient notice to the manager of a place to set up any DSA. In fact, businesses and premises owners have worked with NEA to identify suitable locations for DSAs since 2017, ahead of the establishment of the Orchard Road NSZ."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00676,2018-09-10-T-033,676,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In the case of smoking facilities located within food establishments such as coffee shops, I would like to update Mr Ng and Ms Pereira that since June 2017, smoking corners have been disallowed in new food establishments across the island. When the Orchard Road NSZ comes into effect, outdoor smoking areas at food establishments within the NSZ will also have to close. Existing food establishments that change hands and are issued a new licence would similarly have to remove their smoking corners. We have taken these steps to increasingly create a smoke-free dining experience for everyone."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00677,2018-09-10-T-033,677,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Louis Ng asked about the rationale for the provisions on enforcement powers. The new section 4A gives NEA the powers to enter and inspect smoking-prohibited premises, as not all of these premises are freely accessible to the public."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00678,2018-09-10-T-033,678,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I mentioned earlier, NEA has, at times, encountered challenges in investigating complaints about smoking in certain smoking-prohibited premises, such as at pubs and bars, where uncooperative managers have denied entry by NEA's officers. Managers who refuse NEA entry would now be liable for an offence under the new section 4B. These provisions will deter managers from obstructing or hindering NEA's officers discharging their duties to safeguard public health, and reduce abortive enforcement work."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00679,2018-09-10-T-033,679,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Nonetheless, the powers of entry will be exercised judiciously by trained and authorised officers. I have earlier set out the restrictions on the exercise of the powers of entry. The new section 4A also does not allow authorised officers to make forcible entry under any circumstances. The powers can only be exercised for the purposes of the Act, namely, to enforce the smoking prohibition."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00680,2018-09-10-T-033,680,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Authorised officers would only be allowed to take possession of materials related to the suspected offence. In practice, we will ensure that only officers directly investigating the case may access the evidence."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00681,2018-09-10-T-033,681,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"These amendments will also underscore our firm stance against abuse and threats made against our officers. Those found guilty of such acts will face fines of up to $2,000 for a first offence, and $5,000 for a second or subsequent offence, or a maximum of three months' imprisonment, or both. Similar obstruction provisions and penalties are also found in other laws, such as the Environmental Public Health Act or EPHA administered by NEA. Under the EPHA, any person who obstructs or hinders an authorised officer in the performance of his duties under the Act will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000, and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or both. We will regularly review the penalty for breaches to the Act, as suggested by Ms Thanaletchimi."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00682,2018-09-10-T-033,682,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Last year, NEA issued 22,000 tickets for smoking, and there are calls from Members for NEA to be even more active and responsive in undertaking its enforcement duties. Taken together, these provisions will serve to enhance NEA's operational effectiveness and efficiency in discharging its responsibilities."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00683,2018-09-10-T-033,683,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Ms Chan asked whether MCSTs have to pass a by-law to disallow smoking within the compound of private condominiums. The answer is no. Smoking is already prohibited in the common areas of private estates, including the lift lobby, void decks and common function rooms. So, no by-law is required to prohibit smoking in these areas."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00684,2018-09-10-T-033,684,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding Er Dr Lee's proposal to restrict the sales volume of cigarettes and increase the tax on tobacco, I will convey her suggestions to my MOH and MOF colleagues administering the tobacco excise regime for them to consider."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00685,2018-09-10-T-033,685,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill marks an important step towards our smoke-free vision. The Orchard Road NSZ will ensure a clean and healthy environment for shoppers and visitors. We have come a long way, and many segments of society support our push for a healthier living environment."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00686,2018-09-10-T-033,686,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Smoking habits, however, are hard to break, and we must persevere in helping those who are trying their best to quit smoking. The Government will persist in our efforts to control access to tobacco products and discourage smoking through a combination of fiscal, regulatory and educational measures."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00687,2018-09-10-T-033,687,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"However, these efforts alone are insufficient, without the help of the community. Families and friends should give smokers emotional and psychological support to kick the habit."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00688,2018-09-10-T-033,688,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Orchard Road NSZ represents our commitment to safeguarding the health of the community. I hope smokers will also support our efforts to maintain a conducive environment for all.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00689,2018-09-10-T-033,689,,Er Dr Lee.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00690,2018-09-10-T-033,690,Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Sir. I have four supplementary questions. I would like to inform the Senior Minister of State that you can expand non-smoking areas but because of a lack enforcement, you will not see the end result that you wanted. Perhaps, we can consider putting up designated smoking points (DSPs), like what we have done in Nee Soon South because I see that there are more and more smokers who go use and use the DSPs."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00691,2018-09-10-T-033,691,Lee Bee Wah,"My second question is, smoking in the presence of young children at home. Sometimes, I see parents smoking in front of children who are very young, crawling on the floor. Is there anything that we can do to help these young children because they are taking in second-hand smoke every day?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00692,2018-09-10-T-033,692,Lee Bee Wah,The third question is on thermal camera. I would like to ask how many does the Ministry have and when can they be deployed. I am very keen on that.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00693,2018-09-10-T-033,693,Lee Bee Wah,The last question I would like to ask is  how to enforce non-smoking at common areas in condominiums because your officers will not be able to go in?
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00694,2018-09-10-T-033,694,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For setting up of more DSPs, to the Member's comment about if we have an NSZ and they do not comply, then it will not be effective, I think it is precisely because of this that we are only implementing the NSZ first in Orchard Road because we want to monitor the outcomes. For instance, we want to ensure that there is high compliance and that the DSAs are appropriately used. The locations of the DSAs will also be important – how they are designed and so on. So, that is the reason why we are saying that we will implement at the Orchard Road area first. We will look at it before we decide if we will replicate this."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00695,2018-09-10-T-033,695,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding setting up more DSPs, as I have noted earlier, if you are talking about in housing estates, I think one of the issues to us is really that because of the density of housing estates, for instance, and the fact that housing estates are where the schools are, where the homes are, there is a challenge, in fact, with implementing DSAs in this area because you need to look at locations. It cannot be too conspicuous – you do not want to normalise smoking amongst children because DSAs are the areas where people congregate, and so on. And that is why our approach, as of now, is to increase the number of smoking prohibited areas even within our residential estates – sheltered walkways, playgrounds, common corridors, lift landings and lobbies. And in fact, there are very few areas like Ms Rahayu Mahzam said, where they can smoke. One of them would be in their homes. But we take the Member's point. As I said, we will monitor the outcome of the Orchard Road NSZ before we decide if we will be expanding."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00696,2018-09-10-T-033,696,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding protection of young children of smokers, I think we need to strike a balance between forcing our values and norms on the parents, and the parents do have a duty and responsibility to protect their own young. And I think what we all can do, as I have said, is through education, raising awareness, appealing to the smokers, to their families, their friends, their loved ones and the community to inculcate positive social norms, and to ask them to spare a thought for their loved ones – their children and others around them when they smoke, and to smoke in a considerate manner."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00697,2018-09-10-T-033,697,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding thermal cameras, we are not acquiring the thermal cameras ourselves. We have called a tender to get third party contractor to provide the service. So, we are actually buying service. But these thermal cameras have video analytic capabilities and what they will do is that they will detect any strong heat emitted from the object and then they will be able to capture images of the smoking offence. That will enable NEA to use these images to further investigate the alleged offence."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00698,2018-09-10-T-033,698,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"And we will contract the services such that we can deploy the cameras, the services where it is needed. Not yet. So, we have called for a tender and we are evaluating the tender."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00699,2018-09-10-T-033,699,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"What was the Member's last question? In fact, this is precisely why we have amended the Act. Section 4 actually explicitly allows NEA officers to enter, inspect, investigate in common areas which are smoking prohibited areas of private residential estates when they reasonably believe that there is an offence being committed or had been committed there, or that there is evidence that a smoking offence has been committed. So, for instance, if a member of the public calls up to say that there is smoking violation, NEA officers can actually enter."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00700,2018-09-10-T-033,700,,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00701,2018-09-10-T-033,701,Liang Eng Hwa,"Thank you, Sir. I want to take this opportunity to thank the NEA officers for carrying out those enforcement actions, often in very difficult circumstances."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00702,2018-09-10-T-033,702,Liang Eng Hwa,"I want to ask the Senior Minister of State, she mentioned that we are expanding – there will be more areas prohibited for smoking. And, even as we expand these areas, I want to ask the Senior Minister of State whether, are there plans to step up or expand the enforcement team, whether there is enough manpower on the ground to do it. Otherwise, there is no deterrent. And also, whether there are investment into surveillance equipment to also step up the enforcement there."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00703,2018-09-10-T-033,703,Liang Eng Hwa,"Secondly, the Senior Minister of State talked about smokers who smoke at home. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether there are indeed more smokers now smoking at home. And, is that because of more areas that are prohibited from smoking and therefore, many of them have moved back to their homes and smoke and therefore, cause other externalities to their neighbours and so on."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00704,2018-09-10-T-033,704,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to enforcement, as I have said, for the Orchard Road NSZ, we will monitor the situation when the NSZ comes into force and then, we will calibrate our enforcement capacity. But actually, over the years, we have increased the number of enforcement officers, because of the expansion in the smoking prohibited places. Having said that, realistically, there is a limit as to the number of enforcement officers or manpower we can expand especially faced with our manpower constraints due to an ageing population. The Member is right to say that we would also have to depend on technology, and earlier, I did mention that we are now looking – in fact, we had called for a tender – to use thermal cameras with regard to smoking offence or smoking violations, say, at lift lobbies, staircase landings, and so on, to help us with our enforcement."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00705,2018-09-10-T-033,705,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"At the end of the day, as I have said many times in my speech that we need the community to come together to help us with this. So this amendment to this Act will also explicitly require the managers to be accountable, to be responsible for their premises, to ask the smoking offender to stop smoking or to leave their premises. We cannot be expected to be at every of the 32,000 smoking prohibited places, or to respond to every feedback immediately. And we need the community to help us, including getting the smokers to smoke more considerately and stop smoking if they can."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00706,2018-09-10-T-033,706,Amy Khor Lean Suan,What is the second question?
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00707,2018-09-10-T-033,707,Liang Eng Hwa,Smoking in the home.
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00708,2018-09-10-T-033,708,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Okay. Our smoking rate has come down. I think, earlier in my opening speech, I said that as last year, it is 12%. It has come down from 23% long time ago to about 14% and then 12%. So, in total, smoking rate has gone down. And by inference, that would likely mean that there ought not to be more people smoking at home."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00709,2018-09-10-T-033,709,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Having said that, in every case of smoke wafting into a neighbour's house, it is distressful to the person. People may also be a lot more sensitive about second-hand smoke. But actually according to our records, the numbers have not increased. In fact, we have actually seen some decrease in the number of feedback we have received about smoke wafting into a neighbour's house."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00710,2018-09-10-T-033,710,Deputy Speaker,"Er Dr Lee, last clarification."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00711,2018-09-10-T-033,711,Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Sir. I have two supplementary questions. I agree that the community plays a great role in this. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether there is any plan to step up education in schools. Are there plans to work with MOE to step up education in schools?"
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00712,2018-09-10-T-033,712,Lee Bee Wah,"And the second question is how many community volunteers (CV) are there currently and whether there is any target or any plan to train more CVs, because I do not see that this being actively promoted."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00713,2018-09-10-T-033,713,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding the first question on education, we will continue to work with HPB and MOE on ways to enhance our education outreach to the young, as well as to the population in general."
2018-09-10-T-033-S-00714,2018-09-10-T-033,714,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding the CVs, we currently have about 400 CVs who are trained. We have no target for CVs, but we need to ensure that we have suitable people who join us as community volunteers. So, they will be trained."

2018-09-10-T-034-S-00720,2018-09-10-T-034,720,Deputy Speaker,Leader of the House.
2018-09-10-T-034-S-00721,2018-09-10-T-034,721,Grace Fu Hai Yien,May I make a short speech before I move the motion of adjournment of Parliament today.
2018-09-10-T-034-S-00722,2018-09-10-T-034,722,Deputy Speaker,Please proceed.
2018-09-10-T-034-S-00723,2018-09-10-T-034,723,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the term of office of the Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) is coming to an end. On behalf of the House, I would like to thank the nine NMPs for their contributions. They are  Mr Azmoon Bin Ahmad, Mr Ganesh Rajaram, Mr Kok Heng Leun, Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan, and Ms K Thanaletchimi, for serving one term. Ms Chia Yong Yong, Mr Thomas Chua, Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin and Assoc Prof Randolph Tan for serving two terms."
2018-09-10-T-034-S-00724,2018-09-10-T-034,724,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The NMP scheme was introduced in 1990 to provide a wider range of views and perspectives in Parliament. The NMPs represent diverse groups of Singaporeans and with their views presented in Parliament, they have added to the robustness of the debates and contributed towards better decision-making in this House. In recent years, our electorate has taken an interest in a broader range of concerns and there have been new viewpoints and alternative approaches on the issues debated. Our NMPs have done well in articulating these perspectives and representing different citizen segments."
2018-09-10-T-034-S-00725,2018-09-10-T-034,725,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The NMPs have brought attention to a wide range of issues, including workplace harassment, criminal justice and Muslim inheritance laws. They have also raised thoughtful suggestions on how we can adapt to the demands of a global economy and ensure that SMEs can thrive amidst economic restructuring. Other social issues have also been discussed, including income inequality and freedom for artistic expression in public spaces."
2018-09-10-T-034-S-00726,2018-09-10-T-034,726,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"While each NMP has specific concerns and areas of expertise, they have also collaborated on issues of common concern. In July 2018, five NMPs proposed the motion Education for our Future. Together, they called for the Government to ensure that the education system was accessible and inclusive for all learners. They made passionate and heartfelt speeches on important topics, such as social mobility within the education system, sports education and national examinations."
2018-09-10-T-034-S-00727,2018-09-10-T-034,727,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"While the NMPs have presented their views respectfully, they have not shirked from challenging the status quo. They have contributed to healthy debates in our Parliament, which is necessary when setting the direction for Singapore in our complex and challenging environment."
2018-09-10-T-034-S-00728,2018-09-10-T-034,728,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the NMPs have embodied the spirit of Parliament, putting Singapore and Singaporeans first. On behalf of the House, I would like to thank them for their valuable contributions to Parliament. [Applause]"
2018-09-10-T-034-S-00729,2018-09-10-T-034,729,Deputy Speaker,"Indeed, I believe all Members of the House will join the Leader in thanking all the nine NMPs for their participation and contributions to the robust debate in Parliament. Thank you very much."

2018-09-10-T-036-S-00733,2018-09-10-T-036,733,Kok Heng Leun,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Before I speak, I would like to say this on behalf of all my NMP colleagues. We were talking about it. We would also like to express our thanks to the House, to the Government and to all our fellow parliamentarians for your patience, for your generosity. Through all these debates, we have actually felt that it was a very, very enriching experience. Thank you very much. ["
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00734,2018-09-10-T-036,734,Kok Heng Leun,"Now, I can give my speech."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00735,2018-09-10-T-036,735,Deputy Speaker,"<span style=""color  rgb(51, 51, 51);""> Thirty seconds have gone and have been lost.</span>  Thirty seconds have gone and have been lost."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00736,2018-09-10-T-036,736,Kok Heng Leun,"Art is art. We are familiar with art when it is ""art"". We understand them sometimes as something material, like a painting, a sculpture, or an installation, or an event over a specific time, like a performance or movie screening. We are familiar with these arts being produced and presented in conventional spaces, such as theatre, gallery spaces, cinemas, screening rooms, studios and so on. Of course, there are occasions when these works are presented in alternative spaces. But there are also defined spaces, like in a church, in a quarry or in a cemetery."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00737,2018-09-10-T-036,737,Kok Heng Leun,"Purpose-built art spaces are crucial – like Esplanade, National Gallery Singapore, Singapore Arts Museum, The Substation, Centre 42, amongst others. These are privately-managed public spaces, providing focused spaces for developing and appreciating artistic expression. They congregate audiences and supporters of the arts, therefore creating also a sense of community. They have become iconic sites and attractions in their own right, not only for locals, but also for visitors from the region and abroad who are interested in finding out what our artistic community is doing."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00738,2018-09-10-T-036,738,Kok Heng Leun,But art is not just what occurs in these spaces. Human capacity for expression is not limited to just these spaces. Art is not just artifice – which it also can be – it is also about life.
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00739,2018-09-10-T-036,739,Kok Heng Leun,"When artists take art beyond conventional spaces, they seek to engage with the expressions of the everyday and in sites of the everyday. Here, the gestures and relationships of our everyday spaces and activities become the material of art."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00740,2018-09-10-T-036,740,Kok Heng Leun,"Art as life help us to understand ourselves, allow us to reinvent ourselves. When art happens in everyday places, the space and the gesture, the expression, all become a curios. This distancing, what we call an aesthetic distancing, stimulates queries, investigation, reflections and in many occasions, even actions to realise the reinvention."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00741,2018-09-10-T-036,741,Kok Heng Leun,"Such art practice interrogates our everyday being. It comes with some inconvenience, but necessary to stimulate our creative and imaginative being. As I have said before, creativity comes from ruptures, from interventions, from challenging norms, perceived notions and habits. And when such art practices happen in everyday spaces, it becomes all the more immediate, because everyday places are public space that allows people to interact and be in communal with one another."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00742,2018-09-10-T-036,742,Kok Heng Leun,"As a small nation city, we have quite a substantial population, we have a lot of built-up areas – flats, huge shopping centres, office buildings – and with so much focus on economic and consumeristic activities and successes, public spaces for everyday interaction and communal engagement are important. As Peter G Rowe, a Professor at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design said, “[A sense of community] makes me feel as though I’m part of a human race, not the rat race!”"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00743,2018-09-10-T-036,743,Kok Heng Leun,"When familiar everyday space is filled with excitement and surprises, one becomes rejuvenated and excited. One becomes attentive to things around us, not taking them for granted. Hence arts as life, in everyday places, is one important way to re-connect to our spontaneity, to re-discover our curiosity, to repair our relationships with space, things and people."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00744,2018-09-10-T-036,744,Kok Heng Leun,"And now, I will talk about permits and permission related to the using of this space. But first, let me recall, my early years when I was working at The Substation, founded by Mr Kuo Pao Kun. By the way, today is the 16th death anniversary of Mr Kuo. The Substation is also called ""The Home for the Arts"". And indeed it is a home for many artists and many different arts practices."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00745,2018-09-10-T-036,745,Kok Heng Leun,"There was this sense of free-spirit where conversations flows, things happen. It is a place that celebrates spontaneity, respect artists and their work. It also respects audience by honouring them as individuals who are generous even when they may have different tastes in and preferences on art. I would like to focus on the Substation Garden which is an outdoor space of The Substation where public would come, artists would gather. Hence, it is a public space."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00746,2018-09-10-T-036,746,Kok Heng Leun,"On a busy night, there would be a set-up in the garden to prep for a performance or a hard rock gig with very noisy sound tests. There will be people after watching a piece of theater in the Black Box, they will be gathering in the Garden, discussing what they saw, debating what they liked or disliked, expressing their frustration over some impenetrable work."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00747,2018-09-10-T-036,747,,"<span style=""color  rgb(51, 51, 51);"">would be at the Garden, probably talking to each other after a conference, while some people may be practising on their guitars, or basker Roy Payamal would be practising his juggling skill in the Garden.</span> In the same Garden, artists like Zai Kuning, Tang Da Wu, Amanda Heng, or academics like Lai Ah Eng"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00748,2018-09-10-T-036,748,,"Street performing artist Roy did not need to ask permission to practise at the Garden. Roy made sure that when ever his juggling ball flew out of his hand, crossing the path of anyone there, he would pick it up, and in his very gentle manner, would smile apologetically."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00749,2018-09-10-T-036,749,,"Why did I take such pain to describe The Substation Garden? Because it was here, that I learnt about what makes a space, a place and what makes a good public space. Here I learnt to debate, to listen, to know that there are so many art forms, so many possible artistic practices, so many different opinions that it is important not to judge, but to know that we are all different – we have different opinions and we can co-exist."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00750,2018-09-10-T-036,750,,"The Garden was a place that need no permissions. In fact, many years later, I realised that the people who used the Garden, whether the artist or the audience, gave permission to each other to try things, to be different, to disagree, to agree, and most importantly, to gather. That is why it became such an amazing public space for artists and audience. And I do not remember me, being an arts administrator there managing the Garden, having to do any policing."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00751,2018-09-10-T-036,751,,"Now, on the point of permits and permission, within conventional spaces, certain conditions of the space and use may already determine how art is developed or presented. I have to say that it is to the credit of some of these arts public institutions, like Esplanade, National Gallery, who have gone the extra mile, to reach out to audience, to place-make these public spaces."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00752,2018-09-10-T-036,752,,"However, would these huge public institutions, where artists gather, where artists would meet and talk about ideas, allow people to be spontaneous? What if when dancers, while discussing their future work at the foyer, start to move to demonstrate ideas, then followed by some improvisations that come along in response to the movements? Would this be allowed in such institutions?"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00753,2018-09-10-T-036,753,,I have checked with some of the artists and there are stories where they told me that they would be stopped by the security guards. And the reasons cited would be such activities or behaviour would create disturbances to other visitors.
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00754,2018-09-10-T-036,754,,"Have we become over-zealous in our effort to make sure that these public spaces are well kept, thereby taking away the spirit of spontaneity of an artistic space? That is an irony indeed."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00755,2018-09-10-T-036,755,,"So, how can these privately owned public institutions allow such spontaneity?"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00756,2018-09-10-T-036,756,,"What about the use of everyday spaces for the arts? There are permits and laws that prohibit certain kinds of activities or expressions, such as the Public Order Act, Public Disturbance, Obscenity Act, and so on."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00757,2018-09-10-T-036,757,,"These laws do articulate, to an extent and to a measure of certainty and interpretation, the scope of what is legal, or permitted by the authorities."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00758,2018-09-10-T-036,758,,"But let us consider a hypothetical situation. On a weekday night, a musician outside Toa Payoh Library – you know there is big square there – practising his guitar. His skill was so good that he attracted people gathering around him. He responded because it was fun and he asked them to start to move and dance. So, people gathered. Is this permissible?"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00759,2018-09-10-T-036,759,,"People may say that this is a hypothetical situation and Singaporeans are not so spontaneous. I disagree and agree. I disagree because after many years of artistic practices in public space, I find that Singaporeans want to tell their stories. They want to express and connect with artists. That desire is innate, deeply human, to be with each other, to do things spontaneously. In the early years of our forum theatre performances, we have to beg people to come up to make interventions or to expect our friends to come up to make interventions. But now, people, audiences, come up voluntarily. When we set up tables for conversations on end-of-life issues, people would sit and share and will not stop until we tell them that we have to end by 10.00 pm, because that is stipulated in our performance licence."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00760,2018-09-10-T-036,760,,"Yet, I also would agree that Singaporeans are not so spontaneous because I think we have been culturally and politically conditioned to be cautious. The many laws, like Public Order Act, that caution people from gathering, from getting together for a cause, permits and permissions needed to express, to perform, all these narratives of Singapore need to be orderly has conditioned our mindset, inhibiting us. Making us fearful of being spontaneous  what if I break the law, what if people get offended, what if people complain? And many, many ""what ifs""."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00761,2018-09-10-T-036,761,,"Deputy Speaker, there are a lot of instances where art works well in public and everyday spaces. Forum theatre in heartlands dealing with difficult issues, like end-of-life concerns, discriminations of migrant workers, domestic violence, all these have happened in public spaces without incidents. In one of our recent works, THE LESSON, which talked about how one makes difficult choices on land issues and what is a democratic process, people stayed to participate, debate and are respectful of each other."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00762,2018-09-10-T-036,762,,"Crowd events such as Night Fest and so on, where there certainly is not a high ratio of security for the crowd it attracts, would go on peacefully. I would say that the populace knows how to experience and understand art in these places."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00763,2018-09-10-T-036,763,,"Can art happen beyond the 30 places prescribed by the Government? Only when art can happen in ordinary and every day places, then can we claim, as in the ACSR report, that art is everywhere."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00764,2018-09-10-T-036,764,,Then there is still the question of what kind of work is permitted and who can decide them.
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00765,2018-09-10-T-036,765,,"In the case of artistic expression, is it aesthetic, which can be subjective; moral, which has a level of subjectivity too, and which has certain aspects covered under legal terms; or political, which should be distinguished from legal? What are all these considerations that help decide if that work can be done in public or in everyday spaces? What if there was a case where an artistic expression does not flout the law? Should or then can it be permissible by default? Or if a permission were sought for such an artistic expression that does not flout the law, would it be granted?"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00766,2018-09-10-T-036,766,,"If a group had applied for a licence to blindfold themselves and sit in the train silently, holding the book ""This Is What Inequality Looks Like"" would that be permitted? Would it also be allowed if it is done without applying for permit and licence? It is a quiet piece; it does not create any disturbances; it is performance art in the public."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00767,2018-09-10-T-036,767,,"What if there are some complaints from certain members of the public to the work? Does it then mean that it should be taken down, or the performance being stopped?"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00768,2018-09-10-T-036,768,,"Can an individual or a group who disagrees with a particular artistic work or message, then advocate for it to be removed in the name of it being in the public space? So, who is this public? What is this public space for? For which public?"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00769,2018-09-10-T-036,769,,"The right to a city, this is an idea proposed by French sociologist who talks about if a city, which also include the public space, is meant for public, it should be safe and permissible for everyone to be there, to interact, to exchange information and ideas, as long as the exchange does not incinerate and create disorder. That is a right to the city, a right for everyone."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00770,2018-09-10-T-036,770,,"So, what should we do if there are complaints about artistic work being placed in public space? Let me quote from ACSR, page 18"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00771,2018-09-10-T-036,771,,"“There is a scope to let the community take greater ownership of our arts and culture activities, facilities and development, in order to harness Singapore's creative capacity. Unfortunately, much of our cultural development is currently perceived as being directed 'top-down'. Our people need more space and support to initiate artistic and cultural activities from the ground-up, with the Government playing a more catalytic role in facilitating connections and allowing emergent subcultures and creative communities to thrive.”"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00772,2018-09-10-T-036,772,,"I support the Government in this vision but we know that while we are at the infancy of this development. There have been disputes and disagreement. The Golden Staircase, Mr Oh’s installation at the void deck in Chong Pang, amongst others. So, here I would humbly like to propose that the Government should form an independent body, almost like an ombudsman, to look at such disagreement. The independent body should include legal experts, artistic personnel and various stakeholders to address these disagreement, to investigate complaints, but importantly to set up dialogues and conversations between complainants and the artists. This is how public space should be managed. It is about dialogues, sometimes with disagreement, but the intention is to include, not to exclude."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00773,2018-09-10-T-036,773,,"I would like to end my speech on this issue of trust. I hope that this Government would trust that artists in Singapore are very responsible people. A lot of time when they make work, they do works that are personal with a lot of committed beliefs."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00774,2018-09-10-T-036,774,,"When we talk about earning trust, it is not just about sitting there and say, ""Hey, show me you can be trusted"". It means one needs to reach out to connect in order to express trust. The public space, being a space where strangers meet strangers, means we have to be able to trust by connecting and not by segregating or being territorial or tribal."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00775,2018-09-10-T-036,775,,"Any honest and truthful artist work on trust. Why? Because without which they would not put their artworks in the public, to be critiqued, to be judged. An artwork is a personal and deep expression of self and to show it to public, one must trust the audience. It is this gesture of faith in our capacity as artists, as human beings, that we want to reach out to people, and to hear and get their response."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00776,2018-09-10-T-036,776,,"Artists have great faith in audiences. Likewise, I hope the audience, the public, the Government, everyone, would have the same faith in the artists. Art practices in everyday spaces, is an expression of this trust and this connection."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00777,2018-09-10-T-036,777,Deputy Speaker,"Thank you, Mr Kok. I am glad I did not have to guillotine you. Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, Ms Grace Fu."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00778,2018-09-10-T-036,778,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Mr Kok for his observations and suggestions to increase artistic expression and engagement in Singapore."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00779,2018-09-10-T-036,779,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Kok referred to the many opportunities for art in public spaces beyond the conventional gallery, theatre or studio. In fact, he has mentioned several examples of how forum theatre has been able to engage the public in multiple locations in Singapore, having good engagement on topics that can be difficult, can be emotional and sensitive at times. That is, in fact, the best testament of how art has been able to be carried out in public with trust, with good conversations and with mutual understanding. So, I am glad that he is indeed affirming that this has taken place in Singapore."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00780,2018-09-10-T-036,780,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"He also noted that the Singapore Night Festival organised by the National Heritage Board has done well to balance accessibility and security. I agree with Mr Kok that Singapore’s arts and culture scene, including art in our public spaces, is indeed vibrant and thriving. Aside from the Night Festival, there are many, many other opportunities for Singaporeans to enjoy art in everyday spaces in the city centre, as well as in our heartlands. These include NHB’s Singapore Heritage Festival, National Gallery Singapore’s Light to Night, the National Arts Council’s (NAC’s) Arts in Your Neighbourhood, and People Association (PA)’s PAssionArts. I am sure PAssionArts is quite familiar to many of the Members sitting around the House, because it is taking place in every constituency in Singapore - in everyday spaces, in hawker centres, in void decks, in community centres, in parks. These offerings are part of the over 100 arts and cultural events available each day, and which 74% of Singaporeans agreed that they were proud of in the 2015 Population Survey on the Arts."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00781,2018-09-10-T-036,781,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Kok also spoke about the spaces that are currently available for public art. The Government has embarked on a variety of efforts to increase public art over the last 30 years. These include the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Public Sculpture Masterplan and Art Incentive Scheme, the Land Transport Authority’s Art in Transit Programme, NHB’s Public Art Tax Incentive Scheme, and the NAC’s establishment of the Public Art Trust (PAT) in 2014 with a $10 million seed fund from the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY). Under NAC’s Busking Scheme, over 250 buskers have been endorsed since 2017. They include the father and son duo, Mr Mashruddin Saharuddin and Nizaruddin, who were featured at this year’s National Day Parade, and whose performances have enlivened city life and energised urban spaces."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00782,2018-09-10-T-036,782,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I am pleased to update that NAC has secured over 50 sites around Singapore for public art, from a shophouse wall in Boat Quay to an open area near an HDB block in Tampines. NAC will continue to identify more of such spaces, and work with site owners to make them available for artists to showcase their work. Together with spaces for street art at Goodman Arts Centre, Aliwal Arts Centre, and *SCAPE, these sites will help augment our arts and cultural offerings, and add vibrancy to our city."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00783,2018-09-10-T-036,783,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"MCCY remains committed to making the arts and culture accessible to everyone, and to working closely in partnership with arts practitioners as well as enthusiasts, hobbyists and volunteers. We want to create an environment where more Singaporeans, and not only trained artists, can appreciate and participate in the arts, so that the arts are an integral part of all our lives."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00784,2018-09-10-T-036,784,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In 2017, PAssionArts involved some 50,000 art participants and volunteers, about 30 arts groups and 300 organisations, including schools, voluntary welfare organisations, religious groups, community groups, and hospitals in more than 65 heartland locations. At this year's PAssionArts Festival in July and August, a memorable experience was the Animal Art workshop where three-generational families and neighbours came together to create and paint on wooden planks. And this is an example of how art in everyday spaces, in everyday places, and in everyday lives, can help build the connections which Mr Kok referred to, and which my Ministry also seeks to develop between Singaporeans."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00785,2018-09-10-T-036,785,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We are also stepping up efforts to engage our youths who are the future generation of artists, patrons and supporters of the arts. To do this, we provide opportunities for talented youths to showcase their work. At the recent Night Festival, I had the pleasure of interacting with two groups involving students from the Singapore University of Technology and Design and their work – Hyperbands by Kopi/O and Orbit by LiteWerkz. Their enthusiasm demonstrated how we must continue to support our youth in pursuing their passions, including by expressing themselves and showcasing a part of our Singaporean identity through the arts."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00786,2018-09-10-T-036,786,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Government supports art in everyday spaces because we are aware of its ability to shape common experiences and to spark shared interests. And if done well, this can help Singaporeans develop stronger bonds, and bring us together as a people."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00787,2018-09-10-T-036,787,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"At the same time, however, we are mindful that our public spaces serve a wide range of needs of Singaporeans. We need to be sensitive and respectful of the different perspectives, values, and way of life in our multi-cultural and multi-generational society. It is MCCY's role to ensure that we promote the arts and raise arts excellence in a way that gains strong public support for arts and culture across the board. Therefore, in promoting public art, we must strike a careful balance between the artists, and the stakeholders who own and use the premises."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00788,2018-09-10-T-036,788,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"For example, park users may appreciate the occasional band performance, but prefer to keep the park quiet and serene at other times. Therein lies the need to consult different stakeholders as a matter of respect and basic courtesy – those who own and use the space should also have a say. I am sure that Mr Kok can see the merits of this approach, as he has often advocated for acknowledging diversity in views, in this case from different users of public spaces, including non-arts practitioners. He too has noted the importance of how public art should not flout the law or create public disorder."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00789,2018-09-10-T-036,789,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I will elaborate on how the Government supports art in our common spaces that add to the enjoyment and experience of Singaporeans and enhance our physical landscape, while taking in the considerations that I have outlined earlier."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00790,2018-09-10-T-036,790,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"First, the Government, through NAC, commissions key public art works. The first three commissions under the Public Art Trust (PAT) were conceived to commemorate Singapore's Golden Jubilee. Another two new public artworks will be commissioned in community spaces to commemorate Singapore's Bicentennial next year. And NAC plans to commission one additional public artwork each year thereafter. In other words, we are actively supporting, financing, and cultivating artists to bring public artworks, sculptures and installation art to public spaces."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00791,2018-09-10-T-036,791,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NAC has made efforts to involve the arts community in good public art projects through its grants. For example, OH! Open House, a recipient of NAC's Major Company Scheme funding, curates art walks that bring art into unexpected, everyday spaces such as HDB flats."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00792,2018-09-10-T-036,792,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Second, the success of the arts in Singapore is the result of a strong and mutually-beneficial partnership between the Government, the corporates and individuals. NAC not only encourages private donations for new public art, but also engages key partners for their support, such as in securing new sites for this art. For example, the PAT advises both site owners and artists on best practices in commissioning, installing, maintaining and decommissioning public artworks."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00793,2018-09-10-T-036,793,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Third, to present public art that is relevant to Singaporeans from all communities and walks of life, we must continue to bring art closer to the community through thoughtful programming and outreach. The initiatives of our arts groups, like the national orchestras and Mr Kok's own Drama Box in the heartlands are good examples."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00794,2018-09-10-T-036,794,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The PAT commissioned a Stop and Smell the Ang Mo Dan! exhibition with NAC's Arts In Your Neighbourhood initiative in March this year. The site-specific works by four Singaporean artists included talks, live painting sessions and hands-on craft activities for residents and non-residents of Ang Mo Kio to learn about the rich history and hidden characteristics of this neighbourhood. These activities reached over 190,000 people, and demonstrated how public art can engage and bring communities together when it is carefully curated."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00795,2018-09-10-T-036,795,,"Minister, you have two more minutes."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00796,2018-09-10-T-036,796,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker. As a result of the combined efforts of the Government, private, public and people sectors, today, a wide range and diversity of visual and performing arts have enlivened our public spaces. The Government will continue to develop our policies so that Singapore is home to diverse and distinctive arts that are accessible to, and inspire our people, and connect our communities. Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence."
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00797,2018-09-10-T-036,797,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00798,2018-09-10-T-036,798,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That Parliament do now adjourn."" (proc text)]"
2018-09-10-T-036-S-00799,2018-09-10-T-036,799,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Adjourned accordingly at 6.52 pm.
2018-09-10-T-037-S-00800,2018-09-10-T-037,800,Ang Hin Kee,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in light of more MOE Kindergartens (MKs) being set up (a) how will the transition of early childhood educators from other kindergartens and childcare centres be managed to ensure a seamless shift to the new work environment or employer; (b) whether there have been many enquiries and applications from existing educators to join the MKs; and (c) whether there is re-skilling required for affected teaching staff whose kindergartens are impacted by the emergence of MKs and who have not been successful in transiting to the MK environment or employment.
2018-09-10-T-037-S-00801,2018-09-10-T-037,801,Desmond Lee,"With more dual-income families and working grandparents, as well as growing awareness of the importance of early childhood development, there has been a rising demand for preschool services in Singapore. To meet this demand, over 30 percent more or 40,000 new preschool places will be provided by 2023."
2018-09-10-T-037-S-00802,2018-09-10-T-037,802,Desmond Lee,"The expansion of MOE Kindergartens, which cater to children aged five to six, is only one part of this effort to provide for more affordable and quality early childhood services. Selected MOE Kindergartens partner with Anchor Operators, which run Early Years Centres catering to children aged four and below. The sector remains open to other operators, who continue to play an important role in meeting the demand for preschool services and the different needs of parents and children."
2018-09-10-T-037-S-00803,2018-09-10-T-037,803,Desmond Lee,"In this context, the demand for early childhood educators for the entire sector, and not just the MOE Kindergartens, will continue to grow. For this reason, the Early Childhood Diploma intake at polytechnics has almost doubled from 380 places in 2015 to 727 places in 2017. The Early Childhood Development Agency (or ECDA) will work with the new National Institute of Early Childhood Development to ensure a sufficient pipeline of qualified early childhood educators for the entire sector."
2018-09-10-T-037-S-00804,2018-09-10-T-037,804,Desmond Lee,"ECDA requires the same professional qualifications for early childhood educators, regardless of the preschool they work in. Hence, existing early childhood educators who have taken up employment at the MOE kindergartens would have similar skillsets needed to succeed in their new environment. To supplement their professional training, operators generally have their own on-boarding and induction programmes for new staff to smoothen the transition for them into the workplace. In the case of MOE Kindergartens, headquarter and centre-level induction programmes have helped incoming MOE Kindergarten teachers adjust well to their new working environment."
2018-09-10-T-037-S-00805,2018-09-10-T-037,805,Desmond Lee,"Given the growth and transformation of the sector, Early Childhood educators today have a wide array of options for their career development. We will continue to encourage all early childhood educators to deepen their competencies through continuing development opportunities and milestone programmes for the sector. This not only helps them to keep current with professional requirements and developments in the early childhood field, but also enhances their chances to teach in the centres of their choice. Overall, the quality of the sector will rise."
2018-09-10-T-038-S-00806,2018-09-10-T-038,806,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether NEA can lower the cost burden passed to hawker centre tenants and stallholders such as that in the implementation of one-stop payment terminals, electronic cashless payments, tray returns, dishwashing, and general cleaning."
2018-09-10-T-038-S-00807,2018-09-10-T-038,807,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The primary objective of hawker centres is to provide hygienic and affordable food. The Government has invested in helping stallholders make a decent living and preparing them for future challenges, such as increased manpower shortage and rising labour costs."
2018-09-10-T-038-S-00808,2018-09-10-T-038,808,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The implementation of centre-level productivity initiatives, such as Centralised Dishwashing and Automated Tray Return Systems, will enhance productivity in our hawker centres. It will also reduce the hawkers' workload while addressing their manpower constraints. As labour costs are expected to increase in future, the productivity savings from these initiatives will translate into cost savings for the stallholders."
2018-09-10-T-038-S-00809,2018-09-10-T-038,809,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To help lower the initial cost burden, the Government is co-funding up to 70% of the operating costs of these initiatives for two years. This has been well-received in the hawker centres which have come on board our Productive Hawker Centres initiative, where more than 90% of the stallholders have adopted Centralised Dishwashing services. With these services, stallholders no longer need to collect and wash crockery or employ someone to do so. Stallholders also do not have to buy their own crockery as these are provided by the Centralised Dishwashing vendor."
2018-09-10-T-038-S-00810,2018-09-10-T-038,810,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In October last year, NEA launched the Hawkers' Productivity Grant that provides funding support for the purchase of kitchen automation equipment. This also helps to increase our hawkers' productivity and reduce their workload. Stallholders can claim 80% of the qualifying cost of the equipment on a reimbursement basis, up to a total of $5,000 within a three-year time frame. As of 31 August 2018, NEA has approved 170 applications. In the same vein, the Government called a Call-for-Collaboration (CFC) for the provision of e-payment solutions for food businesses in April 2018. This will reduce the costs to hawkers who wish to adopt the option of electronic cashless payments to increase productivity."
2018-09-10-T-038-S-00811,2018-09-10-T-038,811,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For cleaning, NEA adopts procurement best practices to maximise value for money. These include open tenders to facilitate price competition, and demand-aggregation to bring down unit costs. NEA also adopts a price-quality model which balances between costs and service standards to stall-holders."
2018-09-10-T-038-S-00812,2018-09-10-T-038,812,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will continue to monitor the costs to stallholders closely and, where necessary, review the measures to help our stallholders better manage their business costs."
2018-09-10-T-039-S-00813,2018-09-10-T-039,813,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what has been the progress on the precision engineering industry transformation map and the electronics industry transformation map since their launch in 2017.
2018-09-10-T-039-S-00814,2018-09-10-T-039,814,Chan Chun Sing,"The Precision Engineering Industry Transformation Map (ITM) and the Electronics ITM were launched in October 2016 and September 2017 respectively. Both ITMs were developed and are being implemented in close collaboration with industry, unions, institutes of higher learning (IHLs), and trade associations and chambers, such as the Singapore Precision Engineering & Technology Association (SPETA) and the Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association (SSIA). The Economic Development Board (EDB) is the lead government agency coordinating both ITMs. Both ITMs aim to transform their industries by strengthening existing growth sub-sectors, diversifying into new growth opportunities, and deepening the capabilities of our Precision Engineering and Electronics companies."
2018-09-10-T-039-S-00815,2018-09-10-T-039,815,Chan Chun Sing,"The Precision Engineering industry is characterised by a large number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). To help these SMEs grow, we will need to lower their barriers to innovation and technology adoption. One specific initiative aimed at doing so is the development of model factories, which allow SMEs to experience and experiment with advanced manufacturing technologies in a real-life production environment, before deciding whether to implement them in their own premises. As part of the Precision Engineering ITM, the Model Factory @ SIMTech was launched in October 2017. Another Model Factory will be launched by the end of this year."
2018-09-10-T-039-S-00816,2018-09-10-T-039,816,Chan Chun Sing,"For the Electronics ITM, one area of focus is strengthening our innovation eco-system to enable our companies to harness new growth opportunities. The ITM has outlined a few strategies that are being implemented, such as fostering ""one-to-one"" collaborations between multi-national companies (MNCs) and SMEs, and building up structures to groom Electronics SMEs and startups. Since the launch of the ITM, EDB has worked with Enterprise Singapore (ESG) to support and grow more than fifteen Electronics startups through accelerators and incubators. ESG also supported seven startups in featuring their solutions at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2018 in Las Vegas."
2018-09-10-T-039-S-00817,2018-09-10-T-039,817,Chan Chun Sing,"As we shift the Precision Engineering and Electronics industries towards higher value-added and innovation-intensive activities, both industries will also see the creation of jobs that require greater depth of knowledge. EDB has worked with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), unions and industry stakeholders to roll out Skills Frameworks to help our people identify the key skills, competencies and training programmes that they will need to capitalise on new job opportunities and advance in their careers. We have also put in place programmes to attract young talent, and support the leadership development of our people. For example, with the support of EDB, the SSIA launched the Semiconductor Leadership Accelerator in October 2017 and has since trained about 40 Singaporean professionals over the course of two runs."
2018-09-10-T-039-S-00818,2018-09-10-T-039,818,Chan Chun Sing,"In addition to the ITM initiatives, EDB has worked with TÜV SÜD to develop the Singapore Smart Industry Readiness Index, a comprehensive tool to help companies identify challenges in adopting Industry 4.0 technology. EDB, in partnership with six trade associations and ESG, has targeted 300 funded assessments of the Index. To date, more than 170 funded assessments have been awarded, and of which 40% were to SMEs. More than a third of the assessments were awarded to Precision Engineering and Electronics companies. Industry feedback has been positive, with several companies sharing their experience at industry seminars."
2018-09-10-T-039-S-00819,2018-09-10-T-039,819,Chan Chun Sing,"Thus far, the Precision Engineering and Electronics ITMs, as ""live"" roadmaps of transformation, are supporting our companies in harnessing advanced manufacturing technologies, and our people through skills deepening and upgrading efforts. The ITMs will be reviewed continually to take into account industry feedback and prevailing economic conditions. We will continue to work with our tripartite partners in this joint transformation journey."
2018-09-10-T-040-S-00820,2018-09-10-T-040,820,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many Singaporean workers have participated in the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative and ASEAN Leadership Programme respectively; (b) what industries are these workers employed in at the time of participation; (c) what is the profile of these workers (age, gender, profession and years of work experience); and (d) how many of these workers have progressed into higher-value job roles or leadership roles as a result of participating in the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative and ASEAN Leadership Programme."
2018-09-10-T-040-S-00821,2018-09-10-T-040,821,Chan Chun Sing,"The SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative (LDI) aims to develop more Singaporeans as business leaders in their respective fields. This is achieved in two ways. First, LDI supports companies’ efforts to provide promising employees with on-the-job leadership opportunities. Second, LDI supports training providers to develop market- and sector-specific leadership programmes."
2018-09-10-T-040-S-00822,2018-09-10-T-040,822,Chan Chun Sing,"To-date, companies have committed to develop about 450 Singaporeans under LDI. The scheme is designed to address leadership development needs across different industries and career stages. Accordingly, participants come from diverse industries, including Electronics, Biomedical Sciences and Consumer Businesses, just to name a few. They also have a wide range of professional experience, from the entry level to more advanced stages of their career. Participants are identified by their companies based on merit and performance, regardless of age or gender. So we do not track these statistics."
2018-09-10-T-040-S-00823,2018-09-10-T-040,823,Chan Chun Sing,"In addition to company-centric programmes, another 80 Singaporeans have completed LDI programmes which focus on sectors and markets, such as the Singapore Semiconductor Leadership Accelerator Programme and the Asian Retail Leaders Programme. There are more cohorts in the pipeline. In particular, the ASEAN Leadership Programme is a new initiative that seeks to help business leaders better understand emerging markets, build networks, and advance their companies' growth throughout South-East Asia. This will help develop Singapore leaders with the necessary expertise in ASEAN markets to operate confidently in the region. The inaugural run of the Programme will be in September this year, with a projected class size of 20 participants."
2018-09-10-T-040-S-00824,2018-09-10-T-040,824,Chan Chun Sing,"Strong business leaders are critical to a company's success and viability. They are also important to our economy as a whole. We need leaders with vision, know-how and a ""can-do"" spirit to build and grow globally competitive businesses. The Government will continue partnering industry to help more Singaporeans realise their full potential as effective leaders. As to LDI and the ASEAN Leadership Programme specifically, these initiatives are still in their early stages. We have received good feedback so far. LDI participants have affirmed that such programmes are important to their development, and provide them with useful networking opportunities and industry insights. We will continue to engage employers and participants to assess the effectiveness of these programmes and make improvements along the way."
2018-09-10-T-041-S-00825,2018-09-10-T-041,825,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Government will put in place appropriate security assessment measures for cybersecurity staff or contractors working with the civil service, statutory boards, banks and other organisations or businesses, who are foreigners, employment pass holders, Singapore PRs or new citizens, including those originating from the country that is linked to the Advance Persistent Threat group who carried out the recent cyberattack against SingHealth, NUS and NTU."
2018-09-10-T-041-S-00826,2018-09-10-T-041,826,S Iswaran,"All public service staff and contractors dealing with Government cybersecurity matters, who require access to classified Government information, must undergo security screening by the authorities. Similarly, organisations in the Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) sectors such as Banking and Finance as well as Land Transport are required by their respective sectoral regulators to screen all staff and contractors with access to key infrastructure such as IT systems. Such measures go some way to mitigating the ‘insider’ risk, though they are not fool-proof."
2018-09-10-T-041-S-00827,2018-09-10-T-041,827,S Iswaran,"The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) will also license organisations offering penetration testing and managed security operations centre monitoring services as well as individuals directly engaged for such services, to ensure they meet certain criteria including that their key executive officers are fit and proper persons. Under the Cybersecurity Code of Practice issued by CSA, all CII owners must calibrate a vendor’s access to their CII, based on their organisations’ business needs and cybersecurity risk profile."
2018-09-10-T-042-S-00828,2018-09-10-T-042,828,Chong Kee Hiong,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry will be considering a review of relevant literature texts for lower secondary classes in view of the global pivot to Asia; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider exposing our students to excerpts from great Asian literature classics such as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
2018-09-10-T-042-S-00829,2018-09-10-T-042,829,Ong Ye Kung,"MOE has been reviewing and will continue to regularly review Literature texts. We do so based on educational objectives  the literary merit of the texts, their accessibility and age-appropriateness of language and themes, and their relevance to today’s context."
2018-09-10-T-042-S-00830,2018-09-10-T-042,830,Ong Ye Kung,"So for Literature in English, a text list for secondary school students is provided and updated every three years. This list comprises texts from Singapore, our region and other parts of the world. Given Singapore's position as a nation in Southeast Asia and a global city connected to the rest of the world, MOE needs to ensure a sufficiently wide range of texts, to allow students to be exposed to different cultures, beliefs and practices. Schools have a choice when it comes to selecting texts that best meet the needs of their students. At the lower secondary, they may choose from the recommended text list or select their own Literature texts."
2018-09-10-T-042-S-00831,2018-09-10-T-042,831,Ong Ye Kung,"In recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on texts from Singapore and the region. I think this is reflective of the point in history we are living in."
2018-09-10-T-042-S-00832,2018-09-10-T-042,832,Ong Ye Kung,"Beyond Literature, students are also exposed to texts as part of language learning. For the Mother Tongue Languages, adapted excerpts from suitable classics have been included in the textbooks. For Chinese Language, these include short stories extracted from Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and selected poetry from the Tang Dynasty. Similarly, poetry and excerpts from ancient classics such as Sejarah Melayu (The Malay Annals), Panji Tales, Thirukural and Naladiyar are adapted and included in the Malay and Tamil Language textbooks."
2018-09-10-T-043-S-00833,2018-09-10-T-043,833,Chia Shi-Lu,asked the Minister for Health what measures will be implemented to ensure that (i) providers of home-based and centre-based services for elderly care meet minimum standards of quality (ii) professionals and staff are adequately trained and certified and (iii) this employment sector has a strong Singaporean core.
2018-09-10-T-043-S-00834,2018-09-10-T-043,834,Gan Kim Yong,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) takes a developmental approach to ensure the provision of good quality home- and centre-based care services. In 2015, MOH, in consultation with the sector, introduced developmental service guidelines for home- and centre-based care providers covering areas such as care delivery, staff training and staff qualifications. Separately, healthcare professionals in the sector, such as doctors, nurses and therapists, are subject to licensing by their respective professional bodies, and are held to strict professional standards in areas such as code of conduct, practice standards and competencies. Eldercare centres receiving MOH funding are also required to pass service audits."
2018-09-10-T-043-S-00835,2018-09-10-T-043,835,Gan Kim Yong,"To continually raise standards and improve quality of care, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) conducts regular capability-building programmes in areas such as infection control and medication management, and holds sector forums to regularly share good practices. AIC also provides funding support to providers for staff development."
2018-09-10-T-043-S-00836,2018-09-10-T-043,836,Gan Kim Yong,"MOH will review the need for more formal regulation, including licensing under the upcoming Healthcare Services Act. The Act is scheduled to be rolled out in 2020. As the sector is still nascent and evolving, we will adopt a risk-based approach and subject services with higher patient risks to higher levels of regulation, so as not to add excessive regulatory burden to providers, which could consequently raise the cost of care for seniors."
2018-09-10-T-043-S-00837,2018-09-10-T-043,837,Gan Kim Yong,"We recognise the importance of building a strong Singaporean core to support the growth of home and centre based services. In fact, locals comprise more than seven out of 10 of the workforce in the sector as at end 2017. MOH has provided funding to providers to raise salaries, and this had led to an increase in local staff salaries by around 30% across providers which tapped on our funding support from 2012 to 2017. We agree that better recognition of the importance of care workers will help to encourage more Singaporeans to step forward to join this sector, and we will continue our efforts to reach out to the society at large."
2018-09-10-T-044-S-00838,2018-09-10-T-044,838,Cheng Li Hui,asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to the rise in outrage of modesty cases on public transport (a) what are the current measures in place to ensure that commuters are able to travel safely and whether they are sufficient; (b) how does the Ministry plan to deal with the rise; (c) whether most cases occur at peak or non-peak hours; and (d) whether the number of male victims has risen.
2018-09-10-T-044-S-00839,2018-09-10-T-044,839,K Shanmugam,"To deter outrage of modesty (OM), the Police conduct patrols at bus interchanges, train platforms, and on board trains. Police are also working with community volunteers through the Citizen on Patrol (COP) initiative to complement the patrols conducted by the Police."
2018-09-10-T-044-S-00840,2018-09-10-T-044,840,K Shanmugam,"The Police will continue their efforts to educate and raise public awareness of OM. Advisories have been placed at prominent locations in the MRT stations, bus interchanges, on trains and buses. Police officers have been distributing advisories on OM to commuters."
2018-09-10-T-044-S-00841,2018-09-10-T-044,841,K Shanmugam,We urge victims to make a Police report as soon as possible. Reporting the crime early is crucial to help the Police identify and arrest the perpetrator.
2018-09-10-T-044-S-00842,2018-09-10-T-044,842,K Shanmugam,"OM happens during both peak and off-peak hours, in roughly the same proportion. Hence, we urge commuters to be vigilant at all times."
2018-09-10-T-044-S-00843,2018-09-10-T-044,843,K Shanmugam,The percentage of OM cases involving male victims has remained relatively low over the past three years.
2018-09-10-T-044-S-00844,2018-09-10-T-044,844,K Shanmugam,The Police are monitoring the increase in OM cases and will regularly review their measures.
2018-09-10-T-045-S-00845,2018-09-10-T-045,845,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs what actions have been, and are being, taken to prosecute people smugglers."
2018-09-10-T-045-S-00846,2018-09-10-T-045,846,K Shanmugam,"We take tough action against people smugglers. Between 2016 and July 2018, eleven persons were charged and successfully prosecuted under the Immigration Act for people smuggling or abetment. They were sentenced to imprisonment terms ranging from six to 30 months, and caning of up to six strokes."
2018-09-10-T-045-S-00847,2018-09-10-T-045,847,K Shanmugam,"People smuggling is a transnational crime, and so we also work closely with our foreign counterparts through regular information exchanges and law enforcement cooperation."
2018-09-10-T-046-S-00848,2018-09-10-T-046,848,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what new sectors are being considered for implementation of the progressive wage model beyond security, cleaning and landscaping sectors; and (b) whether the progressive wage model will be implemented in the eldercare sector."
2018-09-10-T-046-S-00849,2018-09-10-T-046,849,Josephine Teo,"The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) provides a clear progression pathway for workers to earn higher wages as they become more skilled, more productive and take on higher job responsibilities. PWM has been implemented in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors as a targeted intervention to address low and stagnant wages caused by cheap sourcing. The PWMs in these sectors have led to wage growth for more than 70,000 resident workers. Between 2011 and 2016, the real median gross wages of full-time resident cleaners, security guards and landscape maintenance workers increased by 5.7%, 6.4% and 3% per annum respectively, higher than resident median income growth."
2018-09-10-T-046-S-00850,2018-09-10-T-046,850,Josephine Teo,"Each PWM is developed through extensive tripartite negotiations, taking into consideration sector-specific issues such as past and prevailing wages, working conditions and the required skills for the relevant jobs. The PWMs are also regularly reviewed by the tripartite committees to ensure that they remain relevant and aligned with the sectors' industry transformation goals. The Government continues to work closely with tripartite partners to develop, promote and adopt PWMs in other sectors on a voluntary basis, such as for bus captains and baggage handlers."
2018-09-10-T-046-S-00851,2018-09-10-T-046,851,Josephine Teo,It was earlier announced that tripartite partners are exploring a PWM for the lift sector to attract more skilled workers into the sector and improve service quality. Discussions are at an advanced stage and more details will be released in the Sectoral Tripartite Committee’s report soon.
2018-09-10-T-046-S-00852,2018-09-10-T-046,852,,"MOH will study if further efforts are needed, including whether to introduce a PWM for the eldercare sector with tripartite partners."
2018-09-10-T-047-S-00853,2018-09-10-T-047,853,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the current percentage of mobile phone ownership for each income group; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider defining basic necessities to include mobile phones when calculating the cost of living, especially in light of the Government's push towards a Smart Nation."
2018-09-10-T-047-S-00854,2018-09-10-T-047,854,Chan Chun Sing,"Based on data from the latest Household Expenditure Survey published by the Department of Statistics, the mobile phone ownership rate is high across all household income groups. For instance, the proportion of resident households with mobile phones ranged from 88.7 per cent for the lowest 20 per cent of households by income to 99.7 per cent for the 61st to 80th percentiles of households by income."
2018-09-10-T-047-S-00855,2018-09-10-T-047,855,Chan Chun Sing,"Mobile phones and their related subscription fees and call charges are included in the consumption basket used to compute the Consumer Price Index (CPI-All Items), which in turn is used as a proxy to measure changes in the cost of living of resident households. Between 2012 and 2017, the communications category of CPI-All Items, which largely consists of mobile phones and related services, saw a price decline of 0.2 per cent per annum on average as compared to the 0.6 per cent per annum increase in the overall CPI-All Items. The decline in communications costs faced by households reflects the increasingly vibrant and competitive telecommunications market."
2018-09-10-T-047-S-00856,2018-09-10-T-047,856,Chan Chun Sing,"More broadly, the Government recognises that mobile phones are an important enabler for many of the digital services that we want to provide to our citizens. Guided by the Digital Readiness Blueprint, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) is looking into providing support to those who do not have access to such devices. In assisting low-income households with financial difficulties, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) also includes their communications needs in the ComCare assistance provided."
2018-09-10-T-048-S-00857,2018-09-10-T-048,857,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the number of jobs which new firms have created in the last five years; (b) how does this number compare to job creation by older firms; and (c) what is the profile and prospects of these new jobs created.
2018-09-10-T-048-S-00858,2018-09-10-T-048,858,Chan Chun Sing,"A study by MTI showed that young firms are key contributors of jobs in Singapore. These are firms which have been formed for five years or less. Between 2012 and 2016, young firms created an average of more than 106,000 jobs per annum, accounting for close to 90 per cent of the 120,000 jobs created each year."
2018-09-10-T-048-S-00859,2018-09-10-T-048,859,Chan Chun Sing,"Many of the jobs created by young firms are in sectors that provide good wages and career development prospects for Singaporeans. In particular, around one-third of the 106,000 jobs created by young firms from 2012 to 2016 were in key growth sectors such as wholesale trade, manufacturing, information & communications and finance & insurance. These are sectors which pay higher monthly wages compared to the economy-wide average."
2018-09-10-T-048-S-00860,2018-09-10-T-048,860,Chan Chun Sing,The Government will continue to work with industry and other key stakeholders to encourage entrepreneurship and attract new investments into Singapore.
2018-09-10-T-049-S-00861,2018-09-10-T-049,861,Ang Hin Kee,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what recourse do pedestrians and motorists have in accidents involving (i) private cars that bear only non-commercial use insurance (ii) private-hire vehicles and taxis doing courier service delivery; and (b) what actions will be taken when apps operators conduct themselves in violation of regulations.
2018-09-10-T-049-S-00862,2018-09-10-T-049,862,Khaw Boon Wan,"The Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act requires all motor vehicles, whether private cars, private-hire cars (PHCs) or taxis, to be insured against third-party claims on injury and death. Drivers must thus ensure that their motor insurance policies provide the appropriate coverage taking into account the intended use of the vehicle. Drivers who contravene this requirement can be fined up to $1,000 and/or be imprisoned for up to 3 months. They may also be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving license for 12 months from the date of conviction."
2018-09-10-T-049-S-00863,2018-09-10-T-049,863,Khaw Boon Wan,"In the event of accidents involving vehicles which do not have the required insurance coverage, the victim may initiate civil proceedings against the other party."
2018-09-10-T-049-S-00864,2018-09-10-T-049,864,Khaw Boon Wan,"In addition, PHCs and taxis are prohibited from being used for the conveyance of goods for reward without LTA's approval. PHC and taxi drivers who accept such jobs may have their vocational licences revoked."
2018-09-10-T-049-S-00865,2018-09-10-T-049,865,Khaw Boon Wan,"PHC booking service operators (BSOs) are required under the Road Traffic Act to ensure that only licensed and appropriately insured drivers and cars are deployed on their platforms. Errant BSOs are liable for warnings, fines, and in egregious cases, a General Suspension Order."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00866,2018-09-10-T-050,866,Alex Yam,asked the Prime Minister (a) what plans are being considered to encourage Singaporeans to have more children in light of the 2017 birth rates being at a seven-year low; and (b) whether the Government has studied the main reasons leading to (i) later marriages (ii) later age for first child and (iii) smaller families.
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00867,2018-09-10-T-050,867,Teo Chee Hean,"Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR) had been around 1.2 in recent years, but fell to 1.16 in 2017. This fall in TFR is in part due to a demographic shift in our population. A relatively large cohort of young Singaporeans, many of whom are children of the ""baby boomers"" born between 1988 and 1998, are just entering the peak childbearing ages between the ages of 25 and 39."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00868,2018-09-10-T-050,868,Teo Chee Hean,"For birth and population trends, beyond yearly variations, it is useful to look at longer time periods. In the last five years since 2013, which was when the oldest cohort of ""echo baby boomers"" first turned 25 years old, we have seen a slight uptick in the average number of births compared to the preceding five-year period (from 2008 to 2012).1 At the same time, compared to earlier cohorts, many of these ""echo baby boomers"" are not yet married or have not yet started having children. When this cohort starts having children, and as the younger ""echo baby boomers"" (currently aged between 20 and 24 years) enter their peak childbearing years, we are hopeful that the number of births will increase. Our TFR could correspondingly improve."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00869,2018-09-10-T-050,869,Teo Chee Hean,"While our birth rates have fallen, it is encouraging that the number of resident marriages has risen – from 25,927 in 2016 to 26,348 in 2017, higher than the average of the past decade of about 25,000 resident marriages. The increase in marriages could translate to more births in the coming years, as young couples build their families."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00870,2018-09-10-T-050,870,Teo Chee Hean,"Indeed, our surveys show that Singaporeans' aspirations to get married and have children remain strong. The 2016 Marriage and Parenthood (M&P) Survey indicated that more than 8 in 10 (83%) of single Millennials (aged 21-35) want to get married, and more than 9 in 10 (92%) of married Millennials want at least two children."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00871,2018-09-10-T-050,871,Teo Chee Hean,"However, young Singaporeans have other life goals as well. With better education and career opportunities, some decide to delay marriage and starting a family, in order to first fulfil other aspirations. From the same survey, half of the single Millennials (54%) indicated that they wanted to focus on their career and studies before marrying."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00872,2018-09-10-T-050,872,Teo Chee Hean,"These factors have contributed to the trends highlighted by Mr Alex Yam, with Singaporeans getting married and having children later, and subsequently having smaller families. From 2006 to 2016, the median age of Singaporean women at first marriage increased from 26.7 to 28.0 years, and the median age of mothers at first birth increased from 29.4 to 30.3 years."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00873,2018-09-10-T-050,873,Teo Chee Hean,"Nonetheless, there are other reasons for cheer. A small but growing number of couples in Singapore are choosing to have larger families. 2,118 babies born in 2017 were the fourth or higher birth-order child, the highest in the past five years."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00874,2018-09-10-T-050,874,Teo Chee Hean,"Marriage and parenthood are ultimately personal decisions, and the reasons and timing for getting married and having children vary across couples. The Government cannot interfere with people’s personal decisions, but we can and will continue to encourage Singaporeans to get married and have children, and to help them with strong support when they do."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00875,2018-09-10-T-050,875,Teo Chee Hean,"We have invested significant resources in the Marriage and Parenthood Package over the past 17 years, to better support Singaporeans at every stage of their marriage and parenthood journey. In line with the feedback we have received, we are doing more in the three key areas of housing, pre-school and workplace support."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00876,2018-09-10-T-050,876,Teo Chee Hean,"Housing. Many couples aspire to own their homes before they start a family. To help them, HDB has launched more than 50,000 new BTO flats since 2015, with priority allocation for first-timers. To provide faster access to housing, HDB will launch 1,100 flats with shorter waiting times of 2.5 years in the next few months, and another batch of 2,000 in 2019. HDB has also been more flexible to allow deferment of income assessment for housing loans and grants till before keys collection. This would benefit young couples who are studying or serving National Service, and are ready to settle down earlier in life."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00877,2018-09-10-T-050,877,Teo Chee Hean,"Pre-school. Many parents cite finding good caregiving options and financial costs as key concerns when having children. One of our key priorities is to ensure more affordable and quality preschool places, to give parents peace of mind that their children are well taken care of while they are at work."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00878,2018-09-10-T-050,878,Teo Chee Hean,"The Government is committed to ensuring that every parent who wants a preschool place for their child will be able to have one. ECDA is enhancing the provision of affordable and quality infant and child care, with 40,000 more places to be added in the next five years. MOE will set up more MOE kindergartens (MKs), with a target of 50 MKs by 2023. As announced by Minister Desmond Lee in July, we are also reviewing our preschool subsidy framework to improve affordability for parents."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00879,2018-09-10-T-050,879,Teo Chee Hean,"Work-life support. We recognise that more Singaporeans want to fulfil their career aspirations even as they build their families. We are doing more to support them in managing their work and family responsibilities. In particular, parental leave provisions have been progressively enhanced over the years, including improved leave support for fathers to play a more active role in caring for their children. Last year, we made the second week of Paternity Leave mandatory, and increased Shared Parental Leave from one to four weeks. In total, fathers can now tap on up to eight weeks of leave to care for their children in the first year of birth."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00880,2018-09-10-T-050,880,Teo Chee Hean,"Over the past year, we have also launched two Tripartite Standards to encourage more family-friendly workplaces – one on Flexible Work Arrangements, and another on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs. To date, about 880 employers have signed up to the Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements, and 290 employers to that on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs. We have also launched the enhanced Work-Life Grant in July, to better encourage the adoption of flexible work arrangements by employees. We will work with tripartite partners to encourage more companies to adopt the Tripartite Standards and Work-Life Grant, so that they can better support their employees' flexible working needs."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00881,2018-09-10-T-050,881,Teo Chee Hean,"It is not enough for Government to act alone. For marriage and parenthood to be achievable, enjoyable and celebrated, the whole of society must come together to foster more family-friendly workplaces and communities. Employers and co-workers can play their part, by showing understanding and support if colleagues need time off to care for young children or aged parents. I was also heartened to hear that the Singapore University of Social Sciences has recently launched a Marriage and Baby Bonus Scheme, that offers each part-time adult student up to two free modules if they get married or have a child during their study. These efforts by the larger community go a long way in celebrating and supporting parenthood."
2018-09-10-T-050-S-00882,2018-09-10-T-050,882,Teo Chee Hean,"We have just celebrated our 53rd National Day a month ago. With the combined efforts of Government, employers, co-workers and the wider community, we can together make Singapore a Great Place for Families, for many more generations of Singaporeans to come."
2018-09-10-T-051-S-00883,2018-09-10-T-051,883,Leon Perera,"asked the Prime Minister with regard to employees hired as individual contractors by the public sector (a) how many employees does the public service have on such contracts currently; (b) what guidelines are in place to protect the interests of these workers in terms of leave benefits and compensation review; (c) what channels are available to them to seek redress on their grievances; (d) whether there are limits to the duration of such contracts; and (e) when such contractors go on to secure permanent employment in the public sector, whether there are provisions to ensure that their prior contract work counts towards the compensation and grade they obtain."
2018-09-10-T-051-S-00884,2018-09-10-T-051,884,Chan Chun Sing,"The intent of the contract framework is to allow public agencies the flexibility to employ officers to undertake specific projects over a fixed period, or as a means to assess their suitability for the job. As at 31 December 2017, about 10% of all public officers or 14,600 public officers are employed on contracts, excluding those on re-employment contracts. Contract officers generally enjoy the same leave and medical benefits and are paid according to the same salary structure as permanent officers"
2018-09-10-T-051-S-00885,2018-09-10-T-051,885,Chan Chun Sing,"Public agencies can appoint officers on contract for up to four years to assess their suitability for the job. For officers who perform well in the job and are assessed to be suitable for a long term career with the Public Service, agencies will offer them permanent positions after one or two years. When contract officers are emplaced as permanent officers, their period of service is considered continuous from the contract employment episode. Agencies also consider the period of contract service when determining the substantive grade and corresponding salary to offer at the point of emplacement."
2018-09-10-T-051-S-00886,2018-09-10-T-051,886,Chan Chun Sing,"As adopters of the Tripartite Standard on Grievance Handling, public agencies have grievance handling procedures in place for officers, whether contract or permanent, to raise their grievances and for these grievances to be properly investigated and resolved."
2018-09-10-T-052-S-00887,2018-09-10-T-052,887,Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Education what mechanisms have been put in place to ensure school bus services remain affordable to all school-going children.
2018-09-10-T-052-S-00888,2018-09-10-T-052,888,Ong Ye Kung,"Schools select school bus operators through a competitive bidding process and award contracts to transport operators who best meet their needs. In January 2015, MOE enhanced the bidding process for school bus services so that schools can reach out to more bus operators to obtain more competitive offers.  The competitiveness of bus fares proposed is one of the key evaluation factors considered by schools."
2018-09-10-T-052-S-00889,2018-09-10-T-052,889,Ong Ye Kung,"The Government has put in place a number of measures to help school bus operators keep their operating cost low so that they can offer more competitive bus fares. For example, school buses are exempted from Certificate of Entitlement requirements. Other private bus operators who use their buses to provide school bus services would be given 50% road tax rebate by the Land Transport Authority."
2018-09-10-T-052-S-00890,2018-09-10-T-052,890,Ong Ye Kung,"To help students who need further assistance to meet their transport expenses, MOE has also implemented a transport subsidy for students on the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) since 1 April 2015. MOE subsidises 50% of the actual monthly school bus fares for primary school FAS students who commute to school via school bus."
2018-09-10-T-052-S-00891,2018-09-10-T-052,891,Ong Ye Kung,"About 3,600 primary students are currently in receipt of MOE's transport subsidy."
2018-09-10-T-053-S-00892,2018-09-10-T-053,892,Lim Biow Chuan,"asked the Minister for Education whether more places in primary schools can be set aside for residents living within 1 km of the primary school if, historically, there are consistently insufficient places for students living in the vicinity of the school."
2018-09-10-T-053-S-00893,2018-09-10-T-053,893,Ong Ye Kung,"MOE regularly reviews the demand and supply trends at the national and regional levels to ensure that there are sufficient school places for school-going children, taking into account the current and projected population as well as planned housing development programmes."
2018-09-10-T-053-S-00894,2018-09-10-T-053,894,Ong Ye Kung,"MOE ensures that there are sufficient places for all eligible Singaporean Primary One-going children within a reasonable distance from their homes. For the last three P1 Registration Exercises, about 98% of the registrants were able to obtain a place in a primary school of their choice, or a primary school within 2km of their residence."
2018-09-10-T-053-S-00895,2018-09-10-T-053,895,Ong Ye Kung,"While MOE plans the location of schools and the number of vacancies carefully, it is not possible to predict exactly how many students will register in a particular school in a particular year. The number changes from year to year, and proximity to the school is not the sole determinant of choice of school. For example, some parents may prefer to register their children in schools further away of which the parents are alumni, or where the grandparents live. In determining the number of classes for each school, MOE also has to calibrate the intake with the capacity of the school so as to ensure an optimum learning environment for all students."
2018-09-10-T-053-S-00896,2018-09-10-T-053,896,Ong Ye Kung,"In instances where there are insufficient vacancies in the school of their choice, we encourage parents to consider other primary schools near their residential address. MOE will continue to ensure every school is resourced with well-trained teachers, investing in their facilities, and ensuring sufficient support for good school programmes, so that every student can receive a good quality and holistic education, regardless of the school which he or she attends."
2018-09-10-T-054-S-00897,2018-09-10-T-054,897,Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for Health whether there are any plans for a polyclinic in Braddell Heights constituency.
2018-09-10-T-054-S-00898,2018-09-10-T-054,898,Gan Kim Yong,"MOH conducts regular reviews of subsidised primary care facilities in different geographical localities, including Braddell Heights and the surrounding areas. In doing so, we will take into account the existing subsidised capacity in CHAS GPs and polyclinics in the areas as well as the projected primary care demand. Meanwhile, residents within the Braddell Heights constituency can seek subsidised primary care at nearby polyclinics located in Toa Payoh, Hougang or Geylang, and nine CHAS GP clinics in the Braddell Heights area."
2018-09-10-T-055-S-00899,2018-09-10-T-055,899,Chia Shi-Lu,asked the Minister for Health in view of the latest findings showing the harmful effects of alcohol consumption and that there is likely no safe level of alcohol consumption (a) whether the Ministry will consider lowering the recommended limit for alcohol consumption to no more than two standard drinks a day for men and no more than one for women; and (b) how will the Ministry conduct an updated public education programme to inform Singaporeans and residents.
2018-09-10-T-055-S-00900,2018-09-10-T-055,900,Gan Kim Yong,"The current recommended limit for regular alcohol consumption in Singapore is already two standard drinks a day for men and one standard drink a day for women as suggested by Dr Chia. According to the latest National Population Health Survey, 2.3% of Singaporeans aged 18-69 years exceeded the recommended limit in 2017. Although this was an increase from 1.4% in 2007, our alcohol consumption is still among the lowest in Asia"
2018-09-10-T-055-S-00901,2018-09-10-T-055,901,Gan Kim Yong,"Together with its partners, the Health Promotion Board (HPB)'s current strategy is focused on raising awareness on the harms of alcohol consumption and binge drinking among youth. HPB worked with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to include information on the harmful effects of alcohol in the school curriculum for all students at primary and secondary schools. Information on the effects of excessive alcohol consumption, particularly binge drinking, is embedded in the lifeskills programme and health related activities for ITE and Polytechnic students, as well as national servicemen. Similar information is also made available to members of the public on HPB's Healthhub website."
2018-09-10-T-055-S-00902,2018-09-10-T-055,902,Gan Kim Yong,HPB also collaborates with other agencies such as the National Addictions Management Service and Traffic Police to include pertinent messages on sensible drinking in their campaigns.
2018-09-10-T-055-S-00903,2018-09-10-T-055,903,Gan Kim Yong,MOH and HPB will continue to take into consideration evidence that is relevant and applicable to our local context when reviewing recommended limits and public education initiatives. We will also continue to closely monitor the trends of regular alcohol consumption and binge drinking in Singapore.
2018-09-10-T-056-S-00904,2018-09-10-T-056,904,Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs in view of the increase in e-commerce scams on online marketplaces (a) what is the solving rate for such cases; (b) how many offenders have been prosecuted so far, and (c) how is the Ministry working with e-commerce companies to protect users."
2018-09-10-T-056-S-00905,2018-09-10-T-056,905,K Shanmugam,"Only a minority of e-commerce scams have been solved. One reason is that a significant proportion of online crimes, including e-commerce scams, are committed by syndicates based overseas. Online crimes are also difficult to solve due to the anonymity provided by the internet."
2018-09-10-T-056-S-00906,2018-09-10-T-056,906,K Shanmugam,"For the same reasons, the number of persons prosecuted is low compared to the number of scams reported."
2018-09-10-T-056-S-00907,2018-09-10-T-056,907,K Shanmugam,"Police have been working with operators of online platforms to put in place measures to better protect users. The online platforms have put up advisories on how users can minimise their risk of falling victim to scams – for example, to require cash on delivery and to check the items carefully before completing the transaction."
2018-09-10-T-056-S-00908,2018-09-10-T-056,908,K Shanmugam,"If advance payments are required, users should make use of secured payment systems. For example, Carousell has recently introduced CarouPay, an escrow payment system. Using the system, payment will only be released to the sellers after the buyers have acknowledged receipt of the items purchased."
2018-09-10-T-057-S-00909,2018-09-10-T-057,909,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the former directors and management of oBike Singapore will be investigated by the Commercial Affairs Department for any alleged improper transfer to oBike Hong Kong of about S$10 million that is allegedly collected from its former Singapore customers by way of prepayment.
2018-09-10-T-057-S-00910,2018-09-10-T-057,910,K Shanmugam,"The Police are investigating oBike Asia Pte Ltd (or ""oBike Singapore"") for misappropriation of funds. As investigations are ongoing, we are unable to comment further."
2018-09-10-T-058-S-00911,2018-09-10-T-058,911,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how regularly are trees along roads inspected and pruned to ensure that they do not overshadow street lamps; and (b) how many instances of feedback have been received from the public concerning trees covering street lamps in the past year.
2018-09-10-T-058-S-00912,2018-09-10-T-058,912,Lawrence Wong,"NParks oversees about two million urban trees across Singapore. Depending on their species, trees are pruned at least once or twice a year prior to the monsoon seasons. NParks also conducts regular health inspections on its trees. Additional pruning may be carried out as a result of these inspections. While pruning is usually carried out to improve the structure and balance of trees, NParks also ensures that branches do not block the light from street lamps during its pruning exercises."
2018-09-10-T-058-S-00913,2018-09-10-T-058,913,Lawrence Wong,"In 2017, NParks received about 200 reports from the public, about trees blocking street lamps. These made up less than one per cent of the feedback that NParks receives per year on roadside greenery. If members of the public spot trees covering street lamps, they can report it through the OneService mobile app or by calling the NParks hotline."
2018-09-10-T-059-S-00914,2018-09-10-T-059,914,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"asked the Minister for National Development in respect of private developments on freehold land that are marked and sold as 99-year leasehold properties, what percentage of the residential properties in Singapore do such developments constitute."
2018-09-10-T-059-S-00915,2018-09-10-T-059,915,Lawrence Wong,"As of April 2018, there are about 3,000 private residential units built on freehold and 999-year land but sold on shorter leases. This represents about 0.8% of the total stock of private residential properties in Singapore."
2018-09-10-T-060-S-00916,2018-09-10-T-060,916,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how has the rise in the number of factoryless goods producing firms changed Singapore's economic competitiveness and its capacity to export; and (b) what are the implications to job creation and prospects as well as overall economic value-add in Singapore.
2018-09-10-T-060-S-00917,2018-09-10-T-060,917,Chan Chun Sing,"Singapore's manufacturing ecosystem has become more diverse over the years, with a shift towards higher-value activities. This includes a rise in the number of Factoryless Goods Producing Firms (FGPFs). These are firms that undertake pre-production activities such as R&D and product design in Singapore, but outsource the physical production to another company, which could be located in Singapore or overseas."
2018-09-10-T-060-S-00918,2018-09-10-T-060,918,Chan Chun Sing,"FGPFs contribute to our economy in several ways. First, due to the high-value nature of their activities in Singapore, FGPFs contributed to 5.2% of the value-added of the manufacturing sector in 2016, even though they accounted for around 0.5% of manufacturing firms. They also provide business to firms in supporting industries that are engaged in logistics, sales and marketing."
2018-09-10-T-060-S-00919,2018-09-10-T-060,919,Chan Chun Sing,"Second, FGPFs generate skilled and well-paying jobs. In 2016, FGPFs accounted for around 2,700 jobs in the manufacturing sector. Around two-thirds of these jobs were filled by Singaporeans. About 80% of the 2,700 jobs were skilled jobs that provide higher salaries for the workers."
2018-09-10-T-060-S-00920,2018-09-10-T-060,920,Chan Chun Sing,"Third, FGPFs conduct R&D with local contract manufacturers and equipment suppliers to jointly develop advanced production processes. Such partnerships help to strengthen the capabilities and competitiveness of our manufacturing sector."
2018-09-10-T-060-S-00921,2018-09-10-T-060,921,Chan Chun Sing,"Manufacturing remains an important part of Singapore's economy. The Government will continue to strengthen and upgrade our manufacturing capabilities by attracting investments in both production and production-related services, and helping Singapore companies to raise their productivity and move into higher-value manufacturing activities."
2018-09-10-T-061-S-00922,2018-09-10-T-061,922,Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the impact to local businesses especially SMEs of Singaporeans and permanent residents shopping in Malaysia and Johore in particular.
2018-09-10-T-061-S-00923,2018-09-10-T-061,923,Chan Chun Sing,The Government does not have data on overseas spending by Singaporeans and permanent residents.
2018-09-10-T-061-S-00924,2018-09-10-T-061,924,Chan Chun Sing,"Singapore retailers face competition not just from shops in Malaysia, but also from other countries due to online shopping and more convenient air connections. This increases competition for local businesses, but it benefits Singapore consumers."
2018-09-10-T-061-S-00925,2018-09-10-T-061,925,Chan Chun Sing,"Competition is a two-way street. Our businesses can also draw customers from overseas by offering greater value, higher quality products, or better service levels. Indeed, tourist spending on shopping in Singapore has grown by 4% from 2016 to 2017."
2018-09-10-T-061-S-00926,2018-09-10-T-061,926,Chan Chun Sing,"Some of our SMEs have developed creative marketing strategies. For example, home grown furniture brand Commune has a retail experience centre at Defu Lane that enhances the shopping experience of its customers. The retail experience centre's 3D floor planner and virtual reality simulation allow customers to recreate their homes and visualise Commune's furniture within their spaces."
2018-09-10-T-061-S-00927,2018-09-10-T-061,927,Chan Chun Sing,"The Singapore economy has thrived because of competition. It drives us to improve our capabilities and up our game, including expanding our international presence and exporting our products and services to overseas markets."
2018-09-10-T-062-S-00928,2018-09-10-T-062,928,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Transport whether measures can be introduced to deal with personal mobility devices and vehicle users who blare loud music or sounds thereby causing annoyance whilst travelling in or along public areas, pathways and roads."
2018-09-10-T-062-S-00929,2018-09-10-T-062,929,Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA encourages all users of personal mobility devices and vehicle drivers to be considerate and gracious to others. As individuals, we should also be prepared to advise and nudge one another against ungracious behaviours."
2018-09-10-T-063-S-00930,2018-09-10-T-063,930,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what measures is the Ministry implementing in areas with a high number of elderly accidents; and (b) whether the Ministry will install the necessary preventive features to ensure our elderly remain safe.
2018-09-10-T-063-S-00931,2018-09-10-T-063,931,Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA implements Silver Zones at areas where there have been senior pedestrian accidents and at areas with a high proportion of senior residents and senior amenities such as medical establishments. Silver Zones improve road safety for seniors by slowing down traffic and alerting motorists to keep a look-out for pedestrians. Features include a reduced speed limit of 40km/h, speed bumps, ramps and barrier-free crossings, enhanced street lighting and longer green man timing. Silver Zones also have centre dividers to narrow lanes and reduce traffic speeds. The results from the existing 15 Silver Zones around the island have been very encouraging, with a 75% drop in the accidents involving the elderly."
2018-09-10-T-063-S-00932,2018-09-10-T-063,932,Khaw Boon Wan,"We target to complete another six Silver Zones by the end of this year, and will aim to have a total of 50 Silver Zones by 2023. As and when the need arises, we are also prepared to provide more Silver Zones."
2018-09-10-T-064-S-00933,2018-09-10-T-064,933,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,asked the Minister for Health what percentage of long-term care workers are Singaporeans and what is being done to improve long-term care workers' salary and career prospects.
2018-09-10-T-064-S-00934,2018-09-10-T-064,934,Gan Kim Yong,"Based on data submitted last year by long-term care (LTC) providers receiving government subvention, about 4 in 10 workers in the sector were locals. The proportion of locals varies across care settings within the LTC sector. Home and centre-based care settings have a higher proportion of locals than in residential care facilities such as nursing homes, where workers have to do shift work and care for less ambulant clients."
2018-09-10-T-064-S-00935,2018-09-10-T-064,935,Gan Kim Yong,"As the LTC sector grows and evolves, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) have stepped up our efforts to improve career prospects and salaries of LTC workers, as well as strengthened our support for skills development and productivity improvement."
2018-09-10-T-064-S-00936,2018-09-10-T-064,936,Gan Kim Yong,"MOH works closely with AIC to provide scholarships and grants, to make training opportunities more accessible to workers. For instance, training subsidies are provided to support workers' development in areas such as clinical skills, leadership and people management through basic modular courses offered by AIC-appointed Learning Institutes. Service providers can also tap on the Community Care Manpower Development Award to sponsor staff for advanced formal training in nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, social work and healthcare management."
2018-09-10-T-064-S-00937,2018-09-10-T-064,937,Gan Kim Yong,"MOH has also been supporting the LTC sector in process improvements, adoption of technology and use of assistive equipment under the Healthcare Productivity Fund (HPF). These efforts aim to facilitate job redesign, increase worker productivity, improve career prospects of employees, as well as allow employers to raise their salaries."
2018-09-10-T-064-S-00938,2018-09-10-T-064,938,Gan Kim Yong,"In tandem with our support for skills upgrading and productivity improvement efforts, MOH has extended over $200 million to raise the salaries of LTC staff across 59 LTC service providers between 2012 and 2017. This has led to an average increase of local LTC workers’ salaries by around 30% across providers that tapped on our funding support over this period."
2018-09-10-T-064-S-00939,2018-09-10-T-064,939,Gan Kim Yong,"Going forward, MOH is also working closely with SkillsFuture Singapore to develop a Healthcare Skills Framework which will articulate the roles, skills and competencies for each job role at different levels. Providers can use this framework as a reference to guide progression of staff in the healthcare industry, including the LTC sector."
2018-09-10-T-064-S-00940,2018-09-10-T-064,940,Gan Kim Yong,We will continue to work with LTC providers to improve career opportunities and regularly review salaries of LTC staff to ensure that they are adequately recognised for their contributions.
2018-09-10-T-065-S-00941,2018-09-10-T-065,941,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked the Minister for Health (a) how many seniors are currently receiving home personal care (HPC) services and how long is the current waiting list; (b) on average, how much are they paying and how much subsidies are they receiving; and (c) on average, whether subsidised nursing home care is cheaper than subsidised HPC services."
2018-09-10-T-065-S-00942,2018-09-10-T-065,942,Gan Kim Yong,MOH works with our partners to provide a range of services to support seniors who need care services.
2018-09-10-T-065-S-00943,2018-09-10-T-065,943,Gan Kim Yong,"Currently, around 1,700 seniors receive Home Personal Care (HPC) services which assist them with Activities of Daily Living (for example, showering and feeding), light housekeeping, grocery shopping, elder-sitting as well as provide mind stimulating activities for them. Overall, there is no wait list across service providers."
2018-09-10-T-065-S-00944,2018-09-10-T-065,944,Gan Kim Yong,"These services are usually charged on an hourly basis and the duration varies according to the care needs of the senior. HPC fees are around $23 per hour on average, before subsidies. For eligible seniors, subsidies of up to 80% are available. HPC providers also extend community and financial support to seniors who require further assistance."
2018-09-10-T-065-S-00945,2018-09-10-T-065,945,Gan Kim Yong,"Nursing homes typically serve seniors who have higher care needs or are more frail, and it would not be meaningful to compare the cost of nursing home services directly with that of HPC services. Those who face financial difficulties can approach the Medical Social Workers for financial assistance, including tapping on MediFund."
2018-09-10-T-066-S-00946,2018-09-10-T-066,946,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether holders of Class 4 driving licences can be exempted from the proficiency driving test when they reach the age of 65 years.
2018-09-10-T-066-S-00947,2018-09-10-T-066,947,K Shanmugam,"An individual’s ability to operate a vehicle safely may be affected with age. Hence, Traffic Police (""TP"") requires all motorists above the age of 65 to have their fitness to drive certified."
2018-09-10-T-066-S-00948,2018-09-10-T-066,948,K Shanmugam,Motorists licensed to operate motorcycles or light vehicles such as passenger cars are required to undergo a prescribed medical examination once every three years when they turn 65.
2018-09-10-T-066-S-00949,2018-09-10-T-066,949,K Shanmugam,"However, those who are licensed to operate heavy vehicles are required to undergo a prescribed medical examination and a proficiency driving test annually when they turn 65. Past the age of 70, they are required to undergo enhanced versions of the medical examination and proficiency driving test, still on an annual basis."
2018-09-10-T-067-S-00950,2018-09-10-T-067,950,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there is a specific period for a traffic summons to be issued to a driver/offender as in-car evidence or human recall of the incident may be lost after a certain period after the incident.
2018-09-10-T-067-S-00951,2018-09-10-T-067,951,K Shanmugam,"Traffic Police, Land Transport Authority, Urban Redevelopment Authority and Housing Development Board issue traffic and parking summonses, only when there is strong evidence that the recipient has committed an offence."
2018-09-10-T-067-S-00952,2018-09-10-T-067,952,K Shanmugam,"In cases where the offender is the vehicle owner, he would be notified of the offence within a week."
2018-09-10-T-067-S-00953,2018-09-10-T-067,953,K Shanmugam,"In cases where the offender is not the vehicle owner, he would be notified of the offence within six weeks or so. More time is required, as the agency needs to establish his identity, based on the information provided by the vehicle owner and other relevant facts."
2018-09-10-T-067-S-00954,2018-09-10-T-067,954,K Shanmugam,"The above time norms may not apply, in scenarios where the offence was reported by members of the public without strong accompanying evidence. In such cases, the relevant agency will conduct an investigation to establish the facts of the case."
2018-09-10-T-068-S-00955,2018-09-10-T-068,955,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) when will the Ministry make public the full findings of the animal monitoring programme conducted at the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, such as the number or frequency of animal sightings before and after the site investigation works; and (b) whether the site investigation works have resulted in a ""mainly moderate impact"" on the environment, which the environmental impact assessment has projected will happen if mitigation measures are taken."
2018-09-10-T-068-S-00956,2018-09-10-T-068,956,Khaw Boon Wan,"In June 2018, LTA announced the completion of Site Investigations for two underground alignments being studied for the Cross Island Line (CRL) in the vicinity of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR). These investigations took place between May 2016 and September 2017, and were the first steps in assessing the feasibility of the two alignment options – under or skirting round the CCNR."
2018-09-10-T-068-S-00957,2018-09-10-T-068,957,Khaw Boon Wan,"Site Investigation works included drilling of boreholes. As some of the drilling was conducted in the ecologically sensitive CCNR, a fauna monitoring programme was developed by LTA, in consultation with NParks and Nature Groups. This consisted of camera traps, which are motion-activated sensors, and transect surveys, which are manual surveys of animal sightings in a specified region. The data collected is being analysed by a professional Environmental Impact Assessment consultant. Initial findings have also been shared with NParks and Nature Group representatives, whose comments are being incorporated to further improve the analysis. LTA will share the results of the analysis, when ready, after consulting the Nature Groups."
2018-09-10-T-068-S-00958,2018-09-10-T-068,958,Khaw Boon Wan,"In addition to fauna monitoring, environmental monitoring for water, noise and light pollution and waste management were put in place. Project management protocols and impact mitigation measures were strictly followed, with compliance monitored weekly to ensure that the environmental impact of Site Investigations was minimized. While the full impact of site investigations is being studied, the camera traps picked up the presence of animals like the Sunda Pangolin and Lesser Mousedeer after the completion of Site Investigation works."
2018-09-10-T-069-S-00959,2018-09-10-T-069,959,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Minister for Transport whether a re-route of existing bus services or additional stops for certain hours or a new bus loop service which ply through Boon Lay Place and the Jurong West parts of Boon Lay constituency can be introduced so that residents living in the Jurong West side of Boon Lay can commute to Boon Lay Place (where most of the community facilities are located) more conveniently and vice versa.
2018-09-10-T-069-S-00960,2018-09-10-T-069,960,Khaw Boon Wan,"Currently, commuters can travel between Boon Lay Place and Jurong West via a direct public bus service, that is, Service 99 or within one bus transfer. As the area is adequately served by existing bus services, there are no plans to roll out new services or to amend existing services. LTA has to be mindful that many commuters could be negatively affected if existing bus services are amended."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00961,2018-09-10-T-070,961,Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether phone scams by callers claiming to be government officials have a different modus operandi from other scams; (b) if so, how is the Ministry helping particularly vulnerable residents, such as the elderly, to quickly check the veracity of these phone calls; and (c) how else the Government is working with overseas enforcement agencies to strengthen detection and enforcement in respect of these scams."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00962,2018-09-10-T-070,962,K Shanmugam,A significant proportion of phone scams are committed by foreign syndicates. The modus operandi usually involve the following steps
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00963,2018-09-10-T-070,963,K Shanmugam,"(a) The perpetrator will claim to be officials from foreign countries, without providing enough information about themselves for the victims to be able to verify their identity."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00964,2018-09-10-T-070,964,K Shanmugam,"(b) The perpetrator will ask the victim to make payments over the phone, and to give bank details, credit card numbers, OTP codes from tokens or passport numbers."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00965,2018-09-10-T-070,965,K Shanmugam,"These phone scams are similar to other forms of scam, in that they exploit the vulnerabilities of potential victims."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00966,2018-09-10-T-070,966,K Shanmugam,Individuals can adopt the following measures to avoid being a victim
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00967,2018-09-10-T-070,967,K Shanmugam,"(a) First, they should exercise vigilance when dealing with unsolicited phone calls, letters or emails, including those purportedly from Government officials or law enforcement agencies. They should not give their personal and banking details to strangers, and should bear in mind that most governments will not ask for payments over the phone."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00968,2018-09-10-T-070,968,K Shanmugam,"(b) Secondly, they can call the authorities that the callers claimed themselves to be from, to ascertain the authenticity of the phone call, letter or email. They can also call the Anti-Scam Helpline at 1800-722-6688 or visit www.scamalert.sg run by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC)."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00969,2018-09-10-T-070,969,K Shanmugam,"Police have worked with stakeholders such as convenience stores, remittance agencies and banks, to raise their awareness, and to put in place prevention measures. This includes training frontline counter staff to spot scam victims, and displaying crime advisories prominently at the counters and automated teller machines. These efforts have resulted in heightened awareness and vigilance amongst their staff, which helped prevent at least 30 scams involving more than $370,000 in 2017."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00970,2018-09-10-T-070,970,K Shanmugam,"Police also use traditional and social media to educate the public on scams, and tailor their approach depending on the target audience. For instance, for the elderly, Police worked with the NCPC to appoint Li Nanxing, a popular local artiste, as our Honorary Crime Prevention Ambassador. A series of TV & radio commercials on scam alerts featuring Li Nanxing, were produced and aired, with corresponding graphics in newspapers and posters."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00971,2018-09-10-T-070,971,K Shanmugam,"Recognising that some elderly may not be reached through newspapers and posters, Police officers also conduct house visits regularly to spread crime prevention messages, and work with Residents’ Committees and grassroots volunteers to reach out to the elderly through community events like block parties, and during festive events."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00972,2018-09-10-T-070,972,K Shanmugam,"To disrupt foreign syndicates at source, the Police share information with their foreign partners. In addition, the Police make efforts to disrupt money flows back to the foreign syndicates. Since January 2018, 22 persons have been arrested and charged in Court for acting as money mules. Of these, 6 have been convicted."
2018-09-10-T-070-S-00973,2018-09-10-T-070,973,K Shanmugam,"I urge Singaporeans to remain alert and vigilant against scams. Family members and friends can prevent a person from falling victim to scams in the first place, as well as prevent any losses, if they intervene early enough."
2018-09-10-T-071-S-00974,2018-09-10-T-071,974,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide an update on the registration of e-bicycles, e-scooters and other power-assisted personal mobility devices in terms of (i) the number registered (ii) the number of violations and (iii) the number of offenders charged."
2018-09-10-T-071-S-00975,2018-09-10-T-071,975,Khaw Boon Wan,"About 13,300 power-assisted bicycles (PABs) have been registered so far. The registration regime for PABs commenced in August 2017."
2018-09-10-T-071-S-00976,2018-09-10-T-071,976,Khaw Boon Wan,"We will implement a registration regime for e-scooters early next year. Other types of personal mobility devices (PMDs), such as hoverboards and unicycles, will not be subjected to the registration regime as their usage is less widespread and their speeds are lower when used."
2018-09-10-T-071-S-00977,2018-09-10-T-071,977,Khaw Boon Wan,"Since the start of the year, there were about 650 offences involving PABs including the use of non-compliant PABs."
2018-09-10-T-071-S-00978,2018-09-10-T-071,978,Khaw Boon Wan,"After the Active Mobility Act commenced on 1 May 2018, which provided for enforcement powers, there were over 700 offences involving PMDs, including the use of non-compliant PMDs and speeding offences. LTA does not have records on the number of offenders charged."
2018-09-10-T-072-S-00979,2018-09-10-T-072,979,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether road resurfacing work is on a scheduled or condition basis; (b) whether there is a prescribed standard on the quality of road resurfacing work; and (c) whether there is central coordination to minimise repeated road surfacing work along the same road over a short period of time.
2018-09-10-T-072-S-00980,2018-09-10-T-072,980,Khaw Boon Wan,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) regularly inspects our roads to ensure their serviceability, and will resurface roads if their surfaces are found to be in poor condition. Road resurfacing may also be required on an ad-hoc basis to repair damage caused by accidents, or to rectify defects such as potholes that require immediate rectification. Finally, road resurfacing is also required after utility laying works are conducted."
2018-09-10-T-072-S-00981,2018-09-10-T-072,981,Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA adheres to international standards when resurfacing roads, such as the International Roughness Index which measures the riding quality of roads."
2018-09-10-T-072-S-00982,2018-09-10-T-072,982,Khaw Boon Wan,"The Road Opening Coordination Committee (ROCC), which is chaired by LTA, centrally coordinates all road resurfacing works among different agencies to minimise repeated road resurfacing works along the same road over a short period of time."
2018-09-10-T-073-S-00983,2018-09-10-T-073,983,Lim Biow Chuan,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether there can be a co-ordinating body for the organisation of all mass sports activities to ensure that organisers do not create traffic shutdown for residents and that there be no loud music being played in the middle of the night."
2018-09-10-T-073-S-00984,2018-09-10-T-073,984,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"There is close coordination among Government agencies to assess requests involving mass sports activities. For those requiring road closures or traffic diversion, the event organisers have to submit plans for approval by the Traffic Police and the Land Transport Authority, and will also have to obtain a letter of support from Sport Singapore. Organisers are also required to engage affected stakeholders, such as residents and businesses, and advise them of the road closure timings and alternative vehicular access to the area."
2018-09-10-T-073-S-00985,2018-09-10-T-073,985,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"MCCY notes the Member's suggestion for a coordinating body for the organisation of mass sports activities, and will be engaging him to study this suggestion."
2018-09-10-T-074-S-00986,2018-09-10-T-074,986,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether physical punishments of servicemen by way of enforced physical exercises or physical drills for disciplinary infringements are still allowed in the SAF; and (b) if not, when have such punishments been prohibited in the SAF."
2018-09-10-T-074-S-00987,2018-09-10-T-074,987,Ng Eng Hen,"Physical exercises in the form of push-ups and sit-ups, or foot drills, and non-physical punishment such as additional duties and weekend confinements, can be meted out by SAF commanders as disciplinary measures to soldiers for their disorderly behaviour and improper attire. These forms of discipline are strictly prescribed in the SAF's Joint Manpower Directive which states the number of repetitions that are allowed for specific exercises, the number and duration of additional duties or confinement and the seniority of the commander who are allowed to mete out such disciplinary measures."
2018-09-10-T-074-S-00988,2018-09-10-T-074,988,Ng Eng Hen,"SAF personnel who mete out unauthorised punishments, or have wilfully or negligently infringed training safety regulations in the conduct of punishment, have been dealt with and prosecuted within the SAF or criminal prosecution in the State Courts."
2018-09-10-T-075-S-00989,2018-09-10-T-075,989,Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Finance how can the Government better assist or advise businesses which have been deceived or misled into signing contracts with companies purporting to be authorised Government agencies or authorised company registrars.
2018-09-10-T-075-S-00990,2018-09-10-T-075,990,Heng Swee Keat,"The Government takes a firm stand against any company that impersonates a government agency or an authorised company registrar. In Singapore's context, the authorised company registrar is the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). ACRA is the statutory body responsible for the registration of companies and businesses in Singapore, and will not hesitate to investigate suspected breaches and prosecute offenders."
2018-09-10-T-075-S-00991,2018-09-10-T-075,991,Heng Swee Keat,"There are safeguards against a company that tries to pass off as a government entity. Companies and other business entities are required to state their name and registration number in all business correspondences, so that members of the public know the identity of the business entity that they are interacting with. ACRA takes any breach of this requirement seriously. Such a breach can be liable for a fine of up to S$1,000. In the past six years, ACRA has, upon receiving complaints, investigated seven business entities for failing to properly state their name and/or registration number."
2018-09-10-T-075-S-00992,2018-09-10-T-075,992,Heng Swee Keat,"To protect themselves, businesses are reminded to exercise vigilance when dealing with any unsolicited letter or email from companies purporting to be authorised Government agencies or authorised company registrars. Letters from government agencies have distinct letterheads, with their names and logos. When in doubt, businesses should contact the government agency. They can use the free business entity search function on ACRA's website to verify the identity of the entity they are dealing with. Businesses should peruse carefully all the terms and conditions before entering into any form of agreement."
2018-09-10-T-075-S-00993,2018-09-10-T-075,993,Heng Swee Keat,"ACRA, in collaboration with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), has an online guide for consumers, which includes a checklist on what consumers should watch out for before making business decisions and how they can use ACRA's business information services to conduct background checks on business entities. This guide, available on ACRA's website, includes advice on how to distinguish if the correspondences are from businesses or government agencies."
2018-09-10-T-075-S-00994,2018-09-10-T-075,994,Heng Swee Keat,Businesses and consumers should alert ACRA if there are any suspected wrongdoings or misrepresentations by companies purporting to be authorised Government agencies or authorised company registrars. They should also make a police report.
2018-09-10-T-075-S-00995,2018-09-10-T-075,995,Heng Swee Keat,"In short, be alert, check and if necessary, report."
2018-09-10-T-076-S-00996,2018-09-10-T-076,996,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry monitors the amounts of microbeads in reservoirs, tap water, and discharge into the ocean; (b) what percentage of microbeads is removed during the water treatment process; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider banning cosmetics that contain microbeads."
2018-09-10-T-076-S-00997,2018-09-10-T-076,997,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB has in place a comprehensive water quality monitoring programme to ensure that our potable water supply complies with regulations and international standards, and is safe for drinking. Microplastics, which include microbeads, are removed at our waterworks that treat water for potable supply. At our NEWater and desalination plants, microplastics are removed using reverse osmosis membranes. Monitoring by PUB shows that our drinking water is free from microplastics."
2018-09-10-T-076-S-00998,2018-09-10-T-076,998,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB also ensures that all used water is collected and treated at water reclamation plants to internationally recognised discharge standards. During the treatment process, microplastics in used water will be substantially removed as sludge and incinerated. The bulk of the treated used water is further processed and reclaimed as NEWater. As a result of these processes, only a miniscule amount of microplastics is discharged into the sea. Nevertheless, PUB is looking into incorporating membrane bioreactor technology in our used water treatment process to further improve the microplastics removal rate."
2018-09-10-T-076-S-00999,2018-09-10-T-076,999,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We are monitoring international developments on microplastics, including microbeads in cosmetics. The National Environment Agency encourages businesses to reduce the use of microbeads in their products. Multinational corporations, such as Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, L'Oreal Group, Colgate-Palmolive, and Estee Lauder Company, have voluntarily phased out microbeads in their products. Major local retailers such as Guardian Singapore, Watsons and NTUC Fairprice, have also indicated that they have phased out microbeads in their house-brand products."
2018-09-10-T-076-S-01000,2018-09-10-T-076,1000,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We are committed to keeping our watercourses free from pollution, and will continue to review the effectiveness of our regulatory and monitoring regime in safeguarding our water resources and the environment."
2018-09-10-T-077-S-01001,2018-09-10-T-077,1001,Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the current progress of the conversion to digital TV; and (b) what are the plans to increase awareness and hasten the conversion.
2018-09-10-T-077-S-01002,2018-09-10-T-077,1002,S Iswaran,Today about four in five
2018-09-10-T-077-S-01003,2018-09-10-T-077,1003,S Iswaran,"In April this year, IMDA launched the DTV Starter Kit to encourage more households to be DTV-ready. The DTV Starter Kit allows Singaporean HDB households without a Pay TV subscription to redeem an indoor DTV antenna and digital set-top box with free installation, or enjoy $100 off selected DTV equipment at participating electronics stores. As of 31 Aug 2018, more than 207,000 households have redeemed their DTV Starter Kits. I encourage all households who have not yet redeemed their DTV Starter Kits to do so right away."
2018-09-10-T-077-S-01004,2018-09-10-T-077,1004,S Iswaran,"IMDA has also been working closely with community partners like the People's Association, the Silver Generation Office and Voluntary Welfare Organisations to help households become DTV-ready. This includes organising roadshows in every town, deploying service counters in high-traffic areas such as markets, hawker centres and community clubs, and conducting briefings at community events. Since June, Mediacorp has also run on-screen crawlers to inform those who are still viewing analogue channels to switch to DTV. Mediacorp will soon reduce the size of the screen area displaying content on analogue channels, which we hope will remind viewers to switch over to DTV early."
2018-09-10-T-078-S-01005,2018-09-10-T-078,1005,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether a central developmental authority should be set up to support the early intervention sector to improve coordination, collaboration and resource allocation; and (b) whether there are plans to train mainstream preschool teachers to work with children with special needs."
2018-09-10-T-078-S-01006,2018-09-10-T-078,1006,Desmond Lee,"The Disability Office within the Ministry of Social and Family Development coordinates the planning, development, resourcing and service delivery of programmes for persons with disabilities, including Early Intervention services. The Disability Office works closely with the hospitals, polyclinics and preschools, for the timely detection of children with developmental needs. The Office also works closely with the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), SG Enable, Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) providers of early intervention services, and with preschools to provide early intervention services to children with developmental needs, and caregiver training for their families."
2018-09-10-T-078-S-01007,2018-09-10-T-078,1007,Desmond Lee,"The Ministry also oversees service management for early intervention services to ensure that service standards are met. It also works with key partners, including the National Council of Social Service and Institutes of Higher Learning, to support the early intervention sector through coordinating manpower planning, capability development for early intervention professionals and setting salary guidelines."
2018-09-10-T-078-S-01008,2018-09-10-T-078,1008,Desmond Lee,"All early childhood educators are trained in the development milestones of young children. As part of their pre-service training, they are also introduced to various forms of special needs in young children, including cognitive, behavioural, emotional and sensory characteristics. They are also briefed on the availability of community resources and professionals that provide support for these children."
2018-09-10-T-078-S-01009,2018-09-10-T-078,1009,Desmond Lee,"In line with their training, early childhood educators who notice a child falling behind his/her development milestones will advise parents to bring the child to a Polyclinic or GP for referral to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) or to the National University Hospital (NUH) Child Development Programme for further assessment."
2018-09-10-T-078-S-01010,2018-09-10-T-078,1010,Desmond Lee,ECDA has also worked with educational institutes and training providers to offer Continuing Professional Development modular courses to existing early childhood educators to be equipped with further skills to better support children with a range of developmental needs.
2018-09-10-T-078-S-01011,2018-09-10-T-078,1011,Desmond Lee,"In addition, early childhood educators may take up the Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Intervention (Special Needs) or the Specialist Diploma in Early Childhood Learning Support at National Institute of Early Childhood Development campus to gain specialised knowledge and skills to identify and work with children with additional needs. The Specialist Diploma will allow early childhood educators to become Learning Support Educators (LSEds), who are able to identify children with developmental needs in relation to their peers, and to deliver the appropriate intervention in the preschool setting, also known as the Learning Support (LS) and Development Support (DS) programmes. LS and DS are Government-funded early intervention programmes for children with mild developmental needs and provide targeted short-term support through LSEds and therapists in the preschools. LSEds also collaborate with the main early childhood educators of the classes in preschools to adapt teaching methods and activities to better engage children with mild development needs in the classroom. This is critical in sustaining the progress made by the child after the interventions."
2018-09-10-T-078-S-01012,2018-09-10-T-078,1012,Desmond Lee,"Over the next four years, MSF will expand LS and DS to more preschools and build up a pool of 200 LSEds to provide targeted intervention and learning support for children with developmental needs in preschools. This will support more early childhood educators in the care and education for their children."
2018-09-10-T-079-S-01013,2018-09-10-T-079,1013,Chong Kee Hiong,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry will review our kindergarten curriculum to evaluate if the exposure to mother tongues among our young is adequate; and (b) what measures will be introduced to strengthen their foundation in these increasingly important languages.
2018-09-10-T-079-S-01014,2018-09-10-T-079,1014,Ong Ye Kung,"MOE, in consultation with early childhood educators as well as local and international experts, has developed the Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework and Educators’ Guides for Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) to support education for pre-school children."
2018-09-10-T-079-S-01015,2018-09-10-T-079,1015,Ong Ye Kung,"The Framework articulates a broad set of vision, objectives, guiding principles and learning goals, including enabling children to learn and use MTL."
2018-09-10-T-079-S-01016,2018-09-10-T-079,1016,Ong Ye Kung,"Today, MOE Kindergartens offer all three MTLs. Every day, one hour of lesson time is dedicated to MTL. This has not been adopted by all pre-schools but more will expand their offering of MTLs in the coming few years."
2018-09-10-T-079-S-01017,2018-09-10-T-079,1017,Ong Ye Kung,"Beyond classroom exposure, the MTL Promotion Committees and Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism have also supported various programmes to encourage MTL use at home and in everyday setting. These efforts, together with the support of community and parents, will provide a conducive environment for our children to learn MTL."
2018-09-10-T-080-S-01018,2018-09-10-T-080,1018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether Careshield Life is subjected to the Insurance Act; and (b) if not, how will the Government ensure that the premiums collected are properly managed and payouts made available when claims arise."
2018-09-10-T-080-S-01019,2018-09-10-T-080,1019,Gan Kim Yong,CareShield Life will not be subject to the Insurance Act as it will be administered by the Government.
2018-09-10-T-080-S-01020,2018-09-10-T-080,1020,Gan Kim Yong,"However, the Government will ensure that CareShield Life is managed in line with relevant regulatory requirements that MAS sets for private insurance companies, including measures to ensure solvency. This is similar to how the MediShield Life scheme is managed today."
2018-09-10-T-080-S-01021,2018-09-10-T-080,1021,Gan Kim Yong,"To ensure the proper governance of premiums collected for CareShield Life, the Government intends to enact new legislation for CareShield Life in 2019. The new CareShield Life legislation will provide for the setting up of a CareShield Life Fund. All CareShield Life premiums collected, along with any investment returns from these premiums, will remain entirely within the Fund. The Fund will be used solely for the benefit of policyholders. It will be audited annually and the financial accounts made public to ensure that all the monies are accounted for."
2018-09-10-T-080-S-01022,2018-09-10-T-080,1022,Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, the Government also intends to legislate the setting up of an independent Council to provide advice on the administration of the CareShield Life scheme. The Council will regularly review and recommend changes in premiums and payouts, in accordance with an actuarially sound adjustment framework. If claims are higher than projected, the Council could recommend raising premiums or slowing down payout increases. Conversely, if claims are lower than expected, the Council could recommend payout increases, slower premium increases, or to return surpluses to policyholders as premium rebates. This legislated arrangement will help safeguard the long-term sustainability of the Fund."
2018-09-10-T-081-S-01023,2018-09-10-T-081,1023,Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how much has HDB spent in its upgrading programme for home owners in 2017 as compared to 2007; (b) how many home owners benefited from the upgrading works; and (c) how have these works translated to enhancing the value of the flats.
2018-09-10-T-081-S-01024,2018-09-10-T-081,1024,Lawrence Wong,"The estimated expenditure spent in FY2017 on all HDB upgrading programmes was about $590 million. In FY2007, the total amount spent was about $580 million."
2018-09-10-T-081-S-01025,2018-09-10-T-081,1025,Lawrence Wong,"If we look at just the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) and the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) alone, about 253,000 flats have benefited from the upgrading works so far, out of a total of 450,000 eligible flats built up to 1986. Another 230,000 flats will benefit from the extension of HIP to cover the flats built between 1987 and 1997."
2018-09-10-T-081-S-01026,2018-09-10-T-081,1026,Lawrence Wong,"Upgrading works enhance the value of the flat in several ways, depending on the type of upgrading work. Under programmes such as the Lift Upgrading Programme and the Remaking our Heartland Programme, the Government builds new amenities which improve the living environment, and result in more convenience to residents and added vibrancy to the area. As for programmes such as the HIP, the Government heavily subsidises the works to help resolve common maintenance problems of aging flats. By keeping the flats in good condition, HIP helps flats maintain their value even as they age. Without HIP, potential buyers of older flats and flat owners would have to undertake the works themselves, which can cost up to about $25,000 per flat."
2018-09-10-T-082-S-01027,2018-09-10-T-082,1027,Alex Yam,"asked the Minister for National Development in light of the various new initiatives on public housing, whether the Ministry can clarify what HDB flat owners at different life stages should do to ensure that they will have a home for life and also an adequate nest-egg for retirement."
2018-09-10-T-082-S-01028,2018-09-10-T-082,1028,Lawrence Wong,The Government has put in place strong support for Singaporeans to meet their housing needs across different life stages.
2018-09-10-T-082-S-01029,2018-09-10-T-082,1029,Lawrence Wong,"We are committed to helping young Singaporeans own their homes, just like previous generations of Singaporeans. We will ensure HDB flats are kept affordable for first-timers, by selling them at subsidised prices and providing generous housing grants.  In this way, Singaporeans will continue to have a tangible stake in the nation’s progress, and their housing asset will appreciate as the economy grows."
2018-09-10-T-082-S-01030,2018-09-10-T-082,1030,Lawrence Wong,"With evolving life circumstances, some families may subsequently choose to move to a larger flat, or near their parents or children for mutual care and support. They should be in a good position to do so, as they would have enjoyed some appreciation from their first flat. We also have schemes to help them live near their parents or married children, such as the Proximity Housing Grant, which was enhanced earlier this year."
2018-09-10-T-082-S-01031,2018-09-10-T-082,1031,Lawrence Wong,"For seniors, the HDB flat provides a nest-egg for retirement. The Government is committed to providing home owners with many options to unlock the value of the flats for their retirement needs. For example, seniors can rent out a spare bedroom or right-size to a smaller flat and apply for the Silver Housing Bonus. They can also sell part of their lease to HDB under the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS). We recently announced the extension of LBS to five-room and larger flats so that more Singaporeans can benefit from the scheme."
2018-09-10-T-082-S-01032,2018-09-10-T-082,1032,Lawrence Wong,"Government upgrading programmes will also help to maintain the value of the HDB flats, and ensure they remain safe and liveable through their lifespan. We will implement the Home Improvement Programme for the next batch of flats built between 1987 and 1997; and will undertake a second round of HIP upgrading for HDB flats when they are about 60 to 70 years old."
2018-09-10-T-082-S-01033,2018-09-10-T-082,1033,Lawrence Wong,"The Government has announced ambitious housing plans for the next few decades. Singaporeans can do their part too, by planning ahead and making informed housing choices. Working together, we can continue to strengthen public housing and home ownership for current and future generations of Singaporeans."
2018-09-10-T-083-S-01034,2018-09-10-T-083,1034,Cheng Li Hui,asked the Prime Minister with regard to the 11 sectors identified to review their connections to untrusted external network (a) what is the timeframe for the sectors to complete their review; (b) whether Government grants and funding will be provided to assist companies in these sectors to beef up their cybersecurity capabilities; and (c) how does the Government plan to work with these companies to ensure that they stay vigilant.
2018-09-10-T-083-S-01035,2018-09-10-T-083,1035,Lee Hsien Loong,"In light of the recent cyber-attack on SingHealth’s computer systems, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) instructed the 11 Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) sectors to strengthen their network security, including taking the following steps"
2018-09-10-T-083-S-01036,2018-09-10-T-083,1036,Lee Hsien Loong,Remove all connections to unsecured external networks if there are no strong business or operational reasons to keep such connections open.
2018-09-10-T-083-S-01037,2018-09-10-T-083,1037,Lee Hsien Loong,"If connections to unsecured external networks are required, these should ideally be mediated through uni-directional gateways, for example, data diodes to prevent data leakage."
2018-09-10-T-083-S-01038,2018-09-10-T-083,1038,Lee Hsien Loong,"If two-way communications between the secured network and unsecured external network is required, a secured informational gateway has to be implemented, such as filters for malicious content and firewalls."
2018-09-10-T-083-S-01039,2018-09-10-T-083,1039,Lee Hsien Loong,"The 11 CII sectors are currently conducting a review of their systems, in consultation with CSA. This process will be completed by the end of 2018."
2018-09-10-T-083-S-01040,2018-09-10-T-083,1040,Lee Hsien Loong,"The Government will continue to review the essential security measures that CII owners must adopt. Ultimately, these security measures must strike a balance between security, operational efficiency and cost. This is a dynamic balance that will be reviewed as the threat landscape evolves."
2018-09-10-T-083-S-01041,2018-09-10-T-083,1041,Lee Hsien Loong,"In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity is critical to protecting business operations and strengthening trust between businesses and their customers. The Government will therefore not be providing grants or funding to CII owners to comply with cybersecurity requirements and implement such cybersecurity measures which should be borne by companies as part of normal business costs. Nevertheless, the Government and CSA will continue working closely with CII owners and businesses to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. This includes rendering professional advice to businesses, and working with the industry to provide affordable and convenient cybersecurity services to companies. In addition, the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) will continue to educate the public and businesses on how to protect themselves in cyberspace. Businesses and members of the public can visit SingCERT at www.csa.gov.sg/singcert and Gosafeonline at www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline for cybersecurity advisories and tips."
2018-09-10-T-084-S-01042,2018-09-10-T-084,1042,Leon Perera,"asked the Prime Minister in each of the past five years, what has been the bonus paid to Cabinet Ministers in terms of (i) the average total number of bonus months (ii) the highest total number of bonus months paid to an individual Minister and (iii) the lowest total number of bonus months paid to an individual Minister."
2018-09-10-T-084-S-01043,2018-09-10-T-084,1043,Lee Hsien Loong,"The average Performance Bonus (PB), and the range of PB received by Political Office Holders of all grades over the past five years were"
2018-09-10-T-084-S-01044,2018-09-10-T-084,1044,Lee Hsien Loong,"The pay components of political office holders are set out in the White Paper on ""Salaries for a Capable and Committed Government"" tabled in Parliament in 2012. Apart from monthly salary, the salary components include 13th month Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance, Performance Bonus, National Bonus, and Annual Variable Component as paid to civil servants. The benchmark salaries take all these components into account."
2018-09-10-T-084-S-01045,2018-09-10-T-084,1045,Lee Hsien Loong,"The Prime Minister formed a Committee in 2017 to review whether the salary framework established in 2012 remains appropriate and valid against its intended goals, and what adjustments may be useful; and whether there is a need to adjust the salaries should there be a change in overall salary levels based on the proposed framework."
2018-09-10-T-084-S-01046,2018-09-10-T-084,1046,Lee Hsien Loong,"DPM Teo Chee Hean informed Parliament in March this year that the Committee had affirmed that the current salary structure for political appointment holders, including the National Bonus framework, remained sound. Therefore, we should maintain this structure. While the MR4 benchmark had increased by 9% since 2011, the Government noted that the 2017 MR4 benchmark was lower than the 2016 MR4 benchmark, and hence had decided to maintain salaries at the current level and watch salary trends further. That remains the position."
2018-09-10-T-085-S-01047,2018-09-10-T-085,1047,Leon Perera,asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Ministry can release data for Singapore citizens deaths over the last 10 years (as distinct from resident deaths); and (b) at what year in the future will citizen deaths exceed citizen births according to existing demographic forecasts.
2018-09-10-T-085-S-01048,2018-09-10-T-085,1048,Teo Chee Hean,"The total number of resident deaths has increased from around 16,200 in 2008 to 19,800 in 2017. The total number of citizen deaths has increased from around 15,600 in 2008 to 19,100 in 2017."
2018-09-10-T-085-S-01049,2018-09-10-T-085,1049,Teo Chee Hean,"Based on current trends1, the number of citizen deaths could exceed the projected number of citizen births around the mid-2030s."
2018-09-10-T-086-S-01050,2018-09-10-T-086,1050,Desmond Choo,asked the Prime Minister in each of the past three years (a) what is the percentage of retired and re-employed civil service employees who have been given one year and multiple-year contracts respectively; (b) what is the percentage of civil service employees not given a second re-employment contract after the first re-employment contract; and (c) how is the civil service helping employees who wish to continue working but are not offered re-employment contracts.
2018-09-10-T-086-S-01051,2018-09-10-T-086,1051,Chan Chun Sing,"Between 2015 and 2017, nine in 10 officers in the Civil Service who retired and wished to continue working, were re-employed at age 62. 77% of these officers were re-employed on multiple-year contracts. 22% of them were re-employed on one-year contracts. The remaining officers were re-employed on contracts of less than one-year duration with mutual agreement between the officers and their agencies. Of the officers who were re-employed on one-year contract at age 62, 87% continued to be re-employed in the following year."
2018-09-10-T-086-S-01052,2018-09-10-T-086,1052,Chan Chun Sing,"The Public Service Re-employment Guidelines take reference from the Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees, including the guidelines on employment assistance to officers who wished to continue working but were not offered re-employment. As a best practice, agencies will work with these officers to find alternative employment, which may include referring them to vacancies within the Public Service and providing career resources and refresher training to facilitate officers' search for jobs."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01053,2018-09-10-T-087,1053,Sylvia Lim,asked the Prime Minister whether the Government has thoroughly assessed the possible adverse economic and psychological impact that the move to a cashless society will have on particular segments of society.
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01054,2018-09-10-T-087,1054,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Ms Lim asked about the adverse impact of a move towards a cashless society. We do not aim to be a completely cashless society. Cash has been with us for centuries, and will be around for quite some time more."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01055,2018-09-10-T-087,1055,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Electronic payments are growing in ease and convenience, and more Singaporeans are taking to e-payments every day. Today, more than 8 in 10 Singaporeans are using some form of e-payments. More than a million Singaporeans have signed on to PayNow. We want to help every segment in society to be able to use e-payments when it is convenient and beneficial to do so."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01056,2018-09-10-T-087,1056,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"For consumers, e-payments are now a lot more convenient than cash. Payment is as simple as waving a card, a smart phone or scanning a QR code. More importantly, for the elderly, it means not having to carry cash for all their needs, and does away with many trips to the ATM. As it is, cash withdrawals at ATMs are coming down by S$300 million every year."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01057,2018-09-10-T-087,1057,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"For small businesses, accepting e-payments helps to reduce the time and effort in counting cash, reconciling money, and depositing the money in the banks. For a hawker, it means no need to handle cash as he prepares food, which also improves hygiene. It has been estimated that the cost of processing cash is about S$2 billion a year, or 0.5% of GDP in 2015. This is the amount that businesses collectively, especially small businesses, can potentially save."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01058,2018-09-10-T-087,1058,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The supporting infrastructure for e-payments has now been developed. We have implemented FAST to facilitate real-time inter-bank account transfers. With PayNow, both individuals and companies can pay one another using their NRIC numbers or phone numbers or Unique Entity Number as the case may be. And Singapore is the first country to adopt a standardised QR Code for payments. Every merchant will just have one QR code for every e-payment scheme it decides to accept, and there will be no confusion on what QR code to scan."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01059,2018-09-10-T-087,1059,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"However, the benefits and convenience of e-payments are not fully felt yet. This is mainly because the solutions building on this infrastructure are just beginning to proliferate."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01060,2018-09-10-T-087,1060,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The standardised SGQR is being rolled out progressively. And as more businesses sign up for PayNow Corporate, it will become easier for people to pay their bills or pay for goods and services or even hawker food by scanning a QR code using their mobile phone. The good thing about paying by QR code is that it does not need any payment accepting devices, and the entry barrier is very low."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01061,2018-09-10-T-087,1061,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"There is also the alternative of contactless payments. NETS and the major consumer banks are progressively replacing older NETS cards with newer NETS contactless bank cards in the coming months. A person just needs to wave his or her NETS contactless bank card to make a payment. This is actually the most convenient and intuitive e-payment mode for the elderly, who are already familiar with using their contactless concession cards for public transport."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01062,2018-09-10-T-087,1062,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"E-payments will for sure be more convenient over time, as the solutions to support it become more user-friendly, people gain familiarity with them, and they become pervasive."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01063,2018-09-10-T-087,1063,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"We are putting effort into educating the public to help everyone take advantage of e-payments. IMDA has launched the e-Payment Learning Journey to help seniors learn how to make digital transactions. SkillsFuture Singapore has rolled out a SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace programme to reach out to members of the public. Banks are also re-skilling branch customer service staff, to become digital banking ambassadors, to help customers enjoy the benefits of digital banking, including e-payments. In many constituencies, students are volunteering to help educate less digitally-savvy residents."
2018-09-10-T-087-S-01064,2018-09-10-T-087,1064,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Through the collective effort of the Government, industry players and the community, we can make e-payments work for all by bringing about greater convenience and benefits."
2018-09-10-T-088-S-01065,2018-09-10-T-088,1065,Sitoh Yih Pin,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA is aware of any reason for the consistently higher number of expired Category D (Motorcycles) COEs; (b) if so, what are the reasons; and (c) whether LTA has any concerns that this could be the result of an attempt at market speculation of Category D (Motorcycles) COEs."
2018-09-10-T-088-S-01066,2018-09-10-T-088,1066,Khaw Boon Wan,The practice in the motorcycle trade is for the dealers to bid for Category D COEs under their names and to hold a stock of Temporary Certificates of Entitlement (TCOEs). This allows their buyers to take delivery of the motorcycles immediately. This is the business model that our motorcycle dealers have adopted. (This is unlike the motor car trade where the dealers only bid for TCOEs upon confirmation of demand.)
2018-09-10-T-088-S-01067,2018-09-10-T-088,1067,Khaw Boon Wan,"Under the current motorcycle business model, the dealers take some risk that they may not be able to use up all the TCOEs at the end of the six-month validity period. Over the past three years, Category D TCOEs which expired at the end of the validity period made up about 3%. There is no evidence of market speculation at play."
2018-09-10-T-089-S-01068,2018-09-10-T-089,1068,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) in the past three years, how many cases have been reported of senior citizens who have fallen and got injured while taking public buses; and (b) what are the measures taken to prevent such incidents so as to ensure safe travel for senior citizens on public buses."
2018-09-10-T-089-S-01069,2018-09-10-T-089,1069,Khaw Boon Wan,"There are about 50 incidents each year of senior citizens who were injured after losing their balance on public buses. The majority of these incidents happened when the buses moved off from a stationary position or stopped abruptly to avoid vehicles cutting in. To reduce such incidents, bus operators are installing telematics systems which enable bus captains to review and improve their driving patterns, such as minimising sudden movements. To date, about 70% of public buses are equipped with telematics systems. However, it is not possible to eliminate all abrupt movements by buses. For example, bus captains may have to apply emergency brakes to respond to unanticipated traffic incidents. To enhance safety for senior citizens, we will continue to encourage younger commuters to give up their seats to them."
2018-09-10-T-090-S-01070,2018-09-10-T-090,1070,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there is any advisory on what should be done by the owner of an e-scooter that does not conform to LTA's regulations, such as its method of disposal; and (b) if there is no such advisory, whether LTA will consider to produce such an advisory."
2018-09-10-T-090-S-01071,2018-09-10-T-090,1071,Khaw Boon Wan,"All personal mobility devices (PMDs), including e-scooters, that are used on public paths cannot exceed 20kg in maximum unladen weight, 700mm in maximum width and 25km/h in maximum device speed."
2018-09-10-T-090-S-01072,2018-09-10-T-090,1072,Khaw Boon Wan,"Persons with non-compliant devices may wish to approach retailers to check if these devices can be modified to become compliant, or traded in for compliant devices. Persons who wish to recycle their devices may contact e-waste or metal recyclers for assistance. A list of recyclers can be found on the National Environment Agency (NEA)'s website at www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/collectors-traders-and-local-recycling-facilities."
2018-09-10-T-091-S-01073,2018-09-10-T-091,1073,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Minister for Defence (a) for the past 10 years, what has been the number of outstanding National Service (NS) defaulters; (b) how many have been eventually charged or pardoned; (c) what have been the efforts to trace and prosecute NS defaulters especially when they are overseas; and (d) what are the criteria for providing clemency to NS defaulters, if at all."
2018-09-10-T-091-S-01074,2018-09-10-T-091,1074,Ng Eng Hen,"Over the past 10 years, an average of about 350 National Service (NS) defaulters each year have either failed to register or enlist for NS, or failed to return after their Exit Permit has expired. Among these, about one third have been arrested or have come forward to resolve their Enlistment Act offences."
2018-09-10-T-091-S-01075,2018-09-10-T-091,1075,Ng Eng Hen,"Efforts to trace and contact NS defaulters include sending registered mails to their last known place of residence, including their overseas address, house visits to their local addresses, and contact tracing through educational institutions that they have attended. The enforcement and punishment of NS defaulters is governed by the Enlistment Act and judicial processes. MINDEF works with the Police to arrest these defaulters. Those who are charged have their punishments meted out by the Courts in accordance with the Enlistment Act."
2018-09-10-T-092-S-01076,2018-09-10-T-092,1076,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of cases of misuse of airport boarding passes in the last five years; (b) what are the main reasons for the misuse; (c) what actions have the Ministry taken against these offenders; and (d) what is the Ministry's plan to reduce such misuse cases.
2018-09-10-T-092-S-01077,2018-09-10-T-092,1077,K Shanmugam,"The transit areas of Changi Airport are gazetted as Protected Places under the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act. It is an offence for persons to misuse their boarding pass to enter the transit areas with no intention of proceeding with their journey. Persons who are found guilty of misusing their boarding pass are liable for a fine of $1,000/-, or imprisonment for two years, or both."
2018-09-10-T-092-S-01078,2018-09-10-T-092,1078,K Shanmugam,"From 2015 to 2017, Police detected an average of 44 cases of boarding pass misuse each year. Most of the offenders gained entry into the transit areas to purchase goods from the duty-free shops, send off friends and relatives, or try to meet celebrities."
2018-09-10-T-092-S-01079,2018-09-10-T-092,1079,K Shanmugam,"Police have worked with the airport community to put up signs to explicitly warn travellers that it is an offence to misuse boarding passes. These signs are displayed at airlines' check-in counters, departure entrances, and immigration counters. Police are exploring with the airlines to print the warnings on the boarding passes, and to publish the warnings on the airlines' website. Police also publicise cases of boarding pass misuse to educate the public."
2018-09-10-T-093-S-01080,2018-09-10-T-093,1080,Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how can companies and individuals avoid being scammed by letters that are designed to look similar to official Government letters; (b) whether the Ministry can help to raise more awareness about such scams apart from cyber scams; and (c) whether heavier penalties can be imposed as such scams can have severe repercussions.
2018-09-10-T-093-S-01081,2018-09-10-T-093,1081,K Shanmugam,Companies and individuals can adopt the following measures to avoid being a victim of scams that use official-looking letters or emails
2018-09-10-T-093-S-01082,2018-09-10-T-093,1082,K Shanmugam,"First, they should exercise vigilance when dealing with unsolicited letters or emails, especially when personal banking details or payments are being sought;"
2018-09-10-T-093-S-01083,2018-09-10-T-093,1083,K Shanmugam,"Secondly, they can call the relevant authorities to ascertain the authenticity of the letter or email;"
2018-09-10-T-093-S-01084,2018-09-10-T-093,1084,K Shanmugam,"Finally, they can seek scam-related advice via the Anti-Scam Helpline at 1800-722-6688 or visit www.scamalert.sg."
2018-09-10-T-093-S-01085,2018-09-10-T-093,1085,K Shanmugam,The Police and NCPC will continually review these measures.
2018-09-10-T-093-S-01086,2018-09-10-T-093,1086,K Shanmugam,The Member also asked whether heavier penalties can be imposed.
2018-09-10-T-093-S-01087,2018-09-10-T-093,1087,K Shanmugam,We think that the sentencing range under existing legislation is adequate. A person who is convicted of a cheating offence under section 420 of the Penal Code may be liable for imprisonment of up to 10 years.
2018-09-10-T-093-S-01088,2018-09-10-T-093,1088,K Shanmugam,"But above all, I urge Singaporeans to remain alert and vigilant against scams."
2018-09-10-T-094-S-01089,2018-09-10-T-094,1089,Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Health whether coverage of and payouts to disabled persons under CareShield Life for the remainder of their lives will be provided so long as they remain Singapore citizens or residents.
2018-09-10-T-094-S-01090,2018-09-10-T-094,1090,Gan Kim Yong,CareShield Life is a national scheme and a key pillar of our social safety net. Singapore Citizens and residents covered under CareShield Life will have lifetime coverage and receive payouts for as long as they remain severely disabled.
2018-09-10-T-095-S-01091,2018-09-10-T-095,1091,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Health what can be done to increase Government contributions or subsidies for the wages of long-term care workers including those in voluntary welfare organisations.
2018-09-10-T-095-S-01092,2018-09-10-T-095,1092,Gan Kim Yong,"In addition to patient subsidies, MOH also provides direct funding to subsidised long-term care (LTC) service providers to help them defray their operating costs, including manpower costs."
2018-09-10-T-095-S-01093,2018-09-10-T-095,1093,Gan Kim Yong,"Over $200 million of funding had been extended to 59 LTC service providers between 2012 and 2017 to raise the salaries of LTC staff. This has led to an average increase of local LTC workers' salaries by around 30% across participating providers over this period. We also support skills training, through scholarships and grants, productivity improvement and job redesign initiatives to raise the value of jobs alongside salary increases."
2018-09-10-T-095-S-01094,2018-09-10-T-095,1094,Gan Kim Yong,We will continue with our efforts to improve career opportunities in the LTC sector and we will regularly review funding support for salaries of LTC staff to ensure that they are adequately recognised for their contributions.
2018-09-10-T-096-S-01095,2018-09-10-T-096,1095,Zainal Sapari,"asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past two years, how many Singaporeans aged 55 and above have hospital bills for inpatient treatment that exceed their daily Medisave withdrawal limits; (b) what are the common reasons for this; and (c) whether the daily Medisave withdrawal limits for unemployed elderly persons can be of a higher daily limit so as to avoid payment requiring cash."
2018-09-10-T-096-S-01096,2018-09-10-T-096,1096,Gan Kim Yong,"To ensure inpatient treatment remains affordable, means-tested Government subsidies of up to 80% are available to all Singaporeans at our public healthcare institutions. In addition, all Singaporeans are covered by MediShield Life which protects them against large bills, and they can utilise Medisave for the co-payment portion of their hospitalisation costs."
2018-09-10-T-096-S-01097,2018-09-10-T-096,1097,Gan Kim Yong,"Currently, more than seven in 10 hospitalisations by Singaporeans aged 55 and above in the subsidised wards (B2 or C ward types) do not require any cash payment, and more than eight in 10 paid less than $100 in cash. This means that with subsidies and MediShield Life, the Medisave claim limits are generally sufficient to cover the large majority of patients' hospitalisation bills."
2018-09-10-T-096-S-01098,2018-09-10-T-096,1098,Gan Kim Yong,"Where the patient's financial circumstances are more challenging, MOH may also consider allowing more Medisave use on appeal. Singaporeans who require additional financial assistance can also approach medical social workers at our public healthcare institutions to apply for Medifund."
2018-09-10-T-096-S-01099,2018-09-10-T-096,1099,Gan Kim Yong,"We regularly review our Medisave withdrawal limits, in conjunction with subsidies and MediShield Life coverage, to ensure that good quality, basic inpatient care is affordable for all Singaporeans. Any changes to the Medisave withdrawal limits must take into account possible impact on Singaporeans' CPF contribution rates and our Medisave adequacy in the longer term."
2018-09-10-T-097-S-01100,2018-09-10-T-097,1100,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Health for each of the years from 2015 to 2017, what have been the respective numbers of unique patients, unique visits, and the average and median costs of each visit for (i) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (ii) Spondyloarthritis and (iii) Psoriatic Arthritis."
2018-09-10-T-097-S-01101,2018-09-10-T-097,1101,Gan Kim Yong,"The 2015 to 2017 subsidised B2 and C ward hospitalisation statistics on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis are in the following table."
2018-09-10-T-097-S-01102,2018-09-10-T-097,1102,Gan Kim Yong,MOH does not collect specific Specialist Outpatient Clinic (SOC) data and primary care data for these three conditions.
2018-09-10-T-098-S-01103,2018-09-10-T-098,1103,Cheng Li Hui,asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the figures and trends of Singaporeans seeking medical help for sleep-related problems over the past decade; (b) what the main types of sleep-related problems facing Singaporeans; (c) whether sleep deprivation is increasingly a concern in fast-paced and work-oriented Singapore; and (d) whether there is the need to step up measures to address sleep deprivation considering that long-term sleep deficit is detrimental to health.
2018-09-10-T-098-S-01104,2018-09-10-T-098,1104,Gan Kim Yong,"Having sufficient, good quality sleep is an important component of a healthy lifestyle. Insufficient or poor quality sleep can lead to impaired cognition, and increased risk of health concerns such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health issues."
2018-09-10-T-098-S-01105,2018-09-10-T-098,1105,Gan Kim Yong,"Insomnia, that is, difficulty sleeping and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are the two most common sleep-related problems that Singaporeans seek medical help for. From 2012 to 2016, the number of patients diagnosed as having insomnia at polyclinics has been stable, averaging 5,100 persons per year. The number of admissions to public hospitals for OSA increased from 3,592 in 2012 to 4,685 in 2017. They could be due to varying factors including increased awareness and more referrals."
2018-09-10-T-098-S-01106,2018-09-10-T-098,1106,Gan Kim Yong,"The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has various initiatives to raise awareness on the importance and benefits of adequate sleep, especially for the young. Efforts include incorporating messages in HPB's stress and psycho-emotional programmes for school children, and engaging parents through workshops to emphasise their role in inculcating good sleep habits in their children. HPB's HealthHub and a microsite also provide additional information on sleep, and tips on good sleeping habits for adults and children. Our public hospitals hold regular forums to increase awareness about sleep disorders and their effects on health. MOH and HPB will continue to encourage Singaporeans to adopt good sleep habits as part of a healthy lifestyle."
2018-09-10-T-099-S-01107,2018-09-10-T-099,1107,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked the Minister for Health whether residency in Singapore is a requirement for the use of Medisave for emergency treatment at overseas hospitals and, if so, what are the reasons for this requirement."
2018-09-10-T-099-S-01108,2018-09-10-T-099,1108,Gan Kim Yong,"Medisave is intended to help Singaporeans save for their medical expenses, especially during old age, and its design takes into account significant Government subsidies for Singaporeans. The use of Medisave is therefore targeted at Singaporeans seeking subsidised care here."
2018-09-10-T-099-S-01109,2018-09-10-T-099,1109,Gan Kim Yong,"Nevertheless, MOH understands that on very rare occasions, some Singaporeans may find themselves in difficult situations due to medical emergencies when travelling overseas, and require help with their medical costs incurred for such emergencies. We do exercise flexibility to allow the use of Medisave in such situations as an exception on appeal, especially for individuals normally resident in Singapore. We review such appeals carefully, taking into account the circumstance of each request on a case by case basis."
2018-09-10-T-100-S-01110,2018-09-10-T-100,1110,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,asked the Minister for Health what is the annual average subsidy disbursed per CHAS cardholder since the scheme started and what is the projected annual expenditure for CHAS subsidies for the next five years.
2018-09-10-T-100-S-01111,2018-09-10-T-100,1111,Gan Kim Yong,"The Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) was launched in 2012. Over the years, benefits and coverage of CHAS have been expanded and the number of CHAS cardholders has also increased."
2018-09-10-T-100-S-01112,2018-09-10-T-100,1112,Gan Kim Yong,"In 2017, a total of $154 million was disbursed to about 650,000 CHAS beneficiaries, equivalent to more than $200 subsidy per beneficiary, compared to $13 million disbursed in 2012 to 75,000 beneficiaries, equivalent to approximately $170 per beneficiary."
2018-09-10-T-100-S-01113,2018-09-10-T-100,1113,Gan Kim Yong,"MOH plans to extend CHAS subsidies to all Singaporeans with chronic conditions, to enable more Singaporeans to benefit from subsidised chronic care at CHAS general practitioners. With this expansion, the projected total CHAS subsidies is expected to rise. The details are being worked out."
2018-09-10-T-101-S-01114,2018-09-10-T-101,1114,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) in the past year, many complaints have been received from mobile customers about being subscribed to third-party services without their consent; (b) under what grounds do such situations arise and what is being done to prevent it; and (c) whether assistance and refunds will be given to elderly consumers who are victims of these situations."
2018-09-10-T-101-S-01115,2018-09-10-T-101,1115,S Iswaran,"Premium Rate Services (PRS) are value-added services delivered over mobile telecommunication networks, and include third-party services provided to mobile customers."
2018-09-10-T-101-S-01116,2018-09-10-T-101,1116,S Iswaran,"In 2017, the Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA) received 91 PRS-related complaints. These complainants generally claimed that they were charged for PRS that they did not subscribe to. IMDA's investigations revealed that these end users had actually subscribed to the PRS without reading the terms and conditions carefully."
2018-09-10-T-101-S-01117,2018-09-10-T-101,1117,S Iswaran,"IMDA has implemented several measures to protect consumers against accidentally subscribing to PRS. Currently, the Code of Practice for the Provision of Premium Rate Service (PRS Code) requires service providers to publish the terms and conditions of their services clearly, and confirm end-users' purchases before activating the PRS."
2018-09-10-T-101-S-01118,2018-09-10-T-101,1118,S Iswaran,"Since 2012, IMDA has required mobile operators to offer a PRS barring service for free. Consumers who activate this service will not receive or be billed for any chargeable PRS. Since the PRS barring service was introduced, the number of PRS-related complaints has dropped by approximately 80% from 483 complaints in 2012 to 91 complaints in 2017."
2018-09-10-T-101-S-01119,2018-09-10-T-101,1119,S Iswaran,"IMDA has also stepped up our consumer education efforts, including giving talks at events targeting seniors, distributing brochures and uploading educational videos on YouTube."
2018-09-10-T-101-S-01120,2018-09-10-T-101,1120,S Iswaran,"Where consumers including seniors have accidentally subscribed to PRS, IMDA will also step in to engage the service provider. In several cases, the service provider has waived the subscription charges incurred on a goodwill basis, and the mobile operator has thereafter activated its PRS barring service. Nevertheless, we urge consumers to also ensure that they fully understand the terms and conditions before activating any PRS."
2018-09-10-T-102-S-01121,2018-09-10-T-102,1121,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Minister for Finance whether union membership fees/dues can be made tax deductible or as a relief such as in other jurisdictions across the globe.
2018-09-10-T-102-S-01122,2018-09-10-T-102,1122,Heng Swee Keat,"Our tax treatment of union membership fees follows the same tax deductibility rules under the income tax system that we apply consistently on all expenses. Under our income tax regime, union membership fees are not tax deductible. This is also the case in other jurisdictions like Hong Kong."
2018-09-10-T-102-S-01123,2018-09-10-T-102,1123,Heng Swee Keat,"Nevertheless, the Government recognises the importance of a strong labour movement to the success of tripartism in Singapore. The labour movement plays a strategic role in helping Singapore stay competitive and workers remain employable. Hence the Government has and will continue to provide support to the unions through various grants."
2018-09-10-T-103-S-01124,2018-09-10-T-103,1124,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether pre-ticked boxes for purchase of additional goods and services or seeking consent from consumers in online transactions can be made illegal.
2018-09-10-T-103-S-01125,2018-09-10-T-103,1125,Chan Chun Sing,"In general, the Government adopts a balanced approach of supporting a pro-enterprise environment and safeguarding consumers' interest. Consumers are encouraged to take steps to protect themselves before making their purchases. This would include checking the terms and conditions of contracts which they are about to enter into; what they are paying for; and the supplier’s refund policies. If consumers are unsure about any terms and conditions, they are encouraged to clarify with the suppliers. Suppliers should also be upfront and transparent with consumers about material terms and conditions in their agreements so consumers can make an informed decision."
2018-09-10-T-103-S-01126,2018-09-10-T-103,1126,Chan Chun Sing,"If consumers have reason to believe that the suppliers have engaged in unfair trading practices, they can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) with details of these practices for CASE to assist them in seeking redress from the suppliers. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act protects consumers against errant retailers which engage in unfair trading practices, including attempts to conceal information or mislead consumers. Under the CPFTA, CASE can invite suppliers to cease their unfair practices through a Voluntary Compliance Agreement. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, as the administering agency of the CPFTA, is also empowered with investigation and enforcement powers to take action against errant retailers who persist in unfair practices."
2018-09-10-T-103-S-01127,2018-09-10-T-103,1127,Chan Chun Sing,"We note the member's suggestion regarding pre-ticked boxes and will study it further, taking into account feedback from relevant stakeholders and global best practices."
2018-09-10-T-104-S-01128,2018-09-10-T-104,1128,Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the progress in supporting Singapore companies to go regional; (b) to date, how many companies has the Ministry successfully helped in regional expansion; and (c) what are the future plans especially for expansion in ASEAN."
2018-09-10-T-104-S-01129,2018-09-10-T-104,1129,Chan Chun Sing,Helping Singapore companies internationalise is a key thrust of Singapore's economic strategy. ASEAN alone represents a market of USD 2.55 trillion in GDP and a population of some 650 million
2018-09-10-T-104-S-01130,2018-09-10-T-104,1130,Chan Chun Sing,"First, we provide targeted grant support for SMEs making their first foray into overseas markets through the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) scheme. In 2017, 1,629 MRA grants were disbursed, which included support for SMEs expanding into regional markets like Indonesia, Myanmar, Vietnam, India and China for the first time."
2018-09-10-T-104-S-01131,2018-09-10-T-104,1131,Chan Chun Sing,"To help companies that have had overseas exposure but which need more tailored assistance to expand overseas or access additional overseas markets, we provide help in the form of the Global Company Partnership (GCP) programme. In 2017, the GCP which comes with a grant assisted 419 companies in the areas of capability development, market access, and manpower development for internationalisation. Of these, about 40% were for companies expanding within Southeast Asia. MTI and our agencies regularly review these grant schemes to provide more customised support to local enterprises seeking to develop new capabilities to scale up and internationalise."
2018-09-10-T-104-S-01132,2018-09-10-T-104,1132,Chan Chun Sing,"Second, we support businesses' efforts to develop their manpower and talent, to better understand regional markets. Examples of partnership with companies include the Youth Talent Programme which targets to send 1000 students each year for work opportunities in overseas markets, the Professional Conversion Programme for Southeast Asia Ready Talent which integrates job-matching and reskilling to help professionals gain new skills for job roles within the Southeast Asian region, and the ASEAN Leadership Programme which trains C-Suite business leaders on strategies to leverage on ASEAN’s growth. Together, these programmes help to build up groups of Singapore students and professionals with more specialised knowledge and in time, experience and networks in the Southeast Asia’s markets."
2018-09-10-T-104-S-01133,2018-09-10-T-104,1133,Chan Chun Sing,"Third, Enterprise Singapore (ESG)'s international network of offices and in-market partners facilitates leads and connections for companies venturing overseas. In 2017, ESG (then-International Enterprise Singapore) successfully facilitated over 450 overseas projects for Singapore companies. The Plug & Play Network, which helps SMEs access new markets by providing in-market assistance in business advisory services, business matching, and market set-up, was also launched in 2017. SMEs can now gain access to assistance in over 45 major cities across six Asian markets, including Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh City, New Delhi and Shanghai. ESG also partnered Trade Associations and Chambers to facilitate visits by about 6,000 businesses to overseas markets through business missions and participation in international trade shows."
2018-09-10-T-104-S-01134,2018-09-10-T-104,1134,Chan Chun Sing,"As the ASEAN Chair this year, Singapore has also worked with member countries to deepen regional connectivity and improve trade facilitation. At the recently concluded 50th ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting, two new Agreements on services and trade facilitation were signed and an ASEAN Agreement on e-Commerce was endorsed. These agreements2  when they take effect will give Singaporean businesses greater access to ASEAN's services markets and save costs and time for Singaporean businesses by making customs procedures less burdensome. The ASEAN Agreement on e-Commerce will lower the costs for Singaporean businesses by improving the speed and reliability of supply chains in cross-border e-Commerce transactions."
2018-09-10-T-104-S-01135,2018-09-10-T-104,1135,Chan Chun Sing,The Government is firmly committed to continuing to support our companies to seize overseas opportunities and grow.
2018-09-10-T-105-S-01136,2018-09-10-T-105,1136,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the current takeup rate for our Aircraft Leasing Scheme; (b) for the eight out of the top ten aircraft leasing companies which have their operations in Singapore, how many of them are participants of the Scheme; and (c) how is our Scheme more competitive vis-à-vis that of our closest rivals such as Hong Kong and Ireland."
2018-09-10-T-105-S-01137,2018-09-10-T-105,1137,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the basis for the Ministry's claim that Singapore has 20% of the global market share in aircraft leasing; (b) for the eight out of the top ten aircraft leasing companies which have their operations in Singapore, how does the Ministry define ""operations""; and (c) how many of them account for their lease income and aircraft assets in the profit and loss and balance sheets, respectively, of their Singapore entities."
2018-09-10-T-105-S-01138,2018-09-10-T-105,1138,Chan Chun Sing,"Singapore's competitiveness as a base for aircraft leasing companies is founded on several factors, including our extensive network of Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs); our strong financial industry and professional services ecosystem which provide supporting services to aircraft leasing businesses; and our established aviation and aerospace industries which complement the aircraft leasing industry with their deep knowledge and quality services."
2018-09-10-T-105-S-01139,2018-09-10-T-105,1139,Chan Chun Sing,"Several companies of varying sizes seeking to develop aircraft leasing capabilities in Singapore have availed themselves of the Economic Development Board (EDB)'s Aircraft Leasing Scheme (ALS). The ALS is just one of the ways in which the EDB works with aircraft leasing companies to capture growth opportunities for the industry, strengthen the larger ecosystem of related industries, and create good jobs for Singaporeans. While Singapore's competitiveness cannot be attributed solely to our tax regime, factual details of tax regimes across jurisdictions including Ireland, Hong Kong and Singapore can be found in the respective government publications."
2018-09-10-T-105-S-01140,2018-09-10-T-105,1140,Chan Chun Sing,"Eight out of the top 10 aircraft leasing companies have offices in Singapore and are registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). Aircraft leasing companies in Singapore may undertake activities such as sales, leasing, and financing depending on their business models. In addition, they are required to comply with accounting and tax filing requirements under Singapore law."
2018-09-10-T-105-S-01141,2018-09-10-T-105,1141,Chan Chun Sing,"While Singapore is generally recognised as one of the top aircraft leasing hubs alongside Ireland which is the industry leader, as reported in industrial reports and news articles, other cities in our region are also competing to capture opportunities arising from Asia's increasing demand in air travel. We will need to continue to partner one another to strengthen Singapore’s position as the preferred base for the world to access Asian markets, and for regional companies to access the world."
2018-09-10-T-106-S-01142,2018-09-10-T-106,1142,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) in each of the past 10 years, what is the number of HDB flats that have been transferred to the estate of the deceased owner who are also the flat's owners; (b) of these, what is the breakdown by flat types and by lease balance respectively; and (c) how many beneficiaries/administrators of such estates have sold the HDB flat left over by the deceased."
2018-09-10-T-106-S-01143,2018-09-10-T-106,1143,Lawrence Wong,"In cases where the flat is held in joint tenancy, the deceased's interest in the flat is passed on automatically to the surviving co-owner without the need for a transfer to the estate of the deceased. The surviving owner may lodge a Notice of Death (NOD) with the Singapore Land Authority, to ensure that the title deed reflects the change in ownership. HDB does not actively track when an NOD is lodged, especially if the NOD was lodged without HDB's assistance."
2018-09-10-T-106-S-01144,2018-09-10-T-106,1144,Lawrence Wong,"On the number of HDB flats sold by an administrator or executor of an estate upon demise of all its owners, HDB's records indicate that there were 1,890 such cases in the past 10 years from 2008 to 2017."
2018-09-10-T-107-S-01145,2018-09-10-T-107,1145,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for National Development whether, with respect to families living in rental flats under HDB's Public Rental Scheme, the income ceiling as well as rent payable for the flats, currently based on monthly household income, may instead be based on per capita household income."
2018-09-10-T-107-S-01146,2018-09-10-T-107,1146,Lawrence Wong,"HDB takes a needs-based approach in assisting public rental applicants and tenants, including those who are above the income ceiling. This includes taking into account their household size and expenses when assessing their requests for public rental, and their ability to pay rent."
2018-09-10-T-107-S-01147,2018-09-10-T-107,1147,Lawrence Wong,"The majority of HDB public rental tenants have a household size of three or less. In addition, more than half of public rental households pay basic rents, which are $26 to $33 a month for a 1-room flat and $44 to $75 a month for a 2-room flat. The remaining households pay higher monthly rents based on their household incomes. If tenants face difficulty affording their rents, HDB looks into their individual circumstances and can exercise flexibility for them to pay a lower rent."
2018-09-10-T-108-S-01148,2018-09-10-T-108,1148,Kok Heng Leun,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether he will provide an update on (i) the types of assistance provided to Sungei Road Hawking Zone (SRHZ) users since September 2017 and (ii) the status of the 120 or so SRHZ users who had not taken up the Ministry's offers for relocation, job placement or financial assistance."
2018-09-10-T-108-S-01149,2018-09-10-T-108,1149,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Sungei Road Hawking Zone (SRHZ) was closed on 10 July 2017. Ahead of its closure, various agencies, including the National Environment Agency (NEA), Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Workforce Singapore (WSG), and Central Singapore Community Development Council (CDC) provided SRHZ users with financial, employment and social support. These included the provision of lock-up stalls at hawker centres managed by NEA, referrals to other flea markets, financial assistance, and job placement."
2018-09-10-T-108-S-01150,2018-09-10-T-108,1150,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In September last year, we updated that the Government had engaged about 200 SRHZ users. Close to 80 received some form of assistance. Since then, the agencies have helped about 20 more former users. Hence, to date, a total of about 100 out of the 200 users have received Government assistance. Around 40 former users have taken up stalls at hawker centres, and about 30 former users have chosen to operate at other flea markets. Another 30 users have received employment and/or financial assistance. Of the 200 users who were engaged, 100 or so users have declined assistance. We understand that they have other means of support, such as employment or family support."
2018-09-10-T-108-S-01151,2018-09-10-T-108,1151,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,We will continue to engage and render assistance to former SRHZ users who come forward.
2018-09-10-T-109-S-01152,2018-09-10-T-109,1152,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked ask the Minister for Education in 2015, 2016 and 2017, what have been the average and median starting salaries of ITE, polytechnic and university graduates working in (i) the private sector and (ii) the civil service."
2018-09-10-T-109-S-01153,2018-09-10-T-109,1153,Ong Ye Kung,"Based on the annual Graduate Employment Surveys (GES) conducted by the Institutes of Higher Learning, the median reported gross monthly starting salaries of ITE, polytechnic and Autonomous University (AU) respondents in full-time permanent employment in the private and public"
2018-09-10-T-110-S-01154,2018-09-10-T-110,1154,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Education (a) when was the Regional Studies Programme (RSP) and its scholarship introduced; (b) since its introduction, how many students have been granted the RSP scholarship; and (c) what is the breakdown of the scholarship recipients based on ethnicity."
2018-09-10-T-110-S-01155,2018-09-10-T-110,1155,Ong Ye Kung,"The Regional Studies Programme (RSP) and the RSP scholarship was introduced in 2008, with the aim to nurture a segment of non-Malays in each generation who are comfortably conversant in the Malay Language and able to engage regional countries effectively. RSP students offer either Malay (Special Programme) or Bahasa Indonesia as a third language. They also have the opportunities to experience school-based enrichment modules on Understanding Southeast Asia; and participate in learning journeys as well as take part in cultural camps and immersion trips to Southeast Asian countries."
2018-09-10-T-110-S-01156,2018-09-10-T-110,1156,Ong Ye Kung,"About 400 of every secondary school student cohort take part in the RSP, of which 100 are given the scholarships. Around 90% of the recipients are Chinese and 10% are Indian and Other Races."
2018-09-10-T-111-S-01157,2018-09-10-T-111,1157,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how effective has the policy dated 2013 been in terms of the proportion of foreign domestic workers who have an off day stipulated in their contract; and (b) how effective has it been in ensuring that foreign domestic workers actually have a physical, emotional and mental rest from work."
2018-09-10-T-111-S-01158,2018-09-10-T-111,1158,Josephine Teo,"It is a condition of all Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) work permits issued or renewed from 2013, that their contracts should provide a weekly rest day or compensation in lieu."
2018-09-10-T-111-S-01159,2018-09-10-T-111,1159,Josephine Teo,"MOM conducts regular surveys with FDWs. Based on the most recent survey in 2015, the proportion of FDWs reporting at least one rest day a month was 98%, compared to 53% in 2010. The percentage of FDWs with four rest days also increased to 56% from 25% in 2010. These results are consistent with a survey of FDWs conducted by the Centre for Domestic Employees in 2017, where 96% had at least one rest days a month and 60% had four rest days a month."
2018-09-10-T-111-S-01160,2018-09-10-T-111,1160,Josephine Teo,"In MOM's survey in 2015, more than 95% of FDWs indicated that their workload was either just right or they were able to handle more, which suggests that the FDWs are sufficiently well-rested to perform their tasks. At the same time, the incidence of FDW complaints to MOM pertaining to overwork or insufficient rest, remains low."
2018-09-10-T-111-S-01161,2018-09-10-T-111,1161,Josephine Teo,MOM's next survey in 2019 will provide further updates.
2018-09-10-T-112-S-01162,2018-09-10-T-112,1162,Lim Biow Chuan,"asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government will ban the payment of heavy vehicle drivers on a ""per trip"" basis to prevent excessive speeding or dangerous driving by the drivers."
2018-09-10-T-112-S-01163,2018-09-10-T-112,1163,Josephine Teo,"There were 10 fatal accidents involving heavy vehicles in the first half of 2018, a significant reduction from the 20 in the same period last year. Nonetheless, we should aim to prevent all accidents."
2018-09-10-T-112-S-01164,2018-09-10-T-112,1164,Josephine Teo,"It is not clear that banning ""per trip"" payments is the solution. The Traffic Police's investigations have found that the top causes of heavy vehicle accidents are related to driver behaviour  failing to keep a proper lookout, failing to control the vehicle and reckless lane changing. In MOM's investigations into heavy vehicle accidents, we found that drivers on other payment arrangements can also exhibit careless driving behaviour."
2018-09-10-T-112-S-01165,2018-09-10-T-112,1165,Josephine Teo,"The Safer Roads Industry Taskforce, comprising representatives from Government agencies, transport and logistics companies and unions, studied the issue of heavy vehicle safety. It concluded that it was more effective to enhance companies' ability to manage driver behaviour, and to build drivers' safety awareness, rather than to ban ""per trip"" payment. The Taskforce's recommendations in 2016 sought to influence driver behaviour by (i) leveraging technology, (ii) expanding driver training, and (iii) strengthening company processes and systems."
2018-09-10-T-112-S-01166,2018-09-10-T-112,1166,Josephine Teo,"To leverage technology, the Traffic Police is conducting a trial to study the suitability of speed-tracking devices for heavy vehicles. MOM has also launched a Technology Challenge to fund the development and test-bedding of devices that can improve vehicular safety. Solutions undergoing test-bedding with logistics companies include those that alert drivers of risky behaviour like speeding and tail-gating. If the trials are successful, MOM will work with relevant agencies and trade associations to promote adoption of these solutions."
2018-09-10-T-112-S-01167,2018-09-10-T-112,1167,Josephine Teo,"To expand driver training, MOM and the Traffic Police have worked with the Automobile Association of Singapore to launch a heavy vehicle vocational driver training course, subsidised by SkillsFuture Singapore. It provides refresher training on top of that given for the heavy vehicle licensing test."
2018-09-10-T-112-S-01168,2018-09-10-T-112,1168,Josephine Teo,"To improve company processes and systems, the Workplace Safety and Health Council has been educating more companies on safe driving. For instance, under the Drive Safe, Work Safe campaign launched in June 2018, more than 200 companies have pledged their commitment to prevent vehicular accidents."
2018-09-10-T-113-S-01169,2018-09-10-T-113,1169,Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) to date, how many employers and community stakeholders are registered under SG Enable or have some form of employment programme for special needs adults; (b) what is the Ministry doing to encourage more to come on board to hire special needs people; and (c) whether more can be done to help employers with adapting the workplace and designing jobs for special needs employees."
2018-09-10-T-113-S-01170,2018-09-10-T-113,1170,Desmond Lee,"To date, SG Enable and its VWO partners have worked with more than 1,000 employers to hire persons with disabilities. SG Enable works with employers to build up their capabilities to train, hire and integrate persons with disabilities into their workforce. It offers advisory and consultancy services, disability management workshops and training at the Enabling Village, as well as job shadowing, internship and mentorship programmes and various online resources. It also helps employers assess their readiness to hire persons with disability and to identify areas they could work on to become more inclusive employers. When employers are ready to hire, SG Enable and its VWO partners will provide job placement and job support services."
2018-09-10-T-113-S-01171,2018-09-10-T-113,1171,Desmond Lee,"The Government supports private sector employers who hire persons with disability in a variety of ways. For example, we give a Special Employment Credit to provide a wage off-set and defray costs for employers hiring persons with disabilities. We also provide grants under the Open Door Programme, which is a scheme administered by SG Enable and supported by Workforce Singapore and MSF. The Open Door Programme helps to fund employee training, workplace modifications, job re-design as well as the purchase of assistive technology devices that support persons with disabilities at work."
2018-09-10-T-113-S-01172,2018-09-10-T-113,1172,Desmond Lee,"Later this month, SG Enable will hold the annual Inclusive Business Forum, which brings employers and other stakeholders together to share best practices and to collaborate in order to create more opportunities and supportive workplaces for persons with disabilities. MSF will continue to work with our partners to bring more employers on board the inclusive hiring journey."
2018-09-10-T-113-S-01173,2018-09-10-T-113,1173,Desmond Lee,"Under the Third Enabling Masterplan, the Government will also enhance opportunities for persons with disabilities to leverage their abilities and secure meaningful jobs. We will work with key stakeholders such as industry leaders to identify new areas of skills development and to refine training and vocational programmes in our special education schools, to better prepare our students for employment. Business networks such as the Enabling Employers Network have also been set up so that businesses can learn from each other and support each other as they work towards becoming more inclusive."
