2019-07-08-T-001,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry is keeping a close monitoring on the development of the recent air pollution incident in Pasir Gudang and whether it will affect Singapore given the close proximity.,1,1,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00001
2019-07-08-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of the Pasir Gudang chemical spill in March 2019 (a) how does the air and water quality in Sengkang, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Pulau Ubin compare with other parts of Singapore from 2008 to 2018, particularly during the northeast monsoon seasons; and (b) what contingency plans are there in the event of an environmental disaster in Johor affecting residents in the aforesaid areas.",1,2,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00002
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Mr Speaker, may I take Question Nos 1 and 2 together, please?",1,3,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00003
2019-07-08-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,4,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00004
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thank you. NEA monitors and reports the air quality in Singapore through a network of five national air quality monitoring stations across the island. These stations are representative of the ambient air quality of the North, South, East, West and Central regions. Criteria pollutants, namely, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and particulate matter, both PM2.5 and PM10, are continuously monitored and reported on an hourly basis as the Pollutant Standards Index or PSI. In addition, NEA monitors the  coastal water quality continuously through buoy-based monitoring sensors deployed in eight locations around Singapore, including the Straits of Johor. This is supplemented by monthly collection samples from 48 sampling points around Singapore.",1,5,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00005
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"From 2008 to 2018, the air and water quality in the northeast region were comparable to the rest of Singapore, including during the northeast monsoon period.",2,6,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00006
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The air and water quality in Singapore have not been affected by the recent pollution incidents in Pasir Gudang. The ambient levels of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the northeast region were also well within safe limits. SCDF also deployed portable standoff chemical gas detectors in the northeast, and did not detect any toxic chemicals in the air.",3,7,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00007
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"NEA and SCDF are in contact with Malaysia’s Department of Environment (DOE) and Fire and Rescue Department (BOMBA) on this latest incident, and will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates if there are significant developments.",4,8,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00008
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our agencies have put in place precautionary measures to guard against any potential pollution impacts arising from chemical incidents, including those from transboundary sources. NEA’s existing air monitoring stations in the northeast region are able to measure the ambient concentration of a variety of VOCs including benzene, toluene and xylene in the parts per billion range. These capabilities and with the support of SCDF’s portable detectors should allow us to detect a transboundary plume and to alert our population accordingly.",5,9,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00009
2019-07-08-T-001,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Minister for his reply. According to media reports, the Johor Chief Minister Dr Sahruddin Jamal had announced yesterday that the state government is looking into relocating their high-risk chemical factories. I would like to ask if Singapore is actively engaging Malaysia on this, to ensure that any relocation does not inadvertently place us at an even higher risk of resultant air pollution.",1,10,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00010
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Both NEA and SCDF are aware of the kinds of chemical industries existing today in Pasir Gudang. It is our existing arrangement to inform each other to ensure that if there are movements of major complexes, we inform each other. So, in this case, when they do and if they do relocate, we will be informed.",1,11,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00011
2019-07-08-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, just a few supplementary questions arising from remarks in the mainstream media in Malaysia and contradictory comments by a Minister in particular about the quality of mop-up work done after the Sungei Kim Kim episode and then, a retraction thereafter. My first question is pertaining to the answer to a Parliamentary Question (PQ) that Minister gave in April this year, with regard to the deployment of chemical gas detectors in the northeast area. Are there any plans that NEA has to make this deployment permanent in view of repeated environmental concerns that are raised in Johor, in particular, about incidents that happen, affecting school children and members of the public there.",1,12,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00012
2019-07-08-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question pertains to whether the Ministry is conducting any studies on low, constant exposure to VOCs, given the large number of residential homes in the Sengkang, Punggol and Pasir Ris region, in particular, and the northeast in general. Is the Ministry pursuing any studies in this regard?",2,13,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00013
2019-07-08-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, we understand from local reports that there are 252 chemical factories in Pasir Gudang. Is the Ministry aware of how many of these are considered to be high risk by internationally accepted standards?",3,14,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00014
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Minister for the supplementary questions. As I had mentioned, all the monitoring stations that I mentioned just now are permanent deployments. These are to detect the ambient levels of VOCs as well as the pollutants in our air. However, when there are complaints from residents of persistent odours or smell that inconvenience them or cause them alarm, SCDF would also then put in the monitoring instruments to ensure that these are either not existent or if they are detected, to take the appropriate measures to advise accordingly.",1,15,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00015
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As for low, constant VOCs, there are very few studies available to advise how much of it should be of concern to us at the ambient level. In fact, all countries except one that we know of, do not even publish their VOCs in their websites. Usually, these are small. Actually, many of us are, in one form or another, already exposed to VOCs on a daily basis like from the glues and the things that we handle regularly. Therefore, when we publish, for example, the PSI, it is based on benchmarks that have been established from proper medical impact of such pollutants or chemicals by bodies like WHO and EPA from the US.",2,16,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00016
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Can I ask the Member to repeat the last question?,3,17,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00017
2019-07-08-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,The last question was on the number of high-risk chemical factories at Pasir Gudang.,1,18,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00018
2019-07-08-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Yes. There is a constant exchange, as mentioned just now, between SCDF and BOMBA of Malaysia, as well as between NEA and DOE of Malaysia, to exchange information as new factories come up and the kind of risks and protection that they have put in place, for each to respond to each other. BOMBA and SCDF carry out very regular joint exercises at our borders to work together and cooperate.",1,19,2019-07-08-T-001-S-00019
2019-07-08-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide an update on the current level of our rail reliability and how such continued efforts are going to be sustained and funded.,1,20,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00020
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Sir, our MRT service has now stabilised. Our intense efforts to improve rail reliability are producing results. Reliability measured by Mean Kilometres Between Failure or MKBF shows significant and sustained improvement. In the 12 months ending in June 2019, the MRT network achieved an MKBF of more than 950,000 train-km – almost one million train-km. This is a seven-fold improvement over 2015. Commuters have felt the difference. Recent surveys by the Public Transport Council, or PTC, show that commuters’ perceptions of MRT services have improved.",1,21,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00021
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),Our MRT is now on par with other world-class systems like the Taipei Metro and Hong Kong MTR.,2,22,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00022
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"These improvements are the result of a concerted multi-year effort. It required rigorous operations and maintenance, disciplined investment and countless personal sacrifices by thousands of public transport workers who have worked day and night to improve the network. We should give them our thanks. I would also like to thank commuters for their patience and understanding. In particular, for the Early Closures and Late Openings or ECLOs, which have given LTA and the rail operators precious engineering hours to step up maintenance and renewal as our MRT lines age.",3,23,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00023
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Our efforts to improve rail reliability have, however, come at substantial expense to both the operators and the Government. First, the rail operators have ramped up their operations and maintenance to support the much higher level of reliability. Between 2016 and 2017, the total cost of running the rail network has increased by around $270 million. As the fares paid by commuters do not cover operating costs, the rail companies are operating at a loss. In the latest reported financial year, SMRT Trains incurred a loss of $86 million. SBS Transit’s train division also lost tens of millions of dollars.",4,24,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00024
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Second, the Government has spent around $1.9 billion to take over ownership of all rail operating assets. While the $1.9 billion is once-off, the Government is now also responsible for the proper and timely renewal of these assets, and this is a huge and continuing financial liability. Under the rail financing framework, the Government pays for the full upfront cost of civil infrastructure and the first set of operating assets. The subsequent operations and maintenance of operating assets are supposed to be fully paid for by the operators, through the collection of fares and non-fare revenue such as advertising. The depreciation cost of operating assets is supposed to be largely recovered by the Government through licence charges.",5,25,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00025
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"But in practice, as fares have been inadequate to cover the cost of operations, Government subsidies have exceeded their intended scope of funding the civil infrastructure and the first set of operating assets. With intensified maintenance to reach the current level of reliability, the Government operating subsidies have increased further. Over the next five years, the Government expects to spend $4.5 billion on operating subsidies; so this is nearly $1 billion a year. This will be on top of the Government spending $25 billion on civil infrastructure, to build and equip new lines.",6,26,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00026
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"LTA and the rail operators are working closely to keep costs under control. We are redesigning our systems and processes. For example, LTA is using its asset renewal programme to install new technologies, such as condition monitoring sensors. For new MRT lines like the Jurong Region Line, LTA is actively engaging the rail operators upstream on the design of the system, to ensure that it is designed and built with efficient downstream operations and maintenance in mind. The rail operators are also pooling their engineering and maintenance capabilities and collaborating with ST Engineering to cut out duplication and raise productivity. All these upstream interventions are necessary, but they will not fully offset the higher costs of operating and maintaining a highly reliable rail network.",7,27,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00027
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"You may ask  why did fares fall below operating cost? PTC’s fare formula is supposed to keep fares in line with macroeconomic cost factors, such as inflation, wages, fuel costs and increases in the network capacity, with a productivity extraction. But until recently, the PTC fare adjustments were not fully implemented. If we had strictly followed PTC’s fare formula, the operators would have been better able to cover the costs of the intensified maintenance. As it is, the additional costs have been partly covered by increased Government subsidy and partly absorbed by the operators who have been incurring substantial losses. So, this is clearly not sustainable.",8,28,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00028
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"PTC’s current fare formula is valid until 2023. We will continue to operate under this formula. But we must have the discipline to implement the formula fully, as we adjust fares over the next four years. In due course, the PTC will need to review the fare adjustment mechanism to reflect the increased operating cost to support the intensified maintenance and the additional operating subsidies from the Government to the MRT system. Meanwhile, Government will provide the operators with a temporary enhanced maintenance grant. The details are being worked out between MOT and MOF.",9,29,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00029
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Mr Speaker, we have stabilised our MRT service. But we have to sustain these efforts over the long term, in order to prevent problems from gradually building up again. This requires discipline  on the operating side to ensure that LTA and the operators invest in upgrades and preventive maintenance of the rail system long before problems become apparent and serious, and on the commuter side to implement regular fare adjustments to keep the rail system financially viable and Government subsidies under control, so that we can sustain a high quality and affordable public transport network.",10,30,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00030
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"We have entrusted the important task of fare review to the PTC and they will be fair to commuters, taxpayers and operators. I seek the Members’ full support for the PTC as and when they make recommendations on transport fare adjustments.",11,31,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00031
2019-07-08-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister. I would just like to ask one question. Now that we are at the sweet spot of 950,000 MKBF, does the Transport Ministry strive to achieve a higher number? The reason why I ask this is because in life, whilst it is always good to have nicer things, ultimately, somebody needs to pay for it.",1,32,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00032
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, I fully support the sentiment that the Member had just expressed. As an engineer, we know that after one million MKBF, we can always try for two million, three million, four million. But it all comes at a cost. The question is, are commuters prepared to pay at such a high level of reliability? It is little bit like the quality control chart, which in engineering that we studied. We know that once you have hit a certain sweet spot, as the Member put it, you can still achieve higher quality control but the increment cost required is extremely high. In fact, the curve is not like that or plateauing; the curve is exponential.",1,33,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00033
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"And the same thing with rail reliability, at one million MKBF which is what we have targeted. We had surveyed the performance of metros around the world, only a handful consistently achieved a million or crossed a million. And a million, in fact, is a very good, reliable level of service. It does not mean no more delays of more than five minutes, but it means that the frequency of occurrence is tolerable. It will not be often that you encounter such delays. And, if you want to achieve an even higher level of reliability, then one must be prepared to pay for more.",2,34,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00034
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"My own sense is if we can consistently maintain this one million MKBF, that should be good enough. But if for various reasons, future Singapore commuters are demanding an even higher level and are prepared to pay for that greater level of reliability, well, for that, we leave it to the next Transport Minister.",3,35,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00035
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"But do not forget one thing, that having crossed a million, it does not mean it will always be up there.",4,36,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00036
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I am a chronic heart disease patient, and I know that I have to take the medication for life. I have just done my blood test – almost perfect picture – my doctors are happy, I am happy, my family is happy, but it does not mean I can stop the medication. The moment I stop the medication, I know what will happen. Likewise, with the railways.",5,37,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00037
2019-07-08-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, I have two supplementary questions. One, I agree with the Minister that having an improved MKBF does not mean that MKBF will always be at that level. In that light, I would like to ask the Minister whether this would be a suitable time to consider introducing service quality as one of the factors in the Fare Review formula. I say this because this will help set the bar for service quality and help to deter decline in service quality in future years.",1,38,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00038
2019-07-08-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"My second supplementary question is that I would like to ask the Minister does LTA monitor the frequency of delays of less than five minutes, and if not, are there any plans to do so? This is really to enhance the commuter experience on an everyday basis.",2,39,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00039
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, we monitor all delays. We track all delays, we log all delays and we analyse all delays, whether it is one minute, 30 seconds, five minutes or 10 minutes. That is how we are able to churn out the data.",1,40,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00040
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Secondly, service quality and how do you track it. One major service quality is MKBF – frequency of delays – which is what we are monitoring.",2,41,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00041
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Another is ""crowdedness"" of train. That is why we included the Network Capacity Factor, in the Fare Formula, as a proxy for crowdedness.",3,42,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00042
2019-07-08-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.,1,43,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00043
2019-07-08-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Minister, I understand that the current fare levels do not cover system operating cost for rail and they have not for some time. I just have two supplementary questions related to that.",1,44,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00044
2019-07-08-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The first is what is the targeted proportion of Government subsidy for rail operating cost in the longer run. And, second, what kind of changes are we looking at to fare levels? Do we have to expect fare levels in the longer run to reach that target level?",2,45,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00045
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As I have said, this was before my time when there was a big public debate, resulting in the White Paper on public transport. The he Government, and I suppose this House, reached a certain long-term view about how one should fund public transport. And it was as what I had articulated in my reply just now. The intention was the Government will pay for the infrastructure – that means the tracks, the viaducts, the underground tunnels – plus the first set of operating assets, which include the trains. Subsequent train operations, which include future replacement of the operating assets, have to be paid for from the fare revenue plus non-fare revenues, which include advertising. And if we achieve that, then the operating subsidy would have been zero. But now, it is more like more than 30%.",1,46,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00046
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"So, we had a certain long-term view about what operating subsidy should be; it should be zero. But instead, there is a substantial gap. Can we close it overnight? I think that is not practical. So, my more limited objective in the medium term is to be able to cover the recent level of intensified maintenance, which has cost the operators a lot of money but has delivered the current level of reliability, which seems quite satisfactory. I think we should try to recover that. How? At what pace? I think PTC will take that into account. But as I said at the reply – we have just adjusted the formula last year, and we have done one round, four more rounds to go. I think let us keep to the formula. Meanwhile, the operators have to be helped. And that is why the Government is footing the bill through this temporary enhanced maintenance grant.",2,47,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00047
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"But the key point is, over the next four years, let us have the discipline to implement fully the fare formula adjustments which are needed. But I will leave it to PTC to elaborate their case. I would urge Members to fully support them. But at the same time, bear in mind, that this additional maintenance expenditure, which has to be continuously incurred, which allows us to achieve this current level of reliability, has to be paid for.",3,48,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00048
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"At the end of the day, let us do not forget, as a total system, who pays for the system. It is people like you and me, taxpayers as well as commuters. The Istana does not have a printing press of money. The money has to come from either taxpayers or commuters. And we just have to find a balance – what is an appropriate level.",4,49,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00049
2019-07-08-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister for his reply. My question pertains to rail reliability. Over the last few months – April, May, June – we have had reports in The Straits Times about various resignations in SMRT. Can the Minister share with the House, what has been the impact of this reported string of resignations on SMRT's plans towards sustained rail reliability for the long haul?",1,50,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00050
2019-07-08-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question pertains to resignations from maintenance and engineering roles, functions which have traditionally been raised in this House as an area for improvement. Is that an issue of concern for the Ministry? Given the maintenance and engineering resignations from within SMRT, does it constitute a significant number such that Singaporeans ought to be concerned that we start slipping in terms of the targets that the Minister has set?",2,51,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00051
2019-07-08-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"And finally, given the number of corporate related resignations from SMRT, is there any concern that the Ministry has about morale within SMRT and whether the system can continue to move forward reliably?",3,52,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00052
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"There was a recent report, not quite by all media, but a Straits Times report. It was only in The Straits Times. Probably one particular journalist who reported that there was a major upcoming resignation by the Head of Trains in SMRT. I read it and I immediately texted Chairman of SMRT. He was in the air then. As soon as he landed at the airport, he replied to me that ""it is fake news"". The Straits Times gave an apology, but in tiny font size.",1,53,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00053
2019-07-08-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Yes, I understand apologies usually are like that. We have had to deal with some of these as well; and it is always a small section somewhere and you wished it were larger. Generally, the larger point, of course, is about those numbers that the same reporter – I believe you are referring to – has report consistently on SMRT issues. Thirty, I believe was the number for Human Resources-related resignations. And my concern is whether there is a deeper issue within SMRT that the public ought to be concerned about.",1,54,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00054
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, with the change of leadership of SMRT, which has been leading it in the last three years, the team that I have worked together, both above-ground and underground. I know them well; it is a very good team of people. Sometimes, some attrition is useful.",1,55,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00055
2019-07-08-T-002,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister, what is the MKBF for East-West Line because my constituency is in Jurong and the East-West Line is actually quite old? So, is there a plan for even individual lines to reach a MKBF of a million as it is now just an average across the country.",1,56,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00056
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"At my level, I look at the whole network. But yes, I also look at individual lines. After all, there are only five lines. So, it is not too difficult to track them. Out of five lines, three are already above a million, and the other two, which includes East-West Line, are not too far behind. East-West Line continues to make progress. The reason, I did explain a few days ago, between North-South Line and East-West Line, both are almost 30 years old and we are changing out some of the core assets items. We started this process with North-South Line, so North-South Line benefited from this earlier renewal process. North-South Line now is 1.4 million MKBF. East-West Line will eventually catch up and exceed one million.",1,57,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00057
2019-07-08-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister for his explanation of targeting operating subsidy levels. I understand the original target subsidy level was about 0%. Today, it is about 30% or so. I would like to ask the Minister, would he have any views on the target balance between commuters and taxpayers going forward. The operating cost subsidy level going forward, should it be closer to 0% or 30%. What are his views on this?",1,58,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00058
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I am an engineer. I am formula driven. So, the more important thing is discipline. The fares have to be adjusted through a formula, which is what we all agreed, and having debated, discussed and settled on the formula, and the formula will last for a period, in our case, five years. I think much more important is to achieve that discipline – each time the adjustment comes out, the calculation, what is the output, stick to it. That, I think is much more important.",1,59,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00059
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"If you do that and if you are able to do that for four more years, including trying to see how this enhanced maintenance, which has given us today's outcome, can be better funded through additional fares, then I think we would be, in the short term, in a much more comfortable position then what we are today.",2,60,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00060
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Should we drive towards zero? We must never give up on this hope, but if it is not possible in the medium term, it does not matter. The key point is we must not allow the operating subsidy percentage to continue to rise. If from 0%, it now deteriorates to 30% and continues to deteriorate, I think that would be a bad outcome. But if we can reverse it, which I think we can, if we are able to stick to the formula plus taking a look at how the enhanced resources that we have put in can be recovered, then I think, we will be home.",3,61,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00061
2019-07-08-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel compelled to ask this because some of us only look at what is happening now in the rail system. I checked my notes last night and at the first Transport Ministry COS, after the the last General Election, in April 2016, the Minister mentioned to this House that this Government will solve all the rail problems by the end of this term of Government. I was sitting there and when I heard the Minister say it, I nearly fell off my chair. That night, I wrote to the Minister and I told Minister, we have set ourselves an uphill task and I was concerned that we may have over-promised. I know the problem would be solved but I was cautious as to whether it could be solved within four to five years.",1,62,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00062
2019-07-08-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,"I think today, compared to 2016, it was a seven-fold increase in MKBF. So, I think with that in mind, Minister, can I ask, what are your thoughts between April 2016 and now; and whether going forward – I know you have said it is for the next Transport Minister to decide – maybe some goals and objectives.",2,63,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00063

2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"It was not a million initially, in fact, I started off with 800,000. That was set after looking at the global data of the other metros. I thought 800,000 was something doable, during this term of Government. As we go along, we found that, hey, we actually can push further. So, I rounded it up to a million.",2,65,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00065
2019-07-08-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"But, as I have articulated just now, having reached the million, the more important thing now is to have the discipline to ensure that the financial adjustments are made in time, and at the operational level, do not be complacent, because you can just walk backwards very easily. Especially for the old lines, the North-South and East-West Lines, after you have renewed the core assets group, even if you do very little, they may be able to deliver a very reliable service because that is how engineering systems work. They talk about this bathtub curve. It is very critical that LTA and the operators and the leadership are fully aware of this. It does not mean that once you have achieved some level of reliability, it will always be there; you can walk backwards very quickly. It may not be immediate but it will show up in a few years' time, as we experienced not too long ago.",3,66,2019-07-08-T-002-S-00066

2019-07-08-T-003,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"In practice, it can be difficult to prove a person's state of mind. To address this, the MDA builds in presumptions. When these presumptions apply, a person charged with importing prohibited drugs can be presumed to know of their presence, as well as their nature. It is then for the accused to give sufficient evidence to rebut the presumptions.",2,69,2019-07-08-T-003-S-00069
2019-07-08-T-003,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"There is also the legal concept of ""wilful blindness"". Under the law, a person will be treated as having knowledge of a fact, if it can be shown that he  (a) suspected something was amiss; (b) yet, did not verify his suspicion out of fear of legal consequences; and (c) he had reasonable means of discovering the truth.",3,70,2019-07-08-T-003-S-00070
2019-07-08-T-003,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Adili was arrested at Changi Airport in November 2011 after flying in from Nigeria. Two packets containing close to 2 kg of Ice were found concealed in the inner lining of his suitcase. Adili claimed that an acquaintance in Nigeria had told him to pass the suitcase to an unknown person in Singapore and he was given about US$5,000 for his travel expenses. He claimed that he do not know what the suitcase contained, why he had to deliver it and he did not ask those questions of his acquaintance. The one issue was whether Adili could rebut the presumption that he knew the nature of the drugs in his suitcase. The Court of Appeal noted that the prosecution in their cross-examination of Adili and in their arguments in addressing this issue, had conceded that Adili did not actually know of the presence of the drugs.",4,71,2019-07-08-T-003-S-00071
2019-07-08-T-003,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Members will appreciate, once the prosecution accepts that the accused did not know of the presence of the drugs, then the presumption cannot apply. The presumption allows the Court to conclude that the accused did know. But if the prosecution accepts that the accused did not know of that fact, then obviously the presumption cannot be relied upon. This legal reasoning is neither novel nor new, and is not in any way different from the Government’s understanding of the law. There are other observations made by the Court of Appeal on wilful blindness. We are studying those observations carefully and will set out the Government's views in due course, and whether any legislative amendments are necessary.",5,72,2019-07-08-T-003-S-00072
2019-07-08-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mr Speaker, my understanding is that the presumptions in the MDA continue to be key legal tools to combat the trafficking of drugs – that is, the supply of drugs, into Singapore. I have asked the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to confirm whether my understanding is still valid and correct. And, if it is valid and correct – that is, that the presumptions continue to be legal and muscular tools – then, arising out of this decision, can the accused now claim a defence that he had no knowledge just by virtue of the drugs being well-concealed? I certainly hope that an accused should not be able to avail himself of such a defence.",1,73,2019-07-08-T-003-S-00073
2019-07-08-T-003,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Our drug laws have been effective and remain so. We have presumptions under the MDA because it can be difficult to prove a person's state of mind as it is something that is intangible and cannot be seen. The presumptions under the MDA impose a legal burden on accused persons to rebut the presumed facts on a balance of probabilities. The presumptions were introduced precisely to address the difficulty of proving an accused person's subjective state of knowledge. This has been our policy intent, right from the beginning. The fact alone that the drugs were well-hidden would not cause the presumptions to be rebutted. Instead, the outcome of each case depends on a holistic assessment of all its unique facts and circumstances as well as the evidence. Our Courts in the past have carefully scrutinised such claims to assess if they are credible such that the presumption is rebutted. And I am confident that they will continue to do so.",1,74,2019-07-08-T-003-S-00074
2019-07-08-T-003,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Moreover, when the presumptions apply, the accused persons bear the onus of persuading the Court that such claims are credible and should be believed. The outcome of each case depends on its unique facts and circumstances as well as the evidence, and Adili's case turns on its facts. One point worth noting is the robustness of our criminal justice system. If the prosecution fails to discharge its burden of proof, an accused person will be acquitted.",2,75,2019-07-08-T-003-S-00075

2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The recent drone intrusions are the first confirmed intrusions into Changi Airport that we have encountered. They disrupted airport operations and led to 55 flight delays and eight diversions over two nights on 18 and 24 June 2019. Although the impact of the recent drone intrusions has been moderate, these intrusions can have severe impact on airport operations. At Gatwick Airport, for example, drone intrusions shut down the entire airport for three days, affecting approximately 1,000 flights.",1,86,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00086
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,Police investigations into the drone intrusions are on-going. We have learnt from the experiences of other airports that identifying the perpetrators can be challenging and will take time.,2,87,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00087
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Meanwhile, our priority is to detect the drones promptly and prevent them from affecting air traffic and endangering public safety. We have taken a multi-agency approach and deployed national resources towards ensuring the safety of Changi Airport operations.",3,88,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00088
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The drone intrusions have caused some to suggest that we should ban the use of drones. There are many beneficial uses of drones. Besides commercial applications, such as drone deliveries and inspections, there are also many recreational users in Singapore. Our schools and Institutions of Higher Learning use drones to teach Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM), including robotics and programming. It is, therefore, important that we continue to take a balanced approach.",4,89,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00089
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"By and large, the community of drone enthusiasts fly their drones responsibly and are sensitive to the needs and concerns of other users that they share public space with in our crowded urban environment. Our laws governing the use of drones prohibit their use within 5 km of an aerodrome, unless a permit has been granted by CAAS. We have assessed this no-fly zone prohibition to be sufficient.",5,90,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00090
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"However, there will be a few selfish and irresponsible persons who operate in flagrant disregard of the law as well as the needs and concerns of others. We will, therefore, tighten the approach to regulating drone uses and dealing with errant drone users through the following measures.",6,91,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00091
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"First, we will introduce a mandatory registration regime for all drones operating in Singapore as well as a licensing framework for pilots of large or more capable drones. This will ensure that drone operators are made aware of their responsibilities and undertake to conduct their activities in a responsible manner.",7,92,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00092
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Second, there will be stricter enforcement actions against errant drone operators. Last week, two persons who operated a drone close to an aerodrome were charged. This morning, a company pleaded guilty to a charge of operating a drone without a permit. The company was fined $9,000. Further, there is one other case being investigated for breaching the existing drone regulations. If convicted, they could face fines of up to $20,000. In conjunction with this, the Government is also looking into increasing the penalties for errant drone users.",8,93,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00093
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As with other forms of new technology, finding the right balance in terms of regulations will take time, particularly since drone technology continues to evolve very quickly.

I am glad to hear that the Ministry is looking into compulsory registration of drones. I hope that this could be done sooner rather than later. So, can the Senior Minister of State provide an estimated timeline when drone registration may take place?",1,96,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00096
2019-07-08-T-004,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"My second question is we need to go beyond registration. We know that some of this technology allows the operator to fly the drones beyond a certain distance. Given Singapore's small land space, this can even be operated outside of Singapore. I would like to ask if the Ministry has plans to put in place an unmanned aerial traffic management system to track all drones that are in operation within our airspace in real-time so that it can facilitate the authorities to go after any errant operators before it reaches within the high-risk areas, such as the airports.",2,97,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00097
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank the Member for those two supplementary questions. On the first query on the timeline for the mandatory registration, we have set up the UAS Advisory Panel in May 2019, who will be looking into some of these issues, including the suggestion to mandate the registration of UAS and we hope to be able to do so by the end of this year. We are urging the Advisory Panel to double up their efforts so that we can bring the timeline earlier.",1,98,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00098
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As to the Member's suggestion of some form of central flight management system, I had in a previous parliamentary sitting announced that we are currently looking into this concept of a central flight management system, whereby registered UAS will be monitored for their activities and where they are operating. However, this is only useful for UAS operators who are cooperative. As for of UAS operators who are uncooperative, with the intention of performing malicious activities, relying on our existing sensors to pick up these illegal activities will be of the utmost importance.",2,99,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00099

2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to share with Mr Ang that, currently, the incidents are being investigated by the Police. It will be too early to prejudge whether these are committed by foreigners or locals, or the profile of the perpetrators. So, I would urge Mr Ang to give us some time to complete the investigation before we are able to make the necessary announcements.",1,101,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00101
2019-07-08-T-004,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State. I have one supplementary question. We know that enforcement is not the easiest of tasks but it is a necessary step to ensure there are compliance and smooth operations. Is it possible for the Ministry to conduct active enforcement 24/7 like intercepting the drones at the boundary of the no-fly zone because it seems like it is a very tedious task? How will the Ministry go about it?,1,102,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00102
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Picking up the activities of drones can be very challenging because the drones are basically quite small in size. Of course, the ideal situation will be to be able to detect the activities of drones on a 24/7 basis.",1,103,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00103
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"But having said that, I think we need to look at the modus operandi of these drone users. Like I have mentioned before, there are cooperative UAS users and in those cases, the central flight management system will be very useful in identifying exactly where these drone users are operating and the activities of these drones. Should there be situations where there are accidental intrusions into some of these restricted areas, the central flight management system will be able to quickly identify these users and inform them about the accidental intrusions.",2,104,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00104
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"However, we are now dealing with illegal, unauthorised malicious, deliberate activities by UAS users. In these cases, we need to have a risk-stratified approach where certain areas will be given priority in terms of assessing the activities and detecting where they are operating. One example will be near aerodromes such as Changi Airport area, where we will have the capability to detect as well as disrupt these activities in the shortest possible time.",3,105,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00105
2019-07-08-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I would like the Senior Minister of State, were there any geo-fencing solutions in place in Changi Airport by June 2019? If so, why were the existing geo-fencing solutions inadequate to prevent the disruptions in June? I would also like to ask the Senior Minister of State, in light of Minister Ng Eng Hen's comments last week, does CAAS or the Changi Airport Group intend to set up a specialist anti-drone unit to deal with drones?",1,106,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00106
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank the Member for those supplementary questions. In fact, he is correct to say that there are certain solutions like geo-fencing technology to disallow the operation of certain drones into restricted areas. However, this will only be possible, if the user is using a drone that is fitted with that kind of capability. For example, if the users were to use DJI drones, these will be equipped with geo-fencing capability where the drones will not be allowed to operate in certain restricted areas.",1,107,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00107
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Unfortunately, in this particular case, we are of the assessment that such a capability has been disabled so that the geo-fencing solutions will not be capable of preventing these intrusions.",2,108,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00108
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As to the Member's second question of the capabilities of CAAS and Changi Airport Group (CAG), MOT and CAAS are working with the various agencies to continue to tap on the security agencies' assets whenever possible or whenever necessary, without compromising their own operational needs. But in the medium term, CAAS and CAG will also be enhancing their own capability to detect and counter drones on an expedited basis. So, the answer in short is that CAG, together with CAAS, will have their own internal capabilities as soon as possible.",3,109,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00109

The Senior Minister of State replied to say that we have counter measures to deal with safety and security threats posed by UAVs. So, looking at what has happened, it seems that such counter measures are inadequate. So, may I ask the Senior Minister of State, what other measures would MOT take to ensure that your measures are adequate to prevent a recurrence.",1,110,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00110
2019-07-08-T-004,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The second question I have for MOT is whether MOT has quantified the losses caused by the diversion of flights and the closure of the runway, and in the light of the massive inconvenience caused to travellers, whether the current maximum fine imposed is adequate. I am trying to say that we should set a stiff punishment to the perpetrators of these offences to make sure that everyone gets the signal that if you disrupt flights, if you cause runways to be closed, the punishment is stiff enough to make sure that everyone reconsiders what they are doing.",2,111,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00111
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Mr Lim for those supplementary questions. Indeed, when I gave the reply in January this year, we did have the capability to detect and disrupt errant drone users. We have also taken a very coordinated approach in managing the current incident. In fact, after the incidents in Gatwick Airport, we have worked out the SOP and conducted table-top exercises to run through the operational plans so that we would be able to cope with similar incidents within our own airspace.",1,112,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00112
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would want to thank all the agencies that had been working day in, day out, 24/7 to manage the incidents that had happened at Changi Airport. As a result, I think we have been able to keep it under control. We have managed to keep disruption to the runway and airport operations to the minimum. I would also want to take this opportunity to remind all drone users that it is a very, very serious offence to operate unauthorised drones within 5 km of the airports or military bases, or at altitudes above 200 feet. Any errant operationers of drones will not only pose danger to aviation, but also to the personal safety of others. Anyone caught flouting this law will face a fine of up to $20,000 or a jail term of up to 12 months or both. We are currently looking at increasing the penalty framework for such offences.",2,113,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00113
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"What are the strategies that we have put in place to prevent similar occurrence? Well, I would say that our priority right now is to beef up our existing capabilities to detect these drone intrusions as quickly as possible, very promptly, and to ensure that our air traffic operations continue to function safely with minimal disruptions. At the same time, we will also put in place enhanced detection and disruption systems to be able to immobilise or prevent these drones from causing mayhem in the airspace as well as posing a danger to flights. At the same time, CAAS has also been judiciously managing the air traffic operations in Changi to ensure minimal disruptions to the flight operations. This can be done through risk-based approaches, in terms of planning for departures and arrivals.",3,114,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00114
2019-07-08-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"These are some measures we are looking at. As I have replied to Mr Dennis Tan's questions, in addition to working with the other agencies, CAAS and CAG are also beefing up their own internal capabilities so that we will be able to manage these incidents more effectively.",4,115,2019-07-08-T-004-S-00115
2019-07-08-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the current state of Singapore's economy and the growth risks ahead and where does the Government intend to pivot to given this period of great external uncertainty.,1,116,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00116

2019-07-08-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how will the ongoing trade war between China and USA impact Singapore; (b) whether the Ministry can name the top three things that the man in the street should be prepared for; and (c) how will the Government cushion the impact.,1,118,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00118
2019-07-08-T-005,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the implications of the trade dispute between US and China on Singapore's economy; and (b) what are the measures that the Government is prepared to implement should our economy slow down significantly.,1,119,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00119

2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I will group the answers into three parts  first, the state of Singapore’s economy; second, our medium term outlook, and third, our strategies to manage the challenges and seize new opportunities.",1,124,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00124
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The global economic environment has weakened. The IMF has lowered its forecast for global GDP growth this year by 0.2%-points, from 3.5% to 3.3%. Key uncertainties include and these include  (a) the US-China trade dispute, which has gone beyond retaliatory tariffs to other areas, including restrictions on technology access and sales; (b) the uncertainty and the risk of a disorderly Brexit; and (c) the political uncertainties of some regional economies.",2,125,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00125
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"All these have dampened consumer and business confidence. Lower demand in our key export markets has in turn affected our outward-oriented sectors such as electronics, precision engineering and wholesale trade, whose performance remains weak. Although EDB is on track to achieving its Foreign Investments targets for this year, we are watching businesses’ investment decisions very closely.",3,126,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00126
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"However, there are pockets of strength in our economy. The information and communications sector is expected to grow given firms’ robust demand for IT and digital solutions. The education, health, and social services sector is similarly expected to remain resilient. The construction sector has also turned around after three years of contraction. Our labour market remains resilient – employment continued to increase in the first quarter of the year, while unemployment remains low at 2.2%.",4,127,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00127
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In May, MTI projected that our economy would grow between 1.5% and 2.5% this year. MTI will review our forecast in August, taking into account the full set of economic data for the second quarter, as well as the latest external economic conditions. Let me touch on the second part of my answer and the medium-term outlook for Singapore.",5,128,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00128
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The medium-term outlook for the Singapore economy will be determined by the following factors.,6,129,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00129
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, how the US-China trade conflict develops. Further tariffs will impact more goods, and bring about even greater re-organisation of global supply chains. The IMF had estimated that the US-China tariffs could cut global economic output by 0.5%-points in 2020. Both countries’ agreement to resume trade negotiations is welcome news, but there are fundamental disagreements between them and those will take time to resolve. Prolonged US-China tensions will further undermine global business and consumer confidence.",7,130,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00130
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, our medium-term outlook will depend on how our major export markets perform. Southeast Asia remains a bright spark, and the US economy appears to be holding up. However, China’s economy could slow down more sharply than expected due to the trade conflict with the US and this could further dampen its import demand from the region. And Europe needs a decisive resolution on Brexit.",8,131,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00131
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"While we must weather these immediate challenges, we must, more importantly, navigate more fundamental shifts in the global economy that will shape our medium- to long-term prospects.",9,132,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00132
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"One is the future of the multilateral trading system. Over the past 40 years, Singapore has benefited from increased economic integration and free trade, underpinned by international rules that apply to countries big and small, and anchored by the World Trade Organization (WTO).",10,133,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00133
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Unfortunately, the multilateral trading system is currently under stress. The risks of economic balkanisation, where markets are bifurcated and trade, talent and data flows are disrupted, have grown. An increasingly protectionist global environment would reduce our access to markets. When we are all reduced to competing for a slice of a shrinking economic pie, no one wins.",11,134,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00134
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second is the emergence of global rules that may affect our status as a global trading hub. For instance, on-going discussions to introduce minimum effective tax rates across countries will affect our competitiveness and carbon caps will constrain our growth potential. We must navigate this carefully to preserve our economic space.",12,135,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00135

2019-07-08-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, as the Minister has just said, our global trade systems are under stress. Indeed, the way things are developing, the world may indeed be trading less with each other, or investing less with each other as well, and both are important. Trade and investments are always the key drivers for the Singapore economy. So, I want to ask the Minister  should we be concerned that more economies around the world are becoming more nationalistic, governments are increasingly looking at balance of trade, current account balances as a pure zero-sum game? How can tiny Singapore respond to this rising economic nationalism?",2,165,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00165
2019-07-08-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, beyond exporting goods and services to the consumers of the world, what are the other ways we can sustain growth within our economy? How can it create opportunities for Singapore? Can Singapore break out from this traditional C+I+G+X kind of model of growth?",3,166,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00166
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, indeed, Mr Liang Eng Hwa has raised a very serious concern for all of us, not just Singapore, but for all countries that are participating in the global trading system.",1,167,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00167
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As countries become more nationalistic and undertake more unilateralist or protectionist measures, it is a concern to all. The concern will be that there will not just be a shift in the supply chains or the distribution networks or the production sites. The greater concern will be a general fall in the investors and consumer confidence.",2,168,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00168
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For Singapore to respond to this scenario, we must make sure that our companies have real capabilities that can allow them to inter-operate across a more fragmented landscape. This is not easy but this is something that we must do in the face of a potential fragmentation of the global economy.",3,169,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00169
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the Member's second question, as any economics student will know, that GDP equation of C+I+G+X-M, that is for Gross Domestic Product (GDP). How must Singapore grow our economy, going forward? What the Member is alluding to, if I read him correctly, is that we must not just look at what is happening domestically in Singapore. And indeed, that is true.",4,170,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00170
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"There are three things that we should be focused on. First, what happens domestically. How do we help our companies and workers to build real capabilities in order to contest in the new world environment? That is domestic. How do we help them access markets; how do we make sure that the rules allow our companies to overcome both the tariff and the non-tariff barriers? So, that is the first part of how we need to run our economy.",5,171,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00171
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The second part of how we need to run our economy goes beyond the GDP equation that we just mentioned. And we talked about the Gross National Product (GNP). How do we have a sizeable base of companies that operate beyond Singapore but contributing back to the Singapore economy. And I will use the example of PSA.,6,172,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00172
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Once upon a time, we believed that the port is critical to Singapore and we continue to believe so. But a port has two possible functions. One is to promote trade with a particular country. The other – most ports are like that – they serve the local domestic economy.",7,173,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00173
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But there is a second way of looking at the port which is the way the Singapore port has developed. We are an exchange platform so people do not just trade with Singapore; people trade through Singapore. So, night, the vast majority of the containers that come to Singapore come through Singapore and we are a major exchange hub. But having done that, it is still not sufficient because trade routes might change, and the global supply chains and patterns will also change, which is why over the years, PSA have built up a string of ports all around the world, allowing them not just to be a port operator, but allowing them to be global logistic players. So, even if the goods do not come to Singapore or come through Singapore, they will trade on the PSA platform or on the Singapore platform. This is a new way of looking at how we should do business.",8,174,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00174
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"That is why Enterprise Singapore (ESG), together with the rest of our economic agencies, are spending so much effort to help our companies to use the world as our hinterland and never be constrained by our geographical size or geographical location. And that will be the next lap of our economic development, and that will be one way where we break the conventional paradigm of the GDP equation which Mr Liang mentioned C+I+G+X-M.",9,175,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00175
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The third prong which we must always bear in mind and sometimes, not so obvious in the public consciousness in our economic strategy, will be how we manage our reserves and where we put our investments. Today, we are in a fortunate whereby for every $5 we spend in the budget, slightly more than $1 this year comes from our returns from our investment. This has given Singapore economy a significant boost and help our budgetary constraints very much. And thus, we must continue to harness our reserves judiciously to make sure that we create the biggest positive impact for Singaporeans.",10,176,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00176
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, going forward, our economic strategy is not just about looking at what we can do domestically, between local firms and foreign firms operating here. We must also look at how we grow the external wing, our GNP, and how we master our investment resources to make sure that we have the ammunition for us to weather the storm.",11,177,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00177
2019-07-08-T-005,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),I would like to thank the Minister for answering the question just now. I think he highlighted the importance of strengthening the fundamentals in Singapore. I have two supplementary questions.,1,178,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00178
2019-07-08-T-005,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"One is related to something more detailed, in particular, the recent US Department of Commerce proposed export controls on 14 categories of technology. And I think it has some impact on Singapore, in particular, what the Minister mentioned, in terms of investments as well. So, whether he can share with the House whether there would be potential impact on Singapore, in terms of investments and potential tech-related restrictions that US imposes on China, and how that affects Singapore companies as well. That is the first question.",2,179,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00179
2019-07-08-T-005,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second is the Minister highlighted about the trade and tech diversions and the supply chain changes. In the region, other countries are also putting in efforts to pull in some of these trade diversions into their countries. Can the Minister share EDB's strategies, in terms of reaping some of the benefits, or pulling some of these production networks into Singapore, if any?",3,180,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00180
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, let me deal with the first one. Indeed, the restrictions on export of what is deemed as a sensitive technology will have implications for the entire global technological eco-system. In the short term, various companies and countries may be able to take measures to shift their production or supply chains elsewhere. This is what we call the substitution effect. But, in the longer term, what we are most worried about, is that it will lead to a bifurcation, if not, a fragmentation of the entire technological space. If that happens, then we are all for the worst of it because it means that the global production system cannot be optimised as a whole, but it will be sub-optimised in parts. This will lead to increased costs, a fragmented production chain and so forth. So, that will be the greatest concern.",1,181,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00181
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our Singapore strategy remains that we will thrive to be able to inter-operate across the different jurisdictions and different systems. But we must also inspire confidence in people who put their investments here that even in such a world, we are able to manage the different sensitivities across different countries, properly.",2,182,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00182
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the Member's second part about the shifts in the global supply chain, indeed, to use a very specific example, some people have said that various productions and supply chains have shifted out from China in the global re-organisation of that product chain. Some of it will come to some parts of the region, around here. Some of it might come to Singapore.",3,183,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00183
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But I must say that Singapore does not compete with the rest of the regional economies for the entire shift in the global production chain. There are some things that we do much better; there are some things that will not be re-allocated here. The simple example is this  for what we call the low-mix, high-volume production, most of them will not come to Singapore because they compete on the basis of scale, labour costs, land costs. But what will come to Singapore will be what we call the high-mix, low-volume. This is where trust, standards, quality, assurance, intellectual property (IP) protection will become very important. And we have seen more of such investments siting in Singapore.",4,184,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00184
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, just to give an example, last week, I went to GSK to open the new facilities. Today's precision medicine is no longer just producing high volume at low cost. Those kinds of medicine and drugs will probably shift to other countries where there is a cost-competitive advantage. But GSK will be very keen to work with EDB to site their high-mix, low-volume pharmaceutical products in Singapore. Why? Because for such high-mix, low-volume production, they require speed to market. Which means that your supply chain, your distribution networks must be robust. That, we do better than most other countries. For such industries, it will require a strong IP regime where people can enforce their IP. That, we also do well. For such productions to happen in small batches, high volume, you require a certain agility in your regulatory framework, which we also do well.",5,185,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00185
2019-07-08-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, there are and there will be sectors that will play to Singapore's advantage but it does not mean that everything that moves out of China or moves out of India will necessarily come to Singapore. That is not our strategy.",6,186,2019-07-08-T-005-S-00186

2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Let me move on to the penalties themselves. Today, our penalties for irresponsible driving offences are generally less severe than in other jurisdictions. For example, for Dangerous Driving causing Death. The maximum jail term in Singapore is only five years. It is 14 years in the UK, 10 years in New South Wales in Australia, Hong Kong as well as Malaysia. In most instances, the actual sentences meted out are lower than the maximum penalties. In recent times, there were at least two separate instances of a motorist beating the red light, colliding into and killing another person. In the April 2017 case, a pedestrian was killed. In the April 2018 case, the vehicle collided into another car, killing the rear passenger. Both motorists were charged for the offence of Dangerous Driving causing Death. Their sentences were five and seven months of imprisonment. These are manifestly inadequate. Therefore, we intend to raise the penalties. We also need to raise sentencing norms for egregious irresponsible driving offences, particularly those that result in death or some form of permanent disabilities.",27,224,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00224
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Let me first deal with penalties in general. Clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill amend sections 64 and 65 to introduce higher maximum jail terms and fines, where applicable, as compared to the existing penalties under the Penal Code and RTA. We will also introduce additional levers to take irresponsible motorists off the roads more quickly and for longer.",28,225,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00225
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"First, we will give Traffic Police the discretion to impose immediate suspension for all Dangerous Driving offences, as well as Careless Driving offences that cause Death or Grievous Hurt. Otherwise, these motorists can continue to drive until such time that they are convicted. Traffic Police already have the discretion to do so for offences that result in death, serious injury or serious damage to buildings. Clause 11 amends section 47C to cover all cases of Dangerous Driving as well.",29,226,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00226
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Second, we will introduce minimum disqualification or DQ periods for offences that cause Death and Grievous Hurt. In exceptional circumstances, such as where the motorist committed the offence while rushing for a medical emergency, the Courts will have the discretion not to apply the minimum DQ periods. Clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill amend sections 64 and 65 for these purposes.",30,227,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00227

Clauses 3 and 15 bring this into effect. For these offences, the Courts will have the discretion not to forfeit the vehicle if the offender is not the vehicle owner and had driven the vehicle without the owner’s consent. In addition, for specified offences, the Courts will also have the discretion not to forfeit the vehicle, if there are good reasons.

It will include a person who has a previous conviction for any Rash or Negligent Act offence in the Penal Code where irresponsible driving was involved. Likewise, any Dangerous Driving or Careless Driving convictions under the RTA, or speeding-related convictions are included. Speeding-related convictions will include offences such as Illegal Speed Trials, colloquially known as illegal street racing, which have been tried and convicted by the Courts. However, it will not include speeding-related offences which have been compounded, which is the way most minor speeding offences are settled today.",33,230,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00230
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Speaker, I will now turn to the amendments for driving under influence. Drivers who are drunk or drug-impaired show a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users. They are one of the biggest contributors to serious accidents on our roads. These are also accidents that clearly could have been avoided if the motorist had not come under influence or did not drive. Currently, such motorists typically face the same maximum penalties as other motorists who cause accidents. The judge may take into consideration that the offender was driving under influence during the sentencing itself. But it would be clearer to have our intentions codified in law. In fact, our intention is for offenders driving under influence to face stiffer penalties to signal the aggravated seriousness of their actions.",34,231,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00231
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"In August 2013, a motorist drove his car at high speeds, swaying between lanes along CTE. Eventually, he rammed into a group of five, killing four victims. He was sentenced to the maximum penalty of five years in jail for dangerous driving causing death, the maximum punishment available. The Court could not mete out higher penalties even though he had knowingly consumed drugs before driving and was a recalcitrant offender. We therefore propose to introduce additional penalties for a motorist who commit a Dangerous Driving or Careless Driving offence, and who is found guilty for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs; or had refused to take a breathalyser or blood alcohol test when directed by Traffic Police. These will be in the form of additional maximum penalties and additional minimum DQ periods.",35,232,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00232
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"For example, a first-time offender who causes death by Dangerous Driving and had done so while driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs will face an additional maximum jail term of two years, and an additional minimum DQ period of two years. This means that motorists who drink-and-drive, and cause death by Dangerous Driving will now be liable for a maximum jail term of 10 years, and to a minimum DQ period of at least 12 years. Repeat offenders will likewise face higher penalties of up to 19 years in jail and lifetime disqualification from driving. An individual will be deemed a repeat offender for an offence of driving under influence, if he has a previous conviction for driving under influence, for being in charge of a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or for failure to produce a specimen for a drug or alcohol test.",36,233,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00233
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Speaker, during the public engagement process, respondents felt that even a standalone driving under influence offence where no accident is caused, should attract higher penalties to better reflect its gravity.",37,234,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00234
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"We agree with this view. The consumption of alcohol or drugs already makes a motorist a danger to other road users. Section 67 in Clause 17 of the Bill will raise the penalties to about double the current levels. We will also raise the existing minimum DQ period to two years for first-time driving under influence offenders and five years for second-time driving under influence offenders. A lifelong disqualification will be imposed on third-time driving under influence offenders. In addition, we will amend section 47C through clause 11 to allow Traffic Police to impose immediate suspension for all driving under influence offences.",38,235,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00235
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Speaker, some Members may rightly point out that the penalties, particularly those for first-time offenders, are still lower than those in other jurisdictions. How exactly then does MHA intend to raise the sentencing norms for irresponsible driving offences? This is where the last category of changes come in.",39,236,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00236
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"We will set benchmarks based on egregious offences where manifestly inadequate jail sentences must be avoided. We will introduce mandatory minimum jail sentences, or MMS, for Dangerous Driving causing Death or Grievous Hurt. With the changes, a first-time offender for Dangerous Driving causing Death will be jailed for at least two years. Repeat offenders will be jailed for at least four years. We will also have mandatory minimum jail sentences for the offences of Dangerous Driving causing Death or Grievous Hurt, where driving under influence is involved. A first-time offender who causes death will be jailed for at least three years. Repeat offenders can face minimum sentences of up to six years in jail.",40,237,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00237
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Take for example, the case of the 62-year-old rag-and-bone lady, whom I mentioned earlier, and she was killed by a drink-driver. The offender had been drinking for nine straight hours and was charged for the offence of causing death by a rash act. During sentencing, also taken into consideration were one count of drink-driving and another count of causing grievous hurt to the dead victim’s husband by a rash act. In all, against a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment, he received a term of 10 months and disqualification of eight years. Many people felt rightly that the motorist was let off too lightly. With the changes, the offender will be sentenced to at least three years in jail, if he is convicted of both Dangerous Driving causing Death and driving under influence. The minimum disqualification will also be lengthened to 12 years.",41,238,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00238
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Speaker, after we had tabled the Bill for First Reading, we received additional feedback. Some respondents noted that while mandatory minimum jail sentences were justified for egregious offenders, there may be rare but valid cases where exceptional extenuating circumstances prevail and where imposing the minimum jail sentence may result in an unfair punishment. These concerns are valid. We need not prescribe the extenuating instances in law. Instead, we have introduced an amendment to the Bill to provide the Courts with discretion to deviate from and impose a sentence lower than the mandatory minimum jail sentence terms should there be special reasons to do so. Special reasons must constitute exceptional mitigating factors or circumstances specific to the case. For example, the offender was rushing to send a passenger for emergency medical treatment in a life-and-death situation when the accident occurred.",42,239,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00239
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Speaker, motorists who have a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users should be severely punished. During our public engagement, some respondents asked if punishments for inconsiderate non-motorists should also be increased. The road situation today is more complex as compared to 20 years ago when the last major review was conducted. There are new groups of road users, such as active mobility device users or new types of vocational drivers and riders. Motorists alone cannot be held responsible for the road safety of all road users. These amendments, therefore, cannot be viewed in isolation.",43,240,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00240

2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"First, I will cover the measures to tighten the regulatory regime against irresponsible driving; and second, other minor amendments to improve road safety.",2,246,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00246
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"The Traffic Police operate the Driver Improvement Points System, DIPS for short. Under this regime, a motorist clocks demerit points when he commits a traffic offence – the more severe the offence, the more demerit points it will attract. Motorists that exceed a stipulated threshold will have their licences suspended.",3,247,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00247
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"The DIPS regime is a deterrent against risk-taking behaviour that is dangerous to other road users, such as illegal U-turns, speeding, and beating red-lights.",4,248,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00248
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"MHA intends to enhance the DIPS regime to further deter risk-taking behaviour by motorists. There are four key measures. First, to streamline the licence suspension and revocation process; second, to lengthen the licence suspension period for repeat offenders; third, to revoke all of an individual’s probationary licences, as long as any one of them is revoked; and fourth, to allow the Courts to consider past compounded road traffic offences as an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing a person convicted of a road traffic offence.",5,249,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00249

2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"First, to streamline the suspension and revocation process. Currently, some errant motorists delay the suspension or revocation of their licences by misusing the appeals mechanism. They file multiple unmerited appeals at different junctures and through different channels. By doing so, they drag out the process, so that they can continue to drive in the interim. But we need to remember, these are irresponsible drivers who have already been picked up for multiple offences leading to a suspension or revocation. To allow them to continue driving while they drag out the appeal process, is to put other motorists at risk.",7,251,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00251
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"We will amend the RTA to make it clear that the Deputy Commissioner of Police, or DCP for short, is allowed to effect licence suspension or revocation four weeks from the date of its notice to the affected motorist. Motorists can still appeal to DCP. Police where possible will process and respond to an appeal within two weeks of receiving the appeal. However, DCP will have the power to suspend or revoke the licence four weeks after the date of its notice, even if the appeal is still being processed. For example, there are cases where the motorist only submits an appeal close to four weeks after receiving the notice. The DCP may still suspend or revoke the licence first and subsequently rescind the suspension or revocation if there are valid grounds to do so.",8,252,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00252
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"We need to bear in mind that to be facing a suspension or revocation, the errant motorist will already have committed several offences prior.",9,253,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00253
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"Mr Speaker, at this point, I would like to highlight that Traffic Police only suspend or revoke an individual’s licence, when there are good reasons to do so.",10,254,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00254
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"First, a suspension or revocation is imposed only when objective criteria are met. For suspension, this usually happens when the motorist has breached the demerit point threshold – either 24 or 12 points, depending on how many prior suspensions he has had. For revocation, this happens when he is on probation and has clocked more than 12 demerit points.",11,255,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00255
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"Second, for Traffic Police to mete out demerit points to a motorist, one of two conditions must apply. First, the Courts have convicted the motorist of the offence. Or two, the motorist has compounded the offence he is reasonably suspected to have committed. This means that the motorist would have already had a previous opportunity to appeal against these individual offences, by either contesting it in Court or appealing to Traffic Police during an offer of composition, before the demerit points were awarded to him.",12,256,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00256
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"Third, motorists who are caught committing a road traffic violation also typically have little reason to dispute against the violation. Traffic Police only take enforcement action when they are strong grounds that an offence has been made out. For a majority of offences, the evidence typically comes in the form of photographic or video evidence or by detection from Traffic Police’s enforcement unit.",13,257,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00257
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"I would also like to speak on appeals in general. A number of affected motorists appeal against suspension or revocation on the basis that they need to drive as part of their job. Actually, if an individual depends on driving to make a living, that is all the more reason for him to drive safely and for him to be off the roads if he is unable or unwilling to do so. Traffic Police, as part of the overall road safety strategy, offer motorists the opportunity to improve their driving behaviour through retraining courses.",14,258,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00258
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"Firstly, motorists who accumulate more than one-third of the maximum allowable demerit points are offered the opportunity to attend the Safe Driving Course, an early intervention measure for those who have exhibited unsafe driving behaviours.

2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"Secondly, motorists who are liable for their first and second suspensions are offered the opportunity to attend the Driver Improvement Point System Retraining Course, also known as the DIPS Retraining Course, which is a rehabilitation course to help errant motorists re-learn and practise safe driving habits. Upon successfully passing the course, motorists will have their suspension periods reduced significantly.",16,260,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00260
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"Mr Speaker, I would now like to address the second measure – lengthen the licence suspension period for serial offenders. We propose to amend the RTA to allow Traffic Police to suspend an individual’s licence for up to five years – from up to three years currently. To put this in perspective, the upper scale of the suspension applies to very serious serial offenders. For instance, with the change, motorists who are facing their sixth suspension, which is equivalent to accumulating demerit points from at least seven red-light beating offences in a short span of time, will have their licence suspended for four years. Those who are facing their seventh or more suspension will have their licence suspended for five years. As you can see, these are recalcitrant offenders who are a real danger on the roads to themselves, to other motorists and road users. Subsidiary legislation will be prescribed to stipulate the length of the suspension period based on the number of previous suspensions. That there are drivers who have been slapped with six or more suspensions may sound unbelievable, but I assure you, it is not unheard of. In 2018 alone, there were seven such motorists.",17,261,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00261
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"I now move to the third measure – revoking all of an individual’s probationary licences, as long as any one of them is revoked. At present, under certain circumstances, a motorist may continue to hold probationary licences for other vehicle classes even though one of his probationary licence has been revoked.",18,262,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00262
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"This is a gap that should be addressed. Traffic Police expect a motorist to take extra care to drive safely when he is on probation, given his relative inexperience. If he breaches the demerit point threshold for any of his probationary licences, for the safety of other road users, he should no longer be allowed to drive any vehicle for which he holds a probationary licence.",19,263,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00263
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),The fourth measure is to allow the Courts to consider past compounded road traffic offences as an aggravating factor for the purpose of sentencing a person convicted of a road traffic offence.

2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"The first pertains to the definition of animals, and the obligations of motorists when accidents involving animals occur.

2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"First, if the body of the animal or carcass is a road safety hazard, motorists should take steps to alert other road users to the obstruction.

2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"Second, if there is reasonable belief that the animal may have an owner, motorists should make attempts to inform the owner or the Police, for example, in road accidents involving dogs that are wearing a collar.",25,269,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00269
2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"Mr Speaker, the second amendment pertains to physical driving licences.

2019-07-08-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling),"The third amendment pertains to the penalties for riding without a helmet. At present, section 74 of the RTA subjects motorcyclists and pillion riders who do not wear helmets to a fine of up to $200. This penalty is less severe than those of other similar offences in the RTA such as failing to wear a proper seat belt or making an illegal U-turn, which attract a jail term of up to three months and a fine of up to $1,000.

The accident left his passenger tetraplegic and bedbound, a condition likely to be permanent. In June 2018, while en route home to Singapore from Malaysia, a family got into an accident. The parents passed away from the accident, leaving behind two young children. In June 2014, a five-year-old boy had to spend more than 100 days in hospital and was permanently paralysed on the right side of his body after a delivery driver failed to keep a proper look-out or a safe distance on the expressway.",2,276,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00276

2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),This Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill prevents and deters road traffic offences as well as calibrates the punishment to achieve a more accurate form of justice in the particular situation.,4,278,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00278
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Allow me, Sir, before I move on to other aspects of the Bill to also speak up on behalf of drivers and pedestrians.

Such a startling appearance on road crossings causes immense danger to the drivers of vehicles and other road users, and can cause death or serious injury.",5,279,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00279
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Pedestrians too suffer at the hands of reckless PMD users. So, while the focus of this Bill, which I support, is to make driving more safe, I hope the authorities and the Courts can consider the serious role of reckless PMD users in causing accidents on our roads and on our pedestrian or road crossings. That should reduce the culpability of the driver of the vehicle.",6,280,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00280
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The other concern I have, before going in particular the details of this Bill, is about turning into a road where the traffic light is green, while at the same time a green man allows a pedestrian to cross the same road. The presence of a green light and a simultaneous green man can cause confusion and accidents can happen. To avoid such confusion, would the rules allow for a green arrow to be coupled with a red man, or a green man to be coupled with a red arrow? This will make the road safer for drivers and pedestrians, if needed this is possible and the traffic flow allows for such permutations.",7,281,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00281
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, this Bill prevents further road traffic offences by providing for disqualification for longer periods and for more offences in clauses 13, 14 and 17. Such offences include certain instances of dangerous driving, driving without due care and drink-driving. There are also longer suspension periods under clause 8. In particular, the new section 46(2)(b) also allows a licence to be suspended after the person completes a prescribed course on safe driving. This prevents further road traffic offences not just by taking the driver off the road for a certain amount of time but also by correcting certain driving practices.",8,282,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00282
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In relation to disqualification periods, is there supposed to be a difference between how the new section 65(6) and the new section 64(2D) operates? The words of both proposed sections are the same but the relevant paragraphs in the explanatory statements are different. The second paragraph on clause 13 in the Explanatory Statement states that the disqualification periods ""serve as a guide to the court as the court retains discretion whether to order the disqualification or depart from what is in the section."" On the other hand, the second paragraph on clause 14 says that ""Under the amended section 65, a court that convicted a person of an offence under subsection (1) must in certain cases order that the person be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period starting on the date of the person's conviction, or the date of the person's release from prison."" Would the Minister or the Senior Parliamentary Secretary kindly clarify how these proposed sections would operate?",9,283,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00283
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Disqualifications do not just prevent future traffic offences, they also deter potential traffic offences from happening. This second theme of the Bill can also be seen in enhanced punishments and the forfeiture of vehicles.",10,284,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00284
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One of the crimes that has enhanced punishment is section 67 driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Every month for the first nine months of 2018, one person lost his or her life to an accident related to drink-driving. Although the number of persons arrested for drink-driving decreased by 3.7% in 2018 compared to 2017, if I am not mistaken, the number of drink-driving accidents increased by 17.3%, with the proportion of motorcyclists increasing by 51.3%. Under clause 17, the punishment for drink-driving is roughly doubled. Instead of a minimum period of 12 months disqualification, the amended section 67(2) provides for two years for a first offender and five years for repeat offenders. The new section 65AA under clause 15 also provides for forfeiture of the vehicle in certain circumstances, such as where the driver was drink-driving and whose reckless driving or driving without due care caused death or grievous hurt.",11,285,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00285
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides ensuring that there is sufficient deterrence against drink-driving, we should also ensure that the victim of a drink-driving accident can obtain compensation. When I asked the Minister for Transport in October last year during a Parliamentary Question, the reply was ""Insurance policies cannot be restricted from paying out for such liabilities incurred from drink-driving."" However, at least some motor insurance policies have exemption clauses that say that the insurance company ""shall not be liable in respect of  1. Any accident, loss, damage or liability caused sustained or incurred … (b) whilst any Insured Vehicle in respect of which indemnity is provided by this Policy is  …(iii) being driven by the Policyholder or by any person on the order of or with the permission of the Policyholder whilst under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.""",12,286,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00286
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),The victim in drink-driving accidents are put in a hard position as the drink-driver may not have enough money on hand to pay the victim. This would be exacerbated if the drink-driver’s vehicle is forfeited under clause 15 of this Bill as the drink-driver would be less able to secure a loan. I am not saying that you should not forfeit the vehicle. I am in favour of forfeiting the vehicle. My concern is for the victim of a drink-driving accident being compensated.,13,287,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00287
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, I ask the Ministry does the Ministry have any plans to ensure that there is support for victims of drink-driving accidents, whether it be ensuring that there be financial compensation or whether it be counselling to overcome any trauma from the incident?",14,288,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00288
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides controlling the situation through the introduction of deterrent, preventive and calibrated punishment regimes, what is the demographic of the drivers for the bulk of accidents and apprehensions made due to traffic offences? According to the General Insurance Association’s review in 2018, the 4% dip in accident reports was largely attributable to fewer private-hire cars and taxis on the road. How are road safety education and campaign efforts effectively targeting these more ""at-risk"" demographics? What are the common root reasons for accidents? When there is change in traffic lights or roads, what is being done to lower the risk of accidents happening? Also, what plans does the Ministry have to enhance road safety to keep up with changing challenges such as a possible increase in delivery motor-bicycles, cyclists and even users of e-scooters or other personal mobility devices who choose to flout the rules against riding on the roads?",15,289,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00289
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Another group of offences with enhanced penalties I would like to draw attention to is that of driving without a licence, or employing or permitting another to drive without a licence, under suspension, or under disqualification. The punishments have been raised significantly. For example, in the case of driving without a licence or permitting or employing someone to drive without a licence, the current section 43 of the Road Traffic Act does not specify a penalty. According to section 131, the penalty for offences without a specified penalty would be a fine not exceeding $1,000 and/or imprisonment not exceeding three months for the first offence and a fine not exceeding $2,000 and/or imprisonment not exceeding six months for subsequent offences. A lot of ""not exceeding"" in that sentence.",16,290,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00290
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"But clause 2 of the Bill raises the penalty for these offences to a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment not exceeding three years for the first offence and a fine up to $20,000 and/or imprisonment up to six years for subsequent offences. What is the rationale for raising the penalties? Will the proposed enhanced punishment be overly harsh on individuals who may have unknowingly driven a vehicle without a licence? For example, those above the age of 65 who were unaware that their licence had expired, or whatever the age cap for that is.",17,291,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00291
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The third theme of the Bill I want to speak on is calibration. This Bill better calibrates the punishment meted out for the particular circumstance. This is most evident by the punishment regime in clauses 13 and 14 relating to dangerous driving and driving without due care in sections 64 and 65. The Bill calibrates it according to culpability, aggravating factor of drink-driving or some other serious offence, gravity of hurt caused, and whether or not the offender is recalcitrant.",18,292,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00292
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),Why is unauthorised speed trials and competition pegged to driving without due care or reasonable consideration under the new section 65(5)(a) and (b) and not reckless or dangerous driving under the new section 64(2C)(a) and (b)? There is a question mark after that.,19,293,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00293
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Unauthorised competitions are deliberate and extremely dangerous, sometimes clocking speeds that more than triple the prescribed speed limit. Although clause 15 provides that a vehicle may be forfeited for certain driving dangerously or without due care, they focus on drink-driving and are ill-suited to address illegal racing as racers may not be drunk when driving. Is it the case that the prosecution has to choose between possible forfeiture of the car and a higher possible sentence of reckless driving when charging for a situation involving illegal racing?",20,294,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00294
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Another way this Bill allows punishment to be better calibrated is by providing for compounded offences to be taken into consideration for sentencing in the new section 139AA, clause 21 of this Bill. This would give the Court a clearer picture of the driver’s driving practices and habits so that the various principles of sentencing can be more accurately weighed out.",21,295,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00295
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In closing, Sir, I hope that educative aspects of prevention will also supplement these changes in the law to enhance the consequences of certain offences for deterrence and prevention.",22,296,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00296
2019-07-08-T-010,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In the whole, this Bill prevents and deters road traffic offences and provides for a better calibrated punishment system and, therefore, I support it.",23,297,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00297
2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, I had not originally intended to speak on the Road Traffic Amendment Bill but life clearly had other plans for me. Last month, I was knocked down by a bus, a big, lumbering double decker to be exact. On the evening of 13 June, at about 8.15 pm, I was crossing the road at the junction of Upper Changi Road East and Somapah Road on my way to the Singapore University of Technology and Design to meet my students. They had developed a game to educate the public about fake news and were excited to demonstrate it to me. And by the way, the game is brilliant.",1,298,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00298
2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Coming back to me at the road junction, I had waited for the light to turn green in my favour and proceeded to walk once it did so. I assure the Members of the House that at no point was I using my phone and that I was single-mindedly focused on making my way across as briskly as possible. When I was about three quarters of the way to the other side, I suddenly felt something very large looming over me and I turned to my left to see a double decker about this close to me. I was stunned and I even made eye contact with the driver and caught his horrified expression as he saw me. The next thing I knew, I had been thrown onto my back and I felt my head hitting the road very, very hard. At that point I literally saw stars, those in my head and those in our beautiful night sky although I could not quite tell which was which. Thankfully, I did not lose consciousness and managed to scramble to the side of the road while the bus driver pulled over. He alighted to inquire as to my well-being and we exchanged information.",2,299,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00299
2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"In spite of my shocked and injured state, I felt profound sympathy for the bus captain. He looked highly stressed, likely worried about the consequences of the accident. As an occasional driver myself, I certainly do not wish to be in that position. Luckily for the both of us, I walked away from the accident largely unscathed. I endured severe aching for the next few days but fortunately did not suffer from any fractures or concussions. Indeed, I am truly grateful that I can stand here today to deliver this speech.",3,300,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00300
2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"My accident gave me much to think about, but especially in relation to road safety. What could have caused the bus captain to completely overlook my presence on a well-lit road when traffic was light, I clearly had right of way, and also had ample time to cross the junction? Was it a case of a driver whose shift was too long or who had had insufficient days of rest? Or was it an issue of the discretionary right turns leading drivers to make a quick turn when there is no on-coming traffic but forgetting that pedestrians too have the right of way?",4,301,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00301
2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"What exactly are the safeguards we have in place to prevent an accident like mine from recurring?

2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"I therefore reached out to the bus company to understand more about their safety procedures. The company was forthcoming. Two members of its senior management met with me and addressed all my queries. They were able to account for the bus captain's years of experience, driving schedule, daily working hours, break times and shift duration – all of which were well within mandated industry standards. They also shared with me their company’s proprietary telematics system that monitors every bus captain for every journey, tracking data such as their driving and turning speeds and instances of sudden braking. Such information helps the company determine how reckless or safety-conscious their drivers are. Using such data, bus captains are effectively graded for their driving performance and the information is conveyed to them via a mobile app so that they can regulate and modulate their own driving as necessary.",6,303,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00303
2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"After my accident, the bus captain was immediately suspended when the investigation established that he was at fault and that there were no issues with the bus. Following the suspension, he underwent a day of retraining where his driving was assessed by a supervisor, before he was deemed road worthy and returned to service. Incidentally, the telematics data revealed that he was consistently one of their safest drivers, which perhaps helps to explain why I am still here today!",7,304,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00304
2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"As a regular public transport commuter, I am reassured that this much attention is paid to safety.

2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"And yet, accidents do and will happen, and we should strive to further reduce their number. I therefore wish to delve more deeply into the issue of discretionary right turn lanes. I am heartened that LTA has concrete plans to discontinue most discretionary right turn junctions within the next five years. Indeed, when I mentioned my accident to friends and acquaintances, they immediately raised the problem of discretionary right turn junctions without my prompting. Colleagues and students who also use the junction where my accident occurred mentioned witnessing many near misses between cars and pedestrians, and cars and PMD riders.",9,306,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00306
2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Discretionary right turn junctions are fundamentally problematic. Drivers wait anxiously in the right turn box and make a dash for it when they note the absence of oncoming traffic, overlooking the fact that there could also be pedestrians crossing at the same time. In 2016, the hon Member Dr Chia Shi-Lu had inquired about accidents at right turn lanes and in his reply, Minister Khaw revealed that between 2011 and 2015, there were a total of 14 fatalities and 319 injuries involving pedestrians and cyclists being hit by right-turning vehicles at such junctions. I am not aware of the latest figures since that period but my accident surely was not the only one. In fact, in February this year, policewoman Mdm Salimah Mohamad was killed by a car turning right at such a junction in Shenton Way when the driver failed to keep a proper lookout.",10,307,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00307
2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Clearly, such junctions that allow cars and people to cross simultaneously present distinct hazards.

2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"LTA has introduced various safety enhancements to such junctions including traffic light timings that give pedestrians a head-start in crossing the road and Silver Zones where speed limits are lowered to cater to the large number of senior citizens in these areas.

2019-07-08-T-010,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"My accident left me with several important takeaways. The first is that we have a public transport system that prioritises and invests in safety, of which we can be justifiably proud. The second is that we should consider whether public buses can be equipped with superior sensors to better alert drivers to the presence of pedestrians and other vehicles so as to avoid collisions as far as possible. The third takeaway is that in our Smart Nation efforts, urban analytics can be strategically marshalled to more accurately track vehicular and human traffic at all junctions, so that we can optimise traffic light timings to allow drivers and pedestrians to share the road efficiently, but also safely. With such analytics, we can better design junctions to allow for smooth flowing traffic, without increased cost to human lives.",13,310,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00310

2019-07-08-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"(In Malay) [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  I have read the news report on a survey conducted by the Traffic Police recently that involved 1,000 road users. The results of this survey revealed that most car users thought positively of themselves when asked to rate their level of safety and graciousness on the roads. However, they felt that the level of safety and graciousness of other drivers were not that good. This is quite worrying because it reflects the mentality and attitude of drivers in Singapore. If all drivers only think of themselves, this will result in more hazards and accidents on the roads. I think that it is important for us to continue encouraging positive behaviour on the roads.",2,319,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00319
2019-07-08-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In addition, I have also read a report about the increase in feedback on irresponsible drivers. Although the number of accidents have declined between 2014 and 2018, the number of feedback received by the Traffic Police about irresponsible drivers have more than doubled, from 6,900 to 18,500. Between 2015 and 2018, the number of summons issued has increased from 152,700 to 181,000.",3,320,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00320

Serious accidents can cause injuries and death and we must do our best to avoid them. One way is by strengthening legislation to stop bad behaviour on the roads. Therefore, I welcome today’s Bill.

I read with interest the news report on the outcome of the survey conducted by the Traffic Police recently. The nationwide study which involved 1,000 respondents from various groups including car drivers, taxi drivers and the elderly revealed that most car users thought positively of themselves when asked to rate their level of safety and graciousness.

2019-07-08-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I find this both slightly amusing and worrying. Amusing as it is not unfamiliar. I drive and when I am on the road, there would be instances when I felt that the drivers are so inconsiderate especially when they do not give way to me. However, I am sure, there may be moments when others would have thought the same of me too. On a more serious and at a deeper level though, this finding reflects the mentality of Singaporean drivers and I feel that it is important to continue to nudge behaviours and develop a culture of safe and gracious driving.",6,323,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00323
2019-07-08-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I also note an earlier news reports sharing that the penalties for irresponsible driving in Singapore is less severe than in some other jurisdictions. Further, it was mentioned that although the number of traffic accidents has dropped, the feedback on irresponsible driving has gone up. The annual statistics from the Traffic Police showed that while there were fewer traffic accidents last year, the number of drink-driving accidents and motorists who ran red lights went up. The number of drink-driving accidents increased by 17.3% to 176 cases last year, from 150 in 2017. Motorcyclists who were drink-driving and got involved in accidents increased by 51.3% to 59 cases in 2018, from 39 cases in 2017.",7,324,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00324

2019-07-08-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Our traffic laws and rules are indeed one way to shape behaviours on the road and it may be time to further strengthen the penalties to target the egregious offences. I welcome the enhancements introduced in this Bill. I would like to, however, make some comments on the amendments.",10,327,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00327
2019-07-08-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Firstly, in respect of the amendment to section 35B of the Bill, I note that before revoking a person’s driving licence, the Deputy Commissioner of Police must give a notice to the driver and the notice period must be at least four weeks before the revocation date. The proposed amendment also sets out a framework for the submission of any representations or objections. I note from the proposed sections 35B (2) and (3) that the Deputy Commissioner of Police could proceed to revoke the licence on the proposed revocation date if the appeal is rejected.",11,328,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00328
2019-07-08-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),I would like to seek a clarification on whether the Deputy Commissioner is at liberty to give any further notice or time to the driver before the revocation. I ask because there may be some people who depend on driving for their livelihood. They may still remain hopeful after submitting representations and may need further time before the final implementation for the revocation. I note that there needs to be a balance between the need to quickly take errant drivers off the roads and to ensure fairness in the process. I would just like to seek clarification on whether the Deputy Commissioner of Police has the discretion to extend the notice period before revocation.,12,329,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00329
2019-07-08-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"My second point also relates to those who drive for a living. I suspect that because of the length of time they spend on the roads, because they may be subjected to the vagaries of passenger demands and road conditions or because they may have become over-confident as they are quite familiar with driving, they may statistically be more likely to commit more traffic offences. I wonder if we have done any analysis on the circumstances of the traffic offenders so that there could be a more targeted approach to address the issue. Because I believe that aside from creating deterrence and penalties, we really should look into the shaping the behaviour of drivers and understanding perhaps some of the challenges drivers face and address them. Perhaps there could also be efforts in rehabilitating bad behaviour very early on. I believe that the Driver Improvement & Points System or DIPS was one good way to encourage good behaviour. Could there perhaps be some enhancements to this programme to provide more specific support and motivation to these drivers?",13,330,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00330
2019-07-08-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"My third point is a general point related to the above. As noted earlier, alongside the enhancements of penalties, I believe there is a necessity to strengthen awareness and encourage safe driving. I am happy to hear that the Singapore Road Safety Council will be ramping up its efforts to raise awareness on safe and gracious behaviour on the roads. I think perhaps we could look at generating strong awareness of driving etiquette in specific situations. For example, I am not sure if many Singaporean drivers follow the “zipper rule”. According to the rule, when traffic merges, drivers merging from the left and right should alternately give way to one another so that traffic flows smoothly. I am sure a lot of things are taught before one gets a licence; however, the lived experience on the roads may be different. So, I hope that all parties and agencies will continue in the effort to create awareness and build better habits and culture on the roads in Singapore.",14,331,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00331

2019-07-08-T-010,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir. What must we do to make our roads safer? This Bill seeks to do so through covering more road offences and issuing harsher punishments. I feel emphasis should also be placed on three other areas. One, educating road users; two, improving road engineering; and three, having safer features in vehicles.",1,333,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00333
2019-07-08-T-010,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"On the first point on education. As mentioned by the hon Member before me, Ms Rahayu, we should do more to push out the message on the importance of being responsible road users. To this end, I hope the regulators can strengthen the role played by and properly resource the Singapore Road Safety Council. This will allow it to mount publicity programmes to educate the public and road users and do so sustainably.",2,334,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00334
2019-07-08-T-010,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Over the weekend, I attended a road safety event by the Council in the Orchard Road area. That is a good initiative and more can be done.

Perhaps also consider participating in the National Day post-parade event whereby we can get all the different road users to do a safety march with regard to sending the message about road safety.",3,335,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00335
2019-07-08-T-010,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"But going upstream then, what can we do? We should review the current driving course content to ensure new learners and drivers who are taking refresher courses appreciate the need for safer driving habits. I read that in some cities, it was even reported that serious road offenders are made to visit the hospital morgue to realise the severity of their actions. We can probably drive the home the same point on the importance of safe driving through either video replays or re-enactments in our training courses on how careless driving can result in serious accidents.",4,336,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00336

2019-07-08-T-010,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Commuters travelling in a taxi or private hire car can also do their part.

2019-07-08-T-010,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, I think we can also consider using data analytics whereby the regulators can work towards identifying vulnerable zones or roads with higher frequency of accidents. Today, accidents that do not involve injuries are sometimes not reported to the Traffic Police. So, I wonder how do such data of vulnerable roads or roads with more accidents are being collated to understand whether or not such interventions such as road designs or re-engineering can slow down vehicles and minimise accident rates.",11,343,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00343
2019-07-08-T-010,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),The third suggestion I have is equipment. That entails having more safety features in our vehicles. Some new vehicles today are fitted with safety devices such as auto-brake functions that automatically slow down the vehicle if they sense a pedestrian or car in the path of travel; or adaptive cruise control which automatically adjusts the vehicle speed to maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead. Some owners install radar sensors or cameras to help them gauge and monitor the safety distance between vehicles. Others rely on reverse sensors which alert the driver when the car is about to hit an object. Such devices serve as safety features that help drivers to navigate in a safer manner.,12,344,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00344
2019-07-08-T-010,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"We should also leverage on telematics to reinforce good driving habits. I recently spoke to the third party private hire app called Grab. They send day-to-day weekly driving reports to their drivers to nudge them towards safer driving. To increase the level of road safety and adoption, can the Traffic Police or LTA work together with vehicle fleet owners to consider perhaps things like rebates when a vehicle owner installs safety-enabling technologies in their vehicles?",13,345,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00345

Singapore’s fatality rate was 2.51 in 2016 and has since improved to 2.20 in 2018.

The vast majority of these offences will have been dealt with by composition offer, or fine penalty. Fines are an important part of our road traffic safety system. As part of the same review that led to this Bill's amendments to the Road Traffic Act, traffic offence fines were recently revised in April 2019. This was the first review in nearly 20 years. Unsurprisingly, because incomes have gone up since then, fines were raised across the board, with the steepest increases for the most severe offences.",4,352,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00352
2019-07-08-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I wish to discuss two issues. First, can we design an optimal traffic fine schedule, based on evidence and economic principles; and second, can we improve equity and efficiency by implementing fines that step up, linked to the income or wealth of the offender?",5,353,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00353
2019-07-08-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The economic principle for fine setting, as laid out in 1974 by the Nobel prize winning economist Gary Becker, is that the expected fine – the penalty adjusted by the the probability of being caught – should equal the social costs caused by the offence. The reason is that many crimes are actions which have private benefits but which produce external social costs.",6,354,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00354
2019-07-08-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Consider speeding on the roads. We speed because we enjoy a private benefit from getting to the destination faster, or because we enjoy driving faster. But because we are speeding, we impose an external social cost on others from the increased accident risk. There is also the risk of injury to the speeding driver, but that is a private cost. The optimal fine makes the potential speeder realise that if they speed, they must pay the external social costs of doing so, which then deters them from speeding.",7,355,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00355
2019-07-08-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Applying this principle of aligning fines to the marginal social costs is quite difficult in practice. We know that speeding is dangerous, but I do not think any country has attempted to seriously quantify the cost of speeding and link these costs to fines. One complication is that the relationship between speed and the risk of injury and death is non-linear and it increases sharply with speed. In the report I referenced earlier, the World Health Organization states that, in principle, a 1% increase in mean speed produces a 4% increase in the fatal crash risk, and a 3% increase in a serious crash risk. This means that optimal fines should increase significantly as the rate of excess speed increases.",8,356,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00356
2019-07-08-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Do we reflect this principle in our fine schedule for speeding? Exceeding the road speed limit by 31 km/h to 40 km/h carries double the fine and demerit points at $300 and eight demerit points, than exceeding the speed limit by 1 km/h to 20 km/h does, at $150 and four demerit points. An evidence-based optimal fine setting policy would examine whether the harm caused by speeding 31 km/h to 40 km/h above the limit is, in fact, larger than double that of speeding only 1 km/h to 20 km/h. The fines and demerit points should be revised upwards according to the actual risks. It would be useful if the Ministry could publish the results of any studies conducted that would show the evidence basis for our recent revisions to the fine schedule.",9,357,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00357
2019-07-08-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"A second issue with setting optimal fines is that motorists differ greatly in their income and wealth. However, fines are generally equal when different motorists commit the same offence, which creates a problem. A fine that is large enough to be meaningful and appropriate to punish the average motorist may be too large for lower income motorists and too small for the richest motorists. This is an obvious limitation to optimal fines in practice. Fines do not work if they are so large that people cannot pay and fines also do not work if they are not meaningful deterrents.",10,358,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00358
2019-07-08-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Elected Members know that many appeals at Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) are for traffic and parking offences. In most cases, the resident admits to committing the offence, but they appeal for leniency because the fines will cause them financial hardship. This creates a challenge when we want to increase fines to appropriately deter unsafe driving. Sir, our vocational drivers – our taxi drivers, private hire drivers, delivery drivers and so on – they are generally low- to middle income earners. While all motorists should drive safely, we must be mindful that a significant penalty for the average private car driver is actually an immense sum for the vocational driver.",11,359,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00359

2019-07-08-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Overall, red light violations in Israel fell by 30% after the fine was increased. But what is interesting is who was affected more. Young drivers, those aged under 30, were more than twice as likely as older drivers to reduce offending, although young drivers offend more to begin with. And, drivers with newer cars were both more likely to run red lights and they were less responsive to the fine increase. I interpret these results as supportive of the theory that fines do deter unsafe driving, and moreover, the deterrent effect of fines depends on the income or wealth of the offender. Richer offenders simply feel the pinch of a fine less.",14,362,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00362
2019-07-08-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"One way of ensuring that fines have the appropriate deterrent effect, while keeping the financial impact on vocational drivers in mind, is to calibrate fines based on the income or wealth of the offending motorist. In 2015, the New York Times reported that a businessman in Finland received a fine of 54,024 Euros for exceeding the speed limit by traveling 64 miles per hour in a 50 mile per hour zone. Not all speeders in Finland pay so much. A more typical motorist would have paid only 345 Euros for the same offence. The reason why the unfortunate businessman paid so much is that he was one of Finland's highest income earners.",15,363,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00363

A similar day-fine system is in use in a number of countries, mostly Scandinavian. The legal history is that a fine represents a payment in lieu of jail, and being locked up is more costly for a high-income offender, because the lost income is larger. So, the fine paid ""per day"" of jail should be scaled to income. The Finnish businessman's speeding offence was rated at eight days' worth of fines, and given his high income, this worked out to 54,024 Euros.",16,364,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00364

2019-07-08-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"One practical way of doing so might be to scale the traffic fine based on the offending vehicle's Open Market Value, for privately-owned passenger cars. These form most vehicles on the road, and differences in the income of drivers of private cars can be very large in Singapore. I think it is reasonable to presume that the driver of a large luxury car is able to pay more than one driving a cheaper vehicle, and they would likely regard the demerit points and other consequences of an offence as far more serious than the fine itself. In fact, insofar as many luxury cars are marketed as safer than less well-equipped cars, there is even more reason to increase the optimal fine as a deterrent, since the perceived risk of injury to the driver themselves will be lower and luxury car drivers may be more inclined to speed.",18,366,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00366

We should examine the evidence basis behind the social cost of unsafe driving and design fines, particularly for higher speeds, to reflect the actual risks more appropriately. We can also improve equity and efficiency by calibrating fines according to the income or wealth of the offending motorist. As road traffic safety is an evolving problem, I hope the Government will study these issues when planning the next revision of the Road Traffic Act.

2019-07-08-T-010,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I support the aim behind the Bill which is to deter irresponsible driving that may lead to harming of innocent lives and damage to property. I applaud the Ministry for obtaining feedback from public before presenting this Bill for consideration in Parliament. In particular, in this Bill, I support the calibration of punishment depending on the harm caused by the motorist in driving his vehicle dangerously or carelessly. Indeed, I note that the Supreme Court, in several recent decisions dealing with sentencing of motorists who are convicted for offences such as drink-driving, dangerous driving and careless driving, already apply an analytical framework which requires a consideration of the harm caused by the motorist as well as his culpability.",2,396,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00396
2019-07-08-T-010,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I have a query on the proposal to provide for enhanced punishment for a ""serious offender"" who commits the offence of dangerous driving or careless driving. ""Serious Offender"" is defined in the Amendment Bill as a person convicted for drink-driving or, alternatively convicted for refusing to give his breath sample. Under the proposed sections 64 and 65, if the same person is convicted for dangerous driving or careless driving, he is subject to an extra punishment which is in addition to the punishment for dangerous driving. So, for example, under the proposed section 64(2)(b), if hurt is caused, where a offender is a serious offender, he is to be punished with a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than 12 months or to both in addition to the punishment for dangerous driving charge.",3,397,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00397
2019-07-08-T-010,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"On the face of it, there is a possibility that the serious offender may be punished twice. This is because, as mentioned before, in the current sentencing framework, the harm and culpability of a drink-driver would be taken into consideration in relation to a sentence imposed on a drink-driver under section 67. Sir, I do appreciate that this scenario would only be triggered if a person faces two charges  that of drink- driving as well as that of dangerous driving. But we cannot have one analytical framework for sentencing in relation to drink-driving if a person is charged singly as opposed to another situation if he is charged for drink-driving as well as dangerous driving. So, I would welcome a clarification from the hon Minister as to what is the Ministry's expectation in relation to sentencing under the proposed sections 64 and 65.",4,398,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00398
2019-07-08-T-010,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The next query I have is in relation to the applicability of community sentencing options. I have previously spoken about the desirability to widen sentencing options during an Adjournment Motion in this House on 11 September 2017. I pointed out that then, for drink-driving cases, the person on conviction would not be liable for community sentencing but a motorist who was convicted for causing death by a negligent act under the Penal Code was imposed a community sentence of a short detention order. This was because the sentence for drink-driving offence under the Road Traffic Act was fixed in law with a minimum mandatory sentence of a fine.",5,399,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00399
2019-07-08-T-010,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In my respectful view, for traffic cases involving people behaving negligently or not realising that they exceeded the alcohol limit but who have caused low to medium levels of harm to life and property, community sentences may be a good option for them in terms of addressing the sentencing principles of deterrence as well as just deserts. Subsequently, in March 2018, this House passed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code to expand the list of offences for which community sentences may be imposed.",6,400,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00400
2019-07-08-T-010,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Under the amended section 337(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, a Court may impose a community work order even if the offender is convicted of an offence for which a mandatory minimum sentence of a fine is prescribed by law. One example is the offence of drink-driving. I would welcome the hon Minister’s confirmation that this comports with the policy intent behind this Amendment Bill.",7,401,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00401
2019-07-08-T-010,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I may be wrong but one community sentencing option which does not appear to be open for offenders under the Road Traffic Act in relation to offences under proposed sections 64 and 65 is the short detention order. If a person is imposed with a short detention order, unlike an imprisonment, his conviction would not constitute as a registrable crime under the Registration of Criminals Act. I would have thought that particularly for lower level culpability acts leading to medium level harm, a short detention order should be considered as a suitable punishment so that the accused would not be delivered with a disproportionate crushing blow vis-a-vis his prospects in the future. I wonder why this option is not provided for in this Bill.",8,402,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00402
2019-07-08-T-010,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The next point I wish to make relates to the fact that the sentencing provision in section 69 of the Road Traffic Act, which deals with administration of preliminary breath tests, is being retained in its current form even though the sentencing provisions for section 67 are proposed to be enhanced. Currently, there is a parity of sentence under section 67(1), which deals with drink-driving and under section 69(4) of the Road Traffic Act, which deals with refusing to give a breath specimen for a preliminary breath test. In both situations, a first timer would be liable to a conviction to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. A repeat offender would similarly be liable for a fine of not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.",9,403,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00403

2019-07-08-T-010,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I do appreciate that if a person does not provide a breath sample for a preliminary breath test, he may be arrested nonetheless and be required to submit a breath sample for the prescribed breathalyser test at the police station. If he again refuses to provide the breath sample, he will be presumed to have committed the offence of drink-driving and charged separately for that offence. However, given that there is currently an existing parity between the sentences provided for both provisions and the aim of this Bill is to deter motorists from irresponsible behaviour, I wonder what is the policy reason for not similarly proposing to amend the punishment for section 69(4) of the Road Traffic Act.",11,405,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00405

2019-07-08-T-010,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The prescribed breathalyser test was introduced in 1996. It was contemplated then that the test has to be administered in the police station. The motorist has to be transported to the police station for this. Now, there are police-grade mobile prescribed breathalyser machines readily available which provide very accurate readings and can be administered at the roadside. There is also a potential for removing the need to administer preliminary breath test. What we will then get is a reading of the alcohol level of the motorist at an earlier time which probably will be a better gauge of what his alcohol level was at the time he was driving or was in charge of his vehicle. I also note that in France, drink-drivers, especially repeat offenders, would be required to fit their cars with vehicle ignition breathalysers or ignition interlock which require them to take a test before they can start their car. They will also be required to blow on a second occasion at a random time to limit the chances of others blowing into the breathalyser for them. I would be grateful for an update from the hon Minister on this front.",13,407,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00407

I have spoken on this topic in this House recently. I appreciate that these amendments are being introduced by the Minister of Home Affairs and the focus is therefore on driver conduct.

It could consider measures taken overseas. For example, in the US, it is compulsory to install rear view cameras. There are also discussions in several countries about making the installation of dash cams compulsory too. Dash cams can be a deterrent against irresponsible driving too. The hon Minister mentioned about video footage being referred to the Police for investigation. They are also are a good source of evidence for investigation into Road Traffic Act offences. Some dash cams have anti-collision sensors and could have made a difference, for example, in relation to the accident that the hon Nominated Member of Parliament Prof Lim Sun Sun was involved in.

Currently, the proposed measures in the Bill only targets the driver. I propose that those who knowingly assist incidents of drink-driving, such as handing a drunk person the keys to the car, should also be made culpable of aiding and abetting drink-driving under the law.

Two high profile accidents in 2018, one along Clementi Road and another at the junction of Jalan Anak Bukit and Jalan Jurong Kechil, which saw two separate fatalities, bring to mind the danger of discretionary right turns. In both cases, the drivers appeared to have had an error of judgement in making the right turn. Earlier, we have also heard similar cases by Members Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Prof Lim Sun Sun. So, while I am encouraged that there are plans to install more non-discretionary right-turn arrows, I would like for us to go one step further and convert all right-turn arrows into non-discretionary. This would certainly go a long way in making our roads a safer place.",5,437,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00437
2019-07-08-T-010,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Second, we should include countdown timers at all traffic junctions. This is not my first time raising this and I note that LTA, in their reply, said that they had conducted a small-scale pilot at the junction of North Bridge Road and Rochor Road over a period of six months in 2003. In that pilot, LTA found that there were no significant improvements to road safety. But many countries have since implemented such countdown timers as they view that it improves road safety. In 2017, a study published by the Oregon State University had also found that such countdown timers lead to safer responses from drivers as it reduces mistakes made in what is called the ""dilemma zone"", which is the area in which a driver is not sure whether to stop or keep going when the light turns yellow. We need to revisit the conclusion of the pilot trial that LTA had conducted over 15 years ago. I believe that the experiences of other countries are sound and there is potential for such countdown timers to further reduce traffic accidents, given the increase in red-light running violations. I hope that the Traffic Police and LTA can conduct a new trial of traffic countdown timers. Perhaps, the agencies can consider Orchard Road, which is within my constituency, which has many traffic junctions – at least eight – and which has significantly heavy traffic flow, for this new trial.",6,438,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00438
2019-07-08-T-010,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, statistics have also shown that cyclists, motorcyclists and their pillion riders are most at risk of injury and fatality in the event of a traffic accident. We need to do more education to teach both cyclists and motorcyclists on the importance of defensive riding, as they are our most vulnerable group of road-users. It is not unusual to see motorcyclists riding in between lanes, especially during peak-hour traffic. Some would even manoeuvre at a fast speed zig-zagging across lanes and in between vehicles. This put them at risk of being side-swept by vehicles if they are in a blind spot. More needs to be done to educate our motorcyclists on the danger of riding between lanes. Correspondingly, we need to educate other drivers on the importance of checking their blind spots constantly before making a turn or making a lane change.",7,439,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00439
2019-07-08-T-010,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Next, I would like to make another pitch again to disallow cyclists from plying our bus lanes during operating hours. Many cyclists do not cycle in a single file and, even if some do, the bus lanes are simply not wide enough to provide a safety distance between the bus and the cyclist. Many bus drivers that I have spoken to, tell me that it is very difficult to manoeuvre the big bus past a cyclist, more so if it is a group of cyclists. It is obvious that it is practically not possible to keep the bus within the bus lane and get past the cyclists. Let us, therefore, separate the big bus from the small bicycle before we end up with another tragic accident.",8,440,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00440

However, we can only accomplish so much just by raising penalties. We need to go beyond our business-as-usual mentality and relook at some of our previously held assumptions and conclusions regarding road safety. I hope the agencies would consider my suggestions which I believe would serve to further make our roads safer. With that, I support the Bill.",9,441,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00441

This is not unique to Singapore but certainly more challenging for us, given our high density urban environment of 7,804 people per sq km. These challenges will only exacerbate, with one in four Singaporeans to be aged 65 and above by 2030.

PMDs have grown in usage and already play an important role in the lives of people who depend on them for various forms of participation in society, especially by the elderly and differently-abled. As 76-year-old retiree, Madam Angie Ng shared, the most life-changing decision was getting a motorised scooter which allows her to go out marketing, visit friends and have a meal — tasks previously virtually impossible because of her osteoporosis which made it extremely painful for her to walk.

2019-07-08-T-010,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"It is clear the rapid proliferation of specific PMDs amplifies the need to develop a culture of safely sharing limited spaces between users going at different speeds. Previously, unregulated PMDs led to persistently high accident rates, with 2,500 active mobility offences recorded between May and December 2018 alone. On 28 May, a news article noted that HDB void deck areas were exempted from the Active Mobility Act and Town Councils can impose their own rules. Fifteen Town Councils then said that they would not rule out banning PMDs from void decks. This is despite recent regulatory reductions of the speed limit of PMDs on footpaths from 15 to 10 km/h.",5,446,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00446

The physical and psychological benefits which PMDs bring cannot be underestimated. An outright ban on PMDs on footpaths or void decks may be a convenient but also a blunt solution. A more effective and calibrated approach would be to institute a different extent of regulation for different PMD user-groups as well as, perhaps more importantly, cultivating a path-sharing and safe riding culture.",6,447,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00447
2019-07-08-T-010,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, we also cannot have a conversation on road rights and sharing limited spaces without talking about Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). AVs have opened up new possibilities to meet mobility needs. And to the vulnerable segments of our population, especially the elderly, AV deployment can both be a cause for celebration and a concern. With one in four of our population being 65 and above by 2030, many who have always enjoyed the freedom of mobility are now and will be less able to. AVs can cover the short distances to visit grandchildren who live close-by without having to navigate stairs, walkways without handrails, or traffic junctions. AVs feature in our near-term future mobility plans as dynamically routed services to be piloted in Punggol, Tengah and the Jurong Innovation District by 2022, a mere three years away. LTA's vision for a car-lite Singapore includes low-speed self-driving pods for neighbourhoods.

We must, therefore, ensure that we balance the design and deployment of AVs with safety and mobility. Whether or not AVs bring about higher accessibility for the elderly will clearly depend on whether we have designed the vehicles, network and system to their needs and challenges. Reviewing the current use cases and testing compiled by Smart Nation SG, I have to humbly suggest that we may have to do more for our growing numbers of seniors.",8,449,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00449

2019-07-08-T-010,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"First, as pedestrians, the elderly are more likely to be at risk with AVs. Pedestrian safety studies emphasise the driver-pedestrian interaction and provisions of cues for decision-making. In the absence of a driver, the elderly pedestrian can only rely on cues from the vehicles. The elderly have slower reaction times and could require both enhanced visual and audio cues to be aware of on-coming traffic. Given our rapidly ageing population, AVs should be designed and tested with consideration to these safety needs. This could include braking reaction time, as well as exterior vehicle design and vehicle sound levels.",10,451,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00451

However, familiarity with the technology, awareness of benefits and user-centric design are all critical aspects to acceptance of this technology. Testing has so far been at One-North, University campuses as well as Gardens By the Bay. These are not areas where the elderly population frequent, limiting their awareness of this technology and its benefits. As always, it is better to ""show them, not tell them"". Providing opportunities for the elderly to experience the technology is important. Entities involved in testing could be required to explore locations and methods to ensure the elderly are part of the testing population in future trials.",11,452,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00452
2019-07-08-T-010,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"While supportive of AV deployment, I cannot help but come back to the complexity around road rights. For example, should a slower-moving AV providing point-to-point service be afforded preferential road rights to other motorised vehicles? Should there be dedicated road space? Do we carve out more space from sidewalks or from motorised roadways for new pickup points? How should we make these choices? These are difficult but important questions for our society and policymakers to grapple with. Perhaps, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pre-empting the new Point-to-Point Passenger Transport Industry Bill that has just been tabled for First Reading today but I think it is safe to say that we must learn from what we have experienced with the PMDs by involving the elderly and vulnerable populations early on with AVs.",12,453,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00453

On the streamlined licence suspension and revocation process, Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked whether the Deputy Commissioner of Police, or DCP, may have the discretion to extend the notice period before suspension and revocation. The DCP can extend the notice period for suspension, but only for the suspended motorist to attend the DIPS Retraining Course. This is because, in this case, the motorist is taking steps to address his errant behaviour. Thus, where a licensee has indicated to Traffic Police that he intends to take the DIPS Retraining course and the course date is later than the date when the suspension is supposed to take effect, he will have the effective date of the suspension pushed back. This is so that the licensee may complete the course and have the suspension period reduced. It bears remembering that for a motorist to be facing suspension and revocation, he would have committed several offences before and he would have had opportunities previously to appeal against those offences.

Most recently, the Traffic Police worked with LTA to reduce the speed limits at two Silver Zones from 40 km/h to 30 km/h.",14,483,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00483

Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Prof Lim Sun Sun, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Murali Pillai suggested to leverage on new technologies, such as urban analytics, ignition-interlock devices and speed limiters. Mr Christopher de Souza suggested providing support for victims of drink-driving accidents. Prof Lim Sun Sun and Ms Joan Pereira also suggested to expedite the installation of Red-Amber-Green arrows at all right-turning junctions. Dr Chia Shi-Lu suggested to restrict offenders’ access to vehicles. Mr Melvin Yong suggested for LTA to consider the installation of countdown timers and to disallow cyclists from bus lanes.

2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun Xueling has addressed some of the Members’ questions and suggestions. I will deal with those regarding the enhanced criminal penalties and then emerging road traffic issues.,2,488,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00488
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, the definition of Dangerous and Careless Driving. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah raised two examples – accidents caused by drivers who had insufficient rest; and accidents caused when there is a mechanical failure of a vehicle, which Mr Murali also asked about. How will we deal with them?",3,489,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00489
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"On driving while sleep-deprived, the Courts have ruled that doing so can be considered as an aggravating factor in sentencing. In general, driving when one is not in a condition to do so is more likely to be considered as dangerous rather than careless. Having said that, other factors, such as the manner of driving, will also be taken into account. AGC will consider the facts of each case when determining the appropriate offence.",4,490,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00490
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"On Er Dr Lee’s second example of mechanical failure of a vehicle, this will not be classified as dangerous nor careless driving offence, as the mechanical fault is not linked to the manner of driving. However, failure to maintain one’s vehicle is already an offence under the Road Traffic Act. In addition, under the Workplace Safety and Health Act, employers have a duty to ensure the safety and health of their employees at work. This includes proper maintenance of vehicles. Failure to do so will also be an offence.",5,491,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00491
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Second, the penalties for specific offences. Mr Christopher de Souza shared his concerns that the increased penalties for Driving without Licence and Permitting or Employing Another Person to Drive without Licence may be too harsh on individuals who may have unknowingly driven a vehicle without a licence. For example, a person may not be aware of the need to certify his fitness to drive and renew his licence when he turns 65. We understand the concern. The Police and the Public Prosecutor will look into the specifics of each case to decide the appropriate charge.",6,492,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00492
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Another question Mr de Souza raised had to do with the treatment for motorists when the victim also violated traffic rules and contributed to the accident. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about accidents caused by jaywalkers.,7,493,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00493
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Deputy Speaker, when assessing whether a motorist should bear liability for an accident, Traffic Police's key consideration is whether the motorist was driving safely. If the motorist had abided by the traffic rules, for example, keeping within speed limits and checking clear before making turns or changing lanes and yet still knock into the victim, for example, a PMD rider or jaywalker, because the latter had appeared suddenly on the road and left him with insufficient time to react, the motorist will not be liable for an irresponsible driving offence. That part is clear.",8,494,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00494
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Conversely, if the motorist was not driving safely, for instance, he spotted a pedestrian jaywalking but decided to speed up in a bid to drive past the pedestrian before the pedestrian can reach the lane his vehicle was on and hit the victim as a result, he will be prosecuted. But, of course, the jaywalker may also be taken to task. So, I hope this part is clear.",9,495,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00495
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Murali Pillai asked about Driving Under Influence offences. He asked about the additional penalties for Dangerous and Careless Driving offences, for motorists who had done so while under the influence of alcohol or drugs and whether this would mean that a person is punished twice for the same act. There is no double penalty. Consider two actions. The first, a motorist was driving under influence. The second, a motorist was driving dangerously or carelessly. A motorist committing the first action, driving under influence, will be liable for penalties even if he was not driving dangerously or carelessly. If he was also committing the second action, that is driving dangerously or carelessly, he would be liable for penalties under Dangerous or Careless Driving instead of Driving Under Influence per se. However, the offence of driving dangerously or carelessly while under influence carries higher penalties.",10,496,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00496
2019-07-08-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Murali asked if the penalties for failing to provide a specimen for a preliminary breath test should be increased. As the proposed penalties are lower than that for the offence of Driving Under Influence, he worries that this may create an incentive for a motorist not to provide the specimen. There is no such incentive. At present, the Traffic Police subject motorists to two tests for suspected Driving Under Influence offences  first, a preliminary breath test to check if the breath alcohol content is beyond the legal limit; and, second, a test to measure the exact alcohol content of the motorist. A motorist who refuses to take the preliminary breath test will be arrested by the Traffic Police and required to take the second test. If the motorist also refuses to take the second test, he will be liable for the offences of  failure to provide specimen for the preliminary breath test; and failure to provide a specimen for the second test, which has an equivalent penalty to the offence of Driving Under Influence. I would also like to assure Mr Murali that the Traffic Police are now able to conduct the second test on the spot with the mobile Breath Evidential Analyser.",11,497,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00497

2019-07-08-T-010,,,"The offences mentioned are not mutually exclusive. It is possible for a motorist to be charged for both the offence of Dangerous or Careless Driving and the offence of Illegal Speed Trial. Motorists who drive in a dangerous or careless manner will be liable for the offence of Dangerous or Careless Driving whether or not they are involved in an illegal speed trial. Motorists who partake in illegal street racing will be liable for the offence of Illegal Speed Trial, even if they were not driving dangerously or carelessly.",2,500,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00500
2019-07-08-T-010,,,"Mr Murali Pillai asked if community sentencing options, such as Community Work Orders, apply to the RTA. Community Work Orders are meant for reparation and restoration and are only limited to a prescribed list of offences. RTA offences are not in the list. However, we do have rehabilitative measures, before an accident even occurs, to help encourage safe driving behaviours by motorists. For example, motorists who have clocked a number of demerit points may choose to attend the Safe Driving Course, which helps them learn and practise safe driving habits.",3,501,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00501
2019-07-08-T-010,,,"Mr Murali had also asked if short detention orders can apply to RTA offences. The answer is yes, if the offence and offender meet the requirements set out under the Criminal Procedure Code, such as not having a specified or mandatory minimum imprisonment. One example is the offence of Careless Driving as well as first-time Driving Under Influence offenders.",4,502,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00502

2019-07-08-T-010,,,"Mr Louis Ng highlighted that some individuals could have compounded an offence without intending to admit guilt. He asked if composition offences in the RTA amount to an acquittal. A person who is charged in Court and appeals may be offered composition. In such instances, once the charge is withdrawn via a discharge amounting to an acquittal, the composition amounts to an acquittal.",6,504,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00504
2019-07-08-T-010,,,"In any case, this will only apply within the RTA. As Mr Ng mentioned in his speech, this is in line with the decisions made by the High Court that compounded offences in the RTA may be taken into account for sentencing.",1,505,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00505

2019-07-08-T-010,,,"Mr Deputy Speaker, let me deal briefly with emerging road traffic issues, such as the use of active mobility devices and autonomous vehicles, or AVs. These emerging issues are increasingly complex. To chart the way forward, several Ministries and stakeholders must work together to tackle the issues from different angles.",3,507,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00507
2019-07-08-T-010,,,"Mr Christopher de Souza, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Anthea Ong spoke on the need to ensure riders behave responsibly. We fully agree. MHA and Traffic Police work closely with MOT and LTA to dovetail our road safety and active mobility policies. We already regulate the use of active mobility devices through a comprehensive set of measures. At this stage of development, the measures cannot be static. However, as Ms Anthea Ong reminds us, an outright ban may be too blunt an act to take because the elderly and the differently abled have benefited from the use of active mobility devices and so, therefore, it is probably better that the measures be continually updated and improved upon.",4,508,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00508

2019-07-08-T-010,,,"On the roads, there have been rules on the use of active mobility devices such as bicycles. In February this year, the Government introduced new rules including the mandatory use of helmets by cyclists on roads. Now, active mobility users at pedestrian crossings must also ""stop and look"" before crossing. In April 2019, MHA and Traffic Police increased the composition sums for cyclist offences on the roads. We have also ramped up public education to raise awareness among active mobility users. Examples of such measures include Traffic Police’s ""Use Your RoadSense"" campaign and LTA’s ""Safer Together"" campaign. These efforts will have to continue.",6,510,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00510
2019-07-08-T-010,,,"Ms Anthea Ong spoke on the need to ensure that AVs are deployed safely. Indeed, self-driving technology has the potential to radically transform our transport system and improve our living environment. But we must ensure technology implementation does not endanger human lives. MHA and Traffic Police are working closely with MOT to ensure that the AV testing regime is rigorous and the deployment of AVs is done in a cautious and safe manner, taking into account the impact on other road users including the elderly and differently abled. Likewise, we will continue to evaluate different technologies as they are made available. In fact, like AVs, these different technologies are probably on trial already one way or the other. So, let me reassure Members if the technologies improve road safety and are feasible to implement, we will find ways to promote their adoption.",7,511,2019-07-08-T-010-S-00511

Also, the National Arts Council – Arts Education Programme provides all students with access to quality arts education experiences.",9,549,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00549
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"In terms of Co-curriculum Activities, students can choose the Arts CCAs, where they have opportunities to take part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Presentation as well as the annual SYF Celebrations. In 2012, the SYF Central Judging was rebranded as a SYF Arts Presentation. The award structure revamp was put in place by the MOE to emphasise enjoyment of the arts rather than the pursuit of awards. This has provided access and opportunity, increasing the participation rates in performing arts.",10,550,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00550
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"For students who are more talented and seek deeper engagement in arts, there is the Artist-In-School Scheme. This scheme supports sustained partnerships between Singapore Arts Professionals, such as musicians, dancers, and writers to co-develop customised arts experiences that deepen students’ engagement in and through the arts.",11,551,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00551
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"The arts can play a significant role in culture-building, community life and city planning. As society becomes more diverse, the arts can help deepen understanding and bridge differences across communities. I believe that artistic excellence and creating access and opportunities to arts for the masses are two different tracks.",12,552,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00552
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"Therefore, I have three recommendations. One, explore the possibilities of transforming our arts academies into a full-fledged Arts University. The arts must energise and excite Singaporeans, bring people together and reflect what Singapore represents to a global community. In Our SG Arts Plan, one of our key strategic thrusts was “Singaporeans are empowered to create, present and appreciate excellent art”. But where will our creators of excellent art come from? In pursuit of access and opportunities to arts, we should not forget we ought to reach the pinnacle of excellence.",13,553,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00553
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"In order to groom our own local pool of artists and talents, we ought to have reputable arts institutions. We already have the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music at NUS, founded in 2003; the arts institutions – LASALLE College of the Arts, founded in 1986; Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, established in 1938, and School of the Arts (SOTA), founded in 2008. These are already reputable institutions; however, more can be achieved.",14,554,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00554
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"For instance, as the first pre-tertiary arts school in Singapore, SOTA’s programme allows students to take one arts subject, in addition to the usual academic subjects taught in mainstream schools. At the end of their six-year programme, students graduate with an IB diploma. However, it was reported in May 2017 that only three in 10 SOTA graduating students went on to pursue arts-related university courses. An article then raised questions about the effectiveness of SOTA’s programmes in preparing students for a career in the arts.",15,555,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00555
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"As an aspiring Arts Nation, I believe that we should have our own Arts University. By transforming or upgrading our art academies, this will draw local and overseas talents into enrolling into these institutions. At present, we do partner prestigious universities overseas, send our students overseas on exchange programmes to broaden their horizon. All these are important. Competitive benchmarking is ambitious and it will help one to grow and learn more about their competitors. We have to nurture local talents. Thus, these efforts will help create vibrancy in the arts scene, heighten motivation amongst the arts practitioners and in the process, and spark off friendly contests to achieve excellence. I urge the Government to explore the possibilities of transforming our arts academies like NAFA and LASALLE into a full-fledged Arts University.",16,556,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00556
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"Two, establish a robust ecosystem to develop top notch artists. Singaporeans can be proud of our artists and arts groups winning international awards and being featured at leading arts venues and festivals around the world. I believe that there is a need to redefine our arts ecosystem, so as to for a greater platform for professional artistes, artistic director and arts manager.",17,557,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00557
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"We do have many top notch artists, Cultural Medallion and Young Artist Award recipients. NAFA has nurtured 13 recipients of the Cultural Medallion. Another 14 of their alumni have been presented the Young Artist Award. Also, many of their alumni have gone on to make their mark in the professional arts scene in Singapore and abroad. LASALLE, too, has her fair share of Cultural Medallions.",18,558,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00558
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"Perhaps we could recognise our cultural medallions more during National Arts events, and work closely with the different National Arts Flagship Companies, to groom and identify younger talents, then pass on the knowledge from one generation to the next.",19,559,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00559
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"Many of them started their music journey since young. They were nurtured by dedicated teachers and supportive parents. We will need to establish a robust ecosystem to develop top notch artists and management, who are equipped with strategic and critical thinking, to groom and nurture the next generation of artists. In achieving excellence, clear career pathways, programmes and platforms need to be in place, also leading them to join national arts flagship companies. This eco-system needs to be sustained.",20,560,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00560
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"Lastly, young Singaporeans in the arts scenes and future international award winners. In fact, we do already have young talented individuals in the arts scenes. Wong Kah Chun was the first Asian to win the prestigious international Gustav Mahler Conducting Competition for in 2016.Violinist Kam Ning has gone on to perform all over the world both as soloist and chamber musician. She was the Second Prizewinner at the Queen Elizabeth Competition in 2001. Eleven-year-old Chloe Chua is the junior champion of the Menuhin International Violin Competition in 2018. Fifteen-year-old Chen XinYu was admitted into the NAFA School of Young Talents at the age of six.

2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"All these are our young Singaporeans, and we should continue to track their performances in the local and international arts scenes. These young budding talents are the future of our arts scenes, and we will need more of them. What does the future hold for international arts winners in Singapore? To cultivate full-time artists and retain them, we need to have a clear career pathway, leading them into a national arts flagship company, after graduation. We will need the Government; such as MOE, MCCY, NAC, the Universities and colleges, and art groups to strengthen their core and emphasis on the importance of outstanding artistic development.",22,562,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00562
2019-07-08-T-012,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member),"The arts scene in Singapore is evolving. Not only seeking more Singaporeans to engage and participate in arts, I urge the Government to rethink and re-offer, at the national level about how Singapore can achieve arts excellence and fly our Singapore flags high in the international scenes. Not only do we need artistes, we need to have qualified teachers, managers and directors, to keep the arts scenes vibrant and to foster the sustainability of the arts sector.",23,563,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00563

2019-07-08-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","First, I agree with Mr Ho on the importance of providing opportunities for our children to experience the arts. Exposure to the arts at a young age can nurture creative thinking and help our children develop empathy and confidence. In addition to the initiatives already highlighted by Mr Ho, NAC has worked to enable quality arts experiences during different life stages from pre-school to tertiary education. To give one example, The Artground at Goodman Arts Centre is an incubator space that offers arts programmes for children as young as a few months old, such as the recent programme called “Baby Space” held in April. NAC has also collaborated with partners like the Early Childhood Development Agency and NTUC My First Skool to bring our artists to pre-schools to enrich their first encounters with the arts.",4,569,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00569
2019-07-08-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","Mr Ho asked about the diverse pathways beyond arts practice that have been taken by students from the School of the Arts (SOTA) after graduation. Our objective in establishing SOTA more than 10 years ago as a premier arts school to nurture leaders in all fields remains relevant today. SOTA was set up to provide a learning environment where both the artistic and academic potential of our students can be realised, and where a culture of experimentation and expression allows them to discover their passions and their strengths. SOTA has attracted some of our best and brightest students who are capable of succeeding in many fields of study and of gaining entry to some of the top academic institutions in the world. A SOTA education develops the skills and confidence for students to follow the pathways they wish to pursue in life. SOTA’s success is not defined only by the number who progress to higher-level arts institutions and become future art practitioners and leaders of arts and culture institutions, but also those who go on to take up other non-arts disciplines, and who then infuse their creative bent and skills into diverse professional fields and industries such as engineering and law. These graduates of SOTA are the future patrons, supporters and audiences who champion the arts.",5,570,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00570
2019-07-08-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","I agree with Mr Ho that it is important to provide opportunities for students to pursue creative arts at the tertiary level. There is currently a wide range of diploma and degree programmes in arts, design and media, more than 90% of which are government-subsidised. They are offered at all five Polytechnics, LASALLE College of the Arts, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, NUS – including the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music, NTU and Singapore Institute of Technology. Altogether, there is a total of 70 diploma and around 30 undergraduate degree courses offered in the creative arts, catering to students who are keen on specialised disciplines such as Music and Fine Arts, as well as those who are interested in more broad-based and multi-disciplinary programmes such as NTU’s degree in Media Art.",6,571,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00571

2019-07-08-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","I will now turn to Mr Ho's second recommendation. We agree that it is important to establish a robust ecosystem that contributes to the development of artists who can make Singapore and Singaporeans proud. To achieve this, NAC's Our SG Arts Plan has identified eight priority areas which range from using digital technology to maximising the impact of the arts on society. We are also committed to providing sector-wide support for our freelancers to look after their own financial and healthcare needs over the longer term. With their range of skills and expertise, freelancers make an important contribution and should have access to resources that will better equip themselves for the nature of their work. MCCY and NAC have been working with our partners to further develop the plans to support freelance artists that we shared at the Committee of Supply debates earlier this year and we will be sharing more details in due course.",8,573,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00573
2019-07-08-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","Another priority in the Arts Plan is to grow our audiences, who are critical to a thriving and sustainable arts ecosystem. The success of a sustainable arts ecosystem is determined not just by the quality of artists and their works, but also by whether they succeed in connecting with and growing their audiences. NAC will, on its part, also step up efforts to help our home-grown talents grow audiences. An example of how NAC has partnered the community to build our audiences is the Hear65 initiative launched in April 2018. This was done in collaboration with independent music media company Bandwagon to celebrate and promote all forms of Singapore music.",9,574,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00574
2019-07-08-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","Finally, I will address Mr Ho's third recommendation – supporting our young artists locally and internationally. Two other priorities in Our SG Arts Plan are to build diverse capabilities in the arts sector and to take Singapore's arts beyond our shores. Our arts eco-system is made up not only of artists but also other arts practitioners, such as managers and administrators, educators, researchers and academics. NAC will continue to support the development of arts professionals in all these areas through its initiatives and funding schemes. For example, Jean Hair was awarded an NAC scholarship in 2018 to pursue a Master of Arts and Cultural Management and has since returned to Singapore to continue her work at the National Gallery of Singapore. We are also proud of our 2011 Young Artist Award recipient Joshua Tan, who was appointed Associate Conductor of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra in the same year and went on to be the Principal Conductor of the Singapore National Youth Orchestra.",10,575,2019-07-08-T-012-S-00575

Some who perform well at such events and competitions are engaged by our national companies, such as Moses Gay – a prize winner at the National Chinese Music Competition in the early 2000s, who is now a colleague of Mr Ho as an Assistant Conductor with the Singapore Chinese Orchestra (SCO). In addition, NAC will continue to provide opportunities for our artists to participate in overseas residencies and exchanges, from Indonesia to China and Australia.

The National Council for Social Service (NCSS) has been running the ""See the True Me"" campaign since 2016, in partnership with the Tote Board. The campaign encourages the public to see persons with disability for who they are, instead of the disability that they have. It has also helped to raise awareness of autism by showcasing the abilities of persons with autism, and by profiling employers with inclusive hiring practices.",2,604,2019-07-08-T-018-S-00604

The subsidy enhancements have lowered the out-of-pocket expenses for early intervention services for most families by 30% to 70%. We are progressively rolling out more customised early intervention services, such as the Development Support Plus programme, to support children with mild to moderate developmental needs within preschools. This will give parents greater assurance that intervention is tailored to their child’s specific needs, and build a stronger foundation for the child to develop to his or her fullest potential.",5,607,2019-07-08-T-018-S-00607

These Allied Educators are able to provide group intervention for students with autism to learn social and communication skills. Specialised school-based intervention programmes are also available to support students with mild developmental needs, including autism. For example, students with both dyslexia and mild autism would be supported by the school-based dyslexia remediation programme to build up literacy skills. Those with moderate to severe autism who require more intensive and specialised assistance in their education are supported in special education (SPED) schools, such as Pathlight, AWWA School and St. Andrew's Autism School.",6,608,2019-07-08-T-018-S-00608

However, these are only temporary measures. So long as a permanent political solution remains elusive, the future of these children remain bleak.",4,660,2019-07-08-T-027-S-00660
2019-07-08-T-027,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"That is why ASEAN has consistently stressed the need to find a comprehensive and durable solution to address the root causes of the conflict, and to create a conducive environment so that the affected communities can rebuild their lives. It is ultimately the responsibility of Myanmar to work towards a viable political solution that addresses the underlying causes of this longstanding and complex problem. This is the only way to resolve this problem once and for all.",5,661,2019-07-08-T-027-S-00661
2019-07-08-T-028,Irene Quay Siew Ching,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the average response time and time taken by emergency ambulances to reach the nearest hospital during rush hours; (b) what is the percentage of emergency ambulances hitting targets for response time and time taken to reach the nearest hospital during rush hours; and (c) whether paramedics have raised concerns about vehicles not giving way to ambulances especially during rush hours.,1,662,2019-07-08-T-028-S-00662
2019-07-08-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"During rush hours, the median response time for an emergency ambulance to arrive at the incident location is about seven minutes. The median time taken to travel from the incident location to the nearest hospital is about nine minutes. We use the median rather than the average response time as an indicator of performance, as the average response time will be skewed by outliers.",1,663,2019-07-08-T-028-S-00663
2019-07-08-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"SCDF's target is to be able to respond to 80% of all emergency medical calls within 11 minutes, regardless of the time of day. This is the time taken by the emergency ambulance to arrive at the incident location. In 2018, SCDF responded to 91% of emergency medical calls within 11 minutes.",2,664,2019-07-08-T-028-S-00664
2019-07-08-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Like operators of emergency ambulance services in other countries, SCDF does not set a target for the time taken for the ambulance to reach the hospital. The ambulance crew, led by a paramedic, will provide the necessary care to the patients on the way to the hospital.",3,665,2019-07-08-T-028-S-00665
2019-07-08-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Nonetheless, SCDF strives to reach the nearest hospital in the shortest time possible. Since 1 December 2017, SCDF ambulances are legally allowed to run red lights and make U-turns at non-designated junctions when responding to life-threatening emergencies, provided it is safe to do so. This was further extended to other SCDF emergency vehicles on 1 June 2019. In addition, SCDF is collaborating with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to implement a traffic priority system in the vicinity of hospitals. The traffic priority system will provide right of way for ambulances conveying critical cases, enabling them to arrive faster at the hospitals.",4,666,2019-07-08-T-028-S-00666
2019-07-08-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Road users also play a crucial role to reduce response times by giving way to ambulances and other emergency vehicles.

2019-07-08-T-029,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"ELD will also introduce the use of self-inking pens, which imprint an 'X', to allow voters to mark their choice clearly and easily without ambiguity. Such self-inking pens require minimum pressure to mark the ballot papers, making it easy for everyone, including the elderly to use. During vote counting, the use of this self-inking pen will reduce the need for Assistant Returning Officers (AROs) to adjudicate ballot papers, since the voters' choice are clearly marked.",4,672,2019-07-08-T-029-S-00672

2019-07-08-T-030,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"FWAs benefit both employees and employers. For employees, FWAs allow them to better manage their obligations at work and their personal needs such as care-giving. For employers, studies4 have found that FWAs result in better employee engagement, reduced employee turnover and increased productivity. A 2018 MOM study5 also found that among workplace practices, availability of FWAs had the greatest impact on staff retention.",3,677,2019-07-08-T-030-S-00677
2019-07-08-T-030,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Among employees who required FWAs in 2016, seven in 10 were provided with the arrangement that they needed6. While this is encouraging, there is room for workplace cultures to become even more progressive. This is why MOM launched the Tripartite Standard on FWAs, to recognise employers who actively facilitate FWAs. To date7, around 1,600 employers, with total staff strength of about 410,000, have adopted the Standard.",4,678,2019-07-08-T-030-S-00678

2019-07-08-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Our public assistance schemes offer targeted assistance to meet different needs. ComCare, a key component of our social safety net, provides assistance to the low-income and vulnerable, to cover their basic living needs such as food, clothing, transportation, and communications. Low-income families are also supported by other schemes, such as the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme which supports the schooling expenses of children from lower-income families, the Public Rental Scheme which provides highly-subsidised rental housing, MediFund which provides assistance with medical expenses, and the Silver Support Scheme which supplements the retirement income of elderly who had low lifetime incomes and now have little family support.",1,686,2019-07-08-T-032-S-00686
2019-07-08-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As each assistance scheme has different objectives and target groups and meet different needs, the eligibility criteria and benefits are based on different information sources and benchmarks.

2019-07-08-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For instance, MSF regularly reviews the ComCare eligibility criteria and cash assistance rates. In our review, we look at expenditure data for daily living expenses of low-income families, as well as national statistical data collected by the Department of Statistics (DOS). Some of this data is published. We also consider input from community stakeholders, such as social workers and frontline officers who work with low-income families, as well as beneficiaries. Our ComCare cash assistance rates were recently raised with effect from 1 Jul 2019. The Long-Term Assistance cash assistance rates for a single-person household was increased from $500 to $600, and larger households will receive higher amounts. The Short-to-Medium-Term cash assistance rates have also been enhanced correspondingly. Importantly, in the design of schemes such as ComCare, agencies are given discretion to adjust the assistance given based on individual circumstances that low-income and vulnerable individuals and families are in.",3,688,2019-07-08-T-032-S-00688

2019-07-08-T-037,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The listings on websites like Airbnb typically do not contain specific information on the property and its owner, or the terms of the rental arrangement. So, the key to effective enforcement against illegal short-term accommodation (STA) is not so much by targeting the listings, but by conducting investigations against all suspected cases and taking action against the STA hosts.",1,725,2019-07-08-T-037-S-00725
2019-07-08-T-037,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Over the past year, URA has been stepping up its investigations of residential units suspected of STA use.

2019-07-08-T-037,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For those renting out their homes on a casual basis, and caught for the first time, URA will impose a composition fine, of up to $5,000. Since May 2019, URA has issued seven such fines. For repeat offenders and those who undertake STA operations on a commercial scale, URA will prosecute them in court, and seek higher penalties. So far, URA has secured four convictions in Court. With the increase in investigation and enforcement actions, we can expect more cases to be fined and prosecuted in Court over the coming months.",3,727,2019-07-08-T-037-S-00727

The increases have been more pronounced in recent years, especially for IP riders which typically have zero co-payment. Between 2016 and 2019, premiums of riders and the private insurance component of IP rose by an average of 24% and 10% respectively each year. These trends are largely reflective of increases in private hospital insurance claims.",1,738,2019-07-08-T-040-S-00738

NParks has been working closely with Government agencies and Town Councils on measures to reduce pigeon feeding, which can attract pigeons and cause them to breed quickly. For instance, NParks monitors pigeon feeding hotspots and works with the Town Councils to carry out targeted enforcement operations. NParks also raises public awareness against pigeon feeding via advisories, posters and outreach events.

2019-07-08-T-043,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To address pigeon feeding issues comprehensively, we need concerted efforts not just by government agencies and Town Councils, but also grassroots leaders and residents. One good example is the High-Rise Littering Pigeon Feeding pilot programme in Yio Chu Kang last year. This involved not only multiple government agencies, but also grassroots leaders who played an integral role in persuading potential pigeon feeders to change their behaviour, and encouraging residents to help educate the local community. The pilot demonstrated how an active and engaged community can help to deliver positive outcomes.",2,754,2019-07-08-T-043-S-00754

This is reflected in the Digital Readiness Blueprint that MCI launched last year.,1,783,2019-07-08-T-049-S-00783
2019-07-08-T-049,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Over the years, the Government has ensured that vulnerable segments of our society are included in our digital transformation journey. Initiatives such as IMDA's NEU PC Plus and Enable IT programmes, and the Assistive Technology Fund administered by SG Enable, provide support for persons with disabilities in their use of technology. For persons with disabilities living in a low-income household, the NEU PC Plus Programme enables them to buy a PC at a subsidised rate, while the Assistive Technology Fund subsidises the cost of assistive technology for purposes, such as early intervention, education and training. In addition, the Enable IT programme encourages the adoption of Infocomm and Assistive Technologies (IT/AT) to enable independent living.",2,784,2019-07-08-T-049-S-00784
2019-07-08-T-049,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We regularly refine and update our initiatives, and are ready to tap on opportunities to deliver better outcomes. The development of assistive technology is such an opportunity that has the potential to make big improvements to the way persons with disabilities complete tasks and activities. As a new initiative to enhance the Enable IT programme, IMDA recently supported SPD, a charity which supports people with disabilities of all ages, to set up 4 IT/AT satellite loan libraries to better provide Polytechnic students with access to IT/AT.",3,785,2019-07-08-T-049-S-00785
2019-07-08-T-049,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Government has also adopted the Digital Service Standards to ensure that digital Government services are inclusive by design, and accessible to groups such as the visually impaired. These standards were recently enhanced and published in October 2018, and we regularly review them to ensure that all Singaporeans can benefit.",4,786,2019-07-08-T-049-S-00786
2019-07-08-T-049,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We are committed to continually ensure that our Smart Nation journey is inclusive to all Singaporeans, including persons with disabilities, and we will do so by working with the people, public and private sectors. One such platform is the cross-sectoral workgroup that MSF launched this year to promote independent living through technology and design, in the home setting as well as within the community. The workgroup is co-chaired by the Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Mr Sam Tan, and President of SPD, Ms Chia Yong Yong.",5,787,2019-07-08-T-049-S-00787
2019-07-08-T-050,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether any company has been approved to operate commercial shared PMD services on public footpaths and public parks; (b) if so, when did this take place and which companies have been awarded; (c) if not, when are approvals expected; and (d) whether an update can be provided on the latest conditions and restrictions which have been imposed or which the LTA intends to impose in respect of the operation of commercial shared PMD services by proposed operators.",1,788,2019-07-08-T-050-S-00788
2019-07-08-T-050,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,The award of PMD-sharing licences has been deferred to later this year as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires more time to review the imposition of additional requirements on licensees to ensure the safety of users and the general public.,1,789,2019-07-08-T-050-S-00789
2019-07-08-T-050,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The requirements being considered include requiring shared PMDs to be certified to the UL2272 standard to ensure fire safety, and to be insured against third-party claims on bodily injury or death. LTA will also start conservatively, restricting sandbox licensees to small fleet sizes over a 1-year sandbox period.",2,790,2019-07-08-T-050-S-00790
2019-07-08-T-051,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many accidents have there been over the last one year involving cyclists and PMD users at bus stops; (b) how can the Ministry better protect commuters at bus stops; and (c) what are the efforts to improve safer usage of bicycles and PMDs at bus stops.,1,791,2019-07-08-T-051-S-00791
2019-07-08-T-051,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In the past year, there were 18 reported accidents involving cyclists and personal mobility device (PMD) users at or near bus stops.",1,792,2019-07-08-T-051-S-00792
2019-07-08-T-051,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA has been progressively undertaking infrastructural improvements at bus stops to improve safety, by building cycling paths and widening footpaths behind bus stops with high commuter traffic. The aim is to allow cyclists and PMD users to go behind the bus stop rather than through it. The widened paths include additional safety features, such as speed regulating strips, ""Look"" and ""Slow"" markings and ""Give Way to Pedestrians"" signs. LTA will continue with these infrastructural improvements where possible.",2,793,2019-07-08-T-051-S-00793
2019-07-08-T-051,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In addition, LTA regularly highlights safe riding practices in its nationwide public education campaigns. These include reminders to  ""always give way to pedestrians"", ""slow down when approaching bus stops"" and ""walk your device in crowded areas"". To date, more than 46,000 individuals have attended the Safe Riding Programme, which teaches riders to slow down, walk their devices, or dismount and push their devices at bus stops, amongst other safe riding habits.",3,794,2019-07-08-T-051-S-00794
2019-07-08-T-052,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Manpower how is the Ministry working with the food delivery companies to ensure that their food delivery riders using PMDs are provided with work injury insurance.,1,795,2019-07-08-T-052-S-00795
2019-07-08-T-052,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) works with food delivery companies on measures to prevent accidents and injuries in the first place. MOM and the Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) have partnered with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Traffic Police on initiatives to inculcate safe riding practices among delivery riders. These initiatives include running the annual Singapore Ride Safe campaign and publishing a guide on safe riding.,1,796,2019-07-08-T-052-S-00796
2019-07-08-T-052,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Food delivery companies are required to purchase work injury compensation insurance for their employed delivery riders. These riders are eligible for compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act if they are injured at work. Companies have control over their employees' work arrangements and are therefore responsible for compensation if their employees are injured in the course of work.,2,797,2019-07-08-T-052-S-00797
2019-07-08-T-052,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"For self-employed delivery riders, they may choose their own work arrangements such as driving their own vehicles and managing their own working hours. In addition, they can work for multiple delivery companies. In this regard, companies do not have full control over the SEP work arrangements and are thus not required to purchase work injury compensation insurance for them.",3,798,2019-07-08-T-052-S-00798
2019-07-08-T-052,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Nonetheless, WSHC has engaged food delivery companies to encourage them to provide personal accident insurance for all their delivery riders, including those who are self-employed. Several major operators like Deliveroo and GrabFood already do.",4,799,2019-07-08-T-052-S-00799
2019-07-08-T-052,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,WSHC will publish an updated guide on safe riding later this year that will include insurance coverage for riders as a good industry practice. It will highlight that a self-employed rider hurt in an accident caused by another vehicle can also claim against the vehicle owner's motor insurance.,5,800,2019-07-08-T-052-S-00800
2019-07-08-T-053,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can provide an update on Singapore's efforts and strategy in ASEAN to lead and boost the green economy and counter climate change; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider working with other agencies to build a bigger climate financing ecosystem here via incentives and lowering bank capital requirements for climate-friendly investments.,1,801,2019-07-08-T-053-S-00801
2019-07-08-T-053,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Located in a region with long coastlines and heavily-populated low-lying areas, ASEAN Member States (AMS) are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. ASEAN's efforts to tackle climate change have been directed toward sustainable development and the building of smart and efficient cities, which also support the growth of a green economy.",1,802,2019-07-08-T-053-S-00802
2019-07-08-T-053,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ASEAN cooperation on climate change is under the purview of the ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change (AWGCC). As Chair for the period 2017 to 2019, Singapore works closely with AMS and international development partners to drive the implementation of the AWGCC Action Plan (2016-2025), which covers climate adaptation and mitigation, capability building, climate finance, and cross-sectoral coordination. AMS are currently working on 18 projects and activities endorsed by the AWGCC. Singapore also launched the Climate Action Package at the Special ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Climate Action last July, to provide training and capacity building for participating countries to take climate mitigation and adaptation measures, which in turn also help to make their economies more resilient.",2,803,2019-07-08-T-053-S-00803
2019-07-08-T-053,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Singapore has also been driving action at the city level. One of our key initiatives as ASEAN Chair last year was the establishment of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN), a collaborative platform for AMS to work towards smart and sustainable development. Singapore will continue to support Thailand as the current Chair of ASEAN to advance this work under its ""Advancing Partnership for Sustainability"" agenda.",3,804,2019-07-08-T-053-S-00804
2019-07-08-T-053,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"However, Governments cannot tackle climate change alone. We need to mobilise private capital to support sustainable development and facilitate the region's transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient economy. My Ministry works closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to promote sustainable financing in Singapore and the region. Let me outline our efforts in three key areas.",4,805,2019-07-08-T-053-S-00805
2019-07-08-T-053,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"First, non-bank financing solutions like green bonds can play a bigger role in the financing of green investments. MAS introduced the Green Bond Grant Scheme in 2017 to spur the use of capital markets instruments for green financing and to promote the adoption of standards for green investment products. The grant helps to offset the cost of obtaining an external review to ensure that the green bonds are aligned with internationally accepted standards. In February this year, the grant scheme was expanded to include social and sustainability bonds, and renamed the Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme (SBGS). To date, over SGD 6 billion of green bonds have been issued in Singapore. MAS has also lowered the minimum issuance size requirement for the SBGS, which will allow more qualifying issuers to access the grant.",5,806,2019-07-08-T-053-S-00806
2019-07-08-T-053,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second, MAS is working closely with banks to strengthen their management of environmental risks and support sustainable financing. Over the past years, the banks have been enhancing their relevant policies and processes. In April this year, our local banks announced their decisions to cease financing of new coal-fired power plants, and are working with their customers to make the transition to cleaner forms of energy production. As a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System, MAS works closely with our international counterparts to develop best practices for banks to manage environmental risks and seize opportunities. These international forums are studying the use of capital and other regulatory requirements to promote sustainable financing. As capital requirements are intended to ensure that banks have sufficient capacity to withstand losses, any reduction in capital should be justified by lower risks posed by exposure to sustainable financing.",6,807,2019-07-08-T-053-S-00807
2019-07-08-T-053,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Third, MAS is working with local and international partners to strengthen the capability and capacity of the financial sector to support sustainable financing activities. For example, MAS has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation, which aims to raise the awareness and knowledge of green bonds through capacity building workshops.",7,808,2019-07-08-T-053-S-00808
2019-07-08-T-053,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The continued growth of sustainable financing requires a coordinated and collective effort involving the financial sector, businesses, the Government and civil society. My Ministry will continue to work closely with the MAS and other government agencies to support our sustainable financing efforts and drive climate action in Singapore.",8,809,2019-07-08-T-053-S-00809
2019-07-08-T-054,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider having (i) designated areas for recycling bins at each HDB block, which will make recycling more convenient and (ii) a waste bin beside each recycling bin to reduce the contamination rate in our recycling bins.",1,810,2019-07-08-T-054-S-00810
2019-07-08-T-054,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Making recycling more convenient is indeed part of the approach that my Ministry and the National Environment Agency (NEA) are taking to improve recycling rates. Every HDB block is currently provided with a recycling bin, and all new Build-to-Order flats launched since 2014 have a recycling chute next to the waste chute, making recycling as convenient as the disposing of general waste. In addition, as suggested by the Member, NEA is working with the Public Waste Collectors and the Town Councils to progressively demarcate the location of recycling bins. NEA is also working with other stakeholders on the ground, including the Town Councils, to ensure that sufficient general waste bins are available.",1,811,2019-07-08-T-054-S-00811
2019-07-08-T-054,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Besides reviewing the infrastructure needed to better support recycling, public education is key in reducing the contamination rate of our recyclables. This is why my Ministry and the NEA launched a #RecycleRight campaign as part of the Year Towards Zero Waste to raise awareness of what can and cannot be recycled. We are also working with our 3P partners to redesign the recycling bin labels to reflect what can and cannot be recycled more clearly, and to emphasise that food and liquids should not be thrown into the recycling bins as they would contaminate the recyclables.",2,812,2019-07-08-T-054-S-00812
2019-07-08-T-055,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the total capacity of infant care centres in Yishun; (b) how many applicants are currently in the wait list; (c) how long do they normally have to wait; and (d) what plans are there to meet the demand.,1,813,2019-07-08-T-055-S-00813
2019-07-08-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As of February 2019, there are about 30 childcare centres in Yishun estate with a licensed capacity of 430 infant care places.",1,814,2019-07-08-T-055-S-00814
2019-07-08-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"While we do not have the wait lists of individual centres, through the Registration Management System under the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), about 100 parents in Yishun have registered interest in an infant care place for their child. This constitutes 2% of all parents with infants living in Yishun.",2,815,2019-07-08-T-055-S-00815
2019-07-08-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Often, parents may register their interest early without an immediate need for infant care places as they have alternative arrangements, such as home-based care, or have registered interest for specific centres. Nevertheless, about 10 centres have immediate vacancies, and another 10 have vacancies within the next six months. Parents may have to wait longer if they prefer to send their infants to specific centres.",3,816,2019-07-08-T-055-S-00816
2019-07-08-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Providing access to quality, affordable infant and childcare remains a key priority for the Government. We will continue to increase capacity where needed to meet demand for early childhood services, including infant care. By 2022, we plan to develop another six centres to provide 130 more infant care places in Yishun. They will be built in tandem with future new Build-To-Order (BTO) the housing development, so that they can be operational in time to meet parents' needs.",4,817,2019-07-08-T-055-S-00817
2019-07-08-T-056,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many cases of neighbour disputes have been reported to the HDB from 2014 till date; (b) how many have been resolved; and (c) what recourse is available to residents who have been subject to persistent and prolonged harassment by neighbours.,1,818,2019-07-08-T-056-S-00818
2019-07-08-T-056,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Since 2014, HDB has received about 15,600 cases of feedback relating to disamenities caused by neighbours, or an average of about 2,800 cases per year. Many of such cases are settled privately. We thus do not have statistics on how many of these cases have been resolved.",1,819,2019-07-08-T-056-S-00819
2019-07-08-T-056,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In cases where neighbours are unable to resolve their differences, they can approach the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), which provides trained mediators to help neighbours arrive at mutually acceptable solutions. HDB also refers cases to the CMC. Since 2014, CMC has mediated 40 to 50 of such cases each year, of which over 70% were resolved.",2,820,2019-07-08-T-056-S-00820
2019-07-08-T-056,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For long-standing and intractable cases where neighbours are unable to resolve their disputes by voluntary mediation or other informal means, the aggrieved parties can bring a claim to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) as a last resort. The CDRT judge can order parties to attend mandatory mediation in the Courts or at the CMC, to attend counselling, or fix the case for hearing.",3,821,2019-07-08-T-056-S-00821

2019-07-08-T-057,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for National Development in light of the growing trend of rainfall volatility and intensity causing human injury and property damage, whether NParks will consider introducing regulations to ensure that all organisations having the responsibility to maintain trees in the vicinity of roads, footpaths, residences, playgrounds and the like apply the same or higher standard of tree inspection and maintenance by NParks.",1,824,2019-07-08-T-057-S-00824
2019-07-08-T-057,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Many organisations, including Town Councils (TCs), take reference from NParks' tree management contracts when drawing up their own contracts. For instance, their contracts require tree inspections to be performed by arborists certified by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). These arborists are able to perform tree inspections and maintenance according to the standards stipulated by the ISA, which NParks' standards are based on.",1,825,2019-07-08-T-057-S-00825
2019-07-08-T-057,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Parks and Trees Act already allows NParks to take action against those who are not maintaining their trees satisfactorily. Authorised NParks officers can enter premises to inspect potentially dangerous trees. If the tree constitutes a danger to any person or property, NParks can issue a maintenance notice requiring the occupier of the premises to maintain the tree or take other specified measures to abate the danger. Non-compliance with NParks' maintenance notice is an offence.",2,826,2019-07-08-T-057-S-00826
2019-07-08-T-057,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides regulatory levers, NParks has also been helping to raise the capabilities of landscape contractors and other organisations that manage trees. This includes providing regular training courses on tree inspection and maintenance, as well as conducting workshops and seminars to share best practices in tree management. NParks will continue to work with organisations that manage trees to ensure that all trees in Singapore are well maintained.",3,827,2019-07-08-T-057-S-00827
2019-07-08-T-058,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for National Development what is the rationale for not wanting to draw demarcation lines along park connectors to provide for clear lines of division between cyclists and joggers using the same path.,1,828,2019-07-08-T-058-S-00828
2019-07-08-T-058,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Based on experience and user feedback, NParks has found that drawing demarcation lines alone will not result in a meaningful separation of cyclists and joggers along the park connectors, or result in improved safety for park users. That is why NParks encourages a ""keep left"" etiquette on the park connectors – slower users should keep left, while faster users overtake on the right.",1,829,2019-07-08-T-058-S-00829
2019-07-08-T-058,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In areas where there is sufficient space, a better approach is to implement separate paths for the different user groups. In other words, there will be a clear physical separator between the walking and cycling paths, and not just a demarcation line on the ground. This is already done in the recently revamped Lakeside Garden in Jurong, where the paths are 8 metres wide. In tandem, we will continue to introduce additional safety measures such as lighting, speed regulating strips, and advisory signs at high usage areas. NParks will also continue to work with LTA and the community to promote the safe and orderly use of our park connectors.",2,830,2019-07-08-T-058-S-00830

2019-07-08-T-061,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health (a) how many cases of imported diseases has been reported in the last three years; and (b) how can the Ministry work with these source countries to minimise the occurrences of these diseases from reaching our shores.,1,841,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00841
2019-07-08-T-061,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In the last three years, there were two reported cases of severe emerging infectious diseases brought in by infected travellers",1,842,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00842
2019-07-08-T-061,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In May 2019, we had an imported Monkeypox case from Nigeria. Monkeypox is a rare infection transmitted primarily from animals to humans and occurring mainly in central and west Africa. It causes fever and rash, and can occasionally be fatal.",2,843,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00843
2019-07-08-T-061,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In May 2016, we had an imported Zika case from Brazil. Although Zika does not generally cause serious illness, it may cause microcephaly in babies of infected pregnant women. Subsequently in August 2016, we reported our first locally-transmitted cases, which were not linked to the case from Brazil, but to another unidentified imported case of a different Asian lineage of Zika.",3,844,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00844
2019-07-08-T-061,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition to these severe emerging diseases, there are also many common infectious diseases that are imported into Singapore. Between 2016 to 2018, there were 1,869 cases of imported infections, of which dengue and traveller's diarrhoea were the most common causes, followed by malaria, chikungunya and measles.",4,845,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00845
2019-07-08-T-061,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Given the high volume of international travel, there is always a risk that travellers may bring in emerging infectious diseases. MOH works closely with international bodies and foreign counterparts to prevent importation of such diseases. We also work with our local healthcare institutions and relevant government agencies to prevent, detect and contain such imported cases.",5,846,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00846
2019-07-08-T-061,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"At the international level, the World Health Organization (WHO) requires countries to notify it of events that constitute a ""public health emergency of international concern"", and may ask them to undertake measures to limit the risk of spread across borders. WHO keeps member nations informed of such incidents and may recommend public health measures if necessary. By working with WHO and other countries, we can better monitor the emerging global situation, obtain early warnings of public health threats, assess the potential risk to us and take early measures to prevent and detect such diseases.",6,847,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00847
2019-07-08-T-061,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Where appropriate, we institute measures at our borders. For example, temperature screening is currently conducted for all travellers from the Middle East to detect cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an infection that can cause severe respiratory illness. However, temperature screening may not be effective against other diseases such as Zika because most infected persons have no or mild symptoms. There is also an incubation period during which an infected person may not display any symptom.",7,848,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00848
2019-07-08-T-061,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH therefore works with our healthcare institutions and professionals to maintain vigilance. We send out alerts and circulars to keep our hospitals, polyclinics and primary care doctors updated on the latest disease situation, and to inform them of the criteria for evaluating and reporting possible cases. The recent Monkeypox case for example was detected by vigilant doctors at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital and National Centre for Infectious Diseases.",8,849,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00849
2019-07-08-T-061,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Finally, when we have a confirmed case, we will take decisive actions to contain the spread and treat the patient. MOH has worked with healthcare providers and relevant government agencies to isolate the case, conduct contact tracing and quarantine close contacts if necessary, and carry our environmental disinfection.",9,850,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00850
2019-07-08-T-061,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The public has an important role to play too. We encourage members of the public to keep up to date with the Government's travel advisories and exercise personal responsibility and hygiene during their travels, especially to affected countries.  This way, it will protect you against the risk being infected and bringing emerging diseases to Singapore.",10,851,2019-07-08-T-061-S-00851
2019-07-08-T-062,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) over the last five years, what is the number of complaints received by HDB pertaining to foreign tenants in HDB estates; (b) what is the nature of these complaints; (c) how does HDB follow up on the complaints; and (d) whether measures are in place to help first-time foreign tenants of HDB flats familiarise with the norms and practices in HDB estates as well as living in Singapore.",1,852,2019-07-08-T-062-S-00852
2019-07-08-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"From 2014 to 2018, HDB received about 3,300 cases of feedback on suspected unauthorised flat rentals, dis-amenities or overcrowding of HDB flats by foreign and non-foreign tenants. HDB investigates every case of public feedback received, on top of the proactive inspections that it carries out. Depending on the severity and circumstances of the infringement, HDB may issue a written warning, impose a financial penalty, or acquire the flats compulsorily from the owners.",1,853,2019-07-08-T-062-S-00853
2019-07-08-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB actively promotes gracious and harmonious living in public housing through various initiatives. For example, HDB has a network of volunteers to help spread tips on neighbourliness at community events and door-to-door visits. HDB also gives out the Good Neighbour Awards to recognise individuals who have gone the extra mile with their acts of neighbourliness.",2,854,2019-07-08-T-062-S-00854
2019-07-08-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides HDB's efforts, there are also initiatives undertaken by other Government agencies. For example, the People's Association's nationwide network of more than 1,400 Integration and Naturalisation Champions reach out to new immigrants and help them settle into the community. The National Integration Council works with community groups, immigrant associations, schools, and other partners to help foreigners and immigrants understand our local laws, norms and culture.",3,855,2019-07-08-T-062-S-00855
2019-07-08-T-063,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether PUB conducts regular checks on water meters of residents' homes to ensure that there is no leakage; and (b) what is the follow-up process when residents suspect that their water meters may be faulty.,1,856,2019-07-08-T-063-S-00856
2019-07-08-T-063,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Water fixtures and fittings, such as pipes and water taps, undergo natural wear and tear and require periodic repair and maintenance. It is the responsibility of home owners to maintain these fixtures and fittings, to ensure that there is no water leakage within their homes.",1,857,2019-07-08-T-063-S-00857
2019-07-08-T-063,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Water meter readings are taken by SP Services, PUB's billing agent, once every two months. If SP Services detects exceptionally high or low usage, SP Services and PUB will carry out checks and investigations. If the meter is faulty, PUB will replace the meter. If the leak is suspected to involve home water fixtures and fittings, PUB will alert the home owner to look into it.",2,858,2019-07-08-T-063-S-00858
2019-07-08-T-063,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Residents who suspect leaks in their homes can turn off all the taps in the house and check their water meters. If the water meter counter dial is still running, there may be a leak in the home. The resident should then engage a licensed plumber to trace and repair the leak. Residents can also contact SP Services to request for the meter to be checked",3,859,2019-07-08-T-063-S-00859
2019-07-08-T-063,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"By 2023, PUB will install 300,000 smart water meters in new and existing premises through the first phase of its Smart Water Meter Programme. Once rolled out, residents with smart meters will have ready access to their daily water usage data through a mobile application or an online portal, and be promptly alerted to suspected leaks.",4,860,2019-07-08-T-063-S-00860
2019-07-08-T-064,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in view of the recent dengue situation, what assistance measures can be offered to home owners, especially the elderly, who are unable to check on areas beyond their reach such as gutters.",1,861,2019-07-08-T-064-S-00861
2019-07-08-T-064,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As of 29 June, there were over 6,100 reported dengue cases in 2019, which is about four times the number of cases in the same period in 2018. We are entering the traditional peak dengue season and a national collective effort is critical to stem the transmission of dengue.",1,862,2019-07-08-T-064-S-00862
2019-07-08-T-064,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Inspections conducted by the National Environment Agency (NEA) showed that 60% of all Aedes aegypti breeding habitats detected were in homes. This proportion was even higher in dengue clusters, with 74% of breeding habitats detected in homes. Therefore, home-owners play a crucial role in keeping dengue at bay.",2,863,2019-07-08-T-064-S-00863
2019-07-08-T-064,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I urge all residents to take immediate action to eradicate potential mosquito breeding habitats by practicing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout regularly, and stepping up housekeeping measures. All residents living in cluster areas should also cooperate with NEA officers to facilitate checks and carry out indoor misting in homes.",3,864,2019-07-08-T-064-S-00864
2019-07-08-T-064,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Community support is an integral part of the national effort to raise awareness and drive action on the ground. NEA, together with Dengue Prevention Volunteers, works closely with Grassroots Advisers, Neighbourhood Committees (NCs) and Residents’ Committees (RCs) to reach out to residents. NCs and RCs can assist households with elderly members to check their homes and remove stagnant water to prevent mosquito breeding.",4,865,2019-07-08-T-064-S-00865
2019-07-08-T-064,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Households can take preventive measures such as avoiding the use of flowerpot plates for ornamental plants. Home owners with roof gutters that are difficult to access can engage pest control operators to check for stagnant water and apply Bti insecticide, if they are unable to do so themselves. A typical Bti briquette can remain effective for about 30 days.",5,866,2019-07-08-T-064-S-00866
2019-07-08-T-064,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"NEA is stepping up efforts to stem dengue transmission. Over 440 dengue prevention events have been organised since the launch of this year's National Dengue Prevention Campaign in April. However, the government alone cannot prevent dengue transmission in Singapore. I encourage everyone, including our silver generation, to be an advocate of dengue prevention and to remind our family members and neighbours to join in this national effort.",6,867,2019-07-08-T-064-S-00867
2019-07-08-T-065,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the cause of the SP Power Grid (SPPG) Substation fire at the Carlton Hotel in February 2019; (b) what is the result of the investigation into the SPPG Substation fire at Bright Hill in January 2019; (c) whether any equipment at fault in these incidents is scheduled for replacement or maintenance; and (d) what measures have been taken to address the risk of recurrence.,1,868,2019-07-08-T-065-S-00868
2019-07-08-T-065,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Based on EMA's investigations, the power failure at the Carlton Hotel on 14 February 2019 was due to a short circuit in the substation switchgear, which started a fire. The insulation between two components in the switchgear had failed due to heat stress from foreign contaminants, which could have been introduced during maintenance. EMA determined that had SP Power Grid (SPPG) complied with its standard operating procedure (SOP) for monitoring work, the incident could have been prevented. As a result, EMA imposed a financial penalty of $1,000,000 on SPPG.",1,869,2019-07-08-T-065-S-00869
2019-07-08-T-065,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As for the power failure at Bright Hill that occurred on 26 January 2019, EMA's investigations showed that a faulty voltage transformer (VT) had started a fire in the substation. EMA found that SPPG was using the faulty VT beyond its Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) recommended lifespan. Thus, EMA imposed a financial penalty of $750,000 on SPPG. SPPG is replacing all the VTs that have exceeded their lifespan, starting with those of a similar make and model as the faulty VT in Bright Hill. EMA has also worked with SPPG to place such equipment within a protection zone where, in the event of failure, the impact will be isolated to minimise the risk of a cascading effect affecting other substations.",2,870,2019-07-08-T-065-S-00870
2019-07-08-T-065,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The Government takes a serious view of ensuring that our power system remains reliable and secure. EMA has also stepped up its regulatory oversight on how SPPG monitors and maintains the health of our power system.,3,871,2019-07-08-T-065-S-00871
2019-07-08-T-065,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Separately, SPPG has engaged an independent consultant to review and recommend enhancements to its equipment replacement and maintenance regime, as well as its monitoring work practices. As a result, SPPG is putting more resources into monitoring and maintaining substations and renewing key assets. They will also extend the use of technologies such as online condition monitoring and deepen the core skills of their workforce. EMA will continue to work closely with SPPG to ensure a high standard of reliability for our power system.",4,872,2019-07-08-T-065-S-00872
2019-07-08-T-066,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are sufficient workers currently at the two rail operators to carry out preventive maintenance of the MRT lines effectively; and (b) what are the plans by the Ministry to ensure that there are adequate skilled technical workers for rail maintenance in view of the introduction and opening of new MRT lines.,1,873,2019-07-08-T-066-S-00873
2019-07-08-T-066,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Effective and timely maintenance is necessary to ensure a reliable MRT service. Besides hardware investments, we also require a skilled maintenance workforce. Today, our rail operators deploy more than 50% of their headcount, or more than 4,000 staff, to maintenance and engineering. Thanks to their tireless efforts, our MRT service has stabilised, with a reliability level comparable to that of Taipei Metro and Hong Kong MTR.",1,874,2019-07-08-T-066-S-00874
2019-07-08-T-066,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"We need to maintain this staffing level for existing MRT lines. But as our MRT network is still expanding, we work closely with the rail operators and the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU), to continuously upskill and reskill existing workers, and to attract a healthy pipeline of new workers.",2,875,2019-07-08-T-066-S-00875
2019-07-08-T-066,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In 2016, LTA launched the $12.5 million Public Transport Manpower Development Fund, or PTMDF in short, to attract, develop, and retain skilled workers in the public transport industry.

2019-07-08-T-067,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"There have been nine reported incidents with injuries at Jewel. Five were escalator-related which the Building and Construction Authority has investigated. They found no technical safety issues and the incidents were due to unsafe user behaviour, such as brushing footwear against the side of an escalator.",2,881,2019-07-08-T-067-S-00881
2019-07-08-T-067,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,Four incidents took place at the Jewel Canopy Park. Investigations by Jewel Changi Airport confirmed that the incidents were not caused by technical problems.,3,882,2019-07-08-T-067-S-00882
2019-07-08-T-067,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Meanwhile, Jewel Changi Airport is taking steps to improve safety. It is installing additional signages to remind visitors to exercise care.

2019-07-08-T-068,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun,asked the Minister for Transport in view of the discontinuation of the bus-on-demand trial due to high software development costs and poor commuter take-up (a) whether options to lower such costs have been explored through opening up software development to more players; and (b) whether a more concerted effort to educate commuters could be made before concluding the trial.,1,884,2019-07-08-T-068-S-00884
2019-07-08-T-068,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,The six-month on-demand public bus or ODPB trial was concluded last month. It has achieved its objective of providing insights on resource requirements and commuter acceptance. We found the ODPB to be less cost effective than regular bus services. One factor was the high software development costs. This is so even though the open tender attracted competitive bids from ten local and overseas players.,1,885,2019-07-08-T-068-S-00885
2019-07-08-T-068,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As with all new technologies, public acceptance takes time and effort. LTA worked with both the ODPB operators and software developers to raise awareness among commuters in the trial areas. Posters were put up at major public transport nodes, and ground ambassadors were deployed to offer assistance to commuters. LTA also engaged stakeholders directly served by the ODPB services. While some commuters were initially uncomfortable with booking a bus ride using mobile phones, many gave it a try with more than 29,000 rides booked and taken.",2,886,2019-07-08-T-068-S-00886
2019-07-08-T-068,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA is open to conducting further trials of the on-demand concept in future. As the technology matures, we can expect the large-scale deployment of ODPB to be more cost effective. We will also build on these initial engagement efforts to educate commuters on the concept.",3,887,2019-07-08-T-068-S-00887
2019-07-08-T-069,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Prime Minister whether house unions in the various Ministries and statutory boards can be regarded as part of the organisational structure and hence be allowed to occupy office space within the building premises without being charged market rental.,1,888,2019-07-08-T-069-S-00888
2019-07-08-T-069,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"House unions are valued partners of public sector agencies, but are not part of the organisational structure. They are separate entities regulated by the Trade Unions Act and other legislation administered by the Registry of Trade Unions.",1,889,2019-07-08-T-069-S-00889
2019-07-08-T-069,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"In general, public sector agencies allow their union branch leaders to use their non-exclusive office facilities, such as meeting rooms, without any charges. They are accorded the same treatment as any other employees who need to use the office facilities. However, in instances where the unions have requested for dedicated office space for their exclusive use, they would be charged market rental rates. This is in line with the Ministry of Finance's policy that all government premises should be rented at market rates.",2,890,2019-07-08-T-069-S-00890
2019-07-08-T-070,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the operating terms for virtual banks as compared with traditional banks; (b) whether MAS will ensure that there is a level playing field for all; and (c) what is the impact of lower operational costs for virtual banks on consumers and the industry.,1,891,2019-07-08-T-070-S-00891
2019-07-08-T-070,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS has announced that it will be issuing up to five new digital bank licences, which will comprise up to two digital full bank licences that can access retail deposits, and up to three digital wholesale bank licences that will cater to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and other non-retail segments. This is in addition to any digital banks that Singapore banking groups may establish under MAS' existing internet banking framework introduced in 2000.",1,892,2019-07-08-T-070-S-00892
2019-07-08-T-070,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"The move will provide space in our banking system for innovative non-bank players, and help spur further innovation in banking. In the same vein, MAS had announced in September last year that non-bank payment institutions will be granted direct access to the real time payments network between banks, also known as Fast and Secure Transfer (FAST).",2,893,2019-07-08-T-070-S-00893
2019-07-08-T-070,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),MAS' operating terms for the new digital banks will be calibrated to maintain the trust and stability that are the hallmarks of Singapore's banking system. Let me elaborate.,3,894,2019-07-08-T-070-S-00894
2019-07-08-T-070,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"First, MAS will carefully evaluate the sustainability of applicants' business models. They must not engage in value-destructive competition to gain market share. MAS will monitor market dynamics and, where necessary, impose additional supervisory requirements or restrictions to deter such behaviour. The aim here is to avoid unsustainable banking practices, and to preserve a level playing field among banks.",4,895,2019-07-08-T-070-S-00895
2019-07-08-T-070,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Second, we will also preserve a level playing field in prudential requirements. The digital banks will have to meet the same capital and liquidity requirements as existing banks. They will be subject to the same consumer lending rules, such as limits on unsecured credit extended and loan-to-value ratios for mortgages. Digital full banks will also be required to participate in the deposit insurance scheme, which will cover an individual’s deposits of up to S$75,000.",5,896,2019-07-08-T-070-S-00896
2019-07-08-T-070,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Third, to minimise risks to retail depositors, MAS will phase in the permissible activities of digital full banks via a two-stage process. A digital full bank will commence as a restricted digital bank to build up its business model and internal processes, and gradually progress to become a full-fledged full bank. At the entry stage, a restricted bank will be subject to an aggregate deposit cap of S$50 million and an individual depositor cap of S$75,000. While digital wholesale banks are not subject to the two-stage process, MAS will impose appropriate activity restrictions in its initial years of operations to mitigate the risks of untested business models.",6,897,2019-07-08-T-070-S-00897
2019-07-08-T-070,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS' regulatory and supervisory frameworks support the stability of the system as a whole, and help preserve sound practices among individual banks. But MAS, like all financial regulators, cannot guarantee that individual banks will not fail, whether they are digital banks or otherwise. It hence remains important for consumers to be aware of the risks, and of the extent of protection that they will be accorded under the deposit insurance scheme if a bank fails.",7,898,2019-07-08-T-070-S-00898

The countries in the List are not by that virtue deemed to be currency manipulators. The US Treasury has also acknowledged the uniqueness of Singapore's exchange-rate based monetary policy system. Its report points out that MAS manages the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) within a policy band, just as other central banks conduct monetary policy by targeting interest rates.

2019-07-08-T-085,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We periodically review MediFund processes to improve and streamline them where possible. For instance, needy patients on Public Assistance today do not need to undergo further MediFund assessment at MFIs. We are also in the midst of rolling out system enhancements, led by our MSWs, that will streamline the application process and improve information sharing. This will make it more convenient for MediFund patients who visit more than one institution.",5,965,2019-07-08-T-085-S-00965

2019-07-08-T-086,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The conditions covered under CDMP are reviewed on a periodic basis as new information and evidence emerge. In June 2018 for example, ischaemic heart disease and pre-diabetes were added to the list of CDMP-approved chronic conditions. We will continue to periodically review the list of supportable conditions, including chronic skin conditions, to meet the needs of Singaporeans, while ensuring that MediSave balances are not prematurely depleted.",2,968,2019-07-08-T-086-S-00968
2019-07-08-T-086,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Beyond the CDMP, other support for treatment of chronic conditions, including subsidies for different chronic skin conditions, are widely available for all Singaporeans at Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GP clinics, polyclinics and where the condition is serious, subsidised specialist outpatient clinics. Singaporeans aged 60 and above can also tap on Flexi-MediSave to defray their out-of-pocket costs for outpatient treatments.",3,969,2019-07-08-T-086-S-00969

2019-07-08-T-102,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"From our preliminary findings, three main factors have contributed to the narrowing of pay differences. First, the employment rate of women in prime-working ages has risen; they tend to be better educated and earned higher wages than older women.
