2020-03-04-T-001,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what lessons are learnt from the recent exit of UN Women from Singapore after 20 years of operations; (b) whether it is timely to review the 80 20 fundraising rule for charities given the global and interconnected nature of issues confronting societies; and (c) what efforts are being made to promote regional and international philanthropy",1,1,2020-03-04-T-001-S-00001
2020-03-04-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)","Mr Speaker,  the closure of the local chapter of UN Women is an internal decision by the board and members of the society.",1,2,2020-03-04-T-001-S-00002
2020-03-04-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)","The 80 20 fund-raising rule under the Charities Act, requires at least 80% of funds raised for foreign charitable purposes be applied towards charitable purposes in Singapore. This is to ensure that donations from our Singapore public are used primarily to benefit locals and to address local needs. The Commissioner of Charities can and does waive this 80 20 rule on a case-by-case basis, such as for fund-raising for immediate disaster relief in other countries.",2,3,2020-03-04-T-001-S-00003
2020-03-04-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)","Ms Ong is right that globalisation and connectivity ties the fortunes of countries together, and many solutions to global issues require collective action from all countries. The Government, through the Economic Development Board, engages and develops a robust eco-system of Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs), including international organisations dedicated to philanthropy. This includes organisations such as the Asia Venture Philanthropy Network (AVPN) and the Asia Philanthropy Circle (APC) – which use Singapore as a venue to convene, share best practices and form partnerships to address global issues.",3,4,2020-03-04-T-001-S-00004

2020-03-04-T-001,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response. I should also declare that I was formerly a board member of UN Women when it was known as UNIFEM. May I know from the Minister if she thinks we should also look into supporting some of the local charities and non-profits that could be ready to go overseas so that we can develop deeper skills and also expand SG Cares' vision beyond our shores?",1,7,2020-03-04-T-001-S-00007

2020-03-04-T-002,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,"asked the Minister for Education what steps are taken to avoid discrimination on the basis of descent in our Primary school admission system which gives preference to children of alumni, given that Article 16(1)(a) of our Constitution provides that ""there shall be no discrimination against any citizen of Singapore on the grounds only of religion, race, descent or place of birth in the administration of any educational institution maintained by a public authority, and, in particular, the admission of pupils..."".",1,13,2020-03-04-T-002-S-00013

2020-03-04-T-002,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Education),"Hence, all our schools are secular and no school will deny the admission of any Singaporean child due to the factors stated in the Constitution. Our Primary 1 admission system seeks to be as open and fair as possible. But when the number of students applying to a school exceeds the number of available places, we need a system of selection.",2,15,2020-03-04-T-002-S-00015
2020-03-04-T-002,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Education),"Since there are no examination results to look at for P1 admission, we have to consider other factors. These include proximity to the school and siblings already in the school, for the convenience of parents and children, children of alumni who have a strong attachment to the school and wish their children to have a similar experience as they did, members of organisations who set up and still legally own the school, active volunteerism in the school or community and students of the MOE Kindergarten in the Primary school. Admitting students with no prior connections with the school is also an objective, and we reserve places for such students.",3,16,2020-03-04-T-002-S-00016
2020-03-04-T-002,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Education),"These are all valid justifications for some level of priority admission. It is common for MOE to receive arguments from one group on why the other group is less deserving. On our end, MOE seeks to strike a balance. That is a complicated legacy we live with, but where possible, we will take steps to lean towards making schools more open and accessible to students who have no prior connections with the school.",4,17,2020-03-04-T-002-S-00017
2020-03-04-T-003,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry intends to delink the eligibility criteria of childcare subsidies from the mother's employment status and, if no, what is the rationale keeping employment status as a criterion.",1,18,2020-03-04-T-003-S-00018
2020-03-04-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mr Speaker, all parents, regardless of their working status, are supported with basic subsidies for childcare for their Singapore Citizen children. As working mothers need childcare while they are at work, the Government provides them with higher basic subsidies, as well as means-tested additional subsidies, if eligible. The mother's working status is thus a criterion for higher subsidies.",1,19,2020-03-04-T-003-S-00019
2020-03-04-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Notwithstanding this, the Government does exercise flexibility where the mother is unable to work and yet requires childcare services. ECDA is planning to provide better subsidy support, especially for low-income families and will announce details at MSF's Committee of Supply.",2,20,2020-03-04-T-003-S-00020
2020-03-04-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Non-working mothers who do not require full-day childcare can enrol their children in half-day kindergartens, which are shorter and often more affordable than full-day childcare programmes. There is, of course, KiFAS, which does not depend on working mother status. Families with children enrolled in kindergartens run by Anchor Operators and MOE may be eligible for means-tested kindergarten subsidies – as I said, KiFAS – which do not depend on the mother’s working status.",3,21,2020-03-04-T-003-S-00021

2020-03-04-T-003,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister for the response. Could I just ask, especially given that we are celebrating women this month, is there a reason why we only specify and link this eligibility criterion to the mother's employment, and not the father's?",1,24,2020-03-04-T-003-S-00024
2020-03-04-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The subsidy was intended to support mothers who go to work. And the way to encourage them to return to the labour market, if they wish; and if they do, then, they can be assured that childcare will be supported.",1,25,2020-03-04-T-003-S-00025
2020-03-04-T-004,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how resilient is Singapore's economy and supply chain in the face of crises such as the COVID-19 outbreak.,1,26,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00026
2020-03-04-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether, as part of economic defence, the Government has considered nurturing a certain amount of domestic manufacturing capacity for critical necessities in product categories like medical disposables.",1,27,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00027
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 4 and 5 together?",1,28,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00028
2020-03-04-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,29,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00029
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Thank you, Sir. The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected Singapore's economy. It has led to a sharp fall in tourist arrivals and a decline in domestic consumption, which have in turn badly affected our tourism, transport, retail and F&B sectors. The disruption in economic activities in China is also expected to negatively affect export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale trade.",1,30,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00030
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Singapore is a small and open economy. The COVID-19 outbreak is a reminder of how unexpected external shocks can have a significant economic impact on us. To improve our resilience to such shocks, a key strategy that the Government pursues is economic diversification. This entails the diversification of our economic structure, our markets and our supply sources.",2,31,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00031
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"First, we have diversified our economic structure across different sectors. For example, we kept the manufacturing sector at 20% of the economy and developed a range of clusters within the sector. We have also kept our services sector diversified, growing modern services like information and communications, alongside trade-related ones like wholesale trade.",3,32,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00032
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Hence, even though the COVID-19 outbreak is expected to significantly affect the tourism and transport sectors, other sectors such as construction, and information and communications are projected to continue to grow and support our overall economy.",4,33,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00033
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Second, we have diversified our export markets to enhance our resilience to market-specific shocks and downturns. We have expanded our network of free trade agreements to give our companies access to a wide range of markets. In this way, we are plugged into growth markets, without being overly reliant on any single market for our exports. No single economy accounted for more than 15% of our domestic exports in 2019.",5,34,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00034
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Third, our economic agencies work closely with companies to diversify the sources of supply for materials, manpower and food.",6,35,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00035
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Our companies’ supply chains have been put to the test in recent weeks due to disruptions in China’s industrial activity. While the impact varies from business to business, companies have indicated that they are generally able to cope with the disruptions because they have existing inventories or alternative suppliers. Most companies have also been able to manage the manpower disruptions arising from the travel restrictions and quarantine measures implemented in China and Singapore to contain the spread of the virus.",7,36,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00036
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"As for food supplies, we have not seen significant disruptions arising from the situation in China, due to our effort to buy from different sources over the years. The Government also retains some domestic supply of critical necessities to mitigate any overseas supply disruptions. For instance, we stockpile rice, personal protective equipment and pharmaceuticals during peacetime, and we also have local manufacturing capabilities for other items such as noodles and masks.",8,37,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00037
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Overall, our strategy of economic diversification has helped to enhance the resilience of our economy in times of crises, such as right now, during the current COVID-19 outbreak. MTI will continue to work with our businesses to improve the resilience of our supply chains by buying our inputs and essential supplies from different countries, and building up local production capacity where possible and where it makes economic sense.",9,38,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00038
2020-03-04-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Tin Pei Ling.,1,39,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00039
2020-03-04-T-004,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Sir, I thank the Senior Minister of State. I have two questions. Firstly, in the nearer term, we see the COVID-19 expected to be on a more prolonged basis and we see other countries also experiencing runs on some of the essential supplies for their populations. So, even though for now, we are able to cope with the supplies such as groceries, but with the other countries also experiencing it, how will this affect our current supplies?",1,40,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00040
2020-03-04-T-004,,,"– but for many of the products that may have many layers of processing, other countries are still highly dependent on this single-source country. So, as we diversify, how likely are we able to succeed in this endeavour, given that it also depends on the other countries and their responses as well?",1,41,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00041
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, Ms Tin's first question on supplies, we are looking at all the key essential supplies, making sure that we have sufficient diversity in our supply sources. That is the best way to deal with this situation. We cannot quite control what is happening in other countries.",1,42,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00042
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"There is no global shortage of food supplies, for example. There is still enough. In certain places, they do have panic buying that have resulted in some of the situations that the Member has described. But we are confident that if we look at our overall situation – a combination of stockpile of essential items plus diversified supply sources – I think we will be okay.",2,43,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00043
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The main thing is that for our situation domestically, we must also keep calm and do not have panic buying. Because no matter how much you stockpile and how diversified your supply sources are, if there is panic buying, no amount of stockpile will be enough. So, that is one of the key things to be able to deal with this situation. It is to stay calm, buy what you need, but do not panic and there will be enough for everybody.",3,44,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00044
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The second thing we need to do is to make sure that in certain critical areas, we are able to also advise people on the proper usage of the various supplies, for example, masks. Like other countries, WHO, the US, the UK and recently, France as well, the governments and health authorities have advised the population that you only need to wear masks if you are unwell. Otherwise, personal hygiene, especially hand hygiene, is still the most important.",4,45,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00045
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Therefore, by doing this, you are able to prioritise the use of mask for healthcare workers, for patients, for frontline workers, the people who need it most. This is the best way to keep the whole community safe, collectively. So, that is what we have been doing in Singapore as well; consistent with the practices, as advised by WHO and by many of these other jurisdictions.",5,46,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00046
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Ms Tin's second question is about supply chain, and I think if I understand the Member correctly, she is saying that a lot of countries today are linked to certain supply sources like China. So, whether it is directly or indirectly, the supply chains are interconnected.",6,47,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00047
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"This is definitely true because we are in a global economy, and no country can be totally isolated when it comes to its supply chains, its market. But it is an issue of to what degree is your exposure. For example, we take tourists. For Singapore, 20% of our tourists come from China. Yes, it is a sizeable group, it is our largest group of tourists. But we are, compared to some other countries, still better off because some of them have 50%, 60% or even higher. So, it is a matter of degree.",7,48,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00048
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"I do not think it is possible to be completely delinked from any major economy in the current environment. So, definitely when something happens in one of the major economies – could be China, could be somebody else – there will definitely be an impact on Singapore. But it is how we manage it by having a sufficiently diversified set of supply sources and markets, that will help us to be able to ride through these ups and downs in a more robust and resilient manner.",8,49,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00049
2020-03-04-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure I have heard the Senior Minister of State answering Question No 5. Could I ask him to answer Question No 5 again?",1,50,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00050
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I have answered Question No 5.",1,51,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00051

2020-03-04-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Could I clarify with the Senior Minister of State, is the Government going to consider nurturing a certain amount of domestic manufacturing capacity for critical necessities in products like medical disposables?",1,53,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00053
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, as I said, I have answered Question No 5 earlier. I think if Mr Dennis Tan had listened carefully, I did talk about the domestic production capacity for essential items and also stockpile.",1,54,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00054

2020-03-04-T-004,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Mr Speaker, I will just like ask the Senior Minister of State, whether given the current COVID-19 situation, we recognise that indeed food supplies is something that is very important and very critical. We have our plans for 30-30. I think that is ambitious plan, but given what has happened, my question to the Senior Minister of State is whether the Government should review this 30-30 plan, that maybe it should be a 30-25 plan, for example. In fact, 30-30 is already very ambitious, but in the current COVID-19 situation, as it has borne out, I think the importance of building up some local supplies become even more critical. So, perhaps we should do a review and see in what way we could accelerate the bringing forward of the timeline.",1,56,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00056
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I thank Mr Seah for his question. As he correctly pointed out, 30-30 is already a very ambitious vision. It is a stretch target. And we certainly want to work towards that; not so much because we are focused on one number but it is really about resilience. It is really about having diversified sources of supplies, including local production. But I think, Mr Seah being in the retail business would be very familiar, that it is not possible for us to be self-sufficient in many items.",1,57,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00057
2020-03-04-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"So, in addition to local production, which is one of the strategies, the other important strategy is to be able to diversify our import markets so that we are able to import from a wide range of countries, a wide range of different suppliers.",2,58,2020-03-04-T-004-S-00058

2020-03-04-T-006,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"However, I believe that more can be done to ensure that all our children are given a good start in life. In a recent house visit, I saw two boys standing on the kitchen counter-top and another running around and their great grandmother chased him with a cane. The great grandparents in their late 70s are caring for three boys, age eight, nine and 10. The father has left the family and their mother is a Grab driver. She could not afford much time for them. The seniors told me that it has been difficult as the boys get into disciplinary issues in schools and after-school care. How can the UPLIFT programme identify students and families who need help?",2,70,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00070
2020-03-04-T-006,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"Can the Minister provide an update on our UPLIFT efforts, including how MOE is strengthening after-school support and counselling support to tackle the challenges faced by disadvantaged students.

2020-03-04-T-006,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Sir, recently, I met a PE teacher from a school that participates in the UPLIFT programme. He shared that there were occasions where his students did not attend regular classes but would make the time to attend his soccer training sessions instead. Ordinarily, such students would have been barred from taking part in CCA, but what was done here was different and, in my view, ""uplifting"".",1,72,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00072
2020-03-04-T-006,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The teacher used the contact time during the training sessions to develop deeper relations with the students and encourage them to improve their class attendance. This changed approach appears to have worked. Quite clearly, though, a lot of effort has to be put in to change the mindset of the students and, on some occasions, their parents too.",2,73,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00073
2020-03-04-T-006,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),May I please ask the hon Minister what are the main problems her colleagues face in the task of ensuring these students under the purview of UPLIFT reach their true potential? What strategies have she and her colleagues identified to overcome these problems? How can we motivate these students to stay the course and how can the rest of the society help?,3,74,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00074
2020-03-04-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Chairman, there are many ground-up initiatives in the community to support children from underprivileged families. In Jurong, for example, we have stepped up our efforts over the years. Two years ago, we started the Jurong Central Student Assistance Scheme or SAS, that helps students from families that receive financial assistance from the Social Service Office. We provide $40 to $50 vouchers per month for each student when they to join SAS with parental consent.",1,75,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00075
2020-03-04-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"These students are mentored by trained volunteers in the areas of life skills, social skills and leadership skills. If these students are underperforming in their academic studies, we will provide them with free tuition. To-date, 50 students from more than 30 families have benefited from the scheme for the last 20 months. We have managed to get two donors to donate more than $250,000 over five years. We hope to share and scale this scheme.",2,76,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00076
2020-03-04-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"This is why I was excited to hear about the UPLIFT Community Pilots started by MOE. My experience working with the SAS recipients has shown me that it is not enough to provide financial assistance to students from disadvantaged families. We need to dive deep and understand the needs of the students and families, and provide necessary support like mentorship, so as to monitor, guide and to encourage the students to be the best persons they can be.",3,77,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00077
2020-03-04-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I believe MOE's UPLIFT efforts are also in the same spirit, with the aim of providing support holistically to children and families in need. To do so, it is important for us to strengthen and coordinate our efforts across agencies and community partners for these students.",4,78,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00078
2020-03-04-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"As more than a year has passed since UPLIFT was first announced, I would like to ask MOE for the progress update.

2020-03-04-T-006,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Last year, a set of guidelines for meaningful school-home co-operation was released, so parents and schools can work together to enhance children's development.

If not, what else needs to be done and if yes, what positive signs have we seen? Character building, learning to learn, becoming a better person – all these are much more challenging than scoring straight As.",5,84,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00084
2020-03-04-T-006,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"To take this forward, MOE should build strong partnerships with parents, industry partners, and the community to develop the values, dispositions and skills that will place our students in good stead for the future.",6,85,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00085

2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Chairman, Sir, let me start with Ms Denise Phua's question. Ms Phua asked if MOE has a transformation map. Two years ago, we launched something like that. We launched a reform movement of the education system and we called it ""Learn for Life"". But Members are probably not very familiar with it because we did not launch everything we want to do with a big bang, so no big headlines. Instead, we paced out the announcement of each thrust of the movement, adopted multi-year implementation plans, so that schools, parents and students can fully understand the changes and can adapt to these.",1,91,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00091
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Today, let me do three things. One, I will give a short update on what we have done so far. Two, I will talk about the new things we are doing – yes, we are doing some new things. Three, I will tie them altogether.",2,92,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00092
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),Let us start with a progress update. We have rolled out four thrusts to improve the system we have today.,3,93,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00093
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The first is nurturing the ""Joy of Learning"". Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Lim Biow Chuan have asked for an update on this.",4,94,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00094
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Joy of learning does not mean schools should be just all fun and games. Joy comes from purposeful learning, from a sense of progress and fulfilment by doing something challenging, hard and meaningful. Then, you feel a sense of accomplishment and you get joy from that.",5,95,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00095
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"A major move is the changes we are making to the PSLE scoring system. We will grade students in wider bands, what we call Achievement Levels, as opposed to differentiating them very finely through today's T-scores. We hope this will change the psychology of students and parents towards PSLE and reduce the over-emphasis on academic results.",6,96,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00096
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The new scoring system, its biggest impact, actually, is that it will affect Secondary school postings and parents are naturally anxious. We will help students and parents familiarise themselves with this new system.",7,97,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00097
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Sometime later this year, we will release simulated cut-off points under the new PSLE scoring system for selected Secondary schools. This will be based on last year’s Secondary One Posting Exercise and PSLE results. Next year, we will release another set of simulated cut-off points based on this year’s Secondary One Posting Exercise results. So, two sets of simulated cut-off points before the system goes live in 2021. But please remember these are simulations. It is not that these are definite cut-off points. There can be changes from year to year, as choice patterns change. And when the system goes ""live"", cut-off-points can change further. Notwithstanding this, we hope that by giving parents information early, we can better support them in making Secondary school choices for their children.",8,98,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00098
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Another major move is the reduction of school-based exams. All Primary schools have removed exams for Primary 1 and 2. This year, 60% of Primary schools would have no Primary 3 and 5 mid-year exams. By next year, it will be 100% based on our implementation schedule.",9,99,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00099
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As for Secondary schools, all have removed Secondary 1 mid-year exams. This year, more than 90% will be removing Secondary 3 mid-year exams. By next year, it will be 100% too.",10,100,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00100
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Some schools, such as the School of Science and Technology (SST), have removed mid-year exams for Secondary 1 to 3 in one shot.

They said with the time freed up, they can now do interesting hands-on stuff like coding, designing robots, making prototypes and so on.",11,101,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00101
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"With more freed up time, other schools such as Gan Eng Seng Secondary introduced a programme called the Learning Fortnight.

2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"However, in general – I will be honest – I think the responses have been varied. When I speak with Primary school students, most will say, ""Hooray, fewer exams"", so they are very happy. But many Secondary school students told me they are not happy; they prefer to have mid-year exams. It may surprise you but it is true. They say, ""Now, without the mid-year exams, we have all these continuous mini-assessments throughout the year. That is more stressful!"" So, I told these students that they have gotten used to exams, which is why we have to change.",13,103,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00103

2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, focus on learning throughout the year, rather than cram your studies and ""mug"" just before exams; that is a less effective learning habit.

2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As Mr Lim Biow Chuan pointed out, many students and parents have deep-seated mindsets about exams – not easy to change.

2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Indeed, as the Member has said, the stakes of exams are high actually because of admission into the next level of education – from PSLE to Secondary school, Secondary school to Polytechnic or Junior College (JC).",18,108,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00108

They observed the students, identified those with leadership skills and initiative, and after the camp was all over, they appointed them as class leaders.

2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"This requires schools and families to complement each other's efforts. Families can provide an immersive MTL environment at home. Then, schools carry on the work, starting with kindergartens putting stronger emphasis on the teaching of MTLs in pre-schools, which we have started to do.",46,136,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00136
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We have also introduced targeted programmes. In Primary schools, we introduced a Mother Tongue Support Programme for Primary 3 and 4 students who have a weak command of MTL. Last year, 60 pilot schools enlisted 1,100 students. It will be fully rolled out to all schools in 2021.",47,137,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00137
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"For students who are strong in MTL, we introduced the Language Elective Programme (LEP) in 15 Secondary schools this year. The Programme supports students to attain a higher level of MTL proficiency and acquire a better understanding of their culture. About 250 students took it up, which is an encouraging start.",48,138,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00138
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"It also helps to have specialised schools, like the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools and programmes like the Elective Programme in Malay Language for Secondary Schools (EMAS) and the National Elective Tamil Language Programme (NETP).",49,139,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00139
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In other words, let us not shy away from doing what it takes to preserve the use of MTLs. The world is moving towards bilingualism, even multilingualism. We have an advantage because of our ethnic diversity and bilingual abilities. We must not only preserve this advantage, but strengthen it further.",50,140,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00140
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),Let me move to the next part of my speech today – the new things MOE plans to do. They have to do with curriculum – what we teach and how we teach.,51,141,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00141
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We need to refresh our curriculum to evolve with the needs and realities of the times. But any changes to curriculum must be very carefully considered. It shapes the values, attitudes, mindsets and competencies of an entire generation. It gives meaning to MOE's mission of ""moulding the future of the nation"".",52,142,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00142
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"For example, we introduced Values-in-Action (VIA) in 2012 to foster social responsibility amongst young Singaporeans. Today, you can see its imprint in our young Singaporeans, in the way they look at social issues. I do think it has an imprint.",53,143,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00143
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As Dr Intan and Mr Ang Wei Neng pointed out, events like the COVID-19 outbreak also offer a valuable opportunity in education. Schools today are placing strong emphasis on personal hygiene and on social responsibility. If we keep all these practices up, even after the crisis has blown over, I think we will have a generation of Singaporeans who will be much more resilient to infectious diseases.",54,144,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00144
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Today we face new challenges and realities that necessitate a refreshing of our curriculum.

2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I will start with CCE. I thank Dr Intan, Mr Zainal Sapari, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Yee Chia Hsing for asking about this. There are a few components to our CCE today, such as the teaching of values, National Education, Social and Emotional Learning, and Education and Career Guidance.",56,146,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00146
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In 2016, we started a comprehensive review of the CCE curriculum. The more we progressed in the review, the more we thought it in urgent need of change. Why is that so?",57,147,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00147
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Because the young today are different from previous generations in one major aspect, which is their exposure to technology. For those who follow comics and watch superhero movies, they are like Bruce Wayne, who is also Batman – one day, one night. They have one real world that parents can see and another one online, which they spend a lot of time on, that parents do not see. As adults who have grown up without this duality and without this space, I do not think we fully understand what our young are going through.",58,148,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00148
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The impact of technology on students and on children is complex and multi-faceted. But let me just highlight one of the most significant effects, which is that technology presents children with the influences, choices and decisions previous generations never had to contend with.",59,149,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00149
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In an online world, you can be anonymous and there are no policemen, no editors, no verifiers. A child can choose to be nasty and then get away with it. Whereas in the real world, it is not easy to say something nasty to your friend in the face; a punch can come back. In fact, sometimes there is nothing very social about social media.",60,150,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00150
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"More importantly now, with a powerful device in their hands, our children can decide  do I use it to acquire knowledge for learning, or access undesirable materials? Do I use it to keep in touch with family and friends, or get addicted to digital entertainment? Do I use it to record beautiful memories, take pictures with my friends or intrude into the privacy of others, or worse, commit a sexual offence?",61,151,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00151
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"How do we ensure that our young make the right choices and survive well in an online world? I think digital world problems require analogue world solutions. It goes back to our values, our morals, our humanity. Values are what distinguish us from computers and machines, and that we cannot abdicate to technology. We apply our moral and values system whether we are offline or we are online. We determine the purpose of technology, we determine the purpose of devices.",62,152,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00152
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Dr Intan said that values are more often caught than taught. I think both are needed. Families play a big part in instilling them in the young, at home. But schools can then work with parents and make a big difference too. We need to update the CCE curriculum to reflect this imperative and reinforce the teaching of values in our children from as young an age as possible. So, we will build on the existing CCE curriculum and strengthen it with the following five changes.",63,153,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00153
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Number one, we will restructure formal CCE lessons to reinforce the teaching of moral values. Today, CCE lessons cover both character and values, and also citizenship. For Primary 1 to 3, we will henceforth devote the bulk of CCE lessons to character and values. As the Chinese saying goes, ""品德在先，学术在后"" – values before academics. We will emphasise respect and care for others, honesty, humility and kindness. They must also learn resilience and courage. Our children need to learn to stand up against discrimination, against bullying – of all kinds and regardless of who the victim is.",64,154,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00154
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Many of these lessons will be taught in MTL from Primary 1 to 6. We will therefore better align the CCE and MTL lessons – ensure that the standard of the language is appropriate and engage students in much more interesting ways. From Primary 4 to 6, we will broaden the existing Form Teacher Guidance Period to include National Education and citizenship topics – values relevant to us as a nation. For these topics, it is more meaningful to have a diverse group of students from all communities and therefore, these classes will continue to be taught in English.",65,155,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00155
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The second change, we will place more emphasis on cyber wellness. We will devote more time and develop more materials to teach this subject, so that students will learn to critically evaluate what they read online, be able to tell genuine news from falsehoods and not rely on social media ""likes"" for validation. They need to be able to say no to bad influences, and protect themselves from cyber bullies and predators.",66,156,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00156
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Several Secondary schools – in fact, 11 – have piloted the new CCE curriculum on cyber wellness. I visited one of them – New Town Secondary – and observed a class on the topic of cyber bullying. This was conducted via a video case study and students were asked at every juncture of the story to vote and decide how the story would unfold. So, they could tell how their decisions affected the outcome of the story. I could tell the situation resonated with them and the students were very engaged.",67,157,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00157
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"To me, the lesson that day was quite clear. The lesson is  if you encounter cyber bullying, seek help and support, do not retaliate. That day, the students voted for retaliation, even though I was sitting there! And the ending did not turn out well. This is one way we are using more authentic scenarios, immersive modalities and giving students more voice and agency to bring CCE to life – not just for cyber wellness, but for all aspects of CCE.",68,158,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00158
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The third change, the CCE curriculum will have greater focus on mental wellness, which is closely related to cyber wellness. We already teach students socio-emotional competencies today. The new CCE curriculum will seek to strengthen one important aspect, which is peer support. Second Minister Indranee will speak more on this topic.",69,159,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00159
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Fourth, we will expand our efforts to engage secondary school students more actively on contemporary issues through CCE lessons.",70,160,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00160
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"This is already done today. We will explore more topics, find ways to engage students more deeply and increase the frequency of these lessons to at least once a fortnight.",71,161,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00161
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Climate change, as Miss Cheng Li Hui and Mr Yee Chia Hsing suggested, could be one of these issues. Other examples could be Government policies, social inequality, race and religion, online falsehoods and so on and so forth.",72,162,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00162
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Leon Perera suggested including a subject like Theory of Knowledge (TOK) into our school curriculum. MOE is quite reluctant to over-crowd our curriculum. It is already quite a heavy curriculum, especially given that TOK is a pre-university subject for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.",73,163,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00163
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Some of these contemporary issues and the discussion of them will help hone the critical thinking skills of our students. They may be sensitive to discuss, but they are important to help our students better understand the complexities of our country and our life. MOE will develop the resources and methodologies. Teachers will guide students to listen attentively, converse respectfully and be open to differing perspectives.",74,164,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00164
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Finally, given the expansion of the CCE curriculum, we will need to have more time to teach it. We will have to, as Miss Cheng Li Hui suggested, further integrate CCE into school lessons and activities, such as CCAs, camps, learning journeys and Values-in-Action.",75,165,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00165
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"With these changes, every school experience can be a CCE lesson. Every teacher can be a CCE teacher. And every school a good school, of course. It should become a whole-school approach. This is happening in some schools, but we will implement it system-wide, be more deliberate about CCE and make learning intentional rather than incidental.",76,166,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00166
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),The new CCE curriculum will be progressively implemented from 2021 in all Primary and Secondary schools.,77,167,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00167
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The second area of curriculum review is Knowing Asia. Several Members, such as Ms Foo Mee Har, Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Teo Ser Luck, have explained why this is important. Suffice to say that Southeast Asia is one of the fastest growing regions in the world. Together with China, India, Japan and Korea, they all form part of our natural hinterland.",78,168,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00168
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Singapore-based enterprises need to be able to venture out to the region. And Singaporeans must be able to play a part in it. To do so, we need to be equipped with the relevant knowledge, language and cultural skills. But, like all skills, it takes many years, even decades of experience, to become a country or a regional expert. What the education system can do, is to get our students started young and expose them to the region. As a start, we will do this in three ways.",79,169,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00169
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, through our Humanities curriculum.

2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"For example, in history, students will learn more about the Vietnam War and how developments in Southeast Asia is intertwined with the complexity of the Cold War. In Social Studies, students can learn about the importance of ASEAN centrality.",81,171,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00171
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Second, we will leverage overseas trips. Overseas trips have taken a backseat due to COVID-19 but I am sure, in time, the crisis will blow over.",82,172,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00172
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The younger ones in schools attend student exchanges, cultural enrichment or embark on service learning projects. The older ones in IHLs typically go for overseas internships and immersion programmes in a foreign education institution. These have been effective in building their cross-cultural skills, resourcefulness and resilience. Students generally enjoy overseas trips, but I think their favourite destinations are still New York and London.",83,173,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00173
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We will organise more trips to Asian countries and encourage students to participate in them. Students from the West are flocking here to experience Asia because of the cultural diversity and the exciting economic opportunities. Our students should do so, too. This is our own backyard and, here, we will always have a natural competitive advantage. We will need that mindset shift that Mr Teo Ser Luck talked about.",84,174,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00174
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng in the Budget Statement, our aspiration is ""70-70"". I would like to assure Mr Saktiandi Supaat that the target includes our ITE students. This means to have 70% of IHL students undergo an overseas stint and with 70% of that going to ASEAN, China or India. Today, the numbers are about ""50-50"". So, it is not an exclusive experience, as Mr Faisal Manap puts it. But there is room to do more.",85,175,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00175
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Third, we can know our region better through the learning of languages. A good start is to learn our Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) better. Where possible – I keep coming back to learning MTL better – and if the students have the aptitude and interest, we will also encourage the learning of third languages. For most students, this will be at a conversational level and it is not examinable.",86,176,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00176
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, to Mr Chen Show Mao’s suggestion – I know the Member has been raising this every year – that MOE make the learning of conversational Malay compulsory in Primary school, I think it is better that we continue to emphasise the learning of a student’s own MTL. As it is, many students are already finding that quite challenging. But we have been encouraging students to learn the language of another community at a conversational level. Today, about 60% of Primary schools and 40% of Secondary schools offer Conversational Malay and Chinese. We are encouraging more schools to do so and more schools will do so.",87,177,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00177
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"There is also value for our young to learn to converse in regional languages, as Members have suggested. We will pair the learning of conversational ASEAN languages with overseas school trips. MOE will start with Vietnamese and Thai. That way, learning is more meaningful and can be immediately applied and more students can access it.",88,178,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00178
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The third area of curriculum review is digital literacy.

I do not have to explain this.",89,179,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00179
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"But what are the responses? One popular response around the world is ""Let us make coding compulsory in schools!"" But that is too simplistic. Not everyone will grow up to be a coder. Many of us just need to learn how to use technology and software and be comfortable with using them. Further, programming languages will become outdated by the time the students graduate.",90,180,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00180
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Another popular response is, ""Let us give every student a digital device"". It is not a bad idea, but it can do more harm than good if the device becomes another gadget that is a big distraction for the student. So, if we want to do this, we must do it in the right sequence – make sure that the curriculum is rightly designed, teachers are equipped with the suitable pedagogical skills, then use the device to enhance teaching and learning.",91,181,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00181
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We need to think about digital literacy more deeply and holistically, rather than simply implementing immediate things that come to mind.

This will be taught through the cyber wellness component of the new CCE curriculum that I spoke about earlier.",98,188,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00188
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The second component is “Think”. This is the ability to manage, analyse, interpret and understand data and then solve problems systematically. These are skills largely found in what we call computational thinking. But we do not need a new subject called computational thinking. The elements are present in existing subjects, especially Mathematics, where there is a strong focus on problem solving already. What schools can do is to explicitly draw out the learning points from Mathematics.",99,189,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00189
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Let us take an example – the teaching of prime numbers. I hope Members remember what prime numbers are. A prime number is one that is not divisible by any other number. Today, teachers typically explain the process to identify prime numbers as follows  for a set of numbers, say one to 100, cross out one, then the teacher will say, ""Then, all the higher multiples of 2, cancel off; then all the higher multiples of 3, cancel off; we skip 4 because it is divisible by 2; and then we go to 5, you skip 6 and go 7 and, finally, what you are left with are prime numbers."" All of us went through that, right?",100,190,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00190
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In future, to be more explicit about developing computational thinking, teachers can challenge students to write a simple program to follow that same logical sequence. Through such an exercise, students learn various programming structures, such as loops and conditions. One common programming logic is  ""if, then, else"". So, applied to this example, if a number is a multiple of 2, then you take it out, it is not a prime number, or else you retain it as a possible prime number and you loop back and you try with 3 and then 5, 7 and so on. With this, the already renowned Singapore Mathematics curriculum has received another upgrade!",101,191,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00191
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The third and biggest component is ""Apply"". We need to teach students to use software and devices productively to learn to work for daily living across different contexts. A major initiative in this area is the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS). This is a dynamic online learning portal. Almost the whole of our curriculum is on SLS, complete with animation, interactives, videos, assessments and other resources.",102,192,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00192
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"To Mr Chen Show Mao's question, we started building it a few years ago, way before there was COVID-19. The idea is not to make students learn completely online and not have to go to school. The quality and outcomes of e-learning will never be the same as a physical learning environment with teachers, friends, CCAs and a social setting. Neither are we using SLS to make the classroom high-tech and futuristic.",103,193,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00193
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"What we want to do is to use SLS to enhance the classroom experience. Let the technology fade into the background, and let the interaction, thinking and discussion come to the fore. Flip the classroom, give students more voice, make learning become collaborative. Then students are more likely to internalise the lessons and achieve better education outcomes.",104,194,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00194
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, we got eight schools to start a pilot project where teachers conducted lessons using SLS and gave every student a personal learning device to access the SLS portal and we learned many things from this pilot project.",105,195,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00195
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, teachers cannot teach the traditional way. They need new pedagogies – e-pedagogy. I witnessed some of these lessons. They are nothing like the lessons that I went through as a kid.",106,196,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00196
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"At Orchid Park Secondary, I saw how a Mathematics teacher, Mr Marwin Low, used SLS to teach students about angles within a diagram. So, after the students logged on to SLS, they were shown a quadrilateral on screen. The students could drag each of the corners and change the shape and size of the quadrilateral. But no matter how they manipulated the diagram, a display at the side will show that the addition of all the interior angles was always 360 degrees. The concept is presented visually and it is very clear.",107,197,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00197
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"They were then presented with various tasks, which they had to solve and use SLS to key in their answers. Students can remain anonymous and give themselves nicknames. They could also see each other's answers, comment on them or pose questions. In this online space, anonymity is put to good use as the students experience a much higher level of psychological safety in learning, as Prof Lim Sun Sun puts it.",108,198,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00198
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The teacher could monitor the answer given by every student in real-time, through a heat map. If the heat map is filled with green dots, it means everyone got the answer right and the lesson carries on. If it is all red dots, it means everyone has got it wrong, and the teacher had better re-teach the concept. If it is mostly green with some red dots, it means that some students need coaching and the teacher will know who they are and can intervene accordingly.",109,199,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00199

I asked her how she managed to make her MTL lesson interesting and engaging. She said she used digital technology. In her case, she incorporated her students' interest in photography into the lesson.

2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"A second important insight from this pilot is that to conduct e-learning, it is very useful for every student to have a personal learning device. Device sharing makes learning sub-optimal. A device is as essential for e-learning in a digital learning classroom, just as paper and pen are for a traditional classroom.",112,202,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00202

The pilot schools have effectively addressed this through device usage control. It can access educationally meaningful sites on the Internet, but online games and Korean dramas are out. It will also monitor students’ use of the device and where they have gone to. Some students are naturally disappointed with the limited functionality of their devices, but it is a necessary thing to do. It is consistent with a common school practice where mobile phone usage is disallowed during school hours.",113,203,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00203

The second structural change is to phase out streaming and replace it with Full SBB.

Senior Parliamentary Secretary Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim will share more about this in his speech for MSF later this week.",18,313,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00313
2020-03-04-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Beyond affordability, families face other challenges. For example, some may require their children to head home after school to look after their younger siblings or grandparents. Others may need help with the documentation needed to apply for financial assistance. Such complex challenges can only be surfaced and addressed through deeper, more personal, engagement with these families.",19,314,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00314

2020-03-04-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Second, we will engage the community to help address each family's challenges in a holistic and targeted way.

2020-03-04-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Finally, we will make the enrolment process and application process for SCFA more user-friendly. For example, teachers will walk families through the various documents that they have to submit and guide them through the process, if needed. For families with complex circumstances, schools will exercise judgement and be more facilitative in the enrolment of children into the SCC.",23,318,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00318
2020-03-04-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"We piloted this outreach approach in a few Primary schools in July last year, because we wanted to see whether it would make a difference. I was struck by the passion I saw in our teachers, who went out of their way to engage families, understand their challenges and work with the community to address them. They visited the students’ homes – multiple times in some cases. They conducted tours of the SCC for the students and induction sessions for parents, because we want to get the parents on-board to make sure the parents send their children to the SCCs. And I am most heartened to announce that we successfully enrolled 87 of the 100 students that we identified for the pilot.",24,319,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00319

The four siblings received limited support at home, as their mother was busy taking care of three other younger siblings. I think we are all familiar with cases like this. Adam and Danial, in particular, had longstanding difficulties with completing homework on time.",26,321,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00321

As the SCC at Boon Lay Garden is run by Big Heart Student Care, a joint venture by the four Self-Help Groups (SHGs), the brothers also enjoyed plug-in programmes run by the SHGs, like the ""Backyard Science Workshops"" run by MENDAKI. The oldest sister, Nadia, also benefited from the SCC staff’s reinforcement of positive values and habits taught by the school. In recognition of her improvement, Nadia was awarded the school’s ""Good Progress Award"" last year.",27,322,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00322

Those who are aged 40 and above can receive further subsidies of up to 90% under the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy. It does not matter if they are employees, self-employed or in between jobs. For employees who are sent for training by their companies, their employers will typically cover the post-subsidy course fees. For others, like freelancers, they would pay the 10% co-payment on their own, and they can use their SkillsFuture Credit for the out-of-pocket costs.",38,374,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00374

We will add to these by expanding the career transition programmes, as suggested by Dr Lim Wee Kiak. Individuals will be trained before they receive career support services, such as advisory and placement from CET centres. There is less certainty of placement compared to Place-and-Train, but this provides greater flexibility in the eventual choice of job. It also allows us to train more individuals in industry-relevant skills to enhance their employment prospects and offer employers a job-ready candidate at the point of placement.

My last question is an appeal to extend the special school years for all of the SPED students – not just those who are currently allowed to study until 21, but for all of them to be able to stay until the age 21.

2020-03-04-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The first clarification Ms Denise Phua had was – how come it is $5,000 for the SEN Fund for those with social and behavioural conditions instead of $25,000? Currently, under the SEN Fund, eligible students with physical impairment can tap up to $5,000 on the SEN Fund. So, it is pegged to that. Eligible students with visual or hearing loss can tap up to $25,000 and that is because for those with visual or hearing loss, the expenses are higher for them in terms of the assistive devices, that is one; as well as the services.",2,477,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00477

Those are generally more expensive than other types of devices. And also, supporting services. For example, hearing loss. You may need somebody to do sign language and then you obviously have to cover that. And for the blind students, sometimes you need note-taking services.

The school has developed an individual transition plan for each student, working with the students, the care-givers and the family, and the idea is really to help them to be able to cope when they leave school.

So, just really going a bit deeper about if these Queen Bees are going to be schools of the industries, how are they going to be governed, how are they going to be funded, and the quality control about the programmes.",2,488,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00488
2020-03-04-T-006,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Chairman, I thank Ms Foo Mee Har for her two supplementary questions. For the first, she is right that because we offer so many different kinds of courses, it is useful for people to get some advisory, some guidance. If I take this course, what are some of the pathways that may be open to me? What are some of the outcomes that I can benefit from? This is going to be done through two channels, mainly. The first one, of course, we are going to do it through the portal. So, the portal will be enhanced to be able to provide some of this information based on the individual's profile, needs, and make some recommendations.",1,489,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00489
2020-03-04-T-006,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"But we understand that some Singaporeans will want a more face-to-face interaction, because they are then able to interact with the advisor, they are able to get some guidance to point them in the right direction. So that is why we are going to work through the SkillsFuture Advice. But this time round, we will go beyond the community, which is what we have been doing for the past few years, to work with the career centres. This will be in collaboration with MOM, Workforce Singapore and also with our unions. And as I mentioned earlier, also with private sector entities that can come in and provide some of these advisory services on a commercial basis.",2,490,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00490
2020-03-04-T-006,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Through this process, we hope to be able to supplement the support that we give to individuals and help them to make those decisions.",3,491,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00491
2020-03-04-T-006,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The other point that I will just mention briefly is that part of having a closer linkage between training and employability, where we also have to curate the quality of the training courses. And that is also what we will do in the next bound – to further raise the quality of the training providers. That is going to be one of the key priorities too.",4,492,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00492
2020-03-04-T-006,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Ms Foo Mee Har's second question on Queen Bees. This is work in progress. We have lined up some companies but every sector is different. Some Queen Bees, like in the case of SP Group, are there because they have many links with suppliers and contractors in the sector. So, they are able to then influence what these SMEs do. Because these SMEs, many of them are their suppliers, their contractors. But in some cases, it is not quite like that. The people who are participating and the SMEs may not be direct contractors or suppliers, but they are part of the industry.",5,493,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00493
2020-03-04-T-006,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"So, the model needs to be customised depending on which Queen Bee company we are working with, which sector we are working on. But I think the fundamental principle remains that what we want is to be able to have these Queen Bee companies to take the lead and work with us as partners, to be able to raise the training opportunities and resources available to other companies and workers within the sector.",6,494,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00494

2020-03-04-T-006,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun,"I first have a clarification. I would like to find out if there will be greater effort to introduce social emotional training for teachers so that there is greater self-awareness on the part of teachers, and that they better understand how they relate not just to their colleagues but also to their students, so as to build a healthier classroom environment.",2,497,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00497
2020-03-04-T-006,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun,"The second is a comment on the device ownership scheme. I appreciate that there are many virtues to personal device usage in schools, but there are also certain pitfalls that we need to think about. Previous research has shown that device ownership actually involves many components, including device purchase, device maintenance, software maintenance as well as software usage. And families are clearly differently advantaged in being able to provide the guidance. So, I have found in my own research that parents from less well-heeled backgrounds face severe inadequacy and severe anxiety in terms of their inability to support their children in this way.",3,498,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00498
2020-03-04-T-006,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun,"In other words, unless we have very concerted, very comprehensive support and augmentation within schools for IT support for students from different backgrounds, you may find that some of these introductions of device usage may introduce different kinds of inequalities. So, I hope due attention can be paid to this issue.",4,499,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00499
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Prof Lim Sun Sun talked about microaggression yesterday. I do not think it is widespread. I do not deny that sometimes it can happen, but I do not think it is so widespread that we have to roll out a national training programme for our teachers. Where teachers cannot control their anger or in the rare occasions that it happens, I think they ought to be counselled. Over time, as they gain experience, they will have more patience and have the skills to handle difficult situations as opposed to losing their cool. I think actually all of us need those kind of skills. But it does not mean we get angry all the time.",1,500,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00500
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for the second question on the device, these are practical issues we really have to look at on the ground, which is why before we roll out any national programme, we always pilot it first. We have piloted in these eight schools and all these issues the Member raised happened, all happened – Wifi kept dropping, all these things happened. But with the experience that we have gained so far, these practical problems can be resolved and we make sure they are resolved before we roll out nationally.",2,501,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00501

2020-03-04-T-006,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,"Third, I have not spoken it in this Committee of Supply but I have spoken about this before. It is good that we are strengthening the support for students with SEN in our schools. Are there plans to recruit more AED(LBS) because at the moment, there are only one or two AED(LBS) to cater to 80% of our students with special educational needs. My son is one of them. I hope that there will be a lot more AED(LBS) because it will certainly help our students with special education needs in the mainstream schools.",4,506,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00506

It is not just online and courses. One important modality for teachers when they learn is to do so in a professional community, learning from each other. You can make use of online platforms but teachers appreciate that the most, when professionals can come together and learn from each other. We have to fully leverage on that.",2,509,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00509

I cannot agree more with Minister Indranee that we need a whole child and whole school and an ecosystem to address students' mental well-being. So, I have two clarifications.",1,512,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00512
2020-03-04-T-006,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"The first one is that a clear big piece within this eco-system in addressing students' well-being, mental well-being, particularly, would be the parents. I am wondering how and when are parents engaged by the schools for a student in distress, and also if we are including parents in the mental health education that we are introducing in some way. I also wonder if one way could be reaching these parents through their employers and that there might be an inter-Ministry initiative with MOM, given the announcement in terms of the Workplace Mental Health Advisory.",2,513,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00513
2020-03-04-T-006,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"The second clarification is, does the Ministry have, or if not, does it intend to have a clear and robust Suicide Prevention strategy in schools, especially given the record number of teenage suicides that we had in 2018 that was announced last year?",3,514,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00514
2020-03-04-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I thank the Member for her clarification. The Member is correct that the parents are actually a very important part of this, and our teachers do engage the parents, especially when the teachers find that their child has a mental health issue. So, the plan to engage parents is very much a part of it.",1,515,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00515
2020-03-04-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"When the Member refers to a suicide prevention strategy, actually, that strategy is the peer support network or the programme that I talked about.

And if it is not too big an issue, the friends can provide support, then that is great. But if it needs a little bit more than that, then you would want to bring it to the attention of the teacher. And the teacher can resolve it, that is fine, but if not, you may have to go to the professional counsellor. And then, from the counsellor, you may have to go to specialised external service providers. So, you can see that it is one layer after another layer, but all to have a protective environment around a student who has got mental health issues.",3,517,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00517

2020-03-04-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"First, we are glad that MOE is providing generous bursaries for students at the Polytechnic and also Universities. We also note that at the University, especially, the tuition fee has been increasing year after year for the past. I do not know whether MOE is continuing with this policy of increasing the tuition fee every year. If it is so, then will the bursary also increase year after year?",2,519,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00519
2020-03-04-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The second clarification is that we are glad that that AUs are taking 2,800 ICT students this academic year. It is about two, three times more compared to the past. Does the Minister have a breakdown of these ICT students by the six Universities? And also, whether the Universities are working with the industrial players to co-create a curriculum, so that the skill-sets acquired by all these students will be matched by the demand of the industry?",3,520,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00520

For Polytechnics, the Government fund about 85%. And then, for University, the Government funds about 75%. Today, we are pretty much there for most courses. Some courses are still out of whack, so over time, we may need to adjust. But for most courses, we are pretty much there.",1,521,2020-03-04-T-006-S-00521
2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"From henceforth, we need to adjust fees from time to time in order to reflect cost inflation.

2020-03-04-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for breakdown of ICT students, I do not have the numbers but a lot are coming from NUS, which has been really beefing up and ramping up their courses. Because the courses, the places, are ramped up so fast, you cannot really get sufficient professors. So, you actually have no choice and, just as well, we rely a lot on practitioners. Indeed, this is very valuable. With their experience, the students gain skills that are very relevant to the market.

Rigorous enforcement should be conducted and heavy penalties meted out to offenders.",1,674,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00674
2020-03-04-T-007,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"I would like to ask for the latest available statistics for this offence and whether the trend is improving or worsening. What has been done to curb high-rise littering and whether the Ministry will be deploying more advanced technology or investigative techniques, such as identification through DNA? Could the Ministry also leverage more on the sense of shame, such as by increasing the visibility and duration of the Corrective Work Orders, to punish these high-rise litterbugs?",2,675,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00675
2020-03-04-T-007,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Chairman, amidst this COVID-19 outbreak, much has been said about social responsibility and public hygiene. From Town Councils to offices, disinfection and constant cleaning has become the norm. This crisis affords us the opportunity to also reinforce the importance of social norms, such as in our hawker centres.",1,676,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00676
2020-03-04-T-007,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"For a number of years now, we have been promoting the concept of tray returns. Gradually, we have seen better response. Yet, we also see many previous innovations fall into disuse. In many older hawker centres, you see automated tray-return belts that have been switched off; coin-return machines that do not work; tray-return stations becoming manual stacking stations for cleaners.",2,677,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00677
2020-03-04-T-007,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"At the same time, the role of the tray is also very much temporary. Many remove their trays out of habit and place dishes onto tables. There is also a socially irresponsible behavior, such as the spitting of food waste and bones onto table surfaces, not just during COVID-19, but on any other day. This should be discouraged. Cleaners often do not have the adequate tools nor training to properly clean. Often, the same cloth is used. And one does not need to leave much to the imagination that the same food waste spat out onto tables ends up being smeared across the entire table.",3,678,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00678
2020-03-04-T-007,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I, therefore, ask that MEWR and NEA promote the usage of trays while dining and not remove the tray itself. This way, the tray catches any spillage as well as any food waste or oral fluids. This means that conservancy contractors should also be incentivised to sterilise trays after each use. This reduces the workload of cleaners, promotes a clean hygienic eating environment and reduces the spread of diseases.",4,679,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00679
2020-03-04-T-007,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"To further achieve this, the design of hawker centres will also have to adapt. Some older hawker centres still use round tables, which are not conducive for the use of trays unlike rectangular tables in newer centres. Beyond COVID-19, I hope that this will promote better hygiene and social norms in Singapore.",5,680,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00680

This will certainly help to alleviate the difficulties experienced by our hawkers due to the reduction in business from the COVID-19 outbreak. Many of these hawkers are worried about the outbreak deepening and prolonging, especially with the news of the virus spread in other countries. The spread will increase the risk of new imported cases from different sources.

We will ensure that only novel foods that are safe for consumption are introduced in Singapore. Last year, SFA implemented a new regulatory framework to require companies to seek its approval and undergo a scientific pre-market assessment before placing novel foods in the market. This framework facilitates the sale of alternative proteins in Singapore while ensuring their safety. Companies, such as local start-up Shiok Meats, who is looking to produce cell-cultured shrimp, will be able to benefit from this framework.",72,796,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00796

As the Government, we are providing leadership in tackling climate change. We do this by enhancing our climate pledge under the Paris Agreement and working with the industry to guide their transformation to a low-carbon economy. While the Government can lead on sustainability, the people must champion its cause.",81,805,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00805
2020-03-04-T-007,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For instance, Singaporeans can make conscious climate-friendly choices in our daily essentials, such as food. Locally-produced food is of high quality, incurs less carbon miles, lasts longer and tastes good. By eating local, Singaporeans are making an environmentally sustainable choice. In the process, we support our farmers by choosing food that is grown in Singapore.",82,806,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00806

They are amongst the top three highest energy-consuming household appliances today. However, many households continue to purchase 1 to 2 ticks refrigerators, partly due to the higher upfront costs of energy-efficient models, without considering the savings from electricity consumption over the long term. Similarly, showering takes up a significant proportion of water consumption, yet many households are choosing the less water-efficient fittings.",87,811,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00811

When we started our journey as a nation, our founding fathers gave us a vision of being the cleanest and greenest city in Southeast Asia. Even for this, we were inspired to do it together. Mr Lee Kuan Yew said in 1968 at the launch of the inaugural ""Keep Singapore Clean"" campaign, ""For only a people with high social and educational standards can maintain a clean and green city"". And he went on to say, ""Only a people proud of their community performance, feeling for the well-being of their fellow citizens, can keep up high personal and public standards of hygiene.""",110,834,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00834

To Mr Chen Show Mao's question, it has been a busy and successful year. We engaged more than 670,000 Singaporeans and together with our 3P (People, Public and Private) partners, organised almost 2,000 Zero Waste programmes and activities.

We believe that we should take a pragmatic approach and find an inclusive solution that works for Singapore and Singaporeans, taking into account our local context. For example, degradable bags provide little benefits in Singapore as we incinerate all our household waste. On a life cycle basis, single-use paper and degradable bags also consume large amount of resources like water and land. Hence, instead of pursuing a substitution strategy, we should focus on inculcating the right values.

But the issue here is that we are going to take too long to review it, which is we have committed to increase it by 2030. So, to tackle this emergency, can we look into reducing the time frame, which means can we at least look into increasing it by 2025, which is five years' time instead of 10 years?",2,922,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00922

The example I raised in my cut is the German Institute of Economic Research that showed that this type of company level disclosure will result in a 17% reduction in carbon emission. So, what is holding us back from doing something that will help to reduce emissions here in Singapore?",3,923,2020-03-04-T-007-S-00923

Surely, there are many other things that have nudged or transform these companies to achieve reduction in the GHG emissions.

We are injecting huge numbers into the community. So, apart from the effectiveness of the technology, we are also mindful, as Mr Louis Ng had mentioned, of the disamenities that residents may suffer from suddenly having millions and millions of mosquitoes in their neighbourhood.

Therefore, we are happy that they have now expanded beyond Singapore shores. For example, Apollo has got concessions now in Brunei, Barramundi Asia too, as well as some other of our fish farms.

2020-03-04-T-008,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Chairman, let us first look at the Budget allocation for MND. This year, MND's budget will grow by 22.2%, or $4.46 billion. Increase is mainly attributed to the public housing development programme and higher spending for SERS and upgrading. Can the Minister provide some details on the new projects to be funded?",5,976,2020-03-04-T-008-S-00976
2020-03-04-T-008,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In addition, I note that the CONQUAS score for HDB flats in 2019 saw a drop of 3.5% to 88.5%, compared to 2018.

In line with that, can we better promote more local talents in the construction industry?",6,977,2020-03-04-T-008-S-00977
2020-03-04-T-008,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I, and perhaps many Members of this House, have seen fewer cases of residents appealing for flats. Those who do usually have more complex circumstances. It is therefore a reflection of how our housing policy has improved. But there are still some who need more help or better options. What more can MND do to help home-seekers access their flats quicker?",7,978,2020-03-04-T-008-S-00978
2020-03-04-T-008,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"With the open booking of flats, it has afforded Singaporeans who want quicker options to select and book their flats.

2020-03-04-T-008,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I would like to return now to a topic that I have spoken of often – the monetisation schemes and support for our elderly homeowners. I am especially happy that the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) has been extended to all flat types. Last year, MND organised an intense round of outreach across Singapore. Many of these roadshows were led by Minister Lawrence Wong himself. This was to raise awareness on the LBS.",9,980,2020-03-04-T-008-S-00980
2020-03-04-T-008,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I would first like to ask what has been the sign-up rate for 2019, and if the roadshows have helped to increased understanding and also encouraged more to take it up.

2020-03-04-T-008,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),Another group that I have spoken about every year has been support for vulnerable families and individuals.

2020-03-04-T-008,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"For elderly Singaporeans who wish to age in place, some have also indicated that they prefer additional services such as ""assisted-living"" facilities.

2020-03-04-T-008,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),Another topic that I have been passionate about is how our redevelopment and rejuvenation cannot be at the cost of our heritage. Many of our buildings have been lost over the years in the name of progress and better land use. I applaud the Ministry's efforts in recent years to better protect our built heritage. I would like to urge MND and the National Heritage Board (NHB) to work together to do more to ensure that our heritage as well as the soul of these buildings are not lost.,18,989,2020-03-04-T-008-S-00989

This has generally resulted in smaller flats being constructed. I have observed at recent Edusave Merit Bursary Awards ceremonies in my constituency that there seems to be more families with more children, that is, three or more. These families usually have a domestic helper or live with grandparents, so extra rooms and more living space are needed.

2020-03-04-T-008,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"First, I wish to highlight that the void decks of new BTO blocks are no longer functional. Residents living in these new blocks can get lost walking in their own void decks. The number of pillars and walls have literally transformed the new void decks into a maze, forcing residents to use the service road in the estate. This is certainly a safety concern for residents who need to cut across the precinct to get to their destination daily.",3,1026,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01026
2020-03-04-T-008,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"Furthermore, due to the maze-like design, void decks, chairs and tables have become hidden in secluded corners in these new BTO blocks.

In the two new BTO precincts in Hougang, the Town Council had to build extra ramps, footpaths and stairs, in addition to the few designated access points, in order to facilitate the safe movement of residents on the ground. Although it is human nature to take shortcuts, the planner should look into providing a more barrier-free integration of the new precinct to the surrounding built-up of areas at the design stage. This will benefit residents on mobility aids or with baby prams, as it is really not easy to navigate the maze-like void deck of new BTO blocks just to use the designated access point.",5,1028,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01028

To facilitate better planning for both individual households and HDB, would the Ministry consider allowing HDB to share information at the beginning of each year about the planned BTOs to be launched in the next one to two years?

These could be cats roaming at corridors, defecating, scratching cars, caterwauling, irresponsible cat feeding and so on. Some residents are bothered by what the cats do, some are just afraid of cats, while others just do not like them. On the other hand, there are many cat lovers who spend their own money to buy cat food and go around the estate feeding them every night.",4,1154,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01154

2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, we will extend our nature park network. Today, we have more than 350 hectares of nature parks, which act as complementary habitats and buffers to our nature reserves to protect them from the impact of urbanisation. This is important as the nature reserves are the richest sources of our natural capital. They contain our primary and secondary rainforests and core habitats for our native biodiversity and wildlife.",2,1189,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01189
2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In all, we will dedicate another 200 hectares of nature parks by 2030. This is two-and-a-half times the size of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Singaporeans can look forward to more places, such as the Rifle Range Nature Park for nature-based recreation, such as hiking and bird watching in future.",3,1190,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01190
2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Khatib Bongsu is a rich mangrove and mudflat habitat on the north-eastern coast of Singapore. I have kayaked there with NParks and our nature community volunteers a number of years ago. It is one of the few good mangrove habitats left in Singapore and I am happy to announce that NParks will also be establishing a 40-hectare nature park there.,4,1191,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01191

2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, we will naturalise more waterways and water bodies in our gardens and parks. We have done this in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and Lakeside Garden, where we transformed concrete canals into natural rivers. We will incorporate such designs in all our coastal and riverine parks. This will also help to protect against sea-level rise and flooding.",7,1194,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01194
2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Lastly, we will conserve important native plants and animal species. Some of our world's most unique biodiversity call our tropical island home. Singaporeans would have encountered rare native species, such as the Singapore Kopsia, on the left, and tiger orchid, on the right, and this is because of our restoration efforts. In fact, the tiger orchid is the largest orchid in the world. It can weigh a few tonnes each.",8,1195,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01195

We aim to nearly double the skyrise greenery footprint in our buildings and infrastructure to 200 hectares by 2030. We will focus on greening our industrial estates. These are amongst some of the hottest areas on the island – hottest in terms of temperature.

In fact, we have been planting Nature Ways since 2013 and, by 2030, we aim to have 300 km of Nature Ways and 500 km of park connectors. With these, all households will be within a 10-minute walk from a park and, over the long term, where feasible, we aim to make every road a Nature Way.",12,1199,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01199

I was standing next to an elderly lady, who was there with her grandson, and they were participating with neighbours and friends in planting the Nature Way. It was along one of the roads. After they had shovelled soil around their sapling, I could not help but overhear this elderly lady asking someone to help her take a photograph of her and her grandson next to the sapling. She told her grandson in Mandarin, ""Boy, let us take a photo. Remember where we planted this tree. Next time, when Ah Ma is gone, come and visit the tree with your family.

In fact, more than 200 stakeholders have already pledged their support to plant more than 120,000 trees. This includes companies on Jurong Island, Keppel Corporation, the National University of Singapore, OCBC, Shimizu Corporation, United Parcel Service (UPS) and many other community groups, organisations and individuals. I am encouraged to see that everyone is doing their part to keep Singapore green.",21,1208,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01208
2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We also want Singaporeans to be more actively involved in the design, development and programming of our parks. Over the next five years, Singaporeans can join in the designing, building and management of 50 new and redeveloped parks, as my colleague Minister Lawrence Wong had announced recently. This includes signage design or promoting park etiquette, and partnering our gardeners to do landscape planting. It is one thing for a park to be built near you; it is another for a park to be built near you in which you have had a hand in designing, conceptualising, building and literally knocking the nails into some of the furniture for the park and planting the trees. It also gives a sense of ownership, custodianship and stewardship of the green spaces around you.",22,1209,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01209

2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Various Members asked about on-going efforts to rejuvenate our CBD and the city and progress of MND's work over the year.,25,1212,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01212
2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We aspire to be amongst the leading cities in the world, where people want to live, work and visit. We have introduced the CBD Incentive Scheme for this purpose. A successful CBD must have a good mix of office spaces, a lively street life, with diverse offerings. To encourage the development of different neighbourhoods in the CBD, we introduced incentives for the conversion of older office buildings into residences and hotels. Interest and take-up have been encouraging and URA planners are working with interested building owners on this.",26,1213,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01213
2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have also introduced the Strategic Development Incentive Scheme to encourage commercial building owners to partner neighbours to comprehensively redevelop a few plots, where transformation is not limited to one building but a whole area along the street or precinct for the public to enjoy.",27,1214,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01214

2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But a leading city is nothing without its people and its soul – not just about buildings and shops, but one that reflects the Singaporean attitude of innovation, openness, daring and verve. Deputy Prime Minister Heng spoke about the spirit of partnership at the launch of the Singapore Together movement last year. At MND we embrace it and will do more to partner Singaporeans. Members have asked how we intend to do so.",29,1216,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01216
2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have private sector partners from 10 precincts all across Singapore on the pilot Business Improvement District programme (BID). The pilot BID programmes are making good progress. These stakeholders seek to take a people-centred approach in creating spaces that will draw people into them. For example, we saw The Lawn next to The Sail and Marina Bay Financial Centre being activated for the first time during the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown, and so expect many more such new initiatives in the coming year and months.",30,1217,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01217
2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Community feedback was key throughout the Draft Master Plan 2019 process. This is another example of how Singaporeans get involved in rejuvenating our city. We exhibited the plan in March 2019 after rounds of consultation, and gazetted it eight months later. We assessed each public feedback thoroughly, and incorporated ideas and suggestions where appropriate. I am confident that the plan has been made better because of our collective efforts and because Singaporeans cared and participated.",31,1218,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01218
2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Members asked about heritage and conservation of buildings to maintain the character of a city. As a city-state, we have to meet the national physical needs while retaining links to our past, retaining links to our national collective memory. And to-date, after a 30-year journey, we have conserved close to 7,200 buildings across our island, with some in the heartlands. Recent additions include the former Bukit Timah Fire Station, former Railway Station Staff Quarters and SCGS campus at Emerald Hill. In our conservation efforts, partnerships are key. And in the case of SCGS, a group of alumnae worked with stakeholders and the public to garner support for conservation.",32,1219,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01219

2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Sir, in the next bound of greening Singapore and energising our city, it is partnerships that are key – the commitment by Singaporeans across all walks of life to work together with us to imagine the next Singapore, to work hand-in-hand to keep our city green, to keep our city lively and buzzing.",34,1221,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01221
2020-03-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Apart from partnerships, we also have to thank many of our colleagues and officers who work assiduously behind the scenes to make this a reality. For example, the aborists, conservationists, botanists, scientists in NParks and Gardens by the Bay who dream of a yet more green Singapore and the city planners and innovators who think of ways to energise community partnerships in order to make our city that much more vibrant and exciting. We look forward to continued partnership with Members of this House as well. [Applause.]",35,1222,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01222

2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"Firstly, we are fundamentally changing the way that we build through DfMA. DfMA allows us to move on-site construction work into a more controlled working environment off-site, to prefabricate building components for on-site assembly. This way, construction becomes faster, cleaner, quieter, and of higher quality.",4,1229,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01229
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"For example, Teambuild, a local builder, achieved close to 37% site productivity gains for its Valley Spring @Yishun, a HDB BTO project by adopting Prefabricated Pre-finished Volumetric Construction (PPVC). Here, you can see a module being lifted, to be assembled just like Lego blocks, with the furnishings already fitted inside.

2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"Next on IDD. The digitalisation of the construction process will facilitate wider deployment of DfMA technologies. Building Information Modelling, or BIM technology, will allow our architects and engineers to design and build in a virtual setting first. This improves the accuracy of construction plans and reduces abortive works downstream. Now IDD takes this further, by leveraging technology to facilitate better collaboration amongst project parties across the building life-cycle, to coordinate production and supply chains, to build more efficiently, to improve building quality and to optimise operations and maintenance.",11,1236,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01236
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"For example, Guan Ho, a home-grown construction firm, has been using digital technology to track building components as they are fabricated, delivered and installed at Punggol Town Hub.

We will set aside $19 million to fund SMEs to adopt digital solutions that complement basic BIM software. SMEs will be guided to assess their level of digital readiness, and identify digital solutions that can benefit businesses. For example, site management platforms to plan and monitor construction activities, and facilities management software for operations and maintenance. SMEs can receive up to 70% funding for pre-approved solutions. SMEs can also use the Digital Roadmap on Training to identify digitalisation courses for employees.",13,1238,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01238

Our industry transformation efforts are not limited to improving productivity. As Deputy Prime Minister emphasised during the Budget, we must remake our city to meet the challenges of climate change. Buildings account for over 20% of our emissions. Green buildings are hence an important part of Singapore’s climate change mitigation strategy. Since the launch of BCA’s Green Mark scheme in 2005, we have greened more than 40% of our buildings by GFA. We are on track to meet our target of 80% by 2030. We also launched the Super Low Energy buildings programme in 2018, which goes beyond Green Mark Platinum standards.",14,1239,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01239
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"To share an example – Keppel Land and BCA are working together to transform the Keppel Bay Tower into a Super Low Energy building. The building uses innovative technologies, including a high-efficiency air distribution system and autonomous lighting control, to reduce energy consumption by about 20%. This is a good example of how existing buildings can achieve Super Low Energy standards. Keppel Bay Tower will be the first commercial building fully powered by renewable energy.",15,1240,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01240

2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"We are considering a few initiatives. First, to push for more energy efficient buildings, we intend to raise the minimum energy performance standards. This will lower emissions, and also benefit building owners over the building life-cycle. Concurrently, we will review our Green Mark certification standards, as highlighted by Mr Louis Ng. BCA will engage stakeholders to develop shared aspirations for sustainability standards in the Built Environment, and we need to work out how to get there in partnership.",17,1242,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01242
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"Next, we want to enable greater transparency in building energy performance. Today, close to 80% of commercial building owners voluntarily opt to disclose their buildings' names and addresses along with their energy performance data, which is published by BCA annually. We intend to identify all buildings when publishing the data henceforth, so that the best performing buildings will serve as role models to encourage others to improve their own energy efficiency. We will share more details by this year.",18,1243,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01243

Under the current BIM PCP, participants are trained in BIM while concurrently undergoing on-the-job-training with their firms. But some firms prefer BIM modellers who can contribute immediately upon hiring. To address this, we will allow participants to complete their full-time training first, before continuing with on-the-job training with their firms. So, on a full-time basis; they could be ready within three months instead of six or 12 months if they were doing it part-time. We hope that more firms will take up the enhanced BIM PCP, which will start later this year.

2020-03-04-T-008,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"Pet licensing is one of the measures that enables NParks to do so quickly. To make it more convenient for pet owners, NParks will introduce a one-time licensing for sterilised dogs by the end of the year. With one-time licensing, owners of sterilised dogs only need to apply to NParks for a licence once, instead of having to repeatedly renew their licence upon expiry. The licence, with a one-time fee of $35, will be valid throughout the life of the dog. This means that if you sterilise your dog and opt for a one-time licence instead of an annual licence, you could save over $800 in licence fees over 10 years. We hope that this will encourage more owners to sterilise and license their pet dogs. For existing owners with three-year licences for sterilised dogs, you will be happy to hear that your licences will automatically be changed to a one-time licence.",18,1295,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01295

Like the example I gave just now, even first-timers at the 30th percentile of household income, can purchase a new 4-room flat in a non-mature estate and service their housing loan with zero or very little cash outlay.",14,1329,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01329
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, for the vast majority of first-timers, the Singapore dream of being able to own your own home remains secure. We will make sure of that both now and in the future.",15,1330,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01330
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Of course, we also want to have more affordable flats in the mature estates and a wider range of flat options to choose from, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Chong Kee Hiong both spoke about this. But it is more challenging to do so in mature estates, due to the limited space for new flats in these estates. In some prime locations, the prices of resale HDB flats are beyond the reach of many young couples just starting out in life.",16,1331,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01331
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"And if this trend continues, it will mean that certain public housing estates can potentially become exclusive areas that only a few can afford and then this will lead to greater social stratification. So, we do have to do something about this. We cannot resolve this issue through our existing model of HDB flats.",17,1332,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01332
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"And that is why I have shared earlier that MND is working on a new model for BTO flats in prime locations. The basic idea is to sell these flats at more affordable prices, but the flats will come with tighter conditions imposed. This is a major change which we are studying and thinking through very carefully, as it will also have an impact on the resale market. We will continue to review it and we will share more details in the coming year when we are ready.",18,1333,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01333
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Besides affordability, we will also help Singaporeans to access their flats more quickly. Several Members like Mr Chong Kee Hiong and Mr Mohamed Irshad spoke about this.",19,1334,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01334
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We will continually review and improve our sales processes to achieve this. For new BTO flats, we give priority for those looking for their first home. That is why virtually all first-timer families have been successful within their first three tries for a BTO flat in a non-mature estate. We have also introduced BTO flats with shorter waiting times of two to three years, because we bring forward the construction.",20,1335,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01335
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Since last year, we have started sharing information on upcoming BTO sites six months in advance instead of just three months. We will try to do more, as suggested by Mr Gan Thiam Poh, but I am afraid it is not so easy to project forward for more than six months. It will be challenging to share this information too far in advance because there may well be unexpected changes along the way.",21,1336,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01336
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Some households may need a flat more urgently. That is why we also offer balance flats for sale, many of which are completed or near completion. Today, we have the Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) and, if there are still unselected flats after the SBF, we pool all of them together and we release them through what we call the Re-Offer of Balance Flats (ROF) exercises.",22,1337,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01337
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The initial take-up of the ROF flats has been positive. But we have received feedback and requests for the ROF to be done more frequently instead of just twice a year. So, last year, we tried putting out some of these unselected flats on an open booking system for people to apply all year round.",23,1338,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01338
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Now that we have some experience with this open booking system, we are ready to extend it further. So, we will do away with the standalone ROF exercises and, instead, the unselected SBF flats, after the SBF exercise, will be pooled and offered directly for open booking right away, without going through another round of balloting. This will enable home-seekers with urgent needs to access flats more quickly.",24,1339,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01339
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Effectively, with this change, there will be three main ways of applying for an HDB flat. With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I display some slides on the screen?",25,1340,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01340

So, that is our first priority to ensure affordability and accessibility of flats.",1,1342,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01342
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, we also support the diverse housing needs of different segments of Singaporeans. For needy households without other housing options or family support, we continue to provide them with public rental housing. Over the years, HDB has steadily increased the public rental supply. The waiting time is now less than two months for applicants who are not particular about location. For those who want specific locations, the waiting time may be longer, depending on availability of units in that particular area.",2,1343,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01343
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Several Members, including Ms Anthea Ong, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Dr Lily Neo, asked for bigger rental units and dedicated units for single tenants, and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun Xueling has also explained our thinking on this matter. We would, in fact, very much like to accommodate all of these requests. The key constraint we have is one of land supply.",3,1344,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01344
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We have to ensure that demand for both new rental and new sold flats in Singapore can be met on a sustainable basis, not just today, but over the coming decade and beyond. That is actually getting harder and harder to do as our island gets more built up. So, we do need to take a pragmatic approach.",4,1345,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01345
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For single tenants, as Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun has said just now, most are prepared to share and are able to live in a rental flat together. For the few with medical conditions, we are prepared to consider their requests on an exceptional basis and allow them to stay in a rental flat by themselves.",5,1346,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01346
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For families, especially with children, the majority already live in our 2-room rental flats and, for very large families, we do our best to accommodate them. For example, for multi-nuclear families, we can offer them two rental units in the same block. On a case-by-case basis, we will be prepared to offer larger families a 3-room rental flat.",6,1347,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01347
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ms Anthea Ong made the point about occupancy caps and I should clarify that these are caps imposed on HDB owners renting out their flats and the tenants who are renting these flats. The occupancy caps do not apply to family members living together, be it in their own flat or a public rental flat.",7,1348,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01348
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"At the same time, we will continue to support public rental tenants towards home ownership. Several Members also spoke about this, including Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Arasu Duraisamy and Dr Lily Neo. We have announced several measures on this last year and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has shared the progress on these initiatives.",8,1349,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01349
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For divorcees, we understand and recognise that their housing transitions can be stressful. To ease this process, we now allow divorcees to apply for flats earlier, once their Interim Judgment has settled matters concerning the children and matrimonial flat. But some concerns still remain. For example, Mr Louis Ng spoke about divorcees who are awarded shared care and control of a single child but are unable to agree on who can list the child in their flat application. We understand that such agreement is not always possible, especially if the divorce was acrimonious. When this happens, HDB will be prepared to consider waiving the mutual agreement requirement, if there is clear evidence that one party has already moved on.",9,1350,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01350
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Another group is unwed parents. Several Members also spoke about this, including Mr Seah Kian Peng, Mr Arasu Duraisamy and Mr Mohamed Irshad. We do want to ensure that their children have a stable home to grow up in. So, we will assist all unwed parents who approach HDB with their housing needs. For such cases, HDB will assess their situation holistically because their circumstances vary.",10,1351,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01351
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Some Members did raise the point that such a case-by-case approach may cause more uncertainty amongst the applicants because they do not know whether their applications will be successful. So, let me clarify the approach that HDB takes. Essentially, there are two broad approaches.",11,1352,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01352
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, for those who are in stable employment and who can afford to buy a flat, then HDB will allow them to buy a flat – not just a new 2-room flat but also a larger 3-room flat in a non-mature estate. Next, for those who have insufficient finances and need a place to stay, then we will continue to consider them for public rental if this is in their child's best interests, taking into account inputs from social workers, if necessary.",12,1353,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01353
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Yet another group that we support is our seniors. Many of them have their own homes but they are concerned about retirement savings. So, we will try to help them unlock the value of their flat if they need to in several ways. They can rent out their flat or spare bedrooms, they can right-size to a smaller flat, or they can sell a part of their lease to HDB under the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS).",13,1354,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01354
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We recognise that more needs to be done to help Singaporeans understand these different options, especially LBS, because it is relatively new and also because we have just recently extended the scheme to 5-room and larger flats, something that Mr Alex Yam, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Arasu Duraisamy highlighted. That is why we have been stepping up our public dialogues and engagements and I am glad to note that LBS take-up has doubled from 800 households in 2018 to 1,600 last year.",14,1355,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01355
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Through these engagements, we also receive feedback and ideas on how our schemes can be improved. One feedback is that the schemes can be quite complex and we can simplify them further. This is particularly the case for the Silver Housing Bonus (SHB), which comes with several conditions. So, having studied the matter, we have decided to simplify and enhance the SHB in three ways.",15,1356,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01356
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, we will remove the requirement that seniors must sell a larger flat and buy a smaller flat. Regardless of the type of flat they sell, seniors can apply for the SHB as long as they buy a 3-room or smaller flat and get some proceeds from the move. So, effectively, someone staying in a 3-room flat in a mature estate who wishes to move to a 3-room flat in a non-mature estate, and can get some proceeds from that move, will still be eligible for an SHB. A lateral move but because they are moving from a mature estate to a non-mature estate, they can unlock some proceeds and they will still be eligible for SHB.",16,1357,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01357
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, to receive the SHB, seniors must top up some proceeds from their move into their CPF Retirement Account. This is to ensure that they have adequate savings for retirement. The top-up required today depends on their net sales proceeds and we will simplify this such that seniors only need to top up the first $60,000 of their proceeds.",17,1358,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01358
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Thirdly, we will increase the maximum cash bonus by 50%, from $20,000 to $30,000. So, seniors will receive $1 in cash bonus for every $2 topped up to their CPF Retirement Account. So, if you have sales proceeds, you top up $60,000, you will get $30,000 in Silver Housing Bonus.",18,1359,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01359
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In line with this increase, we will also increase the maximum Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) bonus across all flat types. This means that owners of 3-room or smaller, 4-room, and 5-room or larger flats will get a larger bonus. The maximum cash bonus will be $30,000, $15,000 and $7,500 respectively.",19,1360,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01360
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We are also looking at alternative housing options for seniors. Last year, we shared that MND is working with MOH to pilot assisted living, which allows seniors to buy a flat along with care services. Mr Arasu Duraisamy asked about the status of this project.",20,1361,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01361
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Both Ministries have held several focus group discussions on the assisted living models. They were generally very well received by seniors, particularly singles and those whose children have moved out. Seniors were especially attracted to the idea of community living.",21,1362,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01362
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We have incorporated the feedback into our pilot. For example, this new pilot that we will be rolling out will have large communal spaces on every floor, not just on the void deck, but on every floor, where residents can gather and interact. The flats will be sized at 32 sqm, with senior-friendly features like larger bathrooms and a layout that can be easily configured for mobility needs.",22,1363,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01363
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We will launch the pilot with about 160 units in Bukit Batok in May this year. More details will be shared in the coming weeks, including the sales conditions, indicative flat prices and the payment options.",23,1364,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01364
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We also want to make public housing more inclusive, especially for persons with disabilities and mobility issues, something which Miss Cheryl Chan highlighted. We have made progress in this area in creating barrier-free access for all our HDB estates, but certainly more can be done. As Miss Cheryl Chan said, technology may well open up new possibilities. We thank her for her ideas and the Government will continue to study this issue.",24,1365,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01365
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"One area when it comes to barrier-free access is having lift access on every floor. Several Members have asked about this – Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Ong Teng Koon, and Mr Png Eng Huat. As Members are aware, there are still about 150 blocks that are not eligible for the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP).",25,1366,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01366
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To set things in context, we have managed to provide direct lift access for flats in the vast majority of HDB blocks. We have done so by using innovative technical solutions and by exercising flexibility for some blocks even when they exceed the cost cap of $30,000 per household. But for the remaining 150 blocks, for some of them, LUP is just not technically feasible, regardless of the cost. For many others, the costs are very high. So, it is not just about having some flexibility above the cost cap but we are talking about costs that can be more than $200,000 per household in some cases. As Mr Png Eng Huat said – enough to buy another HDB flat.",26,1367,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01367
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, we will continue to explore new technical methods to bring down the LUP cost, but it will not be so easy to make progress on this front. In the meantime, we know that some residents may urgently need direct lift access due to medical or mobility issues. And really, it is more cost-effective to help them move to another flat. Mr Png Eng Huat asked for SERS. I do not think we need to SERS the entire block. But what we will do is to offer a new Lift access Housing Grant of up to $30,000 to help those with medical or mobility issues buy a new or resale HDB flat with direct lift access. So, if anyone is in need and they need direct lift access, they do not want to wait, and the grant is available for them to move to a new place which will have direct lift access.",27,1368,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01368
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"A third priority for us is to continue to rejuvenate our HDB towns and keep them vibrant for generations to come, and we have many upgrading programmes. Let me start at the block-level.",28,1369,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01369
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Town Councils are generally responsible for regular and cyclical maintenance of common property, including building façades, and the Government supports the Town Councils for such work, so that the costs are not just borne by the Town Councils from their collections of service and conservancy charges (S&CCs).",29,1370,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01370
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, MND has provided additional grants to help Town Councils with their operating needs and long-term capital expenditure requirements, including for lift maintenance and lift replacement.",30,1371,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01371
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the issue of façade repairs, which Mr Pritam Singh asked about, HDB will bear half of the costs. But if the damages are clearly due to design or construction issues, HDB will cover 100% of the costs. On the specific case that Mr Pritam Singh asked about, we will get back to him quite soon, based on the PE's assessment of what the damages were due to.",31,1372,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01372
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Beyond the work of the Town Councils, there is Government upgrading through the Home Improvement Programme (HIP). We have finished selecting all flats built up to 1986 for Home Improvement. We are now ready to move on to the flats built between 1987 and 1997. There are 230,000 of such flats. This year, we will start with almost one quarter of that or 55,000 flats. We are starting with a bigger number to also help support the construction industry during this period. Town Councils have submitted their nominations for this next phase of HIP, and we will inform the Town Councils of the selected projects later this week and then work can get started as soon as we can. We are prioritising the selection by age, so that the older flats go first, and most flats should be able to get the upgrading when they are about 30 years old.",32,1373,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01373
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"It will take around 10 years to finish the HIP for this series of blocks built between 1987 and 1997. At around that time, our oldest HDB blocks will be about 60 years old and, if our Budget permits then, as we have said, we will initiate the second round of HIP, or HIPII, for these older flats. So, we will, almost every year be continuing with upgrading works.",33,1374,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01374
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides block-level programmes, at the precinct-level, we will refresh older precincts with new amenities through the on-going Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) and we will be selecting 20 NRP projects for implementation this year. In the past, we used to do about 14. Again, we have raised it to 20 projects, partly to support the construction sector.",34,1375,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01375
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"If there are new in-fill developments within an old precinct, then HDB, as the developer, will also provide for facilities to link up the old and new precincts, which is something that Mr Png has asked for. He expressed some disappointment with HDB design. I should say that HDB blocks are designed by a range of architects, not all by HDB. Many are designed by private sector architects. There are some by HDB. The architects take great pride in their work. We will let them know how Mr Png feels about their void decks which are maze-like and confusing. But I am sure they will want to take in feedback and continue to work on these designs to do better.",35,1376,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01376
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, at the town-level, we will renew existing towns through the Remaking Our Heartland programme (ROH). We have selected nine towns and estates for ROH so far. This year, we will select another four towns for ROH. They are Bukit Merah, Queenstown, Choa Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio. The remaking works that can be explored include refreshing of the town and neighbourhood centres, and enhancing of greenery and community spaces in parks or even areas under viaducts.",36,1377,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01377
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And we will do all of this refreshing and rejuvenating while strengthening the distinctive heritage and identity of our individual housing estates, something which Mr Teo Ser Luck and many others have highlighted.

We will also engage and work with residents closely in this endeavour so that we can remake our heartlands together.",37,1378,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01378
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HIP, NRP and ROH are our key upgrading programmes which we will continue to press forward with. At some point, as our flats and estates get older, we will need to more systematically redevelop and renew these older estates. That is why we have said that we will be introducing a new programme called the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS). We expect to roll out the first VERS project sometime after 2030. This is a major programme and we will need to work through the details. We will take some time to do so and we will share that with Singaporeans when we are ready.",38,1379,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01379

2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, we will work with Town Councils to introduce smart LED lighting in all our HDB estates. Using sensors, the system dims to provide just enough ambient lighting when common areas are unoccupied, then brightens again before residents enter an area. It is motion sensors but they are enhanced motion sensors, much better than what you have seen so far. It uses up to 60% less energy than normal LED lighting.",42,1383,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01383
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We will also harness more renewable energy to power common services in HDB estates. We are already installing solar panels on the rooftops of close to 50% of HDB blocks. You do not seen that very often because very few people see HDB blocks from the sky. But half of our HDB blocks today will have HDB panels on their rooftops. We will increase this to 70% by 2030. We will also deploy more efficient solar panels and aim to more than double the total solar power capacity on HDB rooftops, from 220 megawatt-peak (MWp) today to 540 MWp by 2030. So, this will provide clean energy for our common services in our HDB estates and, in turn, benefit our residents.",43,1384,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01384

2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Third, to help cool our HDB estates, we will deploy a new type of paint, called ""cool paint"", that can reduce the heat absorbed by buildings. Our preliminary studies suggest that such ""cool paint"" may be able to reduce ambient temperatures in HDB estates by up to two degrees. So, we will test this across several neighbourhoods to confirm its effectiveness before rolling it out across all estates.",45,1386,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01386
2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, we will also work with Town Councils and the community to convert the top decks of suitable multi-storey carparks into urban farms, community gardens or rooftop greenery. This increases green cover and provides more green spaces for all the residents to enjoy.",46,1387,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01387

2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Transport infrastructure is also key. We have set bold targets to move towards cleaner vehicles, including electric vehicles. On our part, MND will expand the necessary charging infrastructure. We will work with private companies to introduce more charging points at selected public carparks, taking into account the geographical spread of EV chargers, carpark usage, space availability for electrical upgrades and estate upgrading plans. Mr Ong asked for some details on this but we are still working through the detailed plans and we will share more in the coming months.",51,1392,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01392

2020-03-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We will also continue with our longer term plans to rebuild and remake our city for the future. Over the next 10 to 15 years, we will continue developing new growth centres outside the city centre to enhance Singapore’s economic infrastructure. We have plans in the East, in the West and in the North-East around Changi Airport; in the West around Jurong Innovation District and Jurong Lake District; and in the North with the Punggol Digital District as well as Sungei Kadut. In the longer term, beyond the next 10 to 15 years, we have major sites for redevelopment, as Members would be aware, including the Paya Lebar Airbase when the military airbase moves out and the Greater Southern Waterfront. These are ambitious, major long-term plans which will take several decades to realise. So, it is an opportunity for all of us to start imagining what a future Singapore can be and to work towards realising it.",53,1394,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01394

There will be unexpected challenges along the way. At the start of this year, no one could have predicted that we would be dealing with a virus outbreak today and that this virus outbreak would be potentially escalating into a global problem. It reminds me of what our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, used to say. He said this twice, on two occasions during his birthday dinners. He said, and I quote  ""Only a people who are willing to face up to their problems and be prepared to work with their leaders to overcome unexpected hardships with courage and resolution deserve to thrive and prosper.""",54,1395,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01395

2020-03-04-T-008,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"The first question  just now Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad mentioned that there should be no discrimination against foreign contractors. That one we fully understand. But I think the Minister of State has missed my point. I said local contractors felt that they were being discriminated against, not the foreign contractor. Why? Because they submitted the lowest tender, they did not get the job, they had been doing LTA projects. So, why do we pay $6 million to a foreign contractor which is registered in Virgin Islands and BCA, being the agency championing —",3,1400,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01400
2020-03-04-T-008,,The Chairman,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, I think you should make your clarification rather than repeat your speech.",1,1401,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01401
2020-03-04-T-008,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Okay. So, the first question is, can the Minister of State look into the discrimination of the local contractor. Second question, I mentioned about the contractor saying that the carpenters and tilers are no longer coming to Singapore. Can BCA look into this so that they can continue to have workers? And the third question is that, it is good that BCA has asked developers to help contractors, but then developers they have tight practical completion period and ABSD to comply with. Instead of just case-by-case basis that BCA will consider, is it possible to review these for this period so that they do not feel so much stress during this period.",1,1402,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01402
2020-03-04-T-008,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"And the fourth question, ABSD, can it be pro-rated? Currently, even if one unit is not sold, you have to pay up to 25% of the land cost.",2,1403,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01403
2020-03-04-T-008,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"And the last question, I would like to ask how many Polytechnic graduates currently join the construction sector. Because if I understood Minister of State correctly, he mentioned that they will be groomed to replace as S Pass holders. But as far as we understood, many of them, immediately upon graduation, they go overseas or head to a local University to get a degree instead of entering the workforce.",3,1404,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01404
2020-03-04-T-008,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"My question to Minister Grace Fu is that, it seems that there is a very efficient, high rate of solving the problems reported to MSO. I would like to know how is this being monitored. The feedback that I got from residents is that MSO is very keen to close the case very fast. And I tried that myself. So, in January, I took one photograph. I sent to MSO. Straightaway, they replied me, ""Thank you for your report to MSO. We will revert to the relevant work unit"". They consider that closed. I asked them a question, ""Can you take a photograph when the work is done so that I know that it is closed."" And then, no further reply. So, I think many of my residents have similar experience. That is why the feedback to me that MSO is very keen to close the case though the end result is not what we want.",4,1405,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01405
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,I am honoured to get five questions from Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.,1,1406,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01406
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"First, I just want to assure Er Dr Lee Bee Wah that the tender methods we use today follow the Price-Quality Method or PQM, so, it is not always guaranteed that the lowest price wins. It has to be on merit, based on the quality matrices. Unfortunately, specific to the tender, I cannot comment on LTA's evaluation because I do not have access to that particular tender. But rest assured, our approach has been about building our local firms' capabilities and giving them that chance. As I have said, you have seen more and more local firms accessing larger projects either on their own or through joint ventures. That is where you also pick up new capabilities, new skills and new technologies that you can use and apply to meet the kind of requirements that we have. For some of these projects, such as LTA tenders, I do understand. Some of these involving trains do have specific requirements. So, there could be certain technical requirements that were evaluated.",2,1407,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01407
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"But do not give up. Certainly, these are areas in which you have seen more and more local firms coming through; and certainly, we are giving more opportunities.",3,1408,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01408
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"If I could just share that between 2017 and 2019, local firms have been awarded a higher proportion of contracts, in terms of the smaller contracts between $3 million and $85 million. You can see about 90% of such contracted awarded to local firms. This enables local firms to build their track record.",4,1409,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01409
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"And you can also see that more are also being awarded larger public sector contracts over $85 million too. A decade ago, we used to have only a 40% proportion. Today, local firms have about 50% proportion. These are larger projects above $85 million. So, to some extent, we have seen progress. And I think it is good to see more local firms, as I have mentioned in my examples earlier, being able to take on these opportunities.",5,1410,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01410
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On carpenters and tilers, we looked into this. It is not easy to get foreign workers sometimes, especially with some skill-sets because it is not just about our environment here but also the environment there. Contractors tell me too, that in the past they could get ready access to Chinese workers; but as China develops, they are paying their workers more over there, and there is less impetus for them to come here. When more and more countries develop, there will be opportunities out there. Our carpenters and tilers are typically from Malaysia, and you will probably find younger Malaysians being more educated too. So, supply may come down.To some extent, it is more than just our local environment that causes some of these dynamics.",6,1411,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01411
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The Member asked earlier on about the Project Completion period. As I have mentioned, we will monitor this. So far, there are just a few appeals. Let us talk to the industry again and see how we can manage this better. And certainly for now, it is on case-by-case basis but we will continue to monitor the situation.",7,1412,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01412
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On pro-rating the ABSD, or the extension of remission timelines today, I think we can still discuss and negotiate. We understand the current situation. To some extent, we do not have to shift the whole mechanism or the whole system. But I think right now, the approach that we are taking is really on a case-by-case basis. If developers have difficulty meeting their ABSD obligations, we will take it on a case-by-case basis. Let us monitor and see how best we can help developers and builders cope with the current COVID-19 situation.",8,1413,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01413
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"It is not in our interest to make life difficult for our developers and builders. It is a growing sector and we do have long-term pipelines of projects that are being rolled out, not just in the public sector but also in the private sector. We want our local companies to be able to address them. We will help them as much as we can.",9,1414,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01414
2020-03-04-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On Polytechnic graduates, I do not have the numbers. Perhaps the Member would like to file a Parliamentary Question because what she is asking for is specific in terms of pipeline and graduates. So, maybe file a Parliamentary Question in due course.",10,1415,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01415
2020-03-04-T-008,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Chairman, I would like to address Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's question. I thank her for the question. MSO does monitor the time taken to close the case because it is our objective to ensure that we deliver good Public Service, good public municipal services in an effective and timely way. We look at the time taken and we pay particular attention to cases that take longer than usual.",1,1416,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01416
2020-03-04-T-008,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Having said that, we do not stipulate the service standards for each of the agencies because the nature of cases can be different. Some cases can be cleared quite easily. If there is litter that is not cleaned, someone can clean it up quite quickly. But if there is a request for public lighting to be installed, then obviously, the cases would take longer.",2,1417,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01417
2020-03-04-T-008,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We do recognise that even though service standards are not prescribed, public officers, knowing that MSO is watching, tend to want to do the right thing and try to close the cases as quickly as possible. In many of these cases, it is about giving a better reply. In cases where it is expected to take longer, such as doing maintenance in time, when we are doing a cyclical maintenance in three months' time or six months' time, we do want to go back and give the appropriate answer to the resident. If we give the appropriate reply, I think we can manage the expectations of the residents better.",3,1418,2020-03-04-T-008-S-01418

2020-03-04-T-010,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Yes. Indeed, NParks has not forgotten about birds. That is why, with the efforts of ICA together with NParks, they had seized the shipment of 815 birds that the Member mentioned. And I would just like to share that if you look at the number of illegal bird smuggling cases, it has been coming down over the years. In 2016, it was eight cases; in 2019, it was two cases, one of which was cited by Mr Yee.

Can I just ask Senior Parliamentary Secretary that the current rule is that you are not allowed to keep a cat in a HDB flat. So, how and when does HDB enforce this ruling, because a lot of the residents I see, most of the time is because they complained against a neighbour and the neighbour, then realises, ""Oh. You have a cat there. Now, I complain about the cat."" And the cat becomes a sort of collateral and then, they are forced to remove the cat.",2,1431,2020-03-04-T-010-S-01431

I am very thankful that we will exercise flexibility for those where one party has already has private housing. But could I ask further whether we can waive the mutual consent if both parties that have shared care and control are low income, meaning that both cannot really afford to buy from the open market and would need subsidised HDB flats?",4,1433,2020-03-04-T-010-S-01433

The HDB will investigate if the feedback is related to pet-related disamenities, and it is not that a cat is a collateral in bad relations between neighbours. HDB will investigate that the feedback is related to pet-related disamenities.

So, in a case where indeed, both have divorced, they have one child, it is shared care and control and each individual wants subsidised housing, today, the rule does not allow the child's name to be together with both parents.

I wish to thank the Minister, on behalf of the residents of Blocks 115 and 119 of Marsiling Rise for his kind and compassionate consideration of the situation with the introduction of the Lift Access Grant. I wish to ask the Minister whether such grant will be available to flat owners who have purchased the flat prior to the announcement today or will be available to subsequent owners as well. And if the granting of the Lift Access Grant will automatically enable them to buy a flat from the HDB or would they have to buy from the resale market? Can they sell the flat to the HDB or must they sell to the resale market; in which case, will future owners also be eligible for this grant?",1,1439,2020-03-04-T-010-S-01439

So, anyone who owns a HDB flat, regardless of whether you are first-timer, second-timer, nth-timer, but you are the owner of a flat and your flat does not lift access, and you have mobility issues, that is the condition. Then, we will help you get a new flat or a resale flat where there is lift access. And the grant will be extended to that owner to facilitate that transaction.",1,1440,2020-03-04-T-010-S-01440
2020-03-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"How to go about doing it? There are various ways. If the person wants a flat very urgently, then getting it from the resale market makes a lot of sense. If they want a new BTO flat nearby and if there are balance flats, HDB could consider allocating one, if there is a balance flat. But that depends on whether there is availability of such a balance flat nearby. So, it depends.",2,1441,2020-03-04-T-010-S-01441

Earlier in my speech, I asked whether there are assessments by HDB for applicants of Joint Singles Scheme (JSS) to ensure that they are free from mental illnesses and medical conditions before compelling them to stay together. May I ask Minister Wong whether he will look into the JSS for those who have no family members to share with. Because I also noticed that HDB always gives applicants a list of names for them to call themselves to choose their own tenants to share with.

JSS has been around for the last 30 years. So, why can we not tweak this to facilitate just the most vulnerable group in our society? Would he consider?",2,1445,2020-03-04-T-010-S-01445
2020-03-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Chairman, I thank Dr Neo for the suggestion. In fact, it has been tweaked, it has been evolving. JSS today is different from what it used to be, because now we have partitions, we provide more privacy, we give flexibility and anyone that comes with medical conditions with a reason that they need to stay alone, we are prepared to consider, we are prepared to be flexible and allow them to stay on their own. So, it is not a blanket no. We do provide flexibility for those with medical conditions and with exceptional circumstances to stay on their own.",1,1446,2020-03-04-T-010-S-01446
2020-03-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The reason why we cannot depart from this and say, ""Everyone live on their own now"", is the real constraint which I mentioned earlier. If we are going to double, triple the number of rental units that we have in order to accommodate them, because every JSS tenant wants to split up, we do not have land. That is a real constraint. So, there is no land available to build more. We have got to build new flats, we have got to build new rental flats.",2,1447,2020-03-04-T-010-S-01447
2020-03-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I hope Members understand. We are not trying to be hard-hearted about this. There is just not enough space to build so many more new housing units. We try to optimise where we can and as the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said just now, when we did a survey of JSS tenants, the majority of them do get along and are okay. We are dealing with a minority and we can manage that if they do not get along, if there are medical conditions. If they do not get along in the first instance, let us try to find ways to pair you up with somebody else. If you have medical conditions, then we will look at your case, and we will consider allowing you to stay on your own, if there is a need to.",3,1448,2020-03-04-T-010-S-01448

Just now the Minister of State mentioned that due to the change in their own country, that is why the carpenters and the tilers are not coming. That could be part of the reason but what we heard from the industry is that they are not coming to Singapore but they go to some other countries. That is why I urge BCA to study and see what is the reason they do not come to Singapore, so that we do not suffer if we do not tackle this problem now.",1,1455,2020-03-04-T-010-S-01455

But of course, if they go to other countries, then, basically, it could also mean that we do not pay well enough and other countries are also paying better.

As we have shared in many of our speeches earlier, even MOM in the Budget, that the Government is putting a bit of focus into mature workers to see how we can transform and move along.

2020-03-04-T-013,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister),"As mentioned in a recent response to Mr Louis Ng's Parliamentary Question on barriers to fathers taking paternity leave, our research showed that fathers' utilisation of paternity leave is dependent on workplace support, especially from supervisors and colleagues.

2020-03-04-T-022,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether, and to what extent, efforts are still being made to investigate the open cases against four companies under the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act initiated in 2015; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider giving whistleblowers some financial incentives to provide information leading to successful investigation and prosecution.",1,1521,2020-03-04-T-022-S-01521
2020-03-04-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Singapore enacted the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA) in 2014 to send a strong signal that we will not tolerate the irresponsible actions of errant companies, whether Singapore-based or otherwise, that harm our environment. In 2015, NEA issued legal notices under the THPA to six companies to take immediate measures to stop the fires that caused haze that affected Singapore. Two of the companies responded and explained that they were no longer associated with the affected lands. Upon further investigation, NEA accepted their explanation and closed these two cases. The cases against the other four companies are still open. If the directors of the relevant companies enter Singapore, they will be required to assist in our investigations. Action will also be taken against one of the directors who has an outstanding court warrant against him.",1,1522,2020-03-04-T-022-S-01522
2020-03-04-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The THPA is not a panacea or the only tool to fight transboundary haze. Although none of the investigated companies has been prosecuted yet, the THPA has nevertheless put added pressure on companies to behave responsibly. We have no plans to offer financial incentives to whistle blowers at this moment.",2,1523,2020-03-04-T-022-S-01523
2020-03-04-T-023,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,asked the Minister for Manpower in each year of the last three years (a) how many foreign domestic workers have been repatriated back to their home countries before finishing a two-year contract; (b) what are the top three reasons for their repatriation; and (c) how many of those repatriated are hired by an employer in Singapore within six months of their repatriation.,1,1524,2020-03-04-T-023-S-01524
2020-03-04-T-023,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Over the past three years, about 20% of foreign domestic workers (FDWs), or 49,000 FDWs, in Singapore return home without completing their contract each year. Of these FDWs, about 20% return to Singapore to work as an FDW within six months.",1,1525,2020-03-04-T-023-S-01525
2020-03-04-T-023,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The common reasons for FDWs to return to their home countries before the end of contract include  (i) family exigencies back home; (ii) employer found the FDW not suitable for the household; and (iii) FDW did not wish to continue working in Singapore.,2,1526,2020-03-04-T-023-S-01526
2020-03-04-T-024,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many of the 30,000 or so Chinese workers returning to work in Singapore are in dormitory accommodation; and (b) what arrangements are in place to ensure that workers who are subject to Stay-Home Notices are effectively segregated from other workers who are not subject to the Notice, be it in their assigned rooms or in the use of common facilities in the dormitories such as bathrooms, canteens, shops, or recreational or open areas.",1,1527,2020-03-04-T-024-S-01527
2020-03-04-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"A big majority of the Chinese work pass holders who travelled to China over the new year period have yet to return to Singapore. This is because of MOM's strict requirement for their employers to seek prior approval, to ensure an orderly flow and enable effective enforcement of the Stay-Home Notices (SHN) upon arrival. An average of 220 applications have been approved daily. Upon their return, all the workers are expected to serve the SHN. Those found to have wilfully flouted the SHN have had their work passes revoked and permanently banned from working in Singapore. Employers who were non-compliant have also had their work pass privileges suspended.",1,1528,2020-03-04-T-024-S-01528

2020-03-04-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In line with the advice from the public health professionals, persons who are on SHN need not be segregated. Nevertheless, MOM informed dormitory operators to take additional precautionary measures to minimise contact between persons on SHN and their other residents. Residents on SHN would thus reside in a section of the dormitory that is separate from the other residents. Food and daily necessities are provided so that there is no need for them to leave their room, except to seek medical attention.",3,1530,2020-03-04-T-024-S-01530
2020-03-04-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Apart from specific measures for residents on SHN, MOM has also advised dormitory operators to cease mass activities, stagger the use of common facilities, and manage residents who have mild flu-like symptoms by isolating them and seeking medical attention immediately.",4,1531,2020-03-04-T-024-S-01531
2020-03-04-T-025,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development since the shift of early intervention services from MSF Disability Office to Early Childhood Development Agency (a) how many children aged below 7 with developmental needs have been (i) declined for enrolments or (ii) expelled by preschools; and (b) how is the Early Childhood Development Agency supporting families with children with developmental needs secure preschool placements.,1,1532,2020-03-04-T-025-S-01532
2020-03-04-T-025,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Today, many young children with developmental needs are enrolled in a preschool. Three-quarters of children aged five to six who are enrolled in the Early Intervention Programme for Infants & Children (EIPIC) are also enrolled in preschools.",1,1533,2020-03-04-T-025-S-01533
2020-03-04-T-025,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There is a range of support available within preschools for children with developmental needs. For example, about 550 preschools offer the Learning Support and Development Support programmes, which cater to children with learning and mild developmental needs respectively.",2,1534,2020-03-04-T-025-S-01534
2020-03-04-T-025,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"However, some preschools may find it challenging to cater to a child with moderate to severe developmental needs. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) receives feedback on a few such cases per year. Where needed, ECDA works with parents and stakeholders such as SG Enable, EIPIC centres and preschools to find a solution that meets the needs of the child. This includes engaging the parents and the preschools to better understand the child's needs, and arranging for the preschools to work with EIPIC centres to adopt appropriate strategies to support the child. ECDA may also refer the child to suitable preschools which are better placed to support the child’s development.",3,1535,2020-03-04-T-025-S-01535
2020-03-04-T-025,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Government is continuing to enhance support for children with developmental needs in preschools. For example, we introduced the Development Support-Plus (DS-Plus) programme last year to cater to children who have made sufficient progress under EIPIC and are able to transit to receiving intervention in a preschool setting with added support. Under DS-Plus, early intervention professionals from EIPIC centres work with the child in his or her preschool up to twice a week, co-teaching the child alongside the preschool teacher. We have also set up the Inclusive Preschool Workgroup, which will develop recommendations on how to better support children with moderate to severe developmental needs in preschools.",4,1536,2020-03-04-T-025-S-01536
