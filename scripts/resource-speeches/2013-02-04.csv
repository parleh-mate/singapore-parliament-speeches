2013-02-04-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked  the Minister for Health (a) how many elderly Singaporeans are currently suffering from hearing impairment and have sought treatment at Government clinics as compared to three years ago; (b) how many of them require a basic hearing aid; (c) what is the average cost of a hearing aid; and (d) whether the Government will review the use of Medisave to pay for these hearing aids.,1,6,2013-02-04-T-002-S-00006
2013-02-04-T-002,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Mdm Speaker, in 2012, our hospitals attended to about 8,600 seniors for audiometry tests or hearing loss evaluation, as compared to about 6,800 cases in 2010. Of the 8,600 seniors, about 1,500 or 17% of these seniors needed a hearing aid and went through a hearing aid evaluation test. About 800 seniors eventually took up the use of hearing aids.",1,7,2013-02-04-T-002-S-00007
2013-02-04-T-002,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"The cost of a hearing aid varies but averages around $1,000 to $1,500. Medisave coverage does not extend to the purchase of hearing aid because Medisave is primarily meant to support large hospitalisation bills. We need to be careful not to over expand the use of Medisave so that Singaporeans will still have enough in their Medisave to cover their hospitalisation expenses. To help the low income elderly, the Centre for Enabled Living (CEL) has a Special Assistance Fund that provides subsidy for such hearing aids.",2,8,2013-02-04-T-002-S-00008

2013-02-04-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,asked  the Minister for Health (a) what action will be taken to review the handling of disciplinary cases involving doctors; (b) whether the Ministry will study the reasons behind the large number of null votes cast at the recent Singapore Medical Council election; (c) what steps will be taken to strengthen doctors' trust in the Singapore Medical Council; and (d) what steps will be taken to address public trust in our healthcare services.,1,11,2013-02-04-T-003-S-00011
2013-02-04-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mdm Speaker, the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) has appointed a Review Committee to review the existing legislative and administrative frameworks for disciplinary proceedings involving doctors and to optimise and strengthen the processes so that disciplinary matters are dealt with in a just and expeditious manner. This Committee comprises senior doctors and lawyers and the review is expected to be completed in about six months' time.",1,12,2013-02-04-T-003-S-00012
2013-02-04-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,About half the members of the SMC are elected. Voting in the SMC elections is compulsory for all fully registered doctors. About 15% to 20% of doctors cast null votes each year for various reasons.,2,13,2013-02-04-T-003-S-00013
2013-02-04-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The disciplinary processes and requirements for doctors are set out in the MRA, and the disciplinary bodies set up, namely the Complaints Committees and the Disciplinary Tribunals, are obliged to comply with those statutory requirements. The disciplinary proceedings and the deliberations of the disciplinary bodies are conducted independently of the SMC, bearing in mind that the objective of the MRA is to protect the health and safety of the public, uphold standards of practice within the medical profession, and maintain public confidence in the medical profession.",3,14,2013-02-04-T-003-S-00014
2013-02-04-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Director of Medical Services, who is also the Registrar of the SMC under the MRA, has written to all doctors in January this year to explain and clarify SMC's disciplinary processes.

2013-02-04-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To build public trust in our healthcare services, our healthcare professionals must play their part to ensure that patients are given the best care possible. Our professional boards and councils have promulgated ethical codes and guidelines that articulate high standards of professional conduct. The respective professional Acts have disciplinary frameworks as a deterrent against errant behaviour with measures in place to ensure a fair hearing. There are checks and balances in the professional Acts and avenues for appeal. We will continually refine and improve our processes, and ensure that public trust in our healthcare services and practitioners is maintained.",5,16,2013-02-04-T-003-S-00016
2013-02-04-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mdm Speaker, I have two supplementary questions for the Minister. Both relate to the balance between the internal processes of the discipline of medicine and the external overview from Government and regulatory bodies. The first is with respect to trust  does the Minister feel that the primary responsibility for the restoration of trust or the increase of trust lies with members of the profession or with the Government? And similarly, with respect to regulation, the medical profession, for a very long time, has had this principle of internal self regulation because of a presumption of the need for professional knowledge and professional competency. Going forward, where does the Minister see the balance between regulation by external bodies – be they legal bodies or Government bodies – as compared to the idea of internal self regulation by the profession?",1,17,2013-02-04-T-003-S-00017
2013-02-04-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for the clarification that he has sought. First, let me explain that we need to strike a balance between self regulation and external oversight. That is why the MRA was amended recently, in 2010, to include external parties, including the senior legal professionals who will also be part of the disciplinary process that is going to be conducted within the SMC. We should allow the Act that had just been amended to be implemented fully. Many of the cases that we see today are, in fact, cases that have started before the amendment of the Act and, therefore, legally they have to come under the previous framework. The new cases will then be taken on under the new framework.",1,18,2013-02-04-T-003-S-00018
2013-02-04-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Committee that has been set up will also take the time, over the next six months, to review the processes and the implementation of the new Act, and see where else we can improve so as to enhance the trust and confidence of both the profession as well as members of the public. I would urge the Member to give us some time to allow the SMC to work at it, to go through the Review Committee's work. In time to come, we hope to be able to continue to strengthen the processes and build the confidence in this profession.",2,19,2013-02-04-T-003-S-00019
2013-02-04-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mdm Speaker, my apologies. I should have declared my interest as an employee of the public healthcare services.",1,20,2013-02-04-T-003-S-00020
2013-02-04-T-004,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang,"asked  the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether there has been any update on Myanmar's preparation to host the 2013 Southeast Asian Games; and (b) whether this will impact preparations by Singapore athletes gearing up for the Games.",1,21,2013-02-04-T-004-S-00021
2013-02-04-T-004,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","Mdm Speaker, Myanmar will be hosting the Southeast Asian Games in December 2013. The last update from the Myanmar Olympic Committee (MOC) was in July 2012 at the SEA Games Federation Council Meeting. The delegates at the meeting toured facilities such as competition venues and the Games Village, which were still under construction then, but are on schedule for completion before the Games. The Council also deliberated on the sports to be included for the Games. Discussions are still ongoing, but the final list of sports will likely be confirmed at the end of the month. In fact, I believe there has been some convergence and they are probably already settled on the final list of sports.",1,22,2013-02-04-T-004-S-00022
2013-02-04-T-004,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","Based on these preliminary discussions, the National Sports Associations (NSA) and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) have already been working together to prepare our athletes. This includes the setting of milestones and targets, scheduling of overseas training and competitions, as well as other specialised training to ensure that our athletes peak in time for the Myanmar Games.",2,23,2013-02-04-T-004-S-00023
2013-02-04-T-004,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker, and I thank the Acting Minister for the answer. I declare my interest as the President of two sports associations, and a member of the National Olympic Council. The issue we tend to face with the SEA Games is that the sports list tends to be decided from country to country, with the inclusion of some interesting choices that may not feature in the Olympic list of sports. This has resulted in the problem where athletes are preparing year by year, or two years by two years. As Singapore moves towards a more professional pathway of sports development, what can we do as a country, as a member of Southeast Asia and a member of the Games, to create greater visibility for athletes preparing for such competitions in the future? And also, as a future host of the Games in 2015, in terms of preparing to host these Games, are there measures that we can put in place or views that we can push to ensure greater visibility for all parties concerned?",1,24,2013-02-04-T-004-S-00024
2013-02-04-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The hon Member would be aware that at the SEA Games level, the selection of sports is done by the SEA Games Federation Council. And all ASEAN members are represented on the Council by their National Olympic Committees. We are represented by the SNOC. At the SEA Games Federation Council level, our SNOC has always taken the stand that the sports that are included in the SEA Games ought to be games that are Olympics-level or Asian Games-level types of sports. We have always taken that stand. Within the SEA Games framework, the Council allows for traditional games to be included into the Games as well. The host country, sometimes, will include some of these games. Indonesia, in the last SEA Games, included a traditional martial arts sport; Myanmar this year has proposed chinlone, a game that is something like sepak takraw and it is going to be included in the Games, as I understand.",1,25,2013-02-04-T-004-S-00025
2013-02-04-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Within that framework, what we can do is to continue to maintain our position to advocate for SEA Games-level sports to include games that are at the Olympic and Asian Games-level. With that base of sports, our athletes will have quite a number of opportunities to participate, excel and do well in these sports. Within the SEA Games context, there will always be a few traditional sports that will be included. We recognise that and that is part of the SEA Games spirit.",2,26,2013-02-04-T-004-S-00026
2013-02-04-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"When we host the Games in 2015, we will maintain our same position, that we want the Games to be of a high level. And we would want to have, as far as possible, within the SEA Games that we host in 2015, sports that are at the Olympic and Asian Games-level.",3,27,2013-02-04-T-004-S-00027
2013-02-04-T-005,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran,asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower how can the Government ensure that employers of foreign workers in the essential services do enough to inform their foreign employees of the different set of rules and regulations and the law governing the nature of their employment.,1,28,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00028
2013-02-04-T-005,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo,asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) whether he can provide an assessment for the unhappiness of the Chinese bus drivers who were responsible for the recent illegal strike and if this situation could have been better managed; and (b) does the Ministry have in place a safety-valve mechanism to step in before relations breakdown to the point of disrupting vital public transport services.,1,29,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00029
2013-02-04-T-005,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong,"asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower in light of the illegal strikes by the SMRT Chinese drivers, what are the learning points to avoid such an occurrence again.",1,30,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00030
2013-02-04-T-005,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong,asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) how can avenues to address grievances of foreign workers working in Singapore be better managed; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider allowing foreign workers to be unionised.,1,31,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00031
2013-02-04-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) what are the learning points from the recent illegal strike by SMRT bus drivers; (b) whether there are adequate mechanisms to handle the grievances of non-unionised low-wage workers; and (c) whether companies that hire large number of foreign workers are equipped to manage workers of different nationalities and backgrounds.,1,32,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00032
2013-02-04-T-005,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) whether the recent illegal strike by SMRT bus drivers is a wake-up call for tripartism; (b) what lessons can be drawn to ensure that low-wage workers, including foreign workers, will be treated fairly by employers and their grievances heard; and (c) how does the Ministry ensure that employers will not exploit lowly educated foreign workers, particularly non-unionised ones.",1,33,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00033
2013-02-04-T-005,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng,"asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower in view of the recent SMRT bus drivers' work stoppages, how can Singapore do better to maintain its excellent industrial relations track record, especially for essential services.",1,34,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00034
2013-02-04-T-005,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew,"asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower in light of the recent strike by SMRT workers (a) what can be done to strengthen tripartism and ensure that it continues to be Singapore's comparative advantage; and (b) given that bipartism is a pre-requisite for strong tripartism, what more can be done to get employers to recognise and support unions at the workplace.",1,35,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00035
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) what is the rationale for detaining the 29 SMRT bus drivers prior to their deportation in a prison facility when they have not been charged with any offence; and (b) what is being done to ensure that the employment terms and work conditions are adequately safeguarded for persons working in the essential services as specified in the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.,1,36,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00036
2013-02-04-T-005,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien,asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will mandate improvements in the work conditions of foreign workers and make Singapore a more competitive destination for such workers from the region to come to Singapore.,1,37,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00037
2013-02-04-T-005,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) when SMRT first became aware of the pay and housing grievances of its foreign bus drivers; (b) when the Ministry first became aware of the grievances; (c) what actions were taken by the Ministry since the grievances were known; and (d) what plans the Ministry has for improving industrial relationship between foreign workers and employers.,1,38,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00038
2013-02-04-T-005,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,asked   the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) what is the total number of non-Singaporeans employed in the essential services listed in the First Schedule of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Chapter 67); (b) what are the top five essential services that hire the most non-Singaporeans; and (c) what is the number and percentage of non-Singaporeans in each of the top five essential services.,1,39,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00039
2013-02-04-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower with regard to the Ministry's investigation of the recent illegal industrial strikes (a) did the workers have adequate access to the Ministry or other related agencies to air their grievances; (b) what is the Ministry's assessment of the channels available to foreign workers to seek redress on their work conditions; (c) whether the Ministry will consider allowing relevant agencies, NGOs and unions to set up a representative branch office or conduct regular dormitory visits to improve accessibility and prevent foreign worker abuse by employers or exploitation by third parties; and (d) what more can be done to prevent the exploitation of foreign workers by employers.",1,40,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00040
2013-02-04-T-005,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) what role did the Chinese Embassy play in the resolution of the SMRT strike by Chinese bus drivers on 26 November 2012; and (b) whether there were other demands made by these bus drivers apart from salary and living conditions that were made known to the Ministry via the Chinese Embassy.,1,41,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00041

2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would like to thank my fellow Members of this House for the many questions, but in particular, for agreeing to defer your questions to this day.

2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Let me start by addressing Dr Lily Neo, Mr Yee Jenn Jong and Asst Prof Eugene Tan's queries on the causes and actions taken by the Government with regard to the illegal strike by the SMRT bus drivers. I am aware that there are many reasons offered in the various media sources about the root causes of the workers' grievances. Indeed, there have been employment issues raised with MOM on SMRT in the past. In fact, in 2010, a number of these were raised.",2,45,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00045
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Those issues relating to potential breaches of statutory obligations have been investigated and dealt with by MOM, while issues not related to statutory obligations have been surfaced by my colleagues in MOM to SMRT's most senior management levels. All these were dealt with prior to the strike.",3,46,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00046
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"When MOM officers spoke with the PRC bus drivers on 26 November when they participated in the strike, new issues were revealed and their unhappiness boiled down to three core issues. Firstly, differential salary and increments relative to the Malaysian bus drivers. Secondly, a SMRT internal circular which explicitly excluded PRC bus drivers from a recent salary adjustment exercise and, thirdly, perceived unsatisfactory accommodation conditions.",4,47,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00047
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As in most other developed countries, our labour laws will stipulate the basic employment standards, and the Government's role is to ensure that these basic employment standards are upheld. It is neither possible nor desirable to prescribe every good management practice under these laws.",5,48,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00048
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The first two grievances raised by the PRC bus drivers were in fact issues which had nothing to do with employment standards or to do with the law. Rather, they were contractual issues to do with the terms and conditions of their employment. Both employers and employees share a joint responsibility to resolve such cases amicably; and the Government should be careful about interfering in private contractual arrangements which are entered into willingly by both parties and which do not breach any statutory requirements. I will expand on this later.",6,49,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00049
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The third issue alleged a potential breach of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Regulations that require employers to ensure that their foreign employees have acceptable accommodation. Following feedback from the workers, MOM promptly sent officers to check on the state of the accommodation. We found no infringements committed by the dormitory operator such as an unacceptable level of overcrowding. Although the general housekeeping conditions of the rooms the PRC drivers occupied were below par, it should be stressed that the workers are responsible for the general upkeep of their own rooms as part of the rental agreement with the dormitory.",7,50,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00050
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To put things in proper perspective, with a large and diverse workforce, employment disputes are not uncommon in Singapore. In fact, employment disputes are not uncommon among Singaporean workers as well, together with their employers. I think all of us will have experienced that, whether in the capacity of employees or employers. By and large, these are settled amicably between employer and employee through grievance handling mechanisms, and sometimes with MOM's assistance as well. We stepped in to mediate in these issues.",8,51,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00051
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"But let me be clear about this. Whatever the workers' grievances were, we cannot condone workers in this instance, or any other, taking matters into their own hands and breaking the law. If this happens, they will be dealt with according to the law and in the case of the SMRT strike, 29 were sternly warned by the Police for participating in the strike illegally. They were then detained in an immigration depot prior to their repatriation in order to make the necessary arrangements for them to be repatriated from Singapore, and to mitigate the risk of further law and order issues arising from the cancellation of their work passes. Another five persons have been charged under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. Of the five, one has been convicted for participating in the illegal strike. The court proceedings for the other four are on-going. The four drivers have just lodged fresh complaints against SMRT on 11 January, and we are looking into these complaints.",9,52,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00052
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Singapore expects our citizens working in foreign countries to abide by the laws of their host countries. Similarly, we expect all foreign nationals working in Singapore to do the same. Mr Arthur Fong, Ms Irene Ng and Mr Liang Eng Hwa also asked about learning points arising from this particular incident. I would highlight three broad lessons. Firstly, the importance of having a proper grievance handling system, and better workplace diversity management in companies. Secondly, there is a need for better protection of and educational outreach to vulnerable workers. And thirdly, the continuing importance of tripartism amidst a changing workforce profile.",10,53,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00053

2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"There are many reasons why employment-related grievances may arise in workplaces. As I mentioned earlier, it is really not uncommon for a workforce of three million. Some relate to breaches of employers' statutory obligations, while others relate to contractual disputes. Yet others relate to non-contractual issues such as disagreements over the level of employment benefits or the conditions of work. It is not always very clear whether the disagreements arise from unacceptable employment conditions or from the unreasonable demands of the workers themselves. I think we often hear of stories from both sides of the coin. Regardless of their nature, if these grievances are not properly addressed and are allowed to fester, it could eventually lead to undesirable consequences, as in the case of the SMRT incident.",12,55,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00055
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Fundamentally, it is the employer who bears the primary responsibility to address employee grievances. Employers are the ones who can take immediate remedial actions to address valid grievances as and when they arise. And if there are misunderstandings, it is also the employer who should try to communicate better to make sure that these misunderstandings are cleared up. As I mentioned earlier, and I think all of us would, I believe, agree that it is really not practical or desirable for the Government to step in and to prescribe by law all the different good management practices which we expect companies to adopt.",13,56,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00056
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is in employers' self-interest to implement effective communication and grievance management systems.

2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"This is also the view shared strongly by our Tripartite Partners. Both employers and unions believe that open and direct communication between employer and employee is really the key to harmonious industrial relations. In the case of unionised companies, the unions would work with management to include grievance handling procedures in collective agreements.",15,58,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00058
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) recently released an advisory on employee grievance handling that strongly encouraged companies of all sizes to put in place such procedures or to review existing ones to ensure that they are practical and relevant. So, it is not good enough to just have grievance handling mechanisms. They must be able to work and the personnel responsible for them must be able to implement them in their full spirit. I cannot stress enough the importance for all employers to give attention to this issue, particularly if they do not yet have such measures in place. This is important not just with foreign workers for the foreign labour force, but with our own Singaporean workforce as well.",16,59,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00059
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"If there are employers who need help and advice, they can approach the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) which has been conducting workshops and has produced handbooks to educate and equip employers with the wherewithal to implement proper grievance management systems.",17,60,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00060
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I mentioned earlier that in the specific case of SMRT, the grievances by the PRC drivers arose because of the differential salary and increments relative to their Malaysian counterparts, as well as an internal circular which conveyed the decision to the PRC drivers in really, quite an insensitive way. My Ministry has looked into these issues in detail and let me now deal with each in turn.",18,61,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00061
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Government's basic philosophy is to allow remuneration to be set according to market principles. Employers are free to determine the salary they are willing to pay for a particular job. In the same vein, workers, whether local or foreign, are free to decide if the employment terms on offer suit their needs, and whether to accept or reject the employment offer. In our structurally tight labour market, employers who treat their workers fairly and in accordance to their abilities and competencies will have a competitive advantage in finding suitable workers to grow their businesses.",19,62,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00062
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"On the issue of salary differentials, SMRT has explained that unlike Malaysians, the PRC drivers are not permanent staff. Moreover, they are provided transport and accommodation which have to be taken into account in their overall remuneration package.",20,63,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00063
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"SMRT has also explained that the PRC workers are here on a two-year term contracts. These contracts do not provide for wage increments, and the workers were aware that they were not entitled to this increment when they signed on for the job.",21,64,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00064
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,But I would say that SMRT really could have handled the matter better by ensuring that the company's decisions were properly explained to and accepted by the workers. I call on SMRT's top management to deal with these issues decisively. This has been conveyed to them and they have indicated that this is something they are taking on seriously and are addressing.,22,65,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00065
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Grievance handling procedures and communication channels cannot guarantee disputes are always resolved to the satisfaction of workers. As I mentioned earlier, it is often unclear as well, if the dispute arose from inadequate employment conditions or from unreasonable demands of workers. But it certainly helps to mitigate the risk of serious labour management breakdown when the means of communications are opened and there are such systems in place.",23,66,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00066
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked if the drivers had access to the Ministry. The answer is yes. Employees who suspect that their employers have breached their statutory obligations may approach MOM for assistance. As I have said, MOM's role is to ensure that basic employment standards for all employees in Singapore are upheld. We will investigate such complaints and we do not just take the word of one side or one party. If proven to be true, we will not hesitate to take errant employers to task. For non-statutory employment disputes which are raised to MOM, we will facilitate where we can and where is appropriate, but ultimately the resolution lies between the employer and employee. It is not feasible or practical for MOM to step in on every single grievance that occur in every single company.",24,67,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00067
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"If for one reason or another, workers prefer not to come to MOM directly, they can also reach out to unions, or Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) such as the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC), HealthServe and others for assistance in pursuing their grievances. Foreign workers can also approach their respective countries' embassies to register their dissatisfaction and complaints, and thereafter, their embassies will raise it with us.",25,68,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00068
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"MOM recognises the positive roles that unions play in representing the interests of their members and in stabilising labour management relations. Unions play a very important role in our landscape. Foreign Embassies also have regular engagement and a close working relationship with my Ministry. Mr Png Eng Huat asked about the role of the Chinese Embassy in the SMRT case. Throughout the incident, both MOM and MHA officers kept in close contact with Embassy officials and facilitated consular access to the affected Chinese bus drivers.",26,69,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00069
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"MOM further recognises that NGOs can play a useful bridging role. We work closely with these organisations and support their efforts to ensure that workers are not exploited. In fact, at the working level, a lot of interactions take place between my officers and the representatives from the NGOs on a very, very regular basis. Between 2011 and end 2012, the MWC assisted around 3,000 foreign workers by referring their cases to MOM, solving workers' employment grievances and providing interim humanitarian assistance such as accommodation and food. During this period, MOM also received close to 500 and 450 case referrals from NGOs like Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) and the Humanitarian Organisation for Migrant Economics (HOME) respectively. The majority of these cases were resolved by MOM within the month.",27,70,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00070
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Several Members, like Mr Dhinakaran, Dr Lily Neo, Asst Prof Eugene Tan and Mr Cedric Foo, have asked whether special attention should be paid to essential services such as public transport to safeguard workers' interests and to ensure that labour relations in these enterprises do not break down, since that would adversely affect Singaporeans.",28,71,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00071
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Government already recognises that it is critical to ensure companies providing essential services operate smoothly with minimal disruptions. Although the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act prohibits workers employed in sectors like water, electricity and gas from going on strike, they can join trade unions. Trade unions recognised by their employers can use the legal process under the Industrial Relations Act to negotiate with the employer, and surface deadlock disputes to Industrial Arbitration Court. Those employed in essential services listed in the First Schedule, which includes public transport, can go on strike so long as they give their employers 14 days' advance notice. Such restrictions and advance notice pre-requisites for essential services are not unique to Singapore. Many countries have them as well. I think all of us can understand why such requirements are put into the law.",29,72,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00072
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,MOM will be working with the respective sectoral regulators to ensure that they institute robust grievance handling procedures in essential services companies to minimise the probability of industrial action. Sectoral regulators should also work with these companies to put in place business continuity plans.,30,73,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00073
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked whether companies that hire large numbers of foreign workers are equipped to manage workers of different nationalities. In 2010, the National Integration Working Group for Workplaces (NIWG-W) had commissioned a study on the state of workplace diversity management across gender, age and nationality. While 90% of companies agreed that workplace inclusiveness and harmony were important to business outcomes, 27% responded that they faced challenges in managing a diverse workforce. For large companies, line managers and supervisors often lacked skills and knowledge in this regard. SMEs, on the other hand, lacked resources to raise awareness and put systemic processes in place.",31,74,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00074
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Based on these findings, the NIWG-W developed a Workplace Diversity Management Toolkit. It will help employers to assess the state of inclusiveness and harmony in their workplaces, and offers examples of initiatives they can adopt. The toolkit is readily available for employers to download at MOM's website. NIWG-W is currently working with SNEF to explore ways to step up efforts to actively promote good workplace diversity management practices to more employers in a more sustainable manner.",32,75,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00075
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I shall now move on to the second thrust on protection and educational outreach for the more vulnerable workers, including foreign workers, which Mr Dhinakaran, Mr Arthur Fong, Ms Irene Ng, Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Yee Jenn Jong and Mr Laurence Lien have asked about. There have also been several expressions of concern by members of the public about our management of foreign workers.",33,76,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00076
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Members will appreciate that with about 1.2 million guest workers, or one out of every five persons, in Singapore, managing foreign worker issues takes a substantial amount of my Ministry's time and effort. But it is important to watch out for this space. It is heartening to note that from a joint study done by MOM and MWC in 2011, more than nine in 10 of foreigner workers were satisfied with their overall working experience here. However, as I said before many times, while, by and large, we have good employers and Singaporeans, by and large, respect and appreciate the contributions made by foreign workers, there will be negative experiences and unhappy cases from time to time. As I said before, I do believe that we can do more in this area and I will, in this segment, outline some of the existing and upcoming measures.",34,77,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00077
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Over the years, MOM has put in place a framework to ensure basic employment standards for all employees, in terms of legislation, enforcement and educational outreach. Our legislation is regularly reviewed to ensure their continued relevance and efficacy in view of the changing employment landscape.",35,78,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00078
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Recently, as Members are aware, we revised the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) to give the Government more flexibility and enforcement teeth against employers who exploit their foreign workers. Phase 2 of the EFMA review will continue later this year to better protect the well-being of workers, as well as ensure an equitable balance of rights and responsibilities between employers and workers. In addition, we are studying whether to broaden the circumstances where we allow foreign workers to change employers in instances where there has been a genuine mismatch in expectations.",36,79,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00079
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,We are also reviewing the Employment Act. A key area in this review is the improvement of employment standards and benefits for vulnerable employees. And this applies to our local workers as well.,37,80,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00080
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Comprehensive legislative protection in turn needs to be underpinned by robust enforcement. MOM takes a serious view of employers who fail to fulfil their statutory duties under the law. Besides relying on cases triggered by complaints from employees, we also take proactive steps to detect errant employers. In 2012, MOM conducted about 3,000 inspections to detect potential breaches of the Employment Act and Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, including more than 850 inspections of premises used as foreign worker housing. More than 350 employers were also prosecuted and convicted for breaching Employment laws during this period.",38,81,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00081
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In recognition of the different circumstances faced by foreign workers, MOM further undertakes calibrated outreach efforts to educate them of their employment rights and responsibilities, and avenues for assistance. Since 2009, MOM has been issuing guidebooks published in foreign workers' native languages to all new foreign workers when they report to MOM's Work Permit Services Centre to collect their Work Permit cards. The guidebook provides information on foreign workers' employment rights and responsibilities under the law, and useful contact numbers, including those of MOM and the Police, NGOs, and Embassies of foreign workers' home countries. So, if they have issues, they can call any of these above numbers and register their concerns.",39,82,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00082
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Going forward, we will enhance the guidebook to provide more information on proper channels for raising grievances and regulations on industrial actions.",40,83,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00083
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Besides providing information on employment laws, it is important to provide foreign workers with information on their basic employment terms in advance, before they enter Singapore. Since June 2011, employers have been required to declare the foreign worker's basic monthly salary, allowances and deductions when applying for work permits. The information declared by employers is clearly stated in the copy of the In-Principle Approval letter, and a copy of this letter is sent to the worker in their native languages before they enter Singapore. We want to make sure that workers come in with their eyes fully open as to what they have agreed to and what the employers have agreed to.",41,84,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00084
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,MOM has also piloted a series of pre-departure orientation briefings in source countries on topics such as employment laws and employment terms for Singapore-bound construction workers. MOM is also working with our partners to produce an educational video for foreign workers before they come so that they are better informed on their employment rights and how to settle any employment disputes amicably.,42,85,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00085
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"On Mr Arthur Fong's question of whether MOM will allow foreign workers to be unionised, let me clarify that the law already allows this to take place. In fact, many foreign workers are already union members and have their unions representing them on employment related issues such as work-related grievances. And we have encouraged the unions to be proactive on this front, in similar fashion to let our foreign worker population know that they are free to join the unions.",43,86,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00086
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"This brings me to the final point on tripartism and industrial relations, which Ms Irene Ng, Mr Cedric Foo and Ms Mary Liew have asked about.",44,87,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00087
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Strong tripartite cooperation has been one of Singapore's unique strengths. We have said this many times, and it is something that I would want to say again. It is actually quite critical for us and has contributed significantly. It has brought about general industrial peace; stable jobs for all our workers; and enhanced our attractiveness as a business and investment destination. We must continue to build on this foundation so that more and better jobs can be created for Singaporeans. It is not something we should take for granted, and we should continue to strengthen this relationship.",45,88,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00088
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The SMRT incident revealed that industrial peace cannot be taken for granted. It was indeed, as Ms Irene Ng put it, a ""wake-up call"".

2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In conclusion, let me end by saying that it is inevitable that given the changing dynamic of our modern workforce, it will continue to pose new challenges to our existing framework for harmonious industrial relations. The SMRT incident has shown that we need to be nimble and develop new ways to address these challenges early. This will include strengthening the capacity of all parties in the employment ecosystem to minimise work-related disputes as far as possible, and resolve them fairly and expeditiously when they arise.",48,91,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00091
2013-02-04-T-005,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"Mdm Speaker, three supplementary questions, please. May I ask the Minister whether there is any incentive scheme in place to encourage Singaporeans to take up employment in our essential services? May I also ask the Acting Minister what is the percentage of foreign workers being employed in our essential services, and whether he plans to tweak this percentage in the long run to reduce our perpetual reliance on foreign workers for such essential services? Lastly, the Acting Minister mentioned earlier about the notes to be taken from the last strike, may I ask whether he can now give the assurance that there are action plans in place to prevent a future strike?",1,92,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00092
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would like to thank Dr Lily Neo for her several questions. The first set of questions revolves around our essential services. This is a fair concern, and it has been expressed by Mr Png Eng Huat as well. Let me put it this way. Essential services are critical to the well functioning of Singapore's society and we should pay attention to that. Due to security reasons, it would probably be appropriate for me not to go into details as to the extent of which the numbers are involved. But, certainly, with regard to the operators themselves and the agencies concerned, we are working closely with these agencies to understand the circumstance and to make sure that appropriate measures are put in place.",1,93,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00093
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As to whether there are more incentives to encourage more Singaporeans to join such essential services, the agencies are looking at how better to make employment for Singaporeans more attractive. This applies to not just those agencies alone but many other agencies providing public services. But, at the same time, I think it is to make sure that there are measures put in place to manage industrial relations within these firms, and that is critical.",2,94,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00094
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"While we have seen the incidents through the SMRT strike of this possibility, it does not – and I stress – it is important not to generalise that there is a high risk of this happening. There are reasons why it has taken place. In this case, in terms of miscommunication, better management could have taken place. This is where companies and agencies, if they were to undertake much more positive control in terms of labour management, both with local and foreign workforce, they will essentially minimise the probability of such incidents happening.",3,95,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00095
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As to action plans to prevent strikes from taking place, what we have done, together with SNEF and the unions, is to make sure that companies are aware that if we do not manage grievances within our companies, they will fester and can lead to various consequences. There is a range of actions that workers can take, and we see that happening from time to time. The best solution is, really, for companies to take this seriously to make sure that their grievance management systems are in place. We do encourage unions to maintain a good feel of the ground by working with the workers and to encourage workers to join the unions. These are all outlet valves to ensure their grievances are aired and are settled.",4,96,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00096
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"On our part in MOM, we remain an avenue that is opened for these issues to be raised. This is where I would say that clearly in terms of statutory violations, MOM will step in and deal with them. Where it is non-statutory, we will advise the companies, where appropriate, and step in to mediate when we need. But we are not able to apply ourselves on all grievances because clearly there are many, many different types of grievances and many of them are non-statutory.",5,97,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00097

For essential services, we are discussing with them, and we can look at putting in place more proactive measures. Clearly, I think HR audits and better intelligence are things which are practical, and we would see how best we could put in place some of these more proactive measures, as he has mentioned, to make sure that some of these companies and agencies are better able to stay ahead of the game. Clearly, they all take it quite seriously. So, this is something that we will work with them on, and we will explore what can be possible.",1,100,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00100
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Acting Minister for his reply. I noted that there is a very strong emphasis placed on contractualism – the idea that the workers are bound by their contracts. As a lawyer by training, and one who teaches law, I certainly subscribe to that as well. But I think it is also important that the Government emphasises to employers the importance of fairness. The workers can look at the contract and say, ""Okay, this is what I will be paid."" But if they were to come to Singapore and realise that they are being discriminated against, then I think there is only so much that contracts can do; it does not take away the fact that the unhappiness remains. My second question relates to the question that I filed, that is, what is the reason for treating the bus drivers prior to their deportation as prisoners?",1,101,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00101
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I totally agree with Asst Prof Eugene Tan's assertion that contracts are important and should be respected, but at the same time, there is the issue of fairness which is something that all employers should pay attention to. As mentioned, this is good management. Good companies, as we know, are good companies because they are well managed. They are well managed on the basis of values, and it is not just what you say but how you do and how you treat workers. And a lot of it is also about how we communicate and engage. Sometimes, there are differences, and sometimes there is perceived discrimination, unevenness or unfairness. But if communications are sincere, they have an open and a good positive working relationship with their employees, whether local or foreign, that is where a lot of the problems can be pre-empted.",1,102,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00102
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"This, I would suggest, is something that all companies should take heed. Whether we can actually legislate for employers to learn to be fair, that is difficult. What we want to make sure is that we do not want to be intrusive but we do want to encourage. That is where a lot of the HR practices are that we try to actively promote. But we need to be careful not to overdo it because there are many things that companies need to do. In fact, I would say that, sometimes, we are overly regulating things. Some of them are sensible practices which companies should adopt, but where it is statutory and required for the Government to step in to implement laws and regulations, that is something we should do.",2,103,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00103

I recognise that out there, especially online, various allegations are made. For example, let me illustrate. These are not the first complaints raised to MOM with regard to SMRT. A number of complaints were raised prior to this and this has come up. These were raised in 2010, some statutory in nature, some non-statutory in nature. MOM took them seriously. We dealt with the issues, especially those that were statutory, we dealt with them and we told the company to change the practices and, as far as we are aware, those practices were changed. There were also some grievances that were non-statutory. However, we viewed that they were important enough that from a very senior level in MOM, we approached the most senior level in SMRT to register our concerns with some of their management practices. We told them basically that some of these things ought to be sorted out and that is something that they have done.",1,109,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00109
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"MOM deals with not just SMRT but with many companies. Grievances appear – they appear in my email in-box regularly – but whether all are valid or not, we have to follow up and investigate, and that is what our officers do. We do have many grievances surfaced. Like I said, some are statutory, some are non-statutory. Some do not provide the complete story. There is another perspective to it and it is not necessarily clear-cut that the employer is at fault, nor is it fair to say that it is always the employee that is at fault.",2,110,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00110
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"At the end of it, MOM has to deal with this. Where it warrants our attention, we will definitely deal with it. Certainly, from a statutory perspective, we will investigate and take action if regulations are violated. With the non-statutory and where we feel it is necessary, we will step in as well to mediate or deal with the companies or employers concerned. In other cases, where we feel that it is perhaps not as serious and non-statutory, we would encourage the employees to take up other alternative avenues. The avenues remain open, and that is important to register. We do take action and will deal with issues.",3,111,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00111
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As to the numbers with regard to joining the unions, I do not have the numbers off-hand, but like I said earlier, we do encourage our unions to work with the foreign workforce to see whether they are interested in joining and to encourage them to do so. We note that, in some companies, a number of the foreign workers do actively join the unions, and that is a good thing because it allows representation and their voices to be heard and for the unions to take it up on their behalf.",4,112,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00112
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to fair wages, regulations and so on, as I have explained in my response earlier, we have stepped up primarily in terms of our amendments to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) which hon Members are familiar with, and that was tabled a couple of months ago. That was the first tranche. The second tranche will take place sometime in the course of this year. The Employment Act is also being reviewed, with the whole intent to strengthen, not just for foreign workers but for all our workers as well, and to make sure that their rights are protected. The position that MOM takes is this  we are not pro-employer, we are not pro-employee. However, I am also very mindful that from a general perspective, especially at the lower levels of work, it would tend to be weighted for the employer against the employee. That is something I am mindful of and I have registered that with all my colleagues. They agree that it is something to be watchful for in the process as we amend and we strengthen the regulations.",5,113,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00113
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Companies are free to establish their wages and some of their contractual terms. It is a free market. This is where it is important to emphasise – it is not for us to intervene and tell companies how exactly they should structure it. Workers have a choice as well, as to where they can go. Similarly, I would suggest that foreign workers have a choice as to which country they choose to go. Notwithstanding this particular dispute and the amplification of egregious behaviour when it does take place, it is very important for us to recognise that for such a large workforce, Singapore is a fair and decent place for foreign workers to operate in. Most of our employers do not behave in a negative fashion; they are responsible. Singaporeans, by and large, notwithstanding what we read sometimes online, are welcoming, respectful and appreciative of what our foreign workers contribute to our landscape, which is why we remain a fairly attractive destination for foreign workers who are looking to earn a living, to earn enough to remit back to their families. If we were as it is painted sometimes, I do not think foreign workers would be very interested to come here. We have laws in place, we continue to strengthen them and we aim to enforce them as well.",6,114,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00114
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is important to look at it in context. But companies, like I said, do have to be fair and they have to structure their wages and contracts accordingly, because if it is unfair and unbalanced, frankly, the workers will not join them and will move somewhere else.",7,115,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00115
2013-02-04-T-005,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Acting Minister to elaborate on the type of avenues that the 29 SMRT bus drivers got prior to their deportation at short notice. Should they not have been given some sort of independent hearing and its findings made public? Would such an inquiry into the incidents have offered insights into all employers in Singapore on the need to and the mechanisms for proper grievance handling?",1,116,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00116
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, for the bus drivers concerned who participated in the illegal strike, let us be clear. They violated the laws and what we did was to take action to deal with the particular circumstances. In this instance, the PRC drivers, the 29 who were repatriated, were interviewed and given the opportunity to air their grievances and we registered them and took action accordingly. In the investigation process, we assessed as to the culpability of the different bus drivers who were involved. There were many more bus drivers involved, but we were able to differentiate the level of involvement and the degree of responsibility each of the different bus drivers had in participating in the particular incident.",1,117,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00117
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"So, in our case, I would say that what we needed to do was to deal with the particular situation. Bus drivers violated the laws and we have to deal with it. In this case, for the 29 to be repatriated and made sure that investigations had taken place. We interviewed all the different bus drivers involved to make sure that they had the opportunity to register and air their concerns before we dealt with them. Obviously, there were also other bus drivers who, we felt, warranted much more serious action, and those actions are in the process of unfolding as we speak.",2,118,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00118

In the case of SMRT, prior to this incident, they have about 400 PRC drivers and less than 5% were union members. But subsequent to this incident, both the management and the unions worked together to reach out to the workers. As of today, about 75% of the 400 PRC drivers have already signed up to be union members.",2,120,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00120
2013-02-04-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I thank the Minister for his reply. My supplementary question relates to my Parliamentary Question (PQ), which I do not think was answered. In order to facilitate the workers to air their grievances, would the Ministry consider allowing relevant agencies, NGOs or even union branches to be situated within the dormitory compound? As we all know, the workers living in dormitories are often restricted in their movements. Therefore, by the time they go to MOM, it is typically quite a late stage. So, would the Ministry consider that, to improve the accessibility to air their grievances?",1,121,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00121
2013-02-04-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The second point relates to not just observing contract rules, but I am taking NMP Eugene Tan's point about fairness, in which the Ministry today considers contracts and employers where employment terms are set in Singapore. But we also know that sometimes we do have contracts being set outside of Singapore, in which today we do not recognise. To some extent, I think this also makes it much worse for the workers as they come here on a poor footing.",2,122,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00122
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, with regard to Mr Zaqy Mohamad's first suggestion, it is something that we can look at in terms of whether we are able to enhance the access that foreign workers may have, especially in situating something or others in the dormitories. But I would say that the most expeditious would be telephone numbers. They could call a range of agencies concerned. As I have mentioned earlier, these numbers are disseminated. I will take a look at the process again to see whether we can enhance that further. But I would say that that is probably the fastest way to get in contact. And they have a choice. They can call MOM, the unions and the NGOs, and the embassy numbers are also provided. This is a very thorough range of avenues that is available. The key thing is really to educate them that these numbers ought to be used when they do have issues, register the complaint and then we can fix up appointments or whatever to follow up. I would suggest that that might well be the most expeditious and effective way to register their concerns.",1,123,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00123
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"On the point raised by Mr Zaqy Mohamad with regard to contracts signed outside of Singapore, that is something of concern because they may actually sign a contract in their regional state or city, and then that might actually be quite different, depending on what the agents do. It is something we recognise. But our challenge is we do not have the remit to go upstream to govern that because a lot of that operates in another country. What we have done to overcome that is with the In-principle Approval (IPA), meaning that when companies here apply for their work permits, we want them to define what exactly are they requiring the workers to do, what are the contractual terms, pay and so on. Register them, they are recorded in the IPA, this is translated into the native language and issued to the workers before they come. Whatever the workers have agreed with whoever they are supposed to have agreed with in their own local contract in their country, the final document that they received for the IPA would determine ""This is exactly what you are going to do, how you are going to be reimbursed and so on"", and to make sure that at least that tallies.",2,124,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00124
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"That is an important step to take. I would recognise that there are limits to how much I can control upstream. But this is an important measure so that at least they can say, ""Wait a minute. What I have agreed to with my agent or whoever differs greatly from what is being issued from Singapore"" and, hopefully, that would raise alarm bells for the workers themselves for them to resolve the issues and take action accordingly. If it turns out to be completely not what they had signed themselves up for, then they will have other recourse to take at that stage.",3,125,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00125

2013-02-04-T-005,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I agree that foreign workers have a choice before they come to Singapore. The issue is that, after they have come to Singapore and feel that they are locked in to an unfair contract, then they really feel they do not have a choice.",1,127,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00127
2013-02-04-T-005,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"This is where, as we have covered, we need adequate union representation and the proper use of existing dispute resolution mechanisms. I have two follow-up questions  one, how does the Ministry ensure that the foreign workers are adequately represented by the unions, particularly where they form a minority group within that union? Hence, the union might just represent the interest of the majority group. And two, how does the Government encourage the use of the Industrial Arbitration Court − which was not mentioned earlier − as the port of call before an industrial dispute gets out of hand, and to ensure that access to this Court is assured for aggrieved workers?",2,128,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00128
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Our present experience with the unions is that they do actually look out for foreign workers. In fact, we do have the unions highlighting concerns to companies and to us when these issues are raised. This is something the unions do take seriously, in terms of their responsibilities. As mentioned earlier, as a wake-up call, I think this is a useful reminder for all of us to make sure that whatever channels are available, workers and the unions play a very important role. I have very little doubt that the unions take this responsibility in representing all their workers seriously, meaning that if there are concerns raised by the foreign workers, even though they may form the minority, these things will be registered and will be brought upstream. This is something that we will re-emphasise to our union colleagues as well.",1,129,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00129
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to avenues to the Industrial Arbitration Court, all these remain open. I think there is a due process. I deal with a lot of these issues, whether local or foreign, and many of these will go through the appropriate steps, especially when statutory violations occur. Eventually, the access to Industrial Arbitration Court is available, and no one is denied that right to go through some of these processes. It does take time and investigations need to take place. We want to make it as expeditious as possible and we find that in most disputes, we are to resolve it pretty much in a month or so, or no more than three months. Complex cases will take longer. For some settlements, there might be complications, for example, with medical disputes or companies which are not able to pay up. To address this, because of security bond and other measures, we have various levers in place to work with the companies to make sure that adequate compensation is provided for. This is something that takes time, but it is something that we, by and large, are able to settle quite expeditiously. So, no foreign worker, and, in fact, no local worker either, will be denied that avenue.",2,130,2013-02-04-T-005-S-00130
2013-02-04-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I am looking at, as part of our improvement and strengthening of the Employment Act, whether we would be able to establish a different body to deal with some of these non-statutory concerns. I would say that this applies to not just low-wage workers, whether local or foreign, but even for some of the junior PMEs, there are concerns. Sometimes, it is non-statutory issue and we are not always able to step in. But rather than resort to the civil courts, we are exploring whether something of that nature could be set up as an intermediate body to assist them. This is something we will surface through consultation and we will gather suggestions and ideas. In fact, a number of these have been surfaced.

In the last 10 years, there has not been any reported incident of the same nature. MOH takes a very serious view of this incident. As soon as the incident was reported to MOH, I directed MOH and KKH staff to find out how it happened and work with the hospital to prevent similar lapses in future.",1,133,2013-02-04-T-006-S-00133
2013-02-04-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Let me share some background to the incident. As soon as a baby is born in KKH, an identification tag bearing the mother's details is affixed to the baby's right ankle in the delivery suite. The mother's details are also affixed onto a cot that will be used throughout the baby's hospital stay. Thereafter, when the baby has arrived in the ward nursery, a second barcode tag is affixed to the baby's left ankle. This barcode tag is unique to the baby and used to confirm the identity of the baby electronically before medications are served or investigative procedures are carried out.",2,134,2013-02-04-T-006-S-00134
2013-02-04-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The KKH case involved two babies, Baby A and Baby B. Baby A was born on 16 November 2012, while Baby B was born on 17 November 2012. Both babies were correctly tagged and placed in the correct cots soon after birth. For most of the admission, the babies were roomed with their mothers, but in the early morning of 18 November 2012 between 3.15 am and 11.30 am, both babies were in the ward nursery and cared for by the nurses. We believe that it was during this period that the two babies were inadvertently placed in each other's cots. The mix-up most likely occurred when they were removed from their cots for care at about the same time and were returned to the cot without counter-checking their tags to ensure they were returned to the correct cot. KKH was unable to ascertain the precise moment of this mix-up as unlike activities such as administration of medication where the exact time was recorded, the time of several activities such as bathing, changing and soothing a crying baby were not recorded.",3,135,2013-02-04-T-006-S-00135
2013-02-04-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"A second error occurred when the barcode tag on Baby A's left ankle dropped off and was wrongly replaced with Baby B's tag. The staff replacing the missing tag failed to counter-check the identity of the baby against the remaining right ankle tag and most likely relied on the identity on the cot itself, which showed details of Mother B and Baby B.",4,136,2013-02-04-T-006-S-00136
2013-02-04-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Subsequently, the baby thought to be Baby B was brought to Mother B and the baby thought to be Baby A was pushed to Mother A. The staff who brought the wrong babies to the mothers had failed to check both ankle tags against the cot card. Both discharge staff had also failed to open the baby's blanket to check both ankle tags when the mothers were discharged with their babies. When KKH was alerted of the error, it made immediate arrangements to reunite the babies with their rightful parents. Unfortunately, unwarranted distress had already occurred.",5,137,2013-02-04-T-006-S-00137
2013-02-04-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Since then, a specially-commissioned review committee has completed its investigations on the incident. The review committee found that although protocols for the handling of babies were in place, there were lapses in compliance with established policies and procedures. There were indications of lax supervision and inadequate audits and checks imposed by hospital management. In other words, the unfortunate incident could have been avoided if those involved in caring for the affected babies had followed the proper procedures.",6,138,2013-02-04-T-006-S-00138

KKH has already implemented most of these recommendations and is also evaluating possible IT solutions that could further strengthen the current manual processes. Details of the actions taken have been announced by KKH on 26 December last year. Let me just give a few examples. Two staff are now required to tag or re-tag babies to ensure they are correctly tagged. Patient identification procedures will be reinforced during staff orientation and training.

So, there is a certain set of circumstances that circumscribe the context in which the immunity is lifted and that is the context in which these statistics are gathered. We do not know if in fact − and I think that is what the Member is alluding to − we have a total lifting of the immunity, what the instances of false reporting will be. More importantly, the context in which these sorts of assertions are made is hard to establish because of the intrinsic nature of a marital relationship. I think that is a part that we need to deal with. This is a sensitive and emotive matter. It has been discussed and debated extensively in this House in 2007, and the review will take those issues into account.",1,155,2013-02-04-T-008-S-00155

2013-02-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, based on the National Arts Council's Population Survey of the Arts, participation in the arts by youth aged 15 to 24 declined from 40% in 2009 to 28% in 2011. However, this was due in part to a change in the definition of an arts participant in the survey. Respondents who participated in the arts purely for academic or school purposes were excluded in the 2011 edition of the survey. This meant that youth who had participated in school, but did not engage in other arts activities outside of school, were excluded from the pool of participants.",1,162,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00162
2013-02-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The definition was amended to more accurately capture interest and involvement amongst youth relative to other demographic segments, who do not have the advantage of structured school-based programmes. Prior to the change, youth participation rates had appeared much higher than the national average, but may not have presented an accurate picture of youth involvement as they would have included obligatory arts activities in school. Despite this change, the 2011 youth participation rate remains above the national average.",2,163,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00163
2013-02-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MCCY strongly believes that active participation in the arts can help our youth find greater fulfilment and gain confidence to succeed in their endeavours. Participation in the arts from a young age can also cultivate greater creativity and sensitivity amongst our youth. These qualities will put them in good stead in all areas of life. The energy and passion of our youth will also contribute towards greater vibrancy in our arts landscape. The future success of Singapore depends on having passionate and creative young people who are meaningfully engaged with society, and believe in striving for their ideals and dreams.",3,164,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00164
2013-02-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For these reasons, the previously announced Arts and Culture Education Masterplan will channel up to $40 million towards initiatives to improve arts and culture curricula and co-curricular activities in schools. This includes providing grants for showcases and performances by school groups, funding projects which improve pedagogies in the arts curriculum, and leveraging on the arts to teach the academic curriculum. The Masterplan also enhances the instructional capabilities of arts teachers, through masterclasses, learning journeys and conferences. Collectively, the Masterplan will improve the experience of students with the arts, cultivate a love of the arts from young, and develop qualities that our youth can carry with them throughout their lives.",4,165,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00165
2013-02-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MCCY will also continue to support our talented youth to achieve their aspirations in the arts, through programmes such as NAC's ""Pocket Rocket"" and NOISE. ""Pocket Rocket"" provides funding and guidance for youth-initiated arts projects which target community or social causes, while NOISE provides young artists with showcase and mentorship opportunities to grow their talent.",5,166,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00166
2013-02-04-T-010,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Acting Minister. I have three clarifications. As you know, the arts and culture contribute to the development and well-being of children and young people. Research has shown that arts participation be it learning a musical instrument, singing in a choir, drawing or dancing, actually improve children's performance across the curriculum. I just want to find out with regard to the numbers, especially the decline and the change in definition, is the Minister referring to the re-definition of youth participation to only include those youths who participate in the arts as CCAs, and outside of school, leaving out those who take the arts within the core curriculum? My second question is  is there any concern that some of these arts opportunities become significantly reduced after the child hits upper Secondary and starts to face some major examinations? And thirdly, can MCCY commission a survey or some research to track arts participation by children below the age of 15, especially in the area of arts participation outside of school?",1,167,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00167
2013-02-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I thank the Member for her follow-up questions. On the first question, it is the case that we are looking now with the re-definition of arts participation amongst young people at the young people who do not participate in structured programmes within schools. These are largely CCAs, but there may be other non-CCA type of structured programmes. We are largely looking at CCA programmes. That is the reason for the drop in the youth participation rates.",1,168,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00168
2013-02-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On tracking the numbers beyond school, and whether there is a decline in the participation rates because of people progressing through school and perhaps not continuing in arts participation after they have graduated, we do not have very good data on this. Perhaps that happens. We hope that we can improve our ability to identify or to find out more information about what youth participation is like.",2,169,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00169
2013-02-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This links to the Member's third question about broadening the capabilities either within the NAC or the Ministry to have a better sensing of what young people's participation in the arts is like, whether it is at the young age that the Member suggested or as they progress through their school life and perhaps, even as they enter the work force. We do engage in such surveys periodically. NAC, for example, did a survey on youth participation in the arts in 2011. From that survey, they had a good sensing of what interests young people in the arts, what motivates them to take part in the arts. That is one example of a survey that NAC did. We do hope to do more surveys in order to get a better sensing of young people's mindsets when they participate in arts activities.",3,170,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00170
2013-02-04-T-010,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Just a very quick clarification relating to my third supplementary question. My question was whether or not the Minister would start tracking arts participation below the age of 15 for children. This is because if arts participation has very wide knock-on benefits on education and on children's performance in the curriculum, then we need to find out whether or not they have enough equal access across the board, at a very, very young age, not after 15.",1,171,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00171
2013-02-04-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I thank the Member for the clarification. It is something that we will take into consideration.,1,172,2013-02-04-T-010-S-00172

2013-02-04-T-011,Josephine Teo,The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Let me touch on processes to optimise project design and cost efficiency. Madam, we introduced the MOF Gateway Process in 2010 to strengthen the rigour of the approval process for large development projects. Under this process, projects above $500 million in value are subject to a series of reviews – spanning concept, design and costs – by a Development Projects Advisory Panel (DPAP). The panel comprises senior public officers and industry practitioners with deep technical expertise and experience in major infrastructure development. In addition, large projects are also put through Value Management workshops to refine their design in order to maximise value and cost efficiency.",2,175,2013-02-04-T-011-S-00175
2013-02-04-T-011,Josephine Teo,The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Madam, let me say something about how we strengthen public sector project management capabilities. Apart from this Gateway process, we are focusing on procurement and project management capabilities. Government agencies that undertake large infrastructure projects on a regular basis, such as the Land Transport Authority and JTC Corp, have dedicated units and staff overseeing the management of infrastructure projects. Over the years, they have built up substantial in-house capabilities in procurement and project management.",3,176,2013-02-04-T-011-S-00176
2013-02-04-T-011,Josephine Teo,The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"To address the needs of Government agencies which do not have such expertise, the Centre for Public Project Management (CP2M) was set up in January 2011 with the aim of strengthening project management capabilities across the whole of Government. CP2M is staffed by experienced officers from various construction-related disciplines such as quantity surveying and project management. It provides advice and guidance to Government agencies both on design optimisation, as well as robust project management, including risk management. CP2M also helps agencies build their own capabilities in these areas and, in some instances, provides project management services directly to agencies upon request.",4,177,2013-02-04-T-011-S-00177
2013-02-04-T-011,Josephine Teo,The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"I would like to share an example to illustrate these points. This has to do with the Singapore University of Technology and Design. In order to promote and improve value-for-money, the Gateway review of the project, together with inputs from the CP2M team, helped to reduce the footprint of the campus, freeing up land for other uses. This was achieved through the re-routing of a service driveway and the relocation of the tennis courts to the roof of the indoor sports hall instead of on the adjacent grounds.",5,178,2013-02-04-T-011-S-00178

May I ask the Minister of State whether the measures she has outlined so far have in actual fact led to all or most infrastructure projects being completed with proper project management and prudent use of resources? Or in other words, is the Ministry satisfied with the progress so far? And this is given a lot of loss of project management and project planning capacity within the public service with the spin-offs of agencies like the Public Works Department and the Housing and Development Division previously, and also given that there have been some projects with quite large over-runs like the Downtown Line.",1,180,2013-02-04-T-011-S-00180

I refer to the Foreign Minister's reply to my Parliamentary Question on 14 January 2013 pertaining to Singapore's decision to abstain from the successfully passed UN resolution to elevate Palestine's status at the United Nations to a non-member observer state. This oral question was not answered by question-and-answer time during the last sitting, and was responded to in written form in accordance with parliamentary procedure. I have, therefore, sought the leave of Speaker to respond to the Foreign Minister's reply in which the Minister requests for some clarifications, in accordance with parliamentary Standing Order 25.",1,185,2013-02-04-T-012-S-00185
2013-02-04-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"While it would be debatable whether a change in Singapore's voting position would make us more secure, my initial concern when news of Singapore's abstention came through was our decision would indeed have made us more insecure and vulnerable to terrorist threats. Singapore's decision to abstain was in marked contrast to all other ASEAN member states, and an overwhelming number of UN member states, which voted in favour of the resolution. It is noteworthy that many of these countries, like Singapore, have also established UNSC Resolution 242 to be the basis of a viable and long-term solution to the Israel-Palestine issue, and yet, without contradiction, voted in favour to elevate Palestine's status at the UN to that of a non-member observer.",2,186,2013-02-04-T-012-S-00186

This was reflective of the public interest in the issue, given that a central pillar of Singapore's foreign policy operates within a Southeast Asian situation, which hosts a large Muslim population.",3,187,2013-02-04-T-012-S-00187
2013-02-04-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Nonetheless, in the aftermath of the resolution, it is encouraging to note that the Government made it a point to state that Singapore has voted in favour of 18 out of 19 resolutions tabled at the United Nations General Assembly on Palestinian issues since 2008. However, each resolution carries with it a unique foreign policy signature. The resolution on Palestine's elevation is a case in point. Even though Singapore had voted for resolutions in Palestine's favour previously, our decision to abstain is more likely to be remembered than our previous voting patterns because of the weight and international profile of the resolution to elevate Palestine's international status.",4,188,2013-02-04-T-012-S-00188
2013-02-04-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In fact, Singapore's even-handed position, ""sharing the desires of the Palestinians for an independent state, and that of Israel for its security"", may have been misunderstood by some Singaporeans in favour of the latter, because of our abstention. To that end, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs' parliamentary answer to my question stating that Singapore does not support Israel's activities that contravene international law, including its settlement activities in the Occupied Territories is welcomed, as is its communication of this position to Israeli representatives in bilateral meetings. It is equally noteworthy that Singapore sees both sides as having legitimate rights and shared responsibilities. The weight of this statement is significant because it counters a perception that Singapore is pro-Israel, but rather, pro-peace. It also reduces my own concern that Singapore's decision to abstain made us insecure.",5,189,2013-02-04-T-012-S-00189
2013-02-04-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In future, it would be propitious for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to consider profiling Singapore's stand on Palestinian issues and other controversial issues in front and centre not only to solicit public feedback, but before the public raises concerns on the matter lest our position be misunderstood, especially in view of our immediate geopolitical realities. This approach is likely to secure greater consensus for our foreign policy and the realities that determine it, for after all, foreign policy is an extension of domestic politics.

The applicant's disposable income should, therefore, not be confused with the applicant's gross income. His disposable capital does not include assets which we cannot reasonably expect the applicant to liquidate, for example, the home in which he lives, up to a certain value.",9,209,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00209
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Under the proposed amendments, we will expand coverage of the general means test by expanding the existing deductibles for both income and capital, and by creating new deductibles. This will allow for wider and better coverage.",10,210,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00210
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"An applicant can now deduct the following when calculating his disposable income  (i) $6,000 for his own expenses. This is an increase, up from the current $4,500; (ii) he can also deduct up to $6,000 for his spouse's expenses. This is up from the current $3,500. But this would not apply when the Director has already excluded the income of a separated spouse; (iii) the applicant can also deduct up to $6,000 for the maintenance of each dependant. This is up from the current $3,500; (iv) he can also deduct up to $20,000 for rent. This is up from the current $1,000, and is based on the lower end of the prevailing open-market rental rates for 3-room flats in suburban areas; and (v) he can also deduct his spouse's CPF contributions though, again, this will not apply when the Director has already excluded the income of a separated spouse.",11,211,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00211

2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"As for the disposable capital, an applicant can now disregard the following. First, his CPF investments. These are to be disregarded because he cannot withdraw these to pay for legal services. Second, the life insurance policies held by him, of up to $46,000 in surrender value. Third, the annual value of his home, provided that it is $13,000 or less. This is up from the current annual value of $7,800, and it is equal to the revised maximum annual value of HDB flats. HDB flats which are used as dwelling homes will remain entirely deductible.",13,213,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00213
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"These amendments to the general means test will ensure expanded coverage. The current coverage of legal aid is about 17% of Singaporeans and PRs. With these amendments, we estimate that the Act will cover about 25% of Singaporeans and PRs. This would translate to about 300,000 additional persons who can potentially be covered under the Act. And this expanded coverage does not take into account the Director's discretion to depart from the general means test in exceptional circumstances, which I shall address later.",14,214,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00214
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"So what does this mean in practical terms? Perhaps, I can illustrate by this example. Let us take a family of four, living in a HDB flat. You have one working parent, one homemaker, two children. Let us say the gross household income is $3,500 a month, or $42,000 a year. After deduction of CPF, the gross household income is $2,800 a month, or $33,600 a year.",15,215,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00215
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Applying the current test before the amendments, the deduction for each member of the household would add up to $15,000, that is, $4,500 for the applicant, $3,500 multiplied by three for the spouse and children. The annual disposable household income would, therefore, be $18,600 – and this would be above the $10,000 disposal income limit. So, in that example, if you have applied the current test, they would not qualify. But if you apply the revised test under the proposed amendments, then the deductions can add up to $24,000, that is $6,000, for the applicant and up to $6,000 times three for his spouse and two children. So, applying the revised test, the annual disposable household income would be $9,600, which would bring that family within the $10,000 limit. If the same family pays rent, the rent would be an additional deductible and, as such, the gross household income could potentially go up to $5,625 and the family would still meet the income limit of the means test.",16,216,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00216
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"That is for the general means test. There is also a new discretion that we are introducing for family proceedings. Clause 21 introduces a special discretion in applying the means test for family proceedings which involve a child of protection orders. The practical effect of this amendment is that it will extend the coverage of legal aid to persons who are the most vulnerable in family disputes. The Bill introduces a rule-based discretion for the following proceedings  (a) divorces, where a child of age below 21, a minor, is involved; (b) custody care, control and access of children, child maintenance and all cases under the Guardianship of Infants Act where children below age 21 are involved, as well as (c) cases involving personal protection of a child and/or spouse.",17,217,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00217
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In these types of cases, the Director of Legal Aid has the discretion to relax the deductibles in calculating the applicant's disposable capital. Under the Bill, in addition to the standard deductibles, he has the discretion to exclude the following from the calculation of disposable capital – the applicant's home, provided that its assessed annual value is not more than $20,000. This is $7,000 more than the ordinary cap of $13,000. The effect of this amendment is that it will extend coverage to residents living in lower end private property. There will also be a new deductible in the form of $5,000 worth of capital. This, in effect, raises the disposable capital cap to $15,000.",18,218,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00218
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The proposed amendments also expand the discretion for loss of income cases where the applicant has suffered a sudden loss in income and requires legal aid urgently. Under the current Act, when an applicant has suffered a sudden loss in income, the Director already has the discretion to assess the applicant's means by looking at his disposable income for six months instead of the usual 12 months. Under the proposed amendment, the quantum of the deductibles applicable in such situations will be increased, in line with the changes to the general means test for disposable income. So, for example, the deductible for dependants in this situation will be increased to $3,000, from $1,750, which is half of the new deductible for dependants under the general means test.",19,219,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00219

2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Clause 3 amends section 4 to empower the Director of Legal Aid to remove a solicitor from the panel of assigned solicitors. The Director can exercise this power when, for example, a solicitor has ceased practice or it is shown from his professional conduct that he is not a suitable person to remain on the panel. However, a solicitor aggrieved by his removal can appeal to the High Court.",21,221,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00221
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),Clause 7 amends section 9 to empower the Director of Legal Aid to require all applicants for legal aid to make contributions towards the costs incurred for their case. The approach here is ultimately founded on the principle that the applicant must also exercise responsibility. An applicant who has a stake in his case has more incentive to be prudent and responsible than one who does not. The contribution required will depend on the means of the applicant. There will always be cases where the applicant faces great financial hardship. No contribution will be required from those who truly cannot afford to pay any.,22,222,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00222

This will make it easier for aided persons to recover debts due to them.",23,223,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00223

I promise to be nice and polite. I support any measure which promotes access to justice. The Court's role is to resolve disputes, protect rights, interpret and clarify the laws we live our lives by.

2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I, and I am sure many in this House, have come across cases where Singaporeans have been reluctant to pursue good cases, because of costs. Often, it presents a chicken-and-egg problem – a wife who needs a lawyer to recover maintenance but is unable to pay for a lawyer because she does not receive maintenance. Individuals are entitled to represent themselves, but many shy away from doing so because the process appears too intimidating and they believe they cannot cope.",2,231,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00231
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Legal Aid will not solve all these problems and not all problems can be solved, but it is an important tool to help those in need.

2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There are, however, four points I would like to raise about the Bill.",4,233,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00233
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The first concerns the amended means test. In order to qualify for legal aid, the applicant's disposable income must not exceed $10,000. To calculate disposable income, clause 21 stipulates that a maximum amount of $6,000 can be deducted from the applicant's income in respect of maintenance of each dependant.",5,234,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00234
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I accept that $6,000 is a significant increase from the original deductible of $3,500. However, it does not distinguish those families who may have higher expenses because the child or the dependant is handicapped or chronically ill. So, the Act is not flexible enough to embrace different circumstances.",6,235,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00235
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I accept that it would be impossible to legislate for different situations. That is why the Director should be given wider discretion to allow or disallow applications, and to ask for information which will enable him to exercise that discretion. This would allow the means test to be applied in a more effective and accurate way.",7,236,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00236
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The means test could also be made more flexible. A good example of its rigidity is the deduction for rent in calculating disposable income. In this Bill, the amount of deductible for yearly rent has been revised upwards from $1,000 to $20,000. Would that figure still be relevant next year or the year after that? It could, depending on the economic situation, be either insufficient or too generous. Rather than having to wait for Parliament to legislate changes which takes time, we should use a more flexible formula which takes into account fluctuations in inflation or cost of living. This would allow the means test to remain relevant as time and the economy changes.",8,237,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00237
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second is a point for clarification on the issue of contribution. Section 16(4) applies to a person who is not initially liable to make a contribution, and who subsequently recovers money in legal proceedings or by virtue of a settlement. This section operates to make such a person liable to pay the Director for sums payable on his account out of the monies he recovered, and that is a good thing.",9,238,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00238
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Under section 9 of the Act, persons whose disposable capital and annual disposable income fall below $2,000 need not make such contributions. Under the proposed amended section 9, however, this $2,000 lower limit is abolished. Instead, all persons are liable to make contributions, except where the Director exercises his discretion to reduce, waive or refund any contribution.",10,239,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00239
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My question concerns how section 16(4) operates in situations where the Director has exercised his discretion to waive the contribution. Section 16(4) states that only persons who are ""not liable to make a contribution"" are required to pay the Director out of the monies recovered. A literal reading of the section suggests that only persons who had their contribution entirely, and not partially, waived would be liable to the Director for sums payable in the event that he recovers money. Could the Minister clarify if those who had their contributions partially waived are still liable to make contribution in the event that they recover money?",11,240,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00240
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Third, clause 20 of the Bill expands the scope of the Act to allow aid to be granted for proceedings before the Commissioner for Labour under the Work Injury Compensation Act. Such workers are a vulnerable class of people, and legal processes are often alien to them. It is important they are able to enjoy the full benefit of the statutory protection accorded to them. They will need legal assistance to navigate such proceedings in order to do so. Unfortunately, this is often too expensive and, again, intimidating. The Bill deals with this problem by extending the scope of legal aid. And, again, this is a good change.",12,241,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00241
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"This topic brings up the plight of foreign workers. As we have seen in recent months, unscrupulous employers can and do take advantage of their foreign employees. Recently, it was reported that a foreign worker who had been injured in an industrial accident had difficulty obtaining his compensation award because his employer had failed to purchase insurance for him. There have also been reports of employers withholding salaries to their employees for months on end, or who do not provide sufficiently for their welfare. They are exploited simply because they are vulnerable. If left unchecked, workplace abuse can have negative repercussions on Singapore's reputation, industrial relations, and public order.",13,242,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00242
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Under the Act, only citizens and permanent residents can avail themselves to legal aid. I am not advocating legal aid for foreigners. However, there is no reason why employers should not bear the costs of their employees receiving proper representation in relation to work disputes. And this should be made part of the true cost of hiring foreign workers.",14,243,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00243
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My last point concerns legal aid for criminal proceedings. We do not have a criminal legal aid scheme administered by the State. The only form of criminal aid provided by the State is for capital crimes under the LASCO scheme. Those who are unable to afford a lawyer in non-capital criminal proceedings are faced with defending themselves, unless they qualify for aid provided by volunteer lawyers from the Law Society. Based on figures provided by the Subordinate Courts, up to 41% of accused persons are without counsel at the pre-trial stage.",15,244,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00244
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"More should be done to help those who need counsel for criminal matters.

2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"At first blush, there may be some conflict in the Government expending resources to investigate and prosecute crimes, and then giving legal aid to the accused. But it is not the Government's role simply to arrest, try and jail. Government's role is to ensure the rights of all citizens are protected, and that includes making sure that those who are accused have a fair hearing. Its KPI should not be the number of successful prosecutions, but rather that, in every case, a fair and just result was achieved.",17,246,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00246
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There have been cases of accused persons taking what they consider to be the easier path – pleading guilty to an offence they did not commit simply because they cannot afford the cost of a trial. Whenever we have cases of wrong convictions, it is a blight on our legal process and the administration of justice. And there is no higher cost than the indelible stain of a wrong conviction, particularly where the cause is one of lack of resources. As a society, we have a shared interest in ensuring that the rights of all are protected. In that respect, there is no conflict in administering criminal legal aid.",18,247,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00247
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Thus, I would like to urge the Minister to extend legal aid to criminal cases or even consider a public defender scheme to provide legal assistance and representation for those who cannot afford legal counsel in criminal proceedings. We may not need to expand the legal service to achieve this. The solution could lie in assigning lawyers criminal legal aid cases with a modest fee rate set by the Director of Legal Aid. This is not unlike the situation where applicants for legal aid may be assigned an external solicitor. Such a scheme would also have the advantage of building up and improving the quality of the criminal bar, as well as exposing our younger lawyers to such work.",19,248,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00248
2013-02-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I started by saying that Legal Aid is just one tool, albeit an important one. But the duty to providing good counsel to those in need should not fall entirely on the Government. The principle of ""many helping hands"" should apply here as well. Private practitioners, retired lawyers, academics, corporate counsel and even lawyers in foreign law practices in Singapore should get involved. There is enough legal talent in this country to do this. Despite the long hours and the stress, we should acknowledge that we (lawyers, that is) belong to a privileged group. We should offer our time and expertise to help those who are not so fortunate. There is now a strong drive, led by the Law Society, to have lawyers in private practice do more pro bono work. We should support it as best we can. There is still much to do, but if everyone does his bit, we can significantly reduce the risk of an unjust result and have a legal system we are all proud of.",20,249,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00249

He said, and I quote  ""It is cold comfort to those who seek justice to say that we have a great legal system, if it is priced out of their reach."" It is with this as its driving purpose that the Legal Aid Bureau was set up in 1956.

2013-02-04-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Under the present means criteria, the entire amount of an applicant's surrender value on any life insurance policy would be taken into account. In other words, a surrender value of $10,000 or more, even on a life policy, would automatically disqualify an applicant, even if that applicant has got no other assets or is unemployed and has no income. A surrender value of $10,000 on a policy is not very high and, more often than not, taken out at an earlier stage of their lives in order to mitigate against the occurrence of accidents or other unfortunate rainy day incidents. This really ought not count against an applicant when he or she applies for legal aid. More importantly, unlike other forms of disposable capital (such as a motor car or property or shares), an applicant should really not be expected to dispose of his life insurance policy just to fund his legal expenditure.",7,256,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00256
2013-02-04-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"During the debate on last year's Budget, I had inquired if the Minister could consider reviewing the qualifying criteria used for means testing. These criteria have now, through these amendments, been refined and include revising the deductions in income levels to account for the increase in basic living expenditure, and also deductions in rental relief and life insurance policies. These changes would allow the Director, Legal Aid, to better assess the true financial ability of an applicant to have access to legal aid. I, therefore, support these amendments.",8,257,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00257
2013-02-04-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Whilst these revisions go a long way towards ensuring that a broader spectrum of society would not be disqualified on the means test alone (there is also the merits test), I wonder if the Minister would be prepared to consider giving additional discretion to the Director to grant legal aid in circumstances where the applicant otherwise fails to meet the criteria.",9,258,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00258
2013-02-04-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Mdm Speaker, I raise this because, even after these amendments today, the qualifying criteria remain an absolute one, apart from some additional considerations which the Director already has by virtue of paragraph 6 of the Second Schedule and through the additional amendments that are being introduced today. Paragraph 6, in particular, is limited in application to only certain specific category of persons, and even then, there is a cap on the additional deduction which can be given. The Act otherwise provides no latitude for re-consideration once the criterion is exceeded, however minimally. In the case of my resident, the letter he received from the Legal Aid Bureau stated specifically that the criterion was a statutory requirement and they were unable to waive it.",10,259,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00259
2013-02-04-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"The only other recourse in such a situation is for the applicant to appeal to the Minister. Under section 8(4) of the Act, which was introduced in 1995, the Minister may authorise the Director of Legal Aid to grant aid to any applicant who does not qualify if it is in the public interest to do so. However, it is difficult to imagine a situation where an individual or an applicant would be able to satisfy the public interest element to persuade the Minister to exercise his discretion to grant him legal aid. In fact, in 1995, when the then Minister for Law introduced this provision into the Act, he cited as an example of a public interest exception, the victims of the Spyros incident which took place in 1978 in Singapore. And that, we know, was one of the largest industrial accidents in Singapore.",11,260,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00260
2013-02-04-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Hence, I would echo the earlier Member, Mr Hri Kumar, in suggesting that the Legal Aid Director be given a broader discretion to consider all relevant circumstances in a situation where the applicant has not passed the means test. This would not be an altogether new proposition as the comparable legislation in Australia and the UK already provide for the relevant authority there to have discretion to decide, based on a range of relevant circumstances and criteria which evaluates not only the financial means for that particular applicant but also the complexity of the legal case in question and what other serious alternatives (to litigation) the applicant might have.",12,261,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00261
2013-02-04-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Under section 8(3) of the Act, the Director is already conferred a discretion to deny the grant of legal aid even if the means criteria have been satisfied. What I am seeking is to ask  why not give him a similar discretion the other way round – to consider the grant of legal aid, notwithstanding that the means test has not been satisfied. In such a situation, the grant could be on a limited basis, or possibly on an enhanced co-payment basis so that only genuinely needy cases would be assisted. Having an unbending financial means criterion which just looks at numbers alone does not always meet the ends of justice.",13,262,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00262
2013-02-04-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"The last amendment to the Act, as the Minister pointed out, was done in 2007. Income levels, inflation rates move. In fact, today's amendments recognise specifically that, to take the example that the earlier Member cited, for the deduction of rental relief that has gone up from $1,000 to $20,000, taking into account today's prevailing open market rates for HDB housing. This shows that there could be really large swings in the threshold levels between the time that the Act is amended to update these threshold levels. Giving the Director a broader discretion would mean that the Act does not have to be amended each time the qualifying criteria become outdated or need to be amended. And it would certainly also reduce the risk of an applicant falling foul of the means test for no other reason than because market rates have moved on.

2013-02-04-T-017,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"Second, could the disposal income level be increased before a person is eligible for legal aid? For example, to qualify for legal aid after the proposed amendments, the indicative income level for a person with no dependant is a gross monthly income of $1,666.67, or about $20,000 per annum, after taking into account the permitted deductibles. This is an increase from the current existing rates. Would the Minister elaborate how this minimum threshold income is determined? Why $10,000? Why not a figure which is higher?",6,269,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00269
2013-02-04-T-017,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,A third question is  why are Singapore citizens and permanent residents treated equally when it comes to the provision of the grant of legal aid and advice?

To be sure, the State's provision of a well-funded legal aid scheme is necessary. But that is insufficient to develop and sustain a compassionate legal aid scheme. For the legal aid scheme to function purposively and with compassion, the role of assigned solicitors is extremely important. And I say this while also recognising the important role that the legal officers in the Legal Aid Bureau play. Not many legal officers would choose a posting to the Legal Aid Bureau, which is typically not regarded as glamorous. So, in this regard, legal aid must epitomise the best of the legal profession and what the law and the legal system can do to ensure that fairness and justice are not just motherhood statements but are lived realities in our society.",10,273,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00273

A single parent who lived in my ward passed on, leaving behind two children who were in Primary school. Her sister, who was going to take charge of the children, came to see me to seek advice on legal procedures for formal guardianship. This happened in February 2012. One year ago. She had already taken the children in and was taking care of them and looking after them. She herself has got aged parents to look after and she works in the clerical line. I referred her to LAB for assistance, only to be given a rejection after several weeks. I re-appealed, of course. Somehow, the reply came with the same fate. Thus, I made a referral to the then MCYS, only to be told she needed the services of a pro bono legal representative from The Law Society, understandably. She, then, saw the legal representative from the Law Society, who then told her she should go back to LAB, as her case should be handled there! And, of course, she came back to me. It has been some four times since she has come to see me and the case continues, now into its twelfth month, going back and forth.",5,284,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00284

Free legal representation was provided then when necessary to even persons charged with murder.

Then, there is the up to $46,000 of the surrender value of life insurance policies which will be disregarded for means testing. By the same token, Central Provident Fund (CPF) Investments will not be included in the calculation, and the annual value of applicants' property to be excluded from the means testing will be increased to $13,000 from the current $7,800.

The last review of the means test was in 2007 where the disposable income was raised to the current $10,000. With a current inflation rate of over 3%, it would be far more effective to consider raising the disposable income rather than to deploy the current method of increasing personal and dependants' deductibles and relief.",4,298,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00298

If we take reference to an applicant with no dependants, the increase after five years is a mere 7.5%, based on a monthly pay of $1,667. This works out to be only a 1.5% increase per year since 2007, calculated against the gross monthly income. In the same vein, even as we consider the increase in the dependants' relief from $3,500 to $6,000, this works out to be an increase of only 2.5% per year since 2007. All these are still below the 3% average inflation rate.",5,299,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00299

According to the ""Household income Trends 2011"" issued by the Department of Statistics, the average monthly income of our resident employed household, excluding employer CPF contribution, was $6,280 in 2006. In 2011, the same figure has grown sharply by 41% to $8,864.

It would be useful for the Legal Aid Bureau to share with or educate the public openly on what are the objective criteria in the merits test and how approval will be decided.

Of pro bono hours, we have heard commonly of the two schools of thought – one, that it should come from the heart and, the other, a mandatory system. These two points of view are often intensely argued by both sides. I believe a balance can be created between the two. The Law Society, Ministry of Law and our Law Schools are already doing great work in this area. The Chief Justice has also urged and supported the move to encourage the legal profession to serve the community. In fact, just two weeks ago, NTUC and the Law Society entered into a long-term partnership to provide legal clinics, resources and employments to our more than 700,000 union members. Moving ahead, it distils down to how the Government and the legal fraternity can work together to work out a framework that will enhance this access and for the fraternity to endorse and embrace them.",10,304,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00304

A systemic development, capability enhancement and dedication of resources by the Government for legal aid, such as community legal clinics, pro bono legal services and the Legal Aid Bureau, would have greater effectiveness in reaching out to those who need the legal services the most and yet unable to afford them. With that, I support the Bill.",13,307,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00307

2013-02-04-T-017,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"The amendments are good, but I have three points to raise  first, not long ago, the Government announced a slew of generous grants for buying a flat, childcare and education. People now ask  is too much welfare conducive to encouraging people to continue working hard? Some might question the benefits of giving legal aid applicants more financial help. To address these concerns, should the Government not respond by informing the public the scope of legal aid through the media, community and grassroots organisations? Not all legal issues can be solved by free services provided by the Legal Aid Bureau staff.",2,309,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00309
2013-02-04-T-017,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Second, there were 9,775 legal aid cases in 2011, among which over 50% were divorce cases; others were adoption, traffic and industrial accident compensation cases. It is worth noting that one third of the cases were handled by over 100 pro bono private lawyers, not by staff from the Legal Aid Bureau. These are onerous pro bono duties; and the pro bono spirit of these lawyers is commendable. It should be emulated by younger and new lawyers. Some Singaporeans do not understand that the Bureau must take a calibrated approach in handling these cases, and consider each single detail; and they complain that the Bureau has a bad attitude and do things inefficiently. I suggest that the related departments hold seminars and talks with schools and communities so that more people would understand the importance of pro bono legal work and encourage more practising lawyers to take up. We can then better look after the vulnerable who need legal aid, creating a more inclusive society.",3,310,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00310
2013-02-04-T-017,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Third, I understand that there were more females seeking legal aid in 2011. Among them, those aged between 40 and 50 years old made up 28%, and those 50 years old and above made up 36%. In terms of education, those with Secondary school education but did not attain ""O"" level qualifications formed 26%; those with only Primary school education formed 28%. Generally speaking, people with low education tend to be ignorant of their legal rights, therefore, are helpless in handling marital or family disputes. I suggest that, subject to available manpower, we should conduct free legal courses for the low-income earners in languages they are familiar with, so that they know how to safeguard their own rights and seek fair treatment when they encounter difficult legal problems.",4,311,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00311
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Members who have spoken and would like to address some of the issues and queries that they have raised. First, I think that Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Edwin Tong had both made speeches calling for greater discretion. In a sense, what they raised was highlighted and responded to by Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef who, on the other hand, questioned the issue of discretion and asked whether or not we should have some minimum flexible guidelines or criteria. And there you have the tension. Discretion allows you to do a certain amount of things but, at the same time, that discretion cannot be unfettered because, if so, it would not be transparent and then there would be challenges to whether the discretion was exercised properly.",1,312,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00312
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"There has to be some reference to a framework, and that is what we have at the moment. We have tried to balance it by having a transparent means test but, at the same time, we have tried to blunt the sharp edges of the means test by having a discretionary element exercisable by the Director of Legal Aid. I notice, though, that the two cases mentioned by Mr Edwin Tong and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef were ineligible for legal aid because of the surrender value of the applicants' insurance policies. In these cases − for Mr Edwin Tong's resident, the surrender value was $10,000 and, for Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, it was $40,000 − under the revised limits, they would both qualify. I would urge Mr Tong and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef to ask their residents to re-apply. If there is further difficulty, please refer the matter to me, and we will see what can be done.",2,313,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00313
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef also asked about the average number of referrals annually for the last three years and how many were approved. On average, there are about 10,000 applicants to the Legal Aid Bureau per year, out of which, approximately 90% are approved. She had asked what were the reasons for the rejected cases and, in general, it is because they have not met the eligibility criterion. Finally, she had also asked what proportion are matrimonial cases. The answer is 52%.",3,314,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00314
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"There were comments made on the means test in general and, on this, let me just make a few comments – which are that the touchstone is really disposable income and disposable capital, not gross income or gross capital. What we do is we look at the resources reasonably available to the applicant in order to finance his or her legal expenses. The test allows the applicant to deduct the resources which he uses for his day-to-day expenses and his spouses' expenses and his dependants' expenses; so, you do not take that into account. It also disregards the assets which you cannot expect the applicant to sell, for example, his life policy up to certain amount and his dwelling home. So, you look at the end of the day at what he has left that he can actually use to pay for legal services.",4,315,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00315
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Patrick Tay said that taking into account current cost of living, annual disposable income of $10,000 is at the sustenance level. I was not quite sure why that would be the case because the means test envisages that $10,000 is what you have left after you have deducted your own expenses, your spouse's expenses and your dependants' expenses. So, $10,000 disposable income for legal services is not luxurious by any measure but it is, I think, accurate to say that it is above sustenance level. There are also different ways to structure the means test, but our assessment is that adjusting the deductibles is probably a more targeted approach than simply increasing the disposable income limit. That is because the deductibles, which we are increasing, are what represent the average cost of living for the average family. The annual disposable income represents our estimate of the reasonable cost of basic legal services. So, the $10,000 figure was arrived at, being an estimate of what would be a reasonable amount you would have to spend in order to obtain basic legal services.",5,316,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00316
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"If you take a test where you raise the annual disposable income into a one-size-fits-all test, then it could result in inequitable outcomes. For example, all things being equal, a bigger household with more dependants will have more expenses. Having a flat disposable income test could operate unfairly against them. Pegging the living expenses deductibles to a number of dependants will give you a fairer outcome.",6,317,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00317
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, the better approach is this  we look at the disposable income and capital limit and ask ourselves whether those amounts are sufficient to finance the cost of basic legal services. Our assessment is, yes. If you have more than $10,000 in disposable income or capital, you ought to be able to afford basic legal services. If it is less than that, then that is where the Legal Aid Bureau will step in to help you. The idea is that this is not intended for protracted trials but basic legal services, such as probate, adoption and straightforward family law cases.",7,318,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00318
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,I turn now to the comments made by Members on the specific elements of the means test. Asst Prof Eugene Tan asked about the considerations for the review of the Act and how the quantum was derived. The main consideration in reviewing the Act was to take into account the changes in cost of living and also to provide coverage to the more vulnerable groups in family cases. That was the thinking behind the current amendments.,8,319,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00319
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Several Members had also expressed concern that the levels in the means test may become outdated and they had commented on the need for regular updating, and I note Asst Prof Eugene Tan's comment that review and revision are needed so that deserving persons are not shut out. Yes, we agree entirely. That is why the Government regularly reviews the Act and the Act has been reviewed at regular intervals – in 1995, 2001, 2007 and, now, in 2012. But we will continue to review and refine the means test regularly to ensure that it remains relevant.",9,320,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00320
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Hri Kumar suggested that the means test could be updated by using a flexible formula rather than having to wait for Parliament to legislate the changes to the means test. Actually, under section 24 of the Act, the Minister can amend the means test deductibles and discretions in the Second Schedule by way of Gazette notification. In this instance, it is being brought through Parliament because there are other amendments which are required.",10,321,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00321
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I move now to the exceptions to the means test. All of what I said before notwithstanding, I also accept that rigid adherence to the means test can cause difficulties in very exceptional cases. The test is premised upon average income and expenditure patterns and, like all tests premised on a general set of parameters, it may operate harshly, or in an unintended fashion, in exceptional circumstances. It is for this reason that the Act has discretionary exceptions to the general means test which cover separated spouses, those who suffer a sudden disability leading to a loss of earning capacity, those who suffer a sudden loss of income and need urgent aid and, of course, the new exception that we added for family cases involving children or those requiring protection orders. The amendments have increased the quantum of the deductibles for the discretionary cases and built in some extra flexibility.",11,322,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00322
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"To recap, the Government's general approach is to make sure that those in need of legal aid but who are in difficult financial circumstances, especially the vulnerable groups, are not shut out by inflation and changes in the cost of living. We are also concerned to ensure that vulnerable individuals in family situations have the protection of the law and access to justice, and this can be seen from the thrust of the amendments.",12,323,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00323
2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Asst Prof Eugene Tan asked why Singaporeans and PRs are treated equally when it comes to the provision of legal aid and advice, and suggested that PRs be required to satisfy a higher threshold. Actually, there is a differentiation in treatment between Singaporeans and PRs. Whilst we do not have a separate means test for Singapore citizens and PRs for the qualifying level, PRs are generally charged a higher contribution when they are granted legal aid. So, in order to qualify, the test is the same. But at the end of the day, when we are asking back for some form of contribution, the PRs will have to pay more than the Singaporeans, and there is a differentiation between Singaporeans and PRs in favour of Singaporeans. We think that this is a fairer approach. This is the current position, but we will continue to study this.",13,324,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00324

2013-02-04-T-017,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"On the merits test, Mr Patrick Tay asked whether it is necessary to impose a merits test. And the answer, again, is, yes, it is. The reason is this  you are spending taxpayers' money to provide legal aid; you want to make sure that the person has access to justice. On the other hand, if a claim is clearly frivolous, you do not want to be spending the taxpayers' money to pursue something which is clearly and obviously frivolous. Similarly, for untenable defences. On the other hand, I accept that there are also cases which fall in between where the possible outcome is not so clear. And that is where you have to make an assessment of the merits  you have to think about whether this is a case which should go to court. On balance, if there is a reasonable prospect of success, then the Legal Aid Bureau will render legal aid. So, the merits test is relevant and important.",15,326,2013-02-04-T-017-S-00326

The Government already funds LASCO. But on the other types of criminal proceedings, I should say that the Government's KPI is not convictions. The Government's KPI must be and always has been justice. This is something that we will try to uphold. And it is because of this that the Government does also contribute indirectly. The Government makes a contribution to the Law Society's Pro Bono Services Office which runs the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. We are in discussion with the Law Society to expand our funding to them, to enable the Society to take on more deserving cases. There is also a Government-community collaboration, the Community Justice Centre, which is in the midst of being implemented. This is a one-stop hub that will provide greater integration of legal aid and social assistance to litigants-in-person or defendants. Social services available at the Centre include legal clinics and practical support services to help the LIPs or the litigants-in-person prepare court documents and applications.

We are not deciding now on the population trajectory beyond 2020. Nor are we deciding that we will have a population of 6.9 million in 2030. We are using this figure, which is at the high end of the 6.5 million to 6.9 million range, only to prepare infrastructure plans.",13,359,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00359

This is especially important for infrastructure plans that may take many years to implement and, once built, will be there for decades. If we under-provide in our land use and infrastructure plans now, Singaporeans will have less flexibility in the future and, if things turn out unexpectedly, we will face bottlenecks and constraints. In fact, these are precisely the problems that we are facing today. We do not want to repeat these scenarios by under-providing.",14,360,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00360

We hope that with restructuring and productivity gains, with Singaporeans living healthier and longer, and therefore choosing to remain in the workforce longer, and more women joining the workforce, our population will not reach 6.9 million. It is the ability to meet the needs of Singaporeans and provide a good quality of life that is the driver. That is our objective, and not the numbers per se. If we are able to achieve all that with a smaller population, whether 6.5 million or lower, there is no reason to go higher.

The opportunity to build up a critical mass in sunrise industries with good jobs of the future may pass us by. Our diploma holders and graduates may not be able to find challenging PMET jobs to meet their aspirations. A ""freeze"" would also mean fewer workers to do the jobs that many Singaporeans do not want to do, such as construction and cleaning, to help build HDB flats and rail lines.

From 2020 to 2030, with workforce growth further slowing to about 1% per year, and productivity growth moderating to 1% to 2% per year, we may see GDP growth of between 2% and 3% per year from 2020 to 2030, depending on both internal and external circumstances. This range of 2% to 3% growth converges with the mature economies in the OECD.

Rather, we have laid out the various needs and considerations, and are making provisions for the future. We need population projections to make infrastructure plans.

Our forefathers came here from many lands, around the archipelago and further afield. Most Members would not have to go very far back in our own families to find somebody who came to Singapore from elsewhere and decided to sink roots here.

Madam, we have, in the White Paper, made provision for up to a 6.9 million population. The public reaction so far has been less than euphoric, to say the least. The Government has been careful to say that more immigrants are needed because Singaporeans are getting older. Yes, we need growth and continued prosperity. But – there are many buts. But Singapore is already so crowded. But foreigners will take away some of our jobs. But do we really want to keep on growing?",12,435,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00435
2013-02-04-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Singapore is crowded as is. The current bottlenecks, especially transport, are already there.

While 6.9 million is a big number, when we examine it closely, we are already slowing down population growth rate from an average of 2.5% in the last 30 years to about 1.35% in the next 20 years. So, this is almost half the rate that we used to grow and, at these reduced rates, by 2030, the number comes up to a maximum of 6.9 million.",14,437,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00437

Within this constraint, my most severe reservation about the White Paper is the ratio of citizens to non-citizens. Currently, we have less than two Singaporeans to one non-Singaporean, which is already low for me. But in future, this may potentially go down to less than 1.5 1. And then you ask, what is the point of it all?",15,438,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00438

At the same time, can we moderate the flow of immigration as we strive to grow our citizen population? Only within these figures can the notion of ""maintaining a strong Singapore core"" make sense. At the same time, we need to continually review and continually enhance the privileges of being a Singapore citizen. This must be on the Government's radar screen all the time. And together with this, let me ask squarely this question  why are so many people so unhappy with the Population White Paper? First, not many of us want more people, more strangers living in our midst. I have addressed that briefly in my remarks on procreation.",17,440,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00440

Let me say this, suppose we keep the 6.9 million figure, but the Government promises more than enough trains and homes; a steady supply of good jobs if you can work, unemployment benefits if you cannot, and a top-up to your salary if you do not draw a high enough salary. Suppose, as long as you are Singaporean, you are assured of a place in the sun, even if there are more people, simply because this is our land, and the land of our parents. In healthcare, housing and education, you will have a safety net. How is that? Is that not a good thing for Singaporeans?",18,441,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00441

We do our best to get every Singaporean a job, saying that a job is the best welfare, a view that I certainly agree with. For years, we have trumpeted our low spending on direct welfare and lack of unemployment benefits – if we do not work, we do not get paid; otherwise, we would get soft and we would be landed with a large government deficit like many ""soft"" western models.

We should recognise that this is a fundamental change because it shows that we are deviating from one of our most deeply-held past practices. This building ahead of demand is a move I fully support and I am glad the Prime Minister himself has stated this categorically. I also urge the Government to draw up intermediate milestones in five years (or 2017) or in 10 years, what will happen and communicate them clearly so that Singaporeans can better visualise and, for that matter, Singaporeans can also hold Government accountable to these milestones.",23,446,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00446

I am sure we do not want a 2030 headline to read ""Singapore − a country in decline"". That we need more people is partly because we need growth. Growth is good because it gives us a better life. And so, Government must also illustrate clearly how as a result of the population policies, an intended objective is to create better job opportunities and higher salaries for Singaporeans.

It is non-exclusionary. Foreigners who come here, too, are under protection of law, and have the same rights to infrastructure.

2013-02-04-T-019,Seng Han Thong,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"The first concern is the impact of 6.9 million population. People asked  can Singapore really accommodate a population of 6.9 million by 2030? Even so, will we be filled to the brim and will there be ""room for further development""? Minister Khaw Boon Wan had later clarified that 6.9 million is the ""worst case scenario"". What some people failed to understand are why we need immigrants and why there would be a ""worst case scenario"" if they come, and not an ""everything-is-okay scenario"" or a ""best case scenario"". Why would it not be a ""80/20 scenario"" where there is a 80% chance that we would reach the projected population and a 20% chance of wait and see? The foreign arrivals would probably not behave like what we say in Hokkien ""no come no come, one come all come"".",2,478,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00478
2013-02-04-T-019,Seng Han Thong,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"During my school days in the 1960s, we had a population of over 2 million. During my children's school days in the 1990s, our population increased to over 4 million. So in 2030, our population might increase to 6.9 million. We understand that the projected population and the various goods and materials that needed to support it highlighted the growth challenges we face under the current usage of goods, materials and technology. Therefore, the number of foreigners we need is a matter of trade-offs. Deputy Prime Minister Teo had explained what it meant for us of the trade-offs and how the White Paper was trying its best to strike a balance between the different trade-offs.",3,479,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00479

When everyone sees the overcrowding in public transport, the long queues for public housing and the rising cost of living today, it is very easy for them to associate what they see now with what it will be like in 2030. This is a natural response. Everyone hopes the Government can solve the current issues and let everyone regain confidence. To them, the current issues are more pressing than the vision. We import everything, we grew from having nothing to having everything, and this did not come easy. So they asked  can we still enjoy the same quality of life in 2030? Will the price of housing and COE be beyond the reach of their children? These are serious questions.",4,480,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00480

While it is crucial for the Government to plan for the infrastructural needs of an increasing population, the ""heartware"" is equally important to ensure that Singaporeans co-exist with new citizens/foreigners and live harmoniously and bond together. At the same time, we want to have more human touch in Singapore. The current integration programme has not been as effective as desired. If we want Singaporeans to be united as a whole and support the population policies, they need to see a vision where they can ""share the fruits of growth"". This is particularly important for those who may feel marginalised by the influx of foreigners.

Currently, the agencies integrate new citizens through various programmes, from learning journeys, audio-video presentations, sharing sessions, citizenship ceremonies, invitation to grassroots events and national events. For better integration, more social gatherings and activities can be organised to promote better communication and understanding between locals and citizens. Understanding of local concerns and sensitivity can also be shared.

Some jokingly mentioned that it was raised by the men in white, thus White Paper. However, as we know, growing Singapore's population is a long-term national issue that calls for constructive debate between all stakeholders. Whether it is the Government, the Opposition or various segments of our people, we all have very big stakes in our future and we must be ready to listen and be persuaded to adjust our positions after listening. More need to be done to explain the rationale and implications of the Population White Paper so that Singaporeans can understand our demographic challenges. I support the Motion.",10,486,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00486
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to participate in the debate on this White Paper. This is an important document as it sets the way on how we will organise the future Singapore society. In short, Singapore's survival and a perpetuation of the kind of life we have been used to. In this regard, Madam, I must say I am uncomfortable at the pace at which we are discussing such an important document. Although the White Paper has been published and various quarters were consulted and many Singaporeans have given their views, many more do not understand the need to augment our population and how the various strategies are to play out. More importantly, the rationale and the genesis of a possible 6.9 million population need to be explained further as this big figure headline has generated much anxiety and angst.",1,487,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00487
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Perhaps, this is the reason why there is nothing but negative sentiments abounding from the public. Whether it is speaking to the average Singaporean on the street or listening to Singaporeans giving their views on interviews by our radio stations, there is little buy-in to the proposed population growth to almost 7 million people. Madam, it is, therefore, not surprising to see even Yahoo News reporting fury from some Singapore citizens to the future projected population to be slightly more than half, or 55%, being Singaporeans.",2,488,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00488
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Madam, most of us accept the necessity and contribution from foreigners brought to the Singapore socio-economy. Let us be honest. Without the vital contribution of the many foreign resident workers, the Singapore skyline, our way of life and, in large measures, the manageable cost of living, would be very different. Very simply, without the presence of foreigners – many of whom are here to augment our workforce – makes the local kopi-tiam food much more costly.",3,489,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00489
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"That said, the pace of foreigners landing in Singapore over the past few years has caused some concern, some tension. Yet, we know that a xenophobic Singapore will spell an early end to our economic growth and potential.

2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"We need to compartmentalise and explain better the issues that have been a bugbear for many Singaporeans. The manner that the Government is tackling rising property prices, competition of places in schools, crowded public transport and other societal changes associated with a larger population must be convincing. If we cannot do this well at this stage, I feel that the angst and tension will only worsen if we are to move forward with the strategies outlined in the White Paper.",5,491,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00491
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Many Singaporeans are sceptical that we may be able to keep the Singapore core with slightly less than half of the future anticipated population. It is another point that I suggest the Government explain better. Our core will shrink, given our current situation where couples marry later, delay or not having children, or staying single. We are simply not replacing ourselves. The White Paper has laid out various strategies that will help us grow our pool of core Singaporeans. It will be apparent that this will not be at a pace that will help sustain a viable economy. Therefore, we need parallel strategies to keep our economy going and to keep our competitive advantage.",6,492,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00492
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Singaporeans aspire for good jobs and with good pay. Our education system has been evolving and changing to prepare our students well. Our young folks will enter the workforce prepared and on good footing to take on good jobs. But, once armed with good education and work experiences, the typical Singaporean worker is also highly sought after. This is worrying, in the light of the McKinsey Global Institute Report. In the report, there would be a global demand for about 16 million to 18 million highly educated qualitative staff. Singapore workers would then be in demand and the only question is  will they be open to move elsewhere?",7,493,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00493
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Madam, judging from the first responses to the White Paper, I am concerned that the realities, the dynamics and the co-relations of a shrinking population, ageing society, workforce numbers plateauing and eventually fall, are still not apparent to many. As sure as we want to attract qualified people to come here, our people, along with this group, will be sought after by many other economies elsewhere.",8,494,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00494
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"The scenario of a small working population has some realities that are frightening. The local SMEs will leave when they cannot find skilled professionals and workers. Cumulatively, together with the same well-educated Singapore citizens being seduced to work overseas, will not augur well for us. The shrinking workforce will face pressures in surely having to share and carry a higher tax burden. This may exacerbate the situation further. At the very least, we need a diverse economy with a dynamic workforce to continue to be attractive to foreign investors to set up shop here and vibrant enough for our SMEs to build capabilities and eventually propel themselves into other markets. I might have painted an alarmist scenario of a twin exodus from the Singapore economy of both SMEs and MNCs, but once that begins to happen, we are finished.",9,495,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00495

2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"In spite of the many attempts to cool the red-hot property sector in Singapore, the prices of real estate remain stubbornly high. The amount of cash-over-valuation (COV) remains high. I was told the average COV of a 3-room HDB flat in my constituency, Clementi, is more than $23,000. The amount of COV for bigger flats is reportedly even higher. The high COV is in spite of many cooling measures and the announcements of many more HDB flats in the pipeline.",11,497,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00497
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Mdm Speaker, the investment sector is already abuzz with expectations that one of the main beneficiaries of the White Paper would be construction and the real estate related companies. Generally, the average citizens are concerned that with a population of 6.9 million, the immediate pressure would be on the number of HDB flats available and the prices they would have to pay. In spite of the assurances given by the Ministry of National Development, the people are not convinced that there would be adequate flats to meet the rise in demand for housing brought on by its population. More needs to be done to convince the Singapore citizenry on the property front.",12,498,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00498
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"One of the first major debates during my first term in Parliament was on the Motion of whether Singaporeans are stayers or quitters when the going gets tough for Singapore. Mdm Speaker, I now ask the same of the 532,000 PRs amongst us. The White Paper envisioned an annual intake of 30,000 PRs which translates into another 200,000 PRs in addition to the 532,000, making it 732,000 PRs in 2020. Of this number of PRs, how many are PRs of convenience? How many are here just because of the environment for employment security that we provide? How many would cash out and sell off their HDB flats, their condos or even their landed properties, the moment the going gets tough? How many are here after getting their PRs?",13,499,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00499
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"But on the other hand, Mdm Speaker, I have come across many Singaporeans with PR spouses. Some of whom their children are Singaporeans. In recent years, Singaporeans have clamoured for clear differentiation between Citizens and PRs, this has naturally resulted in some disenchantment of Singaporeans with PR spouses. To increase our core population of Singaporeans, perhaps the Government can consider allowing this group of PRs into Citizenship, joining their spouses and their Singapore-born children. There may not be many of them, but going by the demographics and the statistics of the White Paper, every PR will count towards the core.",14,500,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00500
2013-02-04-T-019,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"To conclude, the Government needs to convince Singaporeans that their anxiety and angst over the current day issues of a larger population with knock-on effects on property, schools and transport will be addressed, and to explain the rationale in careful detail the need for an even larger population in the future. Yes, there is a national anxiety and some angst but, instead of letting out this National Moan about the projected population numbers, there should be a National Vigour to address the Vulnerabilities of Singapore. Perhaps then, we might look at the ""numbers"" needed with more objectivity and a renewed urgency to move forward on borrowed time.",15,501,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00501

This is my worry, the projected conversion of 17,000 to 25,000 to Citizens from the 30,000 PRs yearly may even tail off, making that strategy to augment our core fall in the medium to long term.

It is proposing that Singapore citizens form 55% of the population as at 2030, which is significantly down from the 62% currently. Fifty five percent is too close to the all-important threshold of 50% majority. Further, a closer reading will also show that the 55% includes new citizens. Singapore citizens are projected to make up 3.7 million at 2030. If we were to look at the number of new citizenships given out since 2004, and add the new citizenships to be given out from now till 2030, what percentage of the population would be Singaporeans who have grown up here?

Mdm Speaker, instant citizens can be Singaporean in name and have all citizenship rights, but for the Singapore core to be strong, the core must be strongly Singaporean in values, worldview, culture, sense of place and history, and network of friends and family.

Instead of just ""hoping"", the Korean government recognised that procreation was being discouraged not by individual choice but due to structural institutional factors. The Korean government then set explicit hard targets to remove institutional obstacles to boosting TFR. These targets centred on providing institutional support for family life and promoting gender equity within the family. The government tracked hard statistics such as reducing parents' share of child-rearing costs, increasing GDP share of family-related spending, promoting arrangements for mothers to continue working, and even encouraging fathers to share housework.

The Government has justified the population growth projection largely due to its GDP targets. It is gunning for GDP growth of 3% to 4% from now to 2020, and 2% to 3% growth from 2020 to 2030.

First, the economy is but one aspect of the nation's quality of life.

Second, immigrants grow old and consume public services as well, adding to the burden of the national budget. Who will support them when they grow old? By that time, it may be very difficult to try to solve our population needs through improving TFR, but instead have another White Paper to justify bringing in even larger numbers of immigrants.",16,520,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00520

2013-02-04-T-019,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"We believe that Singapore should work towards a more modest GDP growth of 2.5% to 3.5% per year up to 2020, and from 2020 to 2030, 1.5% to 2.5% per year.

We could target to grow our resident workforce by at least 1% per annum, by getting more foreign spouses, home-makers and seniors back to work. Second, our senior citizens may not be as much of a burden as the Government makes out. Using the old-age support ratio to justify the need for higher GDP growth ignores the fact that, increasingly over time, many of our seniors would have their own economic resources to live on, reducing their need to be supported. Many seniors are also retiring later. Indeed, there is potential to tap our seniors further as a resource, rather than view them as a burden.

The Government argued that we need a critical mass in our workforce to ensure the vibrancy of the economy. However, Singaporeans today face a widening income gap, a rising cost of living, increased social friction, unhappiness at the direction this country is taking, worried about their employment prospects. Singapore ranks consistently near to the top in any international benchmark on GDP per capita but sadly, many people do not seem to be happy. What went wrong?",3,557,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00557

In order for Singapore to have critical mass for its continued economic growth, there is a need to attract more immigrants and enlarge the foreign workforce, especially in light of the current Total Fertility Rate of 1.2. This will ensure that Singapore continues to stay relevant in the midst of globalised pressures.

The fears, anxieties and insecurities are not irrational. You can feel it, especially so when the rate of immigration is exceeding the capacity of the country's infrastructure. Despite the many pleas by the Government to not worry, there is no doubt that parents are concerned about the future of their children as the Singaporean core gets increasingly diluted. What will happen to the Singapore that we have grown up to know and loved? In 2030, is Singapore still worth fighting for? These are concerns that the Government must adequately address. Singaporeans must believe in Singapore again.",5,559,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00559

That suggests the role density plays in affecting the fertility rate of a country.

This is also consistent with the finding in a recent paper by Murphy, Simon, and Tamura (2008), which provides evidence indicating that population density, or price of space, is negatively correlated with fertility rate in the United States.",7,561,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00561

In 2030, there will be a denser Singapore and as these reputable studies point out, a reduction in Singapore's total fertility rate. The most worrying aspect of this is the increase in the non-Singaporean portion in the population, especially with immigration top-ups. The Singaporean core will be compromised. The fact is we will be further from a Singaporean Singapore in 2030. In the 18 years leading up to 2030, I think we will see this worrying trend developing before our very eyes. The Government has thus far failed to address this relationship between density and fertility, which has wide ranging implications on the identity of Singapore and Singaporeans in 2030.

The best way or approach to maintain a Singaporean core that is strongly Singaporean is to improve the Total Fertility Rate (TFR).

The availability of these grants may help to lessen the financial burden in their consideration to start a family.

This is seeing that the total fertility rate of Malays has gone down year after year, and that the Prime Minister has previously said during ""Our Singapore Conversation"" last December, that the Government have really tried and worked hard to attract Malay talents from Malaysia and Indonesia, but the numbers are very small each year. My second question is what is the number or the rate of Malay immigrants that is being planned for, or estimated by the Government, to maintain this balance in the racial composition.",23,577,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00577

The breakdown according to race is as follows – half, that is, 500 are Chinese and the rest, around 500 are a combination of Malays, Indians and other races.

Madam, I refer to the front page of yesterday's Berita Minggu with the headline ""Aspirations to Build a Better Future"". This article reported that the chairman of the Suara Musyawarah committee, Mr Sallim Abdul Kadir, said that the conclusion of the participants from a recent forum is about the issue of ""Equal Opportunities"" and not the issue of discrimination.

First, while parents or households with children below 12 years old can benefit from a reduced Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) levy of $170 per month, a further concession to the FDW levy, or better still, a waiver of the levy altogether, will be useful, especially for households where both husband and wife are working. While some may advocate not having FDWs in raising our children, the reality is that households where both husband and wife are working need the help of FDWs to manage their household chores so that they can spend quality time with their children when they are home. The further concession to FDW levy will help them to better manage their household expenses and may even encourage more stay-at-home mothers to go back to work, hence contributing to our economy.",4,588,2013-02-04-T-019-S-00588

As a mother myself, I know that the cost of pre-natal medical and health checks can be quite substantial, even in restructured hospitals.

There is quite a number of childless Singaporean couples who are seeking to adopt babies or toddlers so that they can start their own families. The approval process for adoption can take quite long, ranging from a few months to even more than a year. Some may find the wait frustrating and the time that has lapsed could have been better spent establishing a strong parent-child bond. I strongly urge the Government to look into how the adoption process can be made easier so that Singaporeans can nurture the adopted child to grow up with the right values and contribute back to our Singapore society when they are older.

I think housing or not, having children is a serious choice made by a couple. There are many factors that the couple would have to consider. Housing may be just one of them, but I am happy to share that when I had my first child, I was without a flat of my own and I was staying with my parents.

Just as expectant mothers are now being given greater employment protection during and immediately after their pregnancy, I hope that our older Singaporeans can also enjoy better employment protection as well as the protection of employment benefits and wages. The Government can also pave the way for our seniors to embark on a second career in their golden years, such as becoming allied educators in our schools, or becoming caregivers in student care centres.

These schemes are comprehensive but there may be many more of us who are not aware of these assistance schemes.

2013-02-04-T-021,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,"(In English)  Mdm Speaker, I wish to reiterate that I hope the Government will implement measures to help Singaporeans start their families and manage the costs involved in doing so and help older Singaporeans be gainfully employed even in their golden years, before we resort to bringing in more foreigners or new Singaporeans or PRs. I am confident that when the Government continues to make strides in demonstrating this, Singaporeans will be assured that the Government truly has the interest of Singaporeans and our shared future above everything else which I believe is really the case. And unlike the hon Member Mr Faisal Manap, I think the measures are anything but half-hearted. I hope that the Government will take into consideration these recommendations to the White Paper.",8,602,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00602

2013-02-04-T-021,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"But, let us not dilute ourselves into an identity-less group of Singaporeans. The Singaporean core must remain strong, vibrant; that core must be in the cockpit, that core must be the driving force, not in the passenger seat.

2013-02-04-T-021,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We must not dilute our Singaporean identity – Singaporeans must be the key ingredient to how Singapore is portrayed to and understood by the rest of the world. This responsibility and privilege must be accorded to Singaporeans, with PRs and residents playing a complementary role. Every few years, Singaporeans must be able to look back and say ""My life, my family's life has improved; there is a happy future for us.""",4,606,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00606
2013-02-04-T-021,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We cannot just become stronger economically. We need to become stronger as a people, as a Nation of Singaporeans. Many Singaporeans have understandably raised their concerns as to the projected 6.9 million population by 2030. These include increased competition for jobs, an influx of foreigners to the possible erosion of our unique Singaporean heritage and identity, as well as very real infrastructure constraints, especially in housing and transport. This is why it is essential to stress from the outset of the debate that what we also want to preserve is a high quality living environment for all Singaporeans. We want Singapore to continue to remain one of the best cities in the world to live in, and a country we can proudly call home.",5,607,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00607
2013-02-04-T-021,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),Important questions to be asked are  how are we going to continue to build and nurture a strong Singaporean core that retains the nation's values of resilience and hard work? How do we do this while being held together by a strong and cohesive national identity that will stand us in good stead against the challenges of a global world?,6,608,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00608
2013-02-04-T-021,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"While economic growth is essential to our continued survival and thriving as a nation, we have to ensure that such growth is sustainable. Topping up our population with foreigners cannot be the sole or even main means by which this is achieved. An unregulated population explosion will bring with it attendant ills, such as the dilution of our Singaporean identity and heritage, not to mention longer term economic disadvantages, such as lowered productivity and suppressed wages for lower income Singaporeans, if left unchecked.",7,609,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00609
2013-02-04-T-021,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The second point, Mdm Speaker, the key tenets of meritocracy and multi-racialism cannot be harmed. In a large population, people will try to climb to the top through contacts or clan-nish ways. I have seen this in Europe in my time there spent over four years. This segregates rather than unites. Meritocracy, that is, hard work, honesty, perseverance – must continue to be a cornerstone of the Singapore way; it should be applicable to foreigners in the exact way it applies to Singaporeans. No two paths.",8,610,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00610
2013-02-04-T-021,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),The importance of meritocracy as a guiding principle for Singapore's public policy formulation must be underscored especially in the context of our multi-racial society where perceived racial inequality can give rise to unwanted tensions and divisions.,9,611,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00611
2013-02-04-T-021,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As our Prime Minister Lee put it when some Singaporeans questioned the value of meritocracy during the debate on the academic system of the PSLE last December, ""If we're not looking at merit, what are you going to look at?"" It is this system that allows individuals and communities to progress regardless of their disadvantages or disabilities and, more importantly, levels the playing field across the different ethnic and racial groups that make up the core of our Singaporean society.",10,612,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00612

The Singaporean must feel he or she is benefiting – otherwise why are we doing this?",13,615,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00615
2013-02-04-T-021,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"To add some balance, I add that before we can talk about raising our standard of living, we must realistically acknowledge that a higher standard of living that goes towards the welfare of all Singaporeans can be achieved only if there is a strong foundation for sustainable economic growth. So, growth – it is a pre-requisite. This will, in turn, ensure that the nation is able to thrive and compete amidst the challenges of an increasingly globalised world.",14,616,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00616
2013-02-04-T-021,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"However, if we accept that economic growth fuelled in part by population growth is an objective of the White Paper, then it goes without saying that such growth must translate into tangible benefits for the Singaporean core. At the most basic level, we must ensure that our domestic infrastructure and amenities have sufficient inbuilt capacity to take on the projected increase in population without being unduly strained. Good and affordable housing must continue to be one of our top priorities. We must keep in line with our aspirations to build one of the best public transport systems in the world – a key feature being the doubling of our public transport network to about 360 km by 2030, so that eight in 10 homes will be within a 10-minute walk of an MRT station.

If left unregulated, prices will gallop away, leaving Singaporeans who may not have as much liquid cash left unable to afford such high prices. This will be foolish. We need a stringent way of regulating the property market beyond the combination of Additional Buyers Stamp Duties (ABSDs) and loan-to-capital ratio. We need a predictable system which allows Singaporean demand to predominantly dictate the prices of resale private and HDB homes. How? One possible way is tailoring the Australian model to our local needs. I have spoken about this twice in Parliament and three times counting to date. Foreigners there can only buy select new developments and, thereafter, can only sell to locals. This way, a large foreign resident population will not be able to hijack control of property prices. Presently, our policies are reactive. What we need is a forward foot stance – anticipatory, predictable and sustainable regulation. We must get this right.",17,619,2013-02-04-T-021-S-00619

2013-02-04-T-025,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Government had just recently enhanced the ComCare student care subsidies in July 2012 to make student care more affordable to lower income families.

2013-02-04-T-026,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Top-line statistics on the re-employment situation in 2012 will only be available in March 2013. The results of the previous ad-hoc survey on the retirement and re-employment practices in Singapore conducted in the last quarter of 2011 showed that most employers were prepared for re-employment even before the Retirement and Re-employment Act came into effect on 1 January 2012.,1,643,2013-02-04-T-026-S-00643
2013-02-04-T-026,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"According to the earlier survey results, some 11,500 local employees turned 62 in the year ending June 2011 in private establishments with at least 25 employees. Nearly all or 97% of the retiring cohort in 2011 were offered employment beyond 62. This comprised 66% who were allowed to continue working on their existing contracts and 31% who were offered re-employment under a new contract. Of those who accepted re-employment in the same job, 17% had their wages adjusted downwards, with a median wage cut of 12%.",2,644,2013-02-04-T-026-S-00644

MOM provides conciliation services to employees, unions and employers to help them resolve these disputes. If the dispute cannot be resolved through conciliation, employees may appeal to the Minister for Manpower if they have been unfairly denied re-employment, or lodge a claim if they have received an unreasonable re-employment offer or Employment Assistance Payment. In most of these 32 cases, the employees and employers have reached a successful settlement. The remaining are currently under conciliation. We urge employers to refer to the Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees when making re-employment offers to minimise disputes and to implement re-employment in the right spirit.",3,645,2013-02-04-T-026-S-00645

The employment rate of older residents aged 55 to 64 rose from 61.2% in 2011 to 64.0% in 2012, and the number of re-employment disputes that has been lodged with MOM has been low. Much of this can be attributed to the tight labour market situation and the efforts of the tripartite partners in promoting re-employment. We will continue to monitor the employment landscape for older workers with a view to enhancing employment opportunities for older Singaporeans.",4,646,2013-02-04-T-026-S-00646

From 1 April 2013, new hawker centre cleaning contracts called by NEA will only be awarded to cleaning contractors accredited under the Enhanced Accreditation Scheme (EAS). The EAS requires the accredited companies to, among other conditions, adopt progressive wages for their local cleaners. This means that full-time local cleaners hired under the NEA's new contracts will be paid starting basic wages of at least $1,000 per month.",1,648,2013-02-04-T-027-S-00648

We are currently engaging the TCs and HAs to encourage them to appoint only accredited cleaning contractors for general cleaning and table cleaning activities respectively. We have also been sharing our cleaning contract tender specifications with the TCs and HAs and will continue to do so. We hope that the TCs and HAs will be able to see the value in engaging accredited cleaning companies which are able to meet the demands of the hawker centres.,2,649,2013-02-04-T-027-S-00649

2013-02-04-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Myanmar's reform efforts over the past year have been significant. At the 14 May sitting last year, I informed the House that the ASEAN Leaders had welcomed Myanmar’s free and fair by-elections of 1 April 2012, in line with ASEAN’s support for Myanmar's implementation of its Seven-Step Roadmap to Democracy. The by-elections brought Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, into Myanmar’s Parliament for the first time.",1,651,2013-02-04-T-028-S-00651

The road ahead, nevertheless, remains challenging due to Myanmar's many developmental needs, particularly in human resource development. The country needs the continued support of the international community to tackle these challenges and maintain momentum for its reforms. For this reason, ASEAN has consistently maintained that sanctions on Myanmar should be lifted to encourage broad-based development and help Myanmar's government to continue on the path of reform.",3,653,2013-02-04-T-028-S-00653
2013-02-04-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"ASEAN is thus heartened that our long-standing advocacy has found resonance with the international community. Many countries have recognised and reciprocated the positive steps taken by Myanmar's government over the past year. The US lifted a nearly decade-old ban on most imports from Myanmar in November 2012, just before a historic visit by President Barack Obama, while the EU earlier announced that it would suspend most sanctions. Japan has decided to waive more than half of Myanmar’s debts. Such steps send a clear signal that the international community wants to help Myanmar integrate into the global system, which would in turn improve the lives of its people.",4,654,2013-02-04-T-028-S-00654

Myanmar is working hard to ensure a successful Chairmanship year with the support of the ASEAN Member States. On our part, Singapore will continue to provide capacity building programmes for Myanmar officials in preparation for their Chairmanship, and to help Myanmar deliver a successful outcome. These are part of the broader support that Singapore, as a neighbour and a fellow ASEAN member, has given to Myanmar's reform efforts. In January 2012, we signed the Singapore-Myanmar Technical Cooperation Programme MOU during President Thein Sein's State Visit to Singapore. Under this MOU and other existing training programmes, we provide training to Myanmar in economic development, human resource development, and public administration, which Myanmar has identified as priority areas for development.",5,655,2013-02-04-T-028-S-00655

2013-02-04-T-029,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the recent weakness in our export and industrial production numbers are indications of a declining trend in our economy's competitiveness and whether there are early signs of hollowing out within our manufacturing and industrial sectors.,1,657,2013-02-04-T-029-S-00657
2013-02-04-T-029,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Singapore’s sluggish performance in exports and industrial production was largely due to the challenging external economic conditions. In particular, exports to developed economies such as the US and EU were weighed down by the slow growth of these economies. Other East Asian economies that export to these markets, such as South Korea and Chinese Taipei, were similarly affected.",1,658,2013-02-04-T-029-S-00658
2013-02-04-T-029,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"While the small and open nature of our economy has made us vulnerable to swings in global economic conditions, international rankings indicate that our economy remains competitive. For example, Singapore maintained its position as the second-most competitive nation globally, after Switzerland, in the 2012 Global Competitiveness Index by the World Economic Forum. In addition, according to a 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, Singapore is the third-most competitive city in the world, after New York and London.",2,659,2013-02-04-T-029-S-00659
2013-02-04-T-029,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Our manufacturing sector also remains attractive to investors. In 2012, fixed asset investments totaled S$16 billion, a 17% increase from the preceding year. Furthermore, rather than a hollowing out of businesses, net business and company formation in the manufacturing sector rose by 14% year-on-year in the first three quarters of 20121. Beyond investor interest, industrial production has been supported by our diversified manufacturing base, which limits the impact of global industrial shocks. For instance, the electronics cluster's weak performance in 2012 was offset by strong growth in the biomedical manufacturing and transport engineering clusters.",3,660,2013-02-04-T-029-S-00660
2013-02-04-T-029,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Going forward, our position as a Global-Asia Hub – where international companies can access opportunities in Asia and Asian companies can expand beyond their domestic markets – as well as our strong fundamentals, such as our highly skilled workforce and excellent connectivity, will continue to put us in good stead to attract high-value manufacturing investments.",4,661,2013-02-04-T-029-S-00661
2013-02-04-T-029,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"At the same time, we will continue to encourage exports directly by facilitating market access for local companies. Besides pursuing good-quality Free-Trade Agreements (FTAs) with key economic partners such as the EU and members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we have also increased our economic linkages with emerging economies in South Asia, the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.",5,662,2013-02-04-T-029-S-00662
2013-02-04-T-029,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,These strategies will help to keep our manufacturing sector and the overall economy competitive and resilient.,6,663,2013-02-04-T-029-S-00663
2013-02-04-T-030,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,asked the Minister for Health (a) if he will give an update on the Ministry's investigation of the two clinics which provide medical examinations to foreign workers; and (b) what measures are put in place to ensure that medical screenings for foreign workers are conducted properly and professionally.,1,664,2013-02-04-T-030-S-00664
2013-02-04-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The medical screening of foreign workers is a requirement of the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for pre-employment screening and renewal of work passes.

2013-02-04-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,Investigations are still on-going. Appropriate regulatory actions will be taken against the clinics if they are found to have breached the Private Hospital and Medical Clinics Act and relevant licensing conditions.

2013-02-04-T-031,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"To provide students in SAP schools with an immersive language environment, assembly periods and most of the non-examination subjects are conducted in Chinese. SAP schools also emphasises the transmission of cultural values that are relevant to our Singapore context. The plan is for our SAP schools to continue to seek more effective ways of nurturing bilingual and bicultural students. This is a challenging task as students are exposed, through the internet and mass media, to a variety of cultural norms.",3,673,2013-02-04-T-031-S-00673

2013-02-04-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),"As Mr Teo has noted, MAS has taken steps to educate Singaporeans on the risks of investing in gold buy-back schemes. Companies operating gold buy-back schemes, which are unregulated, are also listed on the MAS Investor Alert List (IAL).",1,685,2013-02-04-T-034-S-00685
2013-02-04-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),"Deputy Prime Minister Tharman had previously explained in this House MAS’ approach to regulation. Schemes that involve investors acquiring direct ownership of physical assets, such as gold, land, art or wine, are presently not regulated. These physical assets are traded by various entities for commercial purposes. In the case of gold, these entities include jewellers, refiners, manufacturers and import-export firms. Trading in physical assets has therefore not been included within MAS’ regulatory ambit, which covers financial products.",2,686,2013-02-04-T-034-S-00686
2013-02-04-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),But regulatory boundaries are not static. We have seen cases of physical commodities being marketed in schemes that purport to be an alternative financial investment. MAS is reviewing whether there is a need to refine its regulatory framework to account for changes in the investment landscape.,3,687,2013-02-04-T-034-S-00687
2013-02-04-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),"In its review, MAS will have to balance the cost of extending its regulatory ambit with the need to provide customers adequate protection. An overly-regulated environment will stifle legitimate businesses and innovations that may well be in consumers’ interests. We have to find the right balance.",4,688,2013-02-04-T-034-S-00688
2013-02-04-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),MAS will also consider ways to limit the scope for entities to mislead or deceive consumers through false advertising. Some of these schemes being marketed as alternatives to traditional financial investments entice consumers through exaggerated claims of returns. MAS intends to work with the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (ASAS) and other Government agencies to tighten the rules for advertising.,5,689,2013-02-04-T-034-S-00689

2013-02-04-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),"MAS will continue to step up its efforts to alert consumers to potential pitfalls when dealing with unregulated investments or entities. Should consumers choose to deal with unregulated entities, they must be fully aware of the risks involved with the investment, the credibility and reliability of the persons they are dealing with, and their channels for recourse should anything go wrong.",7,691,2013-02-04-T-034-S-00691
2013-02-04-T-035,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Acting Minister for Manpower between 2008 and 2012 (a) how many workers did not receive compensation from their employers after the Labour Court ruled in their favour and what recourse do they have if they are unable to engage their own lawyers to claim these payments in the civil courts; and (b) how many companies have failed to comply with the Labour Court's order and what action can the Ministry take against such errant employers.,1,692,2013-02-04-T-035-S-00692
2013-02-04-T-035,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Between 2008 and 2012, the Labour Court issued a total of about 7,400 Orders for payments in favour of workers. Of these, about three quarters were fully paid and 5% were partially paid. The remaining 20% did not receive payment of the amount ordered. Most of these defaulting companies are small and face financial difficulty or have ceased operations.",1,693,2013-02-04-T-035-S-00693
2013-02-04-T-035,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Workers who were awarded payment by the Labour Court and did not receive payment from their employers may enforce the Orders by way of writ of seizure and sale through the Subordinate Courts. This process does not require them to engage a lawyer. MOM officers at the Labour Court facilitate the process by advising workers on the procedures involved, and helping them prepare the necessary documents. However, whether the workers get any payment would depend on whether the companies have any assets left for sale.",2,694,2013-02-04-T-035-S-00694

2013-02-04-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Medisave is designed primarily to help patients pay for hospitalisation expenses and expensive outpatient treatments such as chemotherapy and dialysis. Over the years, we have gradually expanded Medisave use to include outpatient treatments for chronic diseases at polyclinics, GPs or the Specialist Outpatient Clinics, as well as selected vaccinations such as Hepatitis B and pneumococcal vaccinations and screening such as colonoscopy and mammography, to make these more affordable. Patients can use up to $400 per Medisave account to pay for these every year.",1,703,2013-02-04-T-038-S-00703

2013-02-04-T-040,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As a nation, I believe we all want to support the development of the arts and culture, and promote a more creative and innovative society. At the same time, artistic expression must respect the rule of law and show consideration for others who share the common space in our multi-racial and multi-religious society. For its part, the Government has to bear the responsibility of balancing the interests of different segments of society, who may hold different and sometimes opposing views on issues.",1,711,2013-02-04-T-040-S-00711
2013-02-04-T-040,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Within this context, the space for artistic expression is not static; it will continue to evolve. Indeed over the years, Singapore has come a long way in the development of a creative culture. Our artists now have more opportunities to develop their craft, and showcase their creative talents. Singaporeans, in turn, enjoy an abundance of options when it comes to arts and cultural offerings. As our society matures and becomes more diverse, I am confident that the space for artistic expression will continue to grow. For this to happen, it is important to have continued dialogue and engagement between the diverse segments of our community, so that there is mutual understanding, tolerance and respect for different views and perspectives.",2,712,2013-02-04-T-040-S-00712
2013-02-04-T-040,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This is also why we see the need for arts and culture to be part of the daily lives of Singaporeans. This was a gap identified in the recent Arts and Culture Strategic Review (ACSR), which is why MCCY is strengthening our community arts programme, to enable the experience of arts and culture by one and all in the community. A deeper appreciation of the intrinsic value of creativity and the arts will further pave the way for Singapore to become a more creative society.",3,713,2013-02-04-T-040-S-00713
2013-02-04-T-040,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Another key strategy in developing a more creative and innovative people is to invest more in arts education and a curriculum which encourages creative expression within the context of a holistic education. This will build not only future creative talent, but just as importantly, a discerning audience that is appreciative and supportive of the artistic expression. This will require strong programmes to ensure that our students learn about the value of the arts and acquire the skills and dispositions to express themselves creatively, while maintaining a sense of responsibility and an understanding of our social context. Our efforts in promoting artistic and creative education will lay the foundation for a creative society in the years to come.",4,714,2013-02-04-T-040-S-00714

2013-02-04-T-041,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The employment situation for older workers has improved significantly over the last 10 years. The employment rate of older residents aged 55 to 64 rose from 45.2% in 2003 to a new high of 64% in 2012 – comparable to other advanced economies. This is mainly attributed to the tight labour market and measures to improve the employability of older residents, such as the successful implementation of the re-employment legislation. There is also a growing recognition that older Singaporeans can continue to make valuable contributions at the workplace.",1,716,2013-02-04-T-041-S-00716

Recognising that the key to dealing with workplace discrimination lies in changing the mindsets of employers, TAFEP takes a moral suasion approach to encourage fair employment practices. TAFEP also conducts research with employers, employees, job seekers and co-workers to understand and find better ways to overcome the employment hurdles faced by older Singaporeans. Such publications are made available to the public.",2,717,2013-02-04-T-041-S-00717

Thus far, employers approached by TAFEP have heeded TAFEP’s advice and made adjustments to their employment practices, for example, by removing age criteria from job advertisements.",3,718,2013-02-04-T-041-S-00718
2013-02-04-T-041,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Addressing age discrimination is more of an ongoing journey than a destination, and requires the concerted efforts of all members of Singapore society.

2013-02-04-T-042,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"asked the Acting Minister for Manpower whether his Ministry will consider allowing foreigners on student passes to take up part-time work in designated industries such as food and beverage, to ease the current labour shortage.",1,720,2013-02-04-T-042-S-00720
2013-02-04-T-042,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As a matter of principle, foreign students in Singapore should be focused on their studies and not work. Foreigners who would like to work in Singapore should apply for a work pass. Allowing foreign students to work will blur this distinction and encourage abuse, since a foreigner may enter Singapore under the pretext of ""studying"", but with the intent to actually find work.",1,721,2013-02-04-T-042-S-00721
2013-02-04-T-042,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"However, we do allow some foreign students to work in Singapore. Foreign students studying in Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), for example our publicly-funded Universities and Polytechnics, can work in Singapore during their period of study. These are institutions where there are other controls on international student numbers, and where we are assured of stringent admission criteria and quality. Foreign students in these institutions are allowed to work up to 16 hours per week during term time, and with no restriction on the hours during vacation. They can work in any part of the economy, including the F&B industry.",2,722,2013-02-04-T-042-S-00722
2013-02-04-T-042,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We are aware of the manpower difficulties faced by employers in our tight labour market. We have an estimated 90,000 untapped pool of economically inactive residents2, including older persons and women, who had dropped out of the labour force for various reasons, but who welcome the opportunity to return to work. By having more flexible working arrangements and redesigning traditional job scopes, employers can tap on this pool of latent manpower. To further encourage employers to hire older Singaporeans, the Special Employment Credit (SEC) scheme was also enhanced last year. For each Singaporean employee aged above 50 who earns up to $3,000 monthly, employers will receive an SEC of up to 8% of the employee’s monthly wages3. Additional assistance is also available through schemes like ADVANTAGE, which supports employers by defraying some of the costs involved in redesigning jobs for older workers, such as through automation. To recruit more locals, employers should approach WDA’s network of career centres at the Community Development Councils (CDCs), the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) or CaliberLink.",3,723,2013-02-04-T-042-S-00723
2013-02-04-T-042,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"On a more fundamental level, we also need to re-orientate our thinking, from ""where can we find more workers"" to ""how can we do things differently so that we are able to do more with what we have"". This is because the manpower challenges of a tight labour market are a long-term issue, and the sustainable solution lies in improving productivity and upgrading the economy.",4,724,2013-02-04-T-042-S-00724

2013-02-04-T-043,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"There are many complex factors that could affect a student’s PSLE aggregate score. Individual motivation, discipline, effort, learning difficulties and academic aptitude of the student all play a role.

International studies show that in all countries, students' test scores are correlated with the socio-economic and educational background of parents.",2,727,2013-02-04-T-043-S-00727
2013-02-04-T-043,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We have 187 Primary schools, spread across the island, each with its own catchment of students. Given the complex factors that affect students' performance and the spread of students, we see a range of students' test scores across our schools. We should, however, interpret the highest and lowest median with caution. The school that had the lowest median also has several students who were in the top 10% of the PSLE cohort. In fact, all Primary schools, even those with lower median aggregate scores, have students who scored in the top 10% nationally for PSLE.",3,728,2013-02-04-T-043-S-00728
2013-02-04-T-043,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Beyond test scores, our schools, including those with lower median scores, provide opportunities for students to develop themselves. Schools, in their own ways, excel in co-curricular activities and provide academic and other support for the students' overall development. It is important that we move away from judging a school by just its test scores.",4,729,2013-02-04-T-043-S-00729

2013-02-04-T-047,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,The subsidiary legislations were reviewed with inputs from the professions. The process took more time than expected due to the complexities of regulating multiple professions.

2013-02-04-T-048,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Currently, Medisave is designed primarily to help patients pay for hospitalisation expenses and selected outpatient treatments. It is accumulated over the course of one's working life, while the bulk of the healthcare expenses tend to occur when one is older. As post-retirement healthcare costs can vary significantly, we need to strike a careful balance between allowing greater use of Medisave to improve current affordability and the risk of premature depletion.",1,746,2013-02-04-T-048-S-00746
2013-02-04-T-048,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Medisave withdrawal limits today are generally sufficient to cover the bulk of healthcare bills in Class B2/C wards in public hospitals, after taking into account Government subsidies and insurance. For instance, more than eight in 10 subsidised cases pay less than $100 out-of-pocket for their hospital bill. We have recently revised the annual withdrawal limit for selected outpatient treatment to $400. Setting withdrawal limits judiciously to maintain some cash copayment also helps to prevent over-consumption and moderate cost escalation. Those who still have difficulty paying for their healthcare bills are helped through Medifund and other financial assistance schemes.",2,747,2013-02-04-T-048-S-00747

Through AIC and the Health Promotion Board (HPB), MOH will continue to work closely with the grassroots and community partners, including the Family Service Centres and Senior Activities Centres, to encourage more eligible Singaporeans to join the scheme and to assist them in their applications if required.

2013-02-04-T-057,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao,"asked the Acting Minister for Manpower in each year from 2008 to 2012 as applicable (a) how many requests were lodged by employees for assistance to resolve employment disputes under (i) the tripartite mediation for PMEs and (ii) the Ministry's voluntary mediation service; (b) out of the number of incidents for each, how many were lodged by employees aged (i) 40 to 49; (ii) 50 to 59; and (iii) 60 and above; and (c) out of the number of incidents for each, how many were lodged by female employees.",1,783,2013-02-04-T-057-S-00783
2013-02-04-T-057,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"MOM provides assistance to help employees resolve their employment disputes, such as voluntary mediation services and adjudication at the Labour Court. Most employment disputes mediated by MOM are amicably resolved between employee and employer.",1,784,2013-02-04-T-057-S-00784
2013-02-04-T-057,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Tripartite Mediation for Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) was introduced in February 2011 to help PME union members in non-unionised companies address their key employment issues4. Tripartite mediation covers employment disputes in the areas of salary arrears, payment of retrenchment benefits and breach of individual contract by the employer. So far, seven cases have been lodged by employees and almost all have been successfully resolved.",2,785,2013-02-04-T-057-S-00785
2013-02-04-T-057,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,The breakdown of employment disputes lodged by employees for voluntary mediation assistance or tripartite mediation from 2008 to 2012 is provided in Table 1.,3,786,2013-02-04-T-057-S-00786

2013-02-04-T-058,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) what is the salary band for experienced foreigners to qualify for an Employment Pass; (b) whether the Ministry will give ample notice for employers to make adjustments to their business operations when changes to manpower policy are introduced; (c) what help is available for those companies whose foreign worker passes are not renewed/approved and yet cannot find local replacements; and (d) whether any Government agency tracks the loss in business due to the tightening of rules on the hiring of foreign workers.,1,788,2013-02-04-T-058-S-00788
2013-02-04-T-058,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To qualify for the Employment Pass (EP), applicants will have to earn a salary of at least $3,000, with the exact requirements depending on his qualifications and experience. While young graduates from good institutions can qualify if they earn at least $3,000, more experienced applicants would have to earn more than $3,000 to qualify, commensurate with the work experience and quality they are expected to bring. This ensures that EP holders hired are of good calibre and do not compete unfairly with Singaporeans by coming in at lower wages.",1,789,2013-02-04-T-058-S-00789
2013-02-04-T-058,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We have not disclosed precisely how much salary is required for what age, and at what level of qualifications, as we expect employers to independently determine what is the value of the job. However, we have provided companies predictability in the EP application outcome via our online Self Assessment Tool (SAT), which will provide applicants with an indication of whether they are likely to obtain an EP or S Pass based on their age, qualifications and salary. Many employers have not tried using the SAT. We strongly encourage companies to take time to use the SAT when shortlisting candidates for interview before the candidate is selected and before submitting an EP or S Pass application. This will avoid unnecessary frustration with rejected applications. The SAT has a high degree of accuracy. In particular, if the SAT outcome is negative, it is almost certain that the candidate will be rejected if an EP application is submitted. Only a very small proportion of positive SAT outcomes will be eventually rejected, and these often relate to cases where the applicant or company has a past adverse history or if there are security considerations.",2,790,2013-02-04-T-058-S-00790
2013-02-04-T-058,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We have always given businesses time to adjust to foreign manpower policy changes. We have provided a transition period for existing work pass holders. For example, while we announced the higher qualifying salary requirements for EP in August 2011, the changes were implemented for new applications from 1 January 2012 and for renewals from 1 July 2012. For existing EP holders whose passes expired before 1 July 2012, we gave a one-time renewal of one or two years depending on when their passes expired.",3,791,2013-02-04-T-058-S-00791
2013-02-04-T-058,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Employers who are unable to renew the EPs of their existing EP holders should consider more pro-active ways of finding and attracting Singaporeans to take on such positions, such as by offering Singaporean students internship positions or vacation jobs in their companies to gain experience, and interest them to join after they graduate. In sourcing for suitable Singaporeans, companies can also tap on the Workforce Development Agency's (WDA) network of career centres at the Community Development Councils (CDCs), NTUC-Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) and CaliberLink, WDA’s one stop service point for Professionals, Managers and Executives. We also encourage businesses to tap on the many Government support schemes to raise productivity and reduce dependence on manpower.",4,792,2013-02-04-T-058-S-00792
2013-02-04-T-058,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"MTI tracks indicators of business costs and business activity closely. On business costs, we monitor indicators such as the Unit Labour Cost (ULC), rentals and utility costs, and assess their impact on our competitiveness. On business activity, we monitor sector-specific indicators, such as the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for manufacturing, as well as economy-wide indicators, such as investment commitments. MOM and MTI also gather feedback from businesses and investors on a regular basis.",5,793,2013-02-04-T-058-S-00793

2013-02-04-T-059,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh,"asked the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what is the current total floor area available to artists and arts groups under the Arts Housing Scheme (AHS); (b) what is the existing gross floor area (GFA) cap for rental subvention under AHS; (c) whether the availability of space has grown in tandem with the growth in the number of visual and performing groups over the last five years; and (d) whether there is a need to review the GFA cap for AHS.",1,795,2013-02-04-T-059-S-00795
2013-02-04-T-059,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Under the National Arts Council (NAC)'s Arts Housing Scheme (AHS), the total floor area available to artists and arts groups is about 24,000 sqm.

2013-02-04-T-059,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides what is available under the AHS, there is an additional 15,000 sqm of space for subsidised arts housing in the Goodman Arts Centre, which does not fall within the GFA cap. So, the total available space for artists and arts groups is 39,000 sqm.",2,797,2013-02-04-T-059-S-00797
2013-02-04-T-059,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Goodman Arts Centre is a pilot project under a new framework for subsidised arts housing introduced by NAC after extensive consultations with our artists and arts groups. With this new Framework for Arts Spaces, we hope to make our spaces more flexible and useable. One of the key initiatives is the introduction of more shared facilities, short-term project studios, as well as co-tenancy arrangements. These changes optimise the limited space we have, and allow the facilities to benefit more artists and arts groups, including many new and emerging practitioners.",3,798,2013-02-04-T-059-S-00798
2013-02-04-T-059,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Since the introduction of the new Framework, the number of artists and arts groups who benefit from subsidised studios have increased from around 90 in 2007 to more than 170 in 2013 with the opening of the new Aliwal Arts Centre. This represents an almost 90% increase in the number of artists and arts groups housed. This is broadly in tandem with the growth in the number of registered visual and performing arts companies from about 410 to 740 during the same period. In addition, there is a wider group of artists and arts groups who make use of and benefit from the project studios and ""pay-per-use"" rehearsal and performance spaces.",4,799,2013-02-04-T-059-S-00799
2013-02-04-T-059,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"While it is not possible for the Government to house all our artists and arts groups in Government-subsidised spaces, we regularly review how we can better meet their needs through initiatives such as the Goodman Arts Centre and the new Framework for Arts Spaces. At the same time, NAC continues to develop alternative options by working with partners such as commercial developers and community centres to co-locate artists and arts groups in their facilities.",5,800,2013-02-04-T-059-S-00800
