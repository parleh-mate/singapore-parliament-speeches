2014-03-04-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current stock of N95 masks in Singapore; (b) what is the distribution plan for N95 masks to the public in the event of an escalation of the haze situation; and (c) how will masks be distributed to the needy, and if there will be any change to the criteria used to determine who can qualify for free masks.",1,5,2014-03-04-T-002-S-00005

When needed, we would release our stock to the major retailers to meet public demand. We have also worked with the People's Association on plans to distribute the N95 masks to the needy through grassroots organisations. The criteria for the distribution of masks will be reviewed, together with the relevant Ministries.",2,7,2014-03-04-T-002-S-00007
2014-03-04-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. I believe that I have also asked for what is the stock level that is in our stockpile now. Last year, it was nine million. So, has that level been adjusted based on the learning experience from last year? Also, I would like to know  for last year, what was the lowest level the stockpile ever reached, after the releasing of the masks from our stockpile into the major retail outlets? And I would also like to ask if, within our stockpile, the Ministry has taken into consideration now the need for children-sized masks and whether there have been suppliers found for these masks. Finally, is there any learning experience that will now be taken into consideration in terms of catering to the workers who need to work during prolonged periods of haze?",1,8,2014-03-04-T-002-S-00008
2014-03-04-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Madam, I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. I mentioned earlier in my answer that there are currently available N95 masks at major retail outlets. If we look at the inventory of the major retailers, we have about 283,000 N95 masks in their inventory. Nevertheless, for the national stockpile, we have 16 million N95 masks, of which we have forward position of about 1.7 million to our retailers as well as the CCs and Zuellig Pharma, in preparation for the volcano haze in January 2014. Certainly, we have sufficient masks available. In fact, in the last few days, I went around to the retailers and I saw that their masks were readily available. I also spoke to the people I met and some of them shared with me that they have the mask at home.",1,9,2014-03-04-T-002-S-00009
2014-03-04-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The other aspect that the Member asked was the masks for children  there are currently no children N95 masks available in the market. As I mentioned earlier, it is important for us to see how the situation goes. Essentially, as I had mentioned earlier, N95 masks are generally not needed for short exposures, such as commuting from home to school and to work. They are not needed in the indoor environment.",2,10,2014-03-04-T-002-S-00010
2014-03-04-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Nevertheless, we are very mindful of our workers, especially those who perform the essential services.

2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in this Budget Debate. Before I begin, I would like to thank the Finance Minister for a heart-warming Budget where almost every Singaporean stands to gain something from it. This ""cradle to grave"" budget embraces a ""leveling up"" approach for a fair and inclusive society and providing more help to those who started off in life with less. This year's Budget has made a pronounced shift in enlarging its assistance to the middle income. In short, many major segments of our Singapore society are covered.",1,17,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00017
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Whilst the Government introduces measures to further restructure the economy with the view to creating a better future for all Singaporeans, it has not forgotten our Pioneer Generation who has contributed to the narrative of Singapore's success story. The bold and generous package to honour our Pioneer Generation is timely and commendable.",2,18,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00018
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, what I particularly like about Budget 2014 is that it signals a new social strategy of changing mindset and social norms. In his Budget speech, the Finance Minister mentioned that transforming the economy is not about technology and productivity, and definitely not about dollars and cents. It is a workplace culture where employees' views and contributions are valued up and down the line. Indeed, the progress of a country is not measured by just GDP numbers, but by how a society treats its people, especially the elderly and those less able to manage on their own.",3,19,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00019
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),This year's Budget has signaled a mindset change on how we view and value our seniors with the Pioneer Generation Package. Changing such perception and assumptions does not just rest squarely on the shoulders of the Government but is also the responsibility of the society as a whole.,4,20,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00020
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Singapore, like most countries in the world, is rapidly ageing. So, it is timely and critical that the Government, community, employers, colleagues, families and seniors themselves take this ""bull by the horns"" to tackle and manage seniors and ageing issues.",5,21,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00021
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, ageism in the workplace is very real today. Employers in Singapore have yet to fully embrace the Government's call to remove age discrimination. Older people are usually shunned, bypassed or laid off simply because of their age. Older workers are also disadvantaged when they are re-employed with ""downsized"" contracts usually with a pay reduction and lesser benefits, yet are re-employed to do the exact same work.",6,22,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00022
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"To make older workers more employable after they turn 50 and to provide incentive for employers to continue their employment, they have to be made more affordable, as evident from the Government's tiered reducing employer CPF contribution.",7,23,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00023
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Whilst some employers take the increases in CPF contribution rates in their stride, others expressed concerns that this would result in rising costs which further squeeze their profit margins and, eventually, driving up prices for consumers.",8,24,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00024
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, the real crux of the issue is ""mindset"", and it is this change which I am advocating here. Singaporeans must move away from viewing people in their 50s, 60s as ""over the hill"". Most of them, in fact, are very much far from it. In today's shrinking workforce, our seniors will be playing a very critical role to supplement the tight labour situation. They must no longer be viewed as a liability, but as able workers. Our seniors today are more active, healthier and fitter than before and they can remain productive into their 60s and beyond. Many are willing to continue working even when they reach their retirement age.",9,25,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00025
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Many of our seniors today are fit, qualified and with good work experience. They will find it quite difficult to face the thought of doing nothing over the next 25 to 30 years after their retirement. This is a potent recipe for mental and chronic illnesses. While staying employed will help build their retirement savings, it is also very much about self-worth, dignity and productive ageing. For that, being gainfully employed while one is able to work must play a big part. Our employers must value our older workers and do all they can to offer fair re-employment. Let our seniors workforce choose if they want to work or to retire. Retirement age has no bearing on one's productive capacity and denies many senior workers' aspirations for active ageing.",10,26,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00026
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"In this aspect, my first port of call, in changing mindsets, would be that of employers. Our Civil Service, being one of the largest employers, must take the lead in making its work place non-discriminatory, inclusive and an age-friendly one. Only when the majority of our employers adopt fair hiring practices will Singapore be respected as a country where meritocracy is the order of the day.",11,27,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00027
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Older workers should not be seen as just liabilities or as a ""cost component"". Rather, the main reason why companies would be willing to hire or retain their older employees is for the value of their loyalty, experience, reliability, maturity and familiarity with their jobs. They, too, have contributed to their bottom line over the years. This, surely, is worth a lot more and fully justified for fair and equitable compensation, like any other staff in the company.",12,28,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00028
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"On a related note, companies should not base their success purely on revenue and profit margins, but also on how they value and treat their staff. It would be tragic when companies would simply maximise profits at the expense of their workers, especially our older workers.",13,29,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00029
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Surely, if the company is doing reasonably well, employers ought to share its fruits with their staff, be they young or old, by rewarding and paying them fairly.",14,30,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00030
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Work remains the most effective way of building one's CPF savings and enhances their retirement adequacy. I am particularly cheered by Budget 2014's move to further restore CPF contribution rates for older workers as that will help them accumulate retirement savings faster. In 2012, less than 50% of those who turned 55 were able to set aside their Minimum Sum, whilst 40% did not meet the Medisave minimum sum. Undeniably, CPF savings are significant for our seniors, as they will depend even more on them for their retirement and healthcare needs.",15,31,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00031
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Thus, whilst I am happy with the CPF increases for those in the 50 to 55 age group, I am less thrilled for those who are 55 years and above. This is because as these senior workers get older, the contribution to their CPF savings gets a lot lesser.",16,32,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00032
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Whilst the increase in employer contribution is a welcome step towards solving this issue, the additional 0.5% contribution from the older workers eats into their disposable income.",17,33,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00033
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"These senior workers may still be servicing their housing mortgages or be supporting their children's educational expenses. This is especially so, given the changing Singapore demographics, where people are getting married and having kids at a later age, and may have upgraded their homes in their mid-career and thus may still be paying their mortgages and their children's education even when they are in their 50s.",18,34,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00034
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"The adjustments that are made to the CPF contributions, as well as the policies which the CPF Board considers in deciding the allocation to Ordinary, Special and Medisave accounts, must take into consideration our seniors' profile, in order to remain relevant, as well as to avoid causing unnecessary difficulties to our seniors.",19,35,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00035
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Even with the restoration in the CPF brought by this Budget, the CPF savings of our seniors will take a dive as they age. From next year, when they turn 55, their total CPF contribution will fall to 25% which is a significant drop of 10%. For those turning 60, their total CPF will take another 9% dip, resulting in a 20% gap between them and their younger counterparts. This means the older they get, they will face a wider gulf in their financial ability to shore up CPF savings, as well as use their CPF Ordinary Account for housing mortgages.",20,36,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00036
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to call on the Government to do more to enhance the CPF savings of older workers by making more progressive restoration to the employer's CPF contribution. The gap between older and younger workers needs to be narrowed.",21,37,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00037
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"For the 50% of members above 55 years of age who do not meet the Minimum Sum, the restoration of the employer's portion of CPF contribution is a much-needed step in the right direction. Our senior workers need all the help they can get from the Government. The employer can do the one honourable thing to show appreciation and gratitude in paying these older workers equitably.",22,38,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00038
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Rather than tinkering with the older workers' retirement savings by using CPF as a calibrating tool to make them more affordable and employable, the Special Employment Credit and, now, the Temporary Employment Credit, can act as levers to help improve and protect older workers' CPF savings whilst assisting companies cope with rising manpower costs. Perhaps, the Government can implement a scheme where employers who want to recognise the contribution of their older workers can be motivated to voluntarily restore their share of CPF contributions.",23,39,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00039
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Our society needs to have a mindset shift in the area of healthcare and ageing. The biggest challenge facing Singapore's healthcare system and most healthcare systems around the world is coping with ageing patients and the rising occurrence of chronic illnesses. My concern is that the enhanced healthcare affordability may solicit an artificial demand for healthcare services. Indeed, we need to move further upstream towards preventive healthcare rather than disease care. This is important as keeping citizens fit in the first place will reduce the need for treatments which put a further strain on our healthcare and eldercare facilities. More budget should also be set aside for preventive care.",24,40,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00040
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"We need to educate and motivate our citizens to adopt a healthy and productive ageing mindset as early as possible. They should do all they can to stay active, healthy and productive as they age. This also means staying relevant, investing in themselves by way of grooming, continuing education, training and upgrading, staying gainfully employed, securing re-employment and staying employable.",25,41,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00041
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"On a similar note, with a fast-growing ageing population – and our seniors are living longer – there will be more cases of seniors with physical and mental disabilities. As such, more social workers are observing an upward trend in the number of cases of elder abuse and neglect. In recent years, we are seeing an increase in the number of personal protection orders (PPOs) taken out by parents against abusive offsprings.",26,42,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00042
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, the issue of filial piety, the moral responsibility of family members to look after their parents and grandparents, needs to be addressed. This moral obligation to look after one's parents and elders is a common thread that cuts across all races and cultures. I am glad that this year's enhanced Parent Relief seeks to promote filial piety by encouraging and recognising individuals supporting parents and grandparents. The added feature this year is that family members can now share the Parent Relief in recognition that caring for parents is a shared responsibility.",27,43,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00043
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Elder abuse and neglect are a complex phenomenon. One third of reported elder abuse victims were aged 80 and older, and the main forms of abuse were physical abuse, neglect and psychological abuse.",28,44,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00044
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),Our young must continuously be taught the moral responsibility of looking after their parents. Educators need to ensure and reiterate the teaching of filial piety in our educational curriculum. Families must also do their part to impart such values to their children.,29,45,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00045
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"We must never make it easy for adult children to abandon ""care"" for their parents on the excuse that it is too cumbersome to look after them. Whilst the Government has and will continue to provide support to families and caregivers, there must be adequate legislation to prevent abuse of the elderly sick and helpless parents.",30,46,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00046
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"For an ageing population such as Singapore's, it is essential that we start implementing laws to protect the rights of older citizens. Society must send a clear signal that it will not condone violence against an older person by caregivers, relatives or family members.",31,47,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00047
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Indeed, this year's Budget sets the tone for the new social strategy in changing the mindset and attitude of the people, as well as social norms. The Budget goes some way towards catalysing this change, by emphasising, through the CPF restoration, that senior workers can be, and very often are, contributing fully and significantly in their work, regardless of their age. The Pioneer Generation Package does give due recognition to, and honour our seniors who had built Singapore from its humble beginnings to where we are today. Many of our seniors continue to make this contribution, irrespective of their age, and we salute them for it.",32,48,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00048
2014-03-04-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"However, it is not just about a Pioneer Generation Package that gives this special recognition to our seniors, but a whole society approach; and a change of mindset towards ageing and our commitment towards how our seniors should be honoured, treated and accepted on a day-to-day basis. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Budget.",33,49,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00049
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join the 2014 Budget debate.",1,50,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00050
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"This year's Budget, like last year's, is socially inclusive and, taken together with the Budgets since the last General Elections, we now have many measures to help us address the widening income gap among Singaporeans. I am particularly glad that the Government is no longer pursuing a ""growth at all cost"" policy and, instead, focuses on sustainable and inclusive growth. As we approach the 50th Anniversary of Singapore next year, it gives us a good reason to recognise and reward Singaporeans before us who worked hard to build Singapore into what it is today.",2,51,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00051
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"The Pioneer Generation Package is an unprecedented budgetary measure in so many ways. Firstly, it is catered for everyone aged 65 and above, and I am glad to note that the Government chose not to use means testing or any other economic criteria to define the parameters of this package. Everyone who is from the pioneer batch of Singaporeans will benefit from the $8 billion fund. That is a fair and equitable way of recognising the efforts of all those who have contributed to our nation's development in the early years.",3,52,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00052
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"The Pioneer Generation Package does not just benefit older Singaporeans but also generations after. By subsidising healthcare costs, for instance, this helps reduce the dependency ratio for younger Singaporeans going forward and reduces the economic costs of an ageing society on them.",4,53,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00053
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"While this Budget can be lauded for achieving its social aims, I feel that it completely ignored a very important issue facing Singaporeans and companies, not just SMEs. And that is the high cost of living and high cost of doing business in Singapore.",5,54,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00054
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"The Government did the right thing by sticking to its productivity push as it is central to our broader economic restructuring efforts. I fully agree and support that, in the long term, our economy must be supported by productivity-driven growth and not one that relies on cheap input factors like cheap labour. There are two issues facing companies. One is the top-line growth of revenues and business, which I believe will be best tackled by the productivity and innovation initiatives, like the PIC and PIC+, and the other good schemes announced in Budget 2014. The second and immediate issue is one of cost of doing business in Singapore. We are at a critical stage, and I feel that the Government has underestimated the impact of high business costs on our future economy.",6,55,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00055
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"In fact, this year, companies are facing a triple whammy when it comes to doing business in Singapore. First, business costs have gone up, especially rentals and utilities, and some others – transportation cost, for example. Second, cost of labour is going up because of the tightening labour market but also including new measures like the additional CPF that they have to bear. And, third, shortage of workers, as we close the tap on allowing in foreign workers, even if employers are willing to pay more to hire them.",7,56,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00056
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"We are just trying to do too many things too fast and this is hurting many companies. The key issue of cost is not just a concern for SMEs, it is also a big concern for larger companies. I have met with some top management of some large MNCs here in Singapore and they have expressed their serious concerns about the unrelenting increase in the cost of doing business, coupled with the unavailability of workers. Some have warned me that relocation is something in their minds. While MNCs are more mobile, SMEs have less choices and will have to try to stay and fight for their survival. But I urge the Government not to take this for granted as we have a huge threat just next door.",8,57,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00057
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Recently, I made a visit to a few industrial parks in Iskandar and I was shocked to see many factories already in operation and many more coming up. And companies operating in these Iskandar industrial parks are not just SMEs, but also some MNCs. If we are not careful and as more of our SMEs are forced to move to Iskandar, which seems to be the saviour for many of our Singaporean companies, some MNCs may follow them to be near their suppliers and subcontractors, which are mainly our SMEs.",9,58,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00058
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),The exodus may be larger than we imagine and so we should not ignore the potential impact on our economy as job losses may become a serious national problem in the future. We also risk hollowing our economy in the future and I would like to sound an alarm that we are close to the tipping point of this happening.,10,59,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00059
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"I have heard this argument from some Government agencies that they do not mind letting some of our SMEs shut down and relocate as this would free up workers for the sectors that the Government would like to focus on. I say that this is too simplistic an assumption because our SMEs hire two-thirds of the workforce and, moreover, many of our SMEs hire the older workers which multinational companies do not want to hire. A good number of these workers will face difficulties fitting into the sectors that the Government desires, for example, moving from a manufacturing sector to service sector. I would caution the Government against doing too much of cherry-picking of sectors and companies as we do not know which companies will remain rooted here in Singapore and which may become long-term winners.",11,60,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00060
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"I recently spoke with the CEO of a Singapore-based company listed on the Stock Exchange which operates the fifth or sixth largest coffee processing plant in Iskandar and he mentioned that the lease he has to pay to JTC for one of his plants which he operates here in Singapore is too high. In Iskandar, his company owns a freehold property that is able to employ people, including foreign labour, a lot easier than he can do here in Singapore. It is a pity, because the factory is fully automated and it is the type that we would like to be based here in Singapore. I do not think we can ever convince such companies to come back and operate their operations here in Singapore. We, therefore, risk losing such companies forever, if we are not careful with our current policies.",12,61,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00061
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Cost competitiveness. The reality is that cost and cashflow are bigger problems in our business landscape than some of us might imagine it to be. We saw a few weeks ago in the media how a subcontractor working for Keppel Shipyard could not afford to pay wages to its workers. There are others out there who also face similar problems. So, we should have seen how we could have helped them improve their cashflow so that they can survive. We have already given them the opportunities and the deterrents in our many measures to ensure that they stay on the path of restructuring and productivity. But they can only do so if they even survive in the first place. We need to help them do that. We need to look closer at the immediate needs of SMEs and help them overcome their survival issues.",13,62,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00062
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Two weeks ago, a middle-aged SME owner came to the Prime Minister's Meet the People Session, and I was helping Prime Minister at that time. In addition to six Singaporeans, he has hired one foreign worker as a machinist who has been working there for seven years, while two other foreign workers' Work Permits were not renewed last year. He begged that the renewal of his specialist machinist's Work Permit be approved, since he has no one else left to operate the machine. Otherwise, his six Singaporean workers, their families, his three children and wife will have no means of income to support themselves. So, what do we tell this SME owner about the rapid rate of restructuring?",14,63,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00063
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Cost has also been a perpetual issue for the past five to six years, and every Budget has been allocating billions of dollars to help Singaporeans, and, in some cases, companies, offset the high cost of living and doing business here in Singapore. Here, I am talking about cost to every Singaporean in general, not just to SMEs. I think all these transfers and help that the Government is doing is not an efficient way to manage things, and the right thing to do is to go and tackle the root cause of the problem in the first place, and that is to address the real cost issues that we all are facing here in Singapore, individuals and companies. The Government, I believe, has neglected this cost problem for too long and we are facing problems and, therefore, it is costing the Government more by having to do special transfers like GST package, Medisave top-ups, utility top-ups and many others.",15,64,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00064
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"While I welcome all of these measures because the Government is helping Singaporeans because of the high cost, I think we failed to address the cost issues in the past. And I hope that future Budgets will focus more on permanent solutions for cost reduction that will not cost the Government so much in transfers as it is costing us as much today.",16,65,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00065
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"The high cost of business is also affecting our ability to attract foreign multinationals to locate operations here in Singapore and also giving a rethink to many of those who are already here. I recently had lunch with a senior banker of a foreign bank, a very big bank, which has large operations here in Singapore, and he expressed his worry about Singapore losing its competitiveness and the bank having to relook at its future growth strategy here in Singapore both in terms of what it already has here and bringing future operations into Singapore.",17,66,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00066
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to talk about Government land divestment policy – JTC and rental costs in particular. Part of the loss of competitiveness is due to the high rental costs for businesses, and that can be boiled down to one key reason, and, that is, the Government's land divestment policy. JTC was a landlord for about 18% of the industrial property some 10 years ago but, today, only manages about 3% of the market. This is a huge shift and the Government lost the ability to influence rental prices, resulting in developers and investors making the money – this is passive income and not productive income that only benefits the investors, including foreigners, who can afford to invest in industrial and commercial properties as an investment tool and not as a productive activity. In return, the smaller companies find that they cannot manage the high rental costs and look for other means to cut cost, which inevitably leads to the squeezing of salaries of workers. This has led to the problem of Singaporeans unable to afford the high cost of living because the wages are not going up as far, and, therefore, having to have the Government step in year after year with transfers to help Singapore cope with the problem.",18,67,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00067
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Let me quote one employer who made this comment to me recently, ""I would be much happier being generous in salaries to Singaporean staff than supporting the high rentals.""",19,68,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00068
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"I believe it was a mistaken policy some 10 years ago for JTC to divest its properties that benefited just a few companies, especially the large developers and investors, including the REITs, and I believe we have to reverse this policy even if it means the Government having to buy back some of these REITs. In any case, the biggest REIT players are Government-linked entities like Mapletree and CapitaLand.",20,69,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00069

In the long run, if we do not do anything to reverse the situation, we will be in deep trouble as we lose companies to other locations in Asia.",21,70,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00070
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"In fact, the cost issue is so chronic that I believe it is timely that the Government focus on this and I would like to urge the Government to set up a Cost Competitiveness Review Committee, something that we did 30 years ago when we faced similar cost problems in 1985. It is useful that we take stock of our problems and causes, and try to find solutions that will help our people in the future.",22,71,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00071
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"On minimum wage, I am glad that the Government has finally realised the need for some form of a legislated minimum wage scheme, something I have been asking for the last few years. Failing to convince employers to pay higher wages by persuasion through the progressive wage system, we now have a plan which legislates the need for a minimum $1,000 wage for cleaners and, later, also for security guards. This is really welcomed.",23,72,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00072
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"The current approach will, however, add to the cost pressures for companies and, therefore, I feel the Government could have adopted my suggestion of a Government-assisted minimum wage scheme which I suggested at last year's Budget debate. Done in such a way, the progressive wage for cleaners could have kicked in without even hurting the SMEs through higher costs to them.",24,73,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00073
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),I also feel that we are neglecting the fact that there are similar low-earning workers in many other sectors of the economy and a limited progressive wage approach will not achieve the objective of helping the low-income Singaporeans manage the high cost of living. We may only be helping just a fraction of Singaporeans.,25,74,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00074
2014-03-04-T-003,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Furthermore, implementation of what the Government has announced is going to be difficult as we already saw with the caveats announced recently even before the progressive wage system could be implemented for the cleaning industry. As reported in The Straits Times on 24 January this year, certain categories of cleaners will not benefit from the so-called ""Progressive Wage System"", as swimming pool and home cleaners, firms such as those that remove construction debris from work sites, clean building facades on gondolas and animal pens in the zoo are all exempted from the Progressive Wage System.",26,75,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00075

And while cost has definitely gone up since our early years, since Independence, I think it is good to note that this report is an Internet tool designed to help human resource and finance managers calculate cost of living allowances and build compensation packages for expatriates and business travellers. It actually incorporates easy-to-understand comparisons of cost of living indices across cities.

But if we are serious about restructuring the economy in a way that is sustainable and viable for the long term, I am glad to see a clear signal and direction being set for the broader economy, instead of just a reliance on handouts or subsidies that often just paper over what really needs to be done by companies and industries to stay competitive in the global marketplace.",6,86,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00086

2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Members of this House have spoken extensively on rising labour costs and other business costs, for example, rising rentals. The Minister for Finance has attributed this to the painful adjustment process that our economy must go through to restructure to higher quality growth. While a single data point does not make a trend, does the Minister foresee this statistic getting worse before it gets better? What are the drivers of this statistic from his perspective, and how would it impact Government revenues going forward?",6,112,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00112
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Personal income tax receipts decreasing when labour market is tight suggests either that the top 20% of wage earners who pay 80% of our income taxes find it less compelling to remain in Singapore and have relocated, or that compensations have been lowered as a result of profitability of companies being impacted. To me, both scenarios would suggest that Singapore, as a business centre, is becoming less competitive. How does the Minister interpret this statistic and does he view it as a cyclical or secular development?",7,113,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00113
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"I am concerned that these two important components of Government revenue are lower because  firstly, our ability to fund all the good things that our citizens aspire to are directly contingent on how much revenue the Government raises. How do we subsidise more HDB flats, provide more education, build more MRT lines and put up more hospital beds?",8,114,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00114
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Secondly, these are the two healthiest ways for the Government to raise revenue without raising marginal tax rates and without putting extra burdens on our people; people pay more because they earn more.",9,115,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00115
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Mdm Speaker, I feel this Budget debate is a good time for us to be more outward looking and examine some of the factors that might contribute to higher budget revenue, not as an end in itself, but as a means to provide a higher quality of life for Singaporeans. How can we capitalise on global and regional trends to upscale Singapore industries and bring about higher paying, higher skilled jobs to our workers, and higher quality growth for the country?",10,116,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00116
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"The LNG sector is a good example. The Prime Minister unveiled the $1.7 billion LNG terminal at Jurong Island last Tuesday. Besides securing Singapore's energy security at competitive prices, it leads to the development of Singapore as an LNG hub. This brings a host of ancillary services and the development of an ecosystem – thousands of well-paying jobs for technicians, engineers, lawyers, accountants, traders and the likes.",11,117,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00117

2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"My question to the Minister is whether he will consider making more of such investments in areas like agriculture, palm oil, freight, coal, iron ore or metals to make Singapore a wider commodities hub.",13,119,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00119
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),How will the sale of SMX and the delisting of existing commodities contracts by CME impact us in this regard?,14,120,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00120
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Another example is Singapore being chosen as an offshore RMB hub. This status was achieved after many years of close cooperation with China at government-to-government level, business-to-business level, and people-to-people level. It was quite a pleasant surprise when Mr Zhang Gaoli, Politburo Standing Committee member, was named as co-chair of the Sino-Singapore Joint Council of Bilateral Co-operation, and announced our RMB status during the Deputy Prime Minister's visit to China. I would like to extend my congratulations to the Government for having this strategic foresight.",15,121,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00121
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"China's rise is inexorable and the internationalisation of the RMB is inevitable. Singapore, being an offshore RMB hub, is directly contributing to Singaporeans' ability to get good paying jobs in the financial sector. As Mr Ravi Menon pointed out, ""The critical factors that will determine how well Singapore develops as an RMB hub are liquidity and a range of hedging products"". In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the efforts that the MAS has embarked upon to further develop and augment Singapore's status as an RMB hub and as a financial centre.",16,122,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00122

2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"In an article on 18 January 2014, the Economist magazine highlighted Singapore's efforts in setting up Blk 71 at Ayer Rajah Crescent as a home for 100 tech startups. It mentioned that the National Research Foundation has been supporting this initiative, generously topping up investments by accredited incubators by putting in $5 for every $1 invested, up to a maximum of $500,000. But the magazine also warned that with the tech startup sector being an extremely competitive space, government policy can make a big difference. It says, and I quote, ""Even in Silicon Valley, defence dollars during the second World War and the Cold War primed the pump before venture capital took over.""",18,124,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00124
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"I applaud the Government's efforts in fostering entrepreneurship and innovation. The question I would like to ask the Minister is  given that rental costs are a real concern to businesses, and a real impediment to cash-strapped startups, will the Government continue to support this effort by putting out more subsidised office space, especially to home-grown companies? Will the Government look kindly at employment passes for this budding sector? And will the National Research Foundation continue to support startups financially?",19,125,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00125
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Mdm Speaker, like what Dr Lim Wee Kiak has mentioned, Singapore is one of the few countries to have a mechanism for another source of income away from taxes, in the form of Net Investment Returns Contribution, or, put simply, investment income from our national reserves. While it is debatable whether our SWFs assume more or less risks to bring about more or less returns, what is clear and incontrovertible is that NIRC has consistently given us an $8 billion buffer every year for the past several years, without which, Government expenditure would have been severely constrained.",20,126,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00126
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"My question is, therefore, whether we should devote more resources to this initiative to augment our Budget revenue. A good starting point would be to look at the Co-Investment Programme. In Phase One of the Co-Investment Programme, the Government has set aside $160 million with Heliconia Capital Management, which catalysed over $500 million of investments from the private sector. In Phase Two of the programme announced in this Budget, the Government is setting aside $150 million to catalyse SME Co-Investment Fund II and SME Mezzanine Growth Fund.",21,127,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00127
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),I see many benefits of the Co-Investment Programme.,22,128,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00128
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"One, the Government is actively encouraging capital-constrained SMEs to internationalise and regionalise. Two, Co-Investment Programme maintains commercial discipline in investment decisions by letting the private sector take the lead. And, three, the Government, by taking a small principal stake in these funds or companies, is able to directly participate in growth opportunities, especially in the more energetic industrialising countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Indonesia, India and China.",23,129,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00129
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"In this instance, the Government is not crowding out private investments because it takes a small principal position in each venture and works closely with the private sector to identify opportunities. It operates in the middle market of SMEs, away from the investments made in MNCs by our other SWFs. The Government further gains a mechanism to translate growth in the region directly into revenues for the national coffers, again, not as an end in itself, but as a means to fund our growing developmental expenditures and to bring about more benefits for Singaporeans.",24,130,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00130
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"To this end, I would like to ask the Government to consider expanding the Co-Investment Programme to a meaningful scale so that dividends accrued can be big enough to make an impact to NIRC in the future. In effect, we are growing another golden goose that will lay us more golden eggs.",25,131,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00131
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, LNG, RMB, tech startups are all examples of Singapore trying to maintain its relevance in this global village.",26,132,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00132
2014-03-04-T-003,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),This is essential for quality growth and to bring about good jobs for our people. This is also essential to maintain social mobility and cohesion as Singaporeans have more opportunities to find rewarding careers within Singapore and to see Singapore as a worthy place to call home.,27,133,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00133

2014-03-04-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Finance Minister spoke about changing our social norms in three broad areas. At the workplace, there was a call for a workplace culture where employees are appreciated and valued so as to engender an empowered workforce with real knock-on benefits on productivity. This was closely associated with the call for Singaporeans to aim not just for competence but excellence. Equally important, there was a call on employers to understand that doing the job well was the goal, not long hours on the job. Finally, the Finance Minister urged all of us, as consumers, to change our habits, become at ease with self-service facilities and, very importantly, treat service staff with respect.",8,144,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00144
2014-03-04-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The cultural changes required to transform our economy would have to be deep and sustained, with resources devoted to educative efforts and, in the appropriate case, with a regime of incentives and disincentives to modify behaviour.

The results are likely to be progressive, with ups and down, but with the desire that, ultimately, only a minority of individuals will be more resistant to change than others.

The overwhelming majority of Singaporeans in this age bracket do not qualify for the PGP and would need to build up their Medisave and retirement balances in light of the higher MediShield Life premiums.

While the Government has strengthened and widened its social welfare net, it is imperative that it improves on its one-stop social service centres like our CDCs and the training of the staff manning them. By going to one centre in their neighbourhood, citizens should have most of their needs met – finding a job, financial assistance, helping education and skills development, and accessing help schemes offered by various VWOs – and all delivered with empathy.",10,167,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00167
2014-03-04-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),Frontline staff in polyclinics and hospitals should also be trained to help citizens who find it hard to pay their medical bills upfront. We must ensure that no one falls through the cracks. This includes those who do not qualify for public assistance but are facing genuine financial difficulties in paying their medical bills.,11,168,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00168
2014-03-04-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Some residents at my Meet-the-People Session (MPS) report that they were given the impression at hospitals that they will not get the necessary check-ups, operation or medication if they cannot afford to pay for these.

2014-03-04-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"We value self-reliance, but illness should not lead to despair, destitution or bankruptcy. The human element at these points of contact is crucial – as no matter how we explain all the subsidies and schemes available, no matter how many dialogues we have on the ground, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. It is fruitless to explain to them how wonderful the pudding is and all the complicated ingredients in it, whether in four languages or six dialects – but then, when it comes to the crunch, the people at the frontline do not show them the pudding, much less invite them to eat it.",13,170,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00170

2014-03-04-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Why not simplify it? It does not take much to rename it ""MediLife"", a three-syllable word like Medisave and Medifund. It will also make it easier for us to explain to our pioneers who, to be honest, really do not care much for the details. They just want to be assured that they can afford medical treatment when they need it. We can say in simple terms, as I am sure many of us have on the ground, ""Auntie, do not worry about paying for your medical bills, have Medisave. Government will top up Medisave for you every year – for life – $200 to $800 a year. The older you are, the more you will get. Also do not worry about big hospital bills, have MediLife. This is your insurance for life. Even if you have a heart problem or other health problems, do not worry, you will be covered. Oh, Aunty, you are 82 already? Do not worry. The Government will pay your premiums for you. And do not worry about going to specialist outpatient clinics or polyclinics – you get a big discount – extra 50%. No money still and still cannot afford to pay your medical bills? Do not worry, have Medifund. If you still worry, please come and see me!""",15,172,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00172

2014-03-04-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"My second point is on preventive healthcare. While ensuring that public concerns over healthcare costs are addressed, we should step up our focus on preventive healthcare for our active elderly, and provide more funding for wellness centres and programmes. To motivate our seniors, we should find meaningful ways to reward those who take care of their overall well-being, not only their physical health but also mental, emotional and social health, because these tend to be linked.",17,174,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00174

He works hard at keeping himself fit – swims twice a day and also goes to the gym. As we got out of the pool, I told him about our Pioneer Generation Package, and I found myself having to knock on wood when talking about hospital bills and such, because he is such a healthy person. His first response was, ""Oh, that is good, but nothing for me when I am fit and healthy?"" Indeed, a few other seniors who join my constituency's wellness programmes also echoed that view, ""Why must we wait until we are sick or dying before enjoying the benefits of being a pioneer?""",18,175,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00175
2014-03-04-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Indeed, while I understand the reasons for focusing the PGP on healthcare, it would be meaningful to complement that with schemes that can improve their quality of life while they are still healthy. It need not be a top-down Government approach, from this Budget alone; it can be a ground-up whole-of-society approach. For this, I propose that the CHAS medical subsidy card, which all our pioneers will now be eligible for under the PGP, be turned into a special identification card for our pioneers. We can call it the Pioneer card. This Pioneer card should have a distinctive design and colour – perhaps the colours of the flag – half in red and the other half in white. This card can then double up as a distinctive identification card for them, while still being a CHAS card.",19,176,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00176
2014-03-04-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Such identification will make it easier for other organisations to play their part to also honour them with discounts or special treatments for various services and programmes. For example, the community can then extend to those with the Pioneer card special discounts or even free access to some of the community activities and wellness programmes. Such a move will also ensure that honouring our pioneers is not just a package in the Budget, but an ongoing and continuous lifetime whole-of-society effort.",20,177,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00177
2014-03-04-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"With many organisations stepping up and helping the seniors in this way, the worry of many of our elderly over the rising cost of living can also be mitigated to some extent.

The question is, are our youths set as a generation to prove the cynics wrong? The previous generations which have transformed our country did that, not by pessimistic chatter, but by defying the odds and believing that they could do it. This resilience and confidence come from a strength of character and unity that is built over time, and renewed by practice.",25,182,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00182

Across the richer countries in the world, the wages of the typical worker, adjusted for cost of living, are largely stagnant. In America, the real wage has hardly moved over the past four decades. Even in places like Britain and Germany, where employment is reaching new highs, wages have been flat for a decade. In Singapore, we have had real wages going up over the years, but how long can this be sustained?",26,183,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00183

The results were, of course, helpful in designing urban street and peaceful residential areas. The third example is a fun one.

This year's Budget is aimed at creating a society of higher ideals, specifically, a society where ""the old would be looked after; the middle-aged would be fully employed, the young will be well-developed, the handicapped and the poor would be taken care of"".",25,218,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00218
2014-03-04-T-003,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The Government has set aside $8 billion to set up the Pioneer Generation Package, a unique package that sets out to take care of 450,000 Singaporeans aged 65 years and above this year, subsidising their healthcare costs for life, relieving the burdens of our seniors. In times of prosperity, we have not forgotten that the benefits we enjoy are the fruits of labour of the previous generation. The Pioneer Generation Package, together with other measures, is an expression of gratitude from the Government to our Pioneer Generation, which also helps them realise their dream of living a happy and peaceful life. It is a package that touches the heart, and reflects the Government's concern over the ageing population and what it is doing to address the problem directly.",26,219,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00219
2014-03-04-T-003,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The package is comprehensive and, therefore, rather complex. Many Singaporeans have only a partial understanding of it. Many do not know how they will benefit from it, neither do they know the details. At a recent community event, I talked to a long-time Punggol North resident. I asked him, ""How do you feel about the Pioneer Generation Package?"" He said, ""Good, good."" I asked him further, ""In which way it is good?"" He said, ""Er, actually I don't know. Someone said it is good, so I assume it is good"".",27,220,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00220
2014-03-04-T-003,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Among those who will benefit, some are living alone, some are taking care of their 80-year-old aged parents and most are low-income workers who have worked hard in the past, who are illiterate, busy with work or not involved in community activities. We should spare no efforts and make use of various avenues to inform these 450,000 Singaporeans on how they will benefit, so that they can have peace of mind. This will also give our society a boost of positive energy and reinforce the traditional moral value of respecting our elders. It is our duty.",28,221,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00221
2014-03-04-T-003,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Conventional publicity methods, for example, distributing brochures, organising briefings in four languages and dialect, newspaper and TV reports, forums and featured programmes, may be good. However, these are aimed at different segments of the audience and the elderly may not understand them like we do.",29,222,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00222
2014-03-04-T-003,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In order to communicate with the elderly, we must understand their situation. There are many generations between the elderly and us. Some of them have not moved with the times, and there is a generation gap between us, in terms of mindset and language. If they cannot comprehend what they hear, they will not understand. For example, many organisations often ask the public to go on their Facebook or use phrases like ""for more information, please log on to www."" But how would our old folks know about www.dot if they have not even used the mouse before? Therefore, we must be considerate about their feelings. In addition, they have problems like presbyopia, hearing impairment, deteriorating ability to think and understand. Hence, we must find ways to overcome this communication barrier.",30,223,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00223
2014-03-04-T-003,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I suggest producing a series of advertisements featuring key information. They should be about half-a-minute to one-minute long, with simple images and a slower pace. These should be repeatedly broadcast in four languages, so that even those who are illiterate and those with poor memory can access the information. For example, we can provide subtitles in large font size to go with the images, with simple narration and one message per image – this would achieve a better effect.",31,224,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00224

In addition, set up hotlines for senior citizens to make enquiries.",32,225,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00225
2014-03-04-T-003,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Why am I spending so much time to talk about communication? Because the Government has done a lot quietly behind the scenes but they have not communicated properly what they have done. We need to use different ways to communicate with different segments of our society. The elderly have their distinct features, the young have their own lingo, and businesses have their own way of interacting. There is no ""one size fits all"" approach.",33,226,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00226
2014-03-04-T-003,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The important point is that a good government must not only be far-sighted, passionate and driven, but also possess the ability to communicate with its people. Otherwise, all the good efforts of the Government will not be understood by the masses to create a consensus. On the contrary, they may be used by others to flame discontentment, worsen hostility, erode trust and social cohesion. So, I urge the Government to put in more effort to communicate effectively with Singaporeans.",34,227,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00227
2014-03-04-T-003,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In conclusion, the 2014 Budget is a milestone aimed at strengthening nation-building and looking after the long-term healthcare of Singaporeans. It is full of positive energy. I hope that the entire nation, from the Government to businesses, media and the masses, will work together and spread this positive energy to everyone.

Yet, instead of enjoying their golden years, many retirees are out cleaning our buildings, our streets and our toilets. Indeed, MOM statistics suggests that the number of Singaporeans participating in the workforce beyond the age of 65 has doubled from 19.5% to 40% in the last 10 years. Just last week, I met an elderly lady in her 70s cleaning the toilet in an auditor's office. She was so old and so tired she had to carry a low stool around with her the whole time.

For them, it is too late to start saving again and many have to survive on low pensions that have not been inflation adjusted. These retirees, and there are also retirees who are asset rich but cash poor, who may require some help if they are unable to cash in on their properties. However, given our low fertility rate compounded by an ageing population, maybe the questions to ask are  one, are Singaporeans planning adequately for their retirement and if not, what more can be done? Two, if we continue to raise CPF contributions by employers for elderly workers, will it affect their overall employability, especially when many now have to work for longer? And three, do we need to change the concept of work and encourage more flexibility for employers and employees?",6,234,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00234

So, the CPF hike this year will go some way to help ease the cost of retirement. But let us not forget that the self-employed, like hawkers and taxi drivers, will not benefit from this group. We may have to do more to help them.",7,235,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00235
2014-03-04-T-003,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Whilst the workforce participation for the elderly has gone up because they need to work, the worrying statistic is the actual unemployment for those aged 50 and above has been rising in the last three years. In short, elderly Singaporeans find the need to work later in life but they are finding it harder to find a job. So, how do we improve the employability of these seniors? One solution, obviously, is to improve their productivity. The other maybe is to redefine the concept of work especially for the elderly and those who are retired and thinking of a new career.",8,236,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00236

The digitalisation of the world has and will bring about profound changes in the way we do business, the way we interact with each other, and the way governments lead. It is like, if you lose your wallet on the MRT, it would take you some time before you might notice it, but if you lose your smartphone, you probably notice it immediately. The social network is the new production line where decisions are made. Everything is transparent and instant. There will be privacy and security issues.

Another is the increase in income inequality. The Atlantic magazine suggested the Internet has become the ""greatest legal facilitator of inequality in human history"".

Tweaking the education system for youths is not enough. We need solutions that facilitate opportunities for workers to learn new skills at different stages of their working lives.

In 2013, more ex-offenders commit a crime within two years of completing their reformative training or jail sentences. Among those ex-offenders I met, many continue to have low self-esteem, and shared that they find difficulties in getting jobs and acceptance at the workplace.

Rather, they are most worried about the fact that they may not be able to pay for premiums for insurance, housing loan, medical cost, should they lose their ability to work and therefore have no income.

2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Our society has a role to play to help those who are prepared to help themselves. And I think it is quite obvious that the pool of freelancers and self-employed in Singapore is growing and becoming an integral part of our workforce. I have three specific recommendations that I feel that we can do to help our freelancers and the self-employed. Firstly, about recognising and appreciating their capabilities. I have been looking at the newspapers and I notice that it is still not common to see the Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) as a criterion in job advertisements or skills specifications in tenders or quotations. This needs to change even as more freelancers take on certifications but may not be recognised.",16,271,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00271
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I hope the Government, employers and buyers of services can speed up the recognition of skills training certification, such as WSQ, or other nationally recognised certifiable courses. We need to do more to raise the public awareness of WSQ and related qualifications.",17,272,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00272
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Where in the past, buyers were not sure how to assess the skills level of the freelancers, they can now do so via skills certification. This will enable them to also pay appropriate fees based on the expertise of those freelancers they engage. As an illustration, I recently went to a hair salon and saw that there were different fees charged for different grades of hairstylist. This is in recognition of the different skills level attained by the person who is there working in the shop.",18,273,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00273
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),I would also like to recommend that we consider giving more segments of freelancers absentee payroll when they go for licence renewal courses or attend WSQ programme on their own.,19,274,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00274
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Second recommendation. I think we also can do a little bit more to help our freelancers and self-employed must look for and market their services. For example, next year, we will be organising the SEA Games in 2015.",20,275,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00275
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Apart from getting more locals to volunteer to run the event and support by attending the sports event, we should also work closely with Singapore Sports Council to get more Singaporeans to start playing or picking up a new sport. This will open up opportunities for sports coaches and trainers to offer their services so that we not only can participate in the sports but also can be healthy at the same time.",21,276,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00276
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"The third area is really to give them support so that the freelancers and self-employed can do more to save up for personal contingency. This includes things like the ability to pay for housing, healthcare, deal with temporary loss of income and save up for retirement.",22,277,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00277
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"These are challenges faced by employees, but there is a fundamental difference between those who are freelancers compared to those who are employees. For the freelancers and self-employed, they have to make provision for these contingencies on their own.",23,278,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00278
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"The Finance Minister in this year's Budget announced that the Government will defray employers' share of the increased CPF contribution rate for employees aged 50-55 with a Temporary Employment Credit. This is most welcome. As what hon Member Irene Ng said earlier, this is no time for negative thought. In the past, we had asked for minimum wage. Some Members in this Chamber have asked for minimum wage, whereas others have warned that there may be unemployment resulting from a minimum wage. Today, others are worried that with this increase in CPF contribution rate for older workers, it may lead to their being unemployable because of higher cost.",24,279,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00279
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I think we have to see this in context that there are other schemes available across the board from the Government, ranging from the inclusive growth programmes to help companies to upgrade and make their jobs more productive. There are also schemes like PIC. Two years ago, we started the Special Employment Credit to give support to employers when they hire older workers. When you see this in context, we have to understand that, indeed, there may be challenges when older workers want to seek employment. But there is also similar support available for employers to do so. The data also suggests that employment rate for older workers over the years has grown and we welcome this measure. We hope the Government can do more to help our older workers stay employable.",25,280,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00280
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to urge that the Government consider giving the same quantum under the Temporary Employment Credit to the group of freelancers and self-employed who make voluntary contributions to their Medisave. You see they do not have an employer so that they can offset the 1% increase. But if they do make voluntary contribution to their Medisave, perhaps we can extend the Temporary Employment Credit to them as well.",26,281,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00281
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I would also like to call for the same amount of Workfare Income Supplement payout to be given to the self-employed, if they qualify for Workfare. Currently, they receive only a portion of what employed workers are receiving.",27,282,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00282
2014-03-04-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Finally, our freelancers and self-employed workers are a unique category of workforce which also drives the economic growth in Singapore. We need a calibrated and measured approach to help them, of course not only meet their medical needs but also their employment needs. So, let us take it one step at a time. I think we need to start soon. Our economic transformation should also include doing more to help back-to-work women and ex-offenders to stay in the workforce. Madam, with that, I support the Budget.",28,283,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00283
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The ward I represent, Admiralty, was, at least until very recently, a ward with mostly young families.

What I find very moving about this Budget, and there are three main things I would like to discuss, which I think would make a very big difference for young families.",1,284,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00284
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The first, perhaps counter-intuitively, is the Pioneer Generation Package; the second, the improved subsidies for healthcare; and third, the development in subsidies in education.",2,285,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00285
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"First, on the Pioneer Generation Package  this may come as a surprise, but in many of the dialogues I had last year, even with younger family members, one of their biggest concerns was what was going to happen to their parents – they are falling sick, they are living longer. Is anyone going to help with their medical bills? And in that sense, this Pioneer Generation Package is very timely.",3,286,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00286
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"For each of us, in each of our families, those who are second or third generation Singaporeans, we probably have people who would have been pioneers, either our grandparents or our parents. Each of us knows the depth of gratitude we owe to them. In my own family, my grandparents came over from India at a time when travel was by ship so there was no aeroplane to go back for quick visits, no telephones to make phone calls to keep in touch. They stayed through World War II which was a very tough time. They saw the early years of Independence. In many of our families, if we have pioneers to go back that era, their stories will be similar  the personal sacrifices that they made were tremendous.",4,287,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00287
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In some families, it may be the parents as well. In my case, my parents qualified for the Pioneer Generation Package, too. They were born in the immediate baby boom after World War II. In the later colonial era and early years of independence, we went through significant uncertainty. The success of Singapore where we would be today was clearly not pre-ordained, and, in a sense, these were the people who cast their lot and stayed with Singapore so that many of us today can benefit.",5,288,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00288
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Perhaps the biggest worry in the minds of many in this generation who grew up at the time before things like CPF became properly institutionalised, is what is going to happen now. For those with children who are doing well, it is less of a problem, but those whose children may not be doing so well, or for those who do not have enough CPF, healthcare is probably the single biggest concern on their mind. Healthcare comes in many forms. It comes in fear of big hospital bills; it comes with ongoing bills at the clinics.",6,289,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00289
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"So, in that sense, the Pioneer Generation Package addresses a broad range of concerns on their minds. The underlying message that the pioneers would have to worry less about healthcare or, in fact, perhaps not even worry at all, is probably a heartening one. The biggest concern on their minds can be taken away and they can really enjoy their golden years.",7,290,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00290
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"From what I understand for the younger families as well, many of them who have pioneers in their own families will appreciate this, too. This is a very welcome expenditure – it is one of the largest expenditures in the Budget, but one that I think will be supported and welcomed by all.",8,291,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00291
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Now, let me deal with the second one because healthcare affordability was also another concern raised by many of my residents. This too may seem rather counterintuitive because while it was perhaps raised as the biggest concern on the minds of many of my residents, when we asked whether any of them had difficulties with particular big bills that they could not pay or bills that they could not manage, no hands went up.",9,292,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00292
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I guess there is a fear of exceptional healthcare cost even though we probably have a system in place to take away a lot of the strains. One of the most important developments in this front will be MediShield Life. The intention is that Pioneer Generation Package is going to be one-off. But what that would mean is that for the next generation, in order for their long-term healthcare needs to be taken care of, a system like MediShield Life will be crucial to plug that gap. In that sense, the idea of mandatory insurance to deal with big bills is something that is important, and something that I think it is good to plan for early so that we will not have to come up with packages for each and every generation to meet their long-term medical needs.",10,293,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00293
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The expanded subsidies at Specialist Outpatient Clinics are also welcomed because these are, again, ongoing costs, especially for people who might have chronic conditions. A lot of these assistance schemes in healthcare will ease more of the concerns that many of the younger families have as well.",11,294,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00294
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The final aspect that I want to deal with is education. One of things that was unique for Singapore in the earlier years and what has helped the children of the pioneers do better than the pioneers themselves is the fact that they had access to education. In that sense, the two areas of education that are potentially more expensive are pre-school education and tertiary education which are the exact two areas that this Budget is targeting. That is welcome.",12,295,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00295
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Given that we have limited resources, if we are looking at a further review of these schemes, rather than having universal free education for everyone, what I would advocate is that we have greater subsidies to make sure that everyone has access to higher education and access pre-school education.",13,296,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00296
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I would, therefore, prefer more targeted subsidies for those who need them more. Recognising that tertiary education is probably becoming more of a necessity – whether that is at ITE, Polytechnic or University – for many families, especially low- and middle-income families whose children may be going to Polytechnic or ITE, the expanded availability of bursaries will be very welcome.",14,297,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00297
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Let me just wrap up on a final note on how this Budget works through a financial perspective. I think we are running a very modest deficit in this Budget but that is more or less catered for by our recent surpluses. So, I do not think that is a major concern.",15,298,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00298
2014-03-04-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Conceptually, I think the idea that we can fund a package as broad-ranging as the Pioneer Generation Package from a single year's Budget is exceptional. It also shows that we are still committed to fiscal discipline. Even as we become more compassionate and spend more on social spending, we should still maintain our commitment to fiscal discipline as that will allow the future generations to not have to worry about carrying the burden of the past.",16,299,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00299

I hope to see a wider range of medication, outpatient treatments and perhaps early screening tests to be included into the usage of Medisave.

2014-03-04-T-003,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Hence, the package came as a pleasant surprise to many. While engaging the ground, I have received many heartening comments. Some PG Singaporeans said they had never expected to be recognised or honoured in their lifetime because they had deemed themselves to be ordinary Singaporeans – ordinary but great in our hearts. Others who have a keen sense of humour even joked in Hokkien that they are finally ""gam wan"" to admit that they are old. So, they tell me, ""我终于认了""; they finally admit to being old. Even non-PG Singaporeans have so far expressed support for the PG package, though some wished they had been born earlier.",4,329,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00329
2014-03-04-T-003,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"This package is generous and will benefit the PG Singaporeans till the end of their life journey. This also means a whopping national expenditure of $8 billion, probably not something that we can sustain all the time but I believe it is worth it. This huge fiscal commitment is something that is worth it. For the generation who had done so much for today's Singapore, we who are younger need to ask ourselves  how much is this generation of young Singaporeans willing to give of ourselves to support our older generation, especially those who had come from the founding generation of modern Singapore during the Independence? I had made the same statement during the Opening of Parliament debate in 2011 and called for bold steps in offering free basic public healthcare for our old. With this PG package, I can say certainly and gladly that the Government is, indeed, looking after our pioneers.",5,330,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00330
2014-03-04-T-003,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"I support the PG package, but I would also like to urge the Government to consider whether the PG package should solely focus on healthcare and whether there could be a cash component as well, pretty much echoing some of our Members of this House had said earlier. One of the key issues that retirees face is cashflow management. They have assets locked up in the form of housing or CPF savings with restrictions on the usage. While the generous subsidies will mean less out of pocket expenses for the pioneers, which will in turn increase disposable income, this may not apply to those who are in good physical but poor financial health. Hence, could the Government consider allowing the pioneers to decide whether a particular year's Medisave top-up be converted into a cash voucher for, say, S&CC and utilities bill payments? In terms of fiscal expenditure, there is no impact – Government will still pay out the same amount but, to the pioneers, it will mean so much as there is more flexibility and more means to resolve their very pressing needs.",6,331,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00331
2014-03-04-T-003,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"All said, it is highly commendable for the Government to exercise moral leadership in honouring and caring for our PG – our elders. It is a strong signal to the younger generation that this value of honouring our elders is still precious to our nation and, hopefully, this value will endure many more generations to come. However, the entire society and nation have to internalise and exemplify such a value. For instance, we cannot outsource filial piety or gratitude to our pioneers to the Government and the Government alone. If so, we, as individuals, will truly be soulless beings who see ourselves as having no stake in this land we call home.",7,332,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00332

For example, reach out to them, speak with them, keep them company, collect their stories, organise and take part in programmes that will engage them meaningfully. And perhaps even to bring them on organised trips – bring them to Istana which has such historical meaning to our context that I believe that the Pioneer Generation will feel a deep sense of pride because they had a very strong role, a very big part to play in building modern Singapore. So, these actions, infused with a human touch, will certainly be valued more than just dollars and cents.",8,333,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00333

So, why not recognise these foreign spouses who are legally married to Singaporeans? Let them have some certainty of stay in Singapore with an immigration progression roadmap with milestones defined, so that the foreign spouses and their families know what are expected of them and plan their lives accordingly. Singaporeans have chosen them to share their lives with and these foreign spouses have also chosen to give up on their homelands to be part of Singapore. Moreover, should they have children, their children will be most likely born as Singaporeans given that at least one parent is a Singapore citizen.

In a way, it is to find an alternate way out. While offering lots of money and help options, I wonder how effective these are in helping the SMEs to transform, especially the small enterprises. Many do not have the capacity to find out possible innovations or best practices that they can use to improve productivity and reduce reliance on manpower, both foreign and local.

For example, helping them with horizon scanning of suitable innovations/technologies/best practices, hand-holding them through the implementation of these improvements, and helping them to develop new niche areas and move into growth industries. For those who eventually cannot sustain their businesses, will the Government consider an Employment Guarantee programme, somewhat similar to European's Youth Guarantee programme, for the displaced SME owners and staff so as to minimise the pain and structural unemployment?

However, due to labour shortage and high operating costs, many SMEs are still suffering, in particular, the more traditional and small-scale businesses. This is because many of these owners are relatively older with lower education background. And due to the small size of their businesses, they are unable to meet MOM's dependency ratio and have to manage most of the work on their own. Some of them even have to work from dawn to dusk. When they are so exhausted from their work, requiring them to broaden their horizon, search for new technologies and transform their businesses is, indeed, mission impossible.",21,346,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00346

One owner of a small bakery, for example, shared that his business is a micro business.

As a result, he had to handle everything himself. I asked if he had considered making use of the Government incentive programmes to increase his productivity via process re-engineering or innovative technologies. He said he would very much like to respond to the Government's call but he did not know of the possible technologies to leverage on and what examples he could learn from overseas. He simply did not know where to start.

Besides pumping in large sums of money, it is very important to assist and guide SMEs closely. Economic transformation is excruciatingly painful. If you succeed, you will be reborn and emerge strongly. But if you fail, you lose everything, including your livelihood. To lessen the amount of pain and failure in the transformation, and to encourage more companies to take bold steps to try, could the Government consider an ""employment guarantee"" programme to ensure that business owners and their employees will be guaranteed of training and a job, should they fail in the transformation process. This will provide safeguards for the business owners, workers and their families.

The Government has made the right move in stockpiling sand and granite so that our public housing and infrastructure construction are not disrupted. As a small country with hardly any natural resources, we are highly vulnerable to the actions and decisions of our neighbouring countries. The Indonesian government banned the export of a wide range of minerals worldwide on 12 January, leaving several local construction projects in limbo. This is an issue that not even diplomacy could resolve. And this is not the first time it has happened. For example, last year, Malaysia banned the export of five types of fish to us for two months, and in 1997, Indonesia banned the export of sand, which led to price surges for sand from Malaysia.

Understandably, there is a need to discourage zealous purchasing from the construction companies, but surely there are better ways to go about this, such as putting a quantity limit or asking them to replenish the stock from their own source.

Furthermore, the imperative to be economically competitive is one that must be balanced against another abiding imperative – that of ensuring that the CPF institution is not compromised and that employers play their part in keeping the social compact relevant. I would say that being economically competitive does not exclude the need for workers to have a fair bargain.",12,428,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00428

2014-03-04-T-003,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, during the 2013 Budget debates, I requested for KiFAS or the Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme to be extended to all kindergarten students from needy families and not only limited to students from PCF kindergartens. In this year's Budget, KiFAS was extended only to kindergartens administered by MOE and Anchor Operators. Once again, I would like to ask the Government to extend the KiFAS scheme to kindergarten students who are attending kindergarten centres run by welfare and religious organisations.",23,478,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00478
2014-03-04-T-003,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Finally, I hope that the measures that were announced during this year's Budget will continue to be reviewed and updated so that the assistance being offered will move with the times, and correspond with the prevailing situation and cost of living.

2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xxxx.] I could sense that the Malay/Muslim community was very touched when the Prime Minister paid tribute to the Malays from the Pioneer Generation who chose to remain in Singapore, after the separation with Malaysia. Their choice to do so made a big difference in our nation-building efforts.",2,481,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00481
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"This was important, especially since Malays in Singapore eventually made significant achievements and are able to stand as equals with the other communities. The Pioneer Generation of Malays should also become our role models, demonstrating the way for us to move forward as Singaporeans, with a commitment to meritocracy.",3,482,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00482
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) is well-received by the Malay/Muslim community all around. The Government's acknowledgement is in line with the spirit and ways of the Malay community, which are to always respect and appreciate the elderly. The PGP also takes care of the welfare and health of senior citizens in the spirit of gotong-royong.",4,483,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00483
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In fact, it is fitting that this package focuses on healthcare, since health issues are a major concern to the Malay/Muslim community. It more or less reduces the burden on children who are taking care of their elderly parents, especially in terms of healthcare costs, and, in the long term, it would be good if the message that we wish to send out would also include raising awareness on disease prevention, practising a healthy lifestyle and planning for healthcare needs.",5,484,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00484
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"(In English)  Mdm Speaker, the highlight of this year's Budget is arguably the PGP. It is, undoubtedly, a generous package and I am heartened to see that many seniors I speak to are happy to be recognised. This is especially since, in this case, qualifying for the package was not by means testing as it is in recognition of our Pioneer Generation's achievements. Many of my residents I have spoken to are happy with the PGP. Many have already subscribed to CHAS and I am heartened that many will continue to benefit from the Package.",6,485,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00485
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In this sense, this Budget gives recognition to our Pioneer Generation so that they do not feel left out of our modern economy, which they had helped build over the years. Through this move, the Government also sends a clear message – that no one gets left behind, especially the seniors who have brought us to where we are today.",7,486,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00486
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The Package will also help many residents. Many who are middle income dwellers in my constituency form the ""sandwiched class""; and they have to care for their seniors, especially those who do not have to support their premiums or their future healthcare needs. This is a system that also encourages filial piety, which, I hope, translates to the values that we want to inculcate in our society across all ages, now and in the future.",8,487,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00487
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Even though in past Budget speeches, there had been an emphasis that the Government was only focusing on leaving no one behind, the PGP is one budget item that makes me proud to be a Singaporean and a Member in this House.",9,488,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00488
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to move on now to speak for the generations that will succeed the Pioneers. As I move around for house visits, a number of Singaporeans that I spoke to, in their late 40s or early 60s, often cite their concern that they do not feel secure where retirement is concerned. While the Government is trying to address their concerns in terms of healthcare affordability, many do not have the confidence that they can retire comfortably with the same quality and standard of living they enjoy today.",10,489,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00489
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Many have invested their CPF in property and can barely meet the Minimum Sum and save on their own accord. They look at the ever-increasing cost of living and inflation, and project the future costs in their minds against the savings that they can accumulate. This is where many become uncertain about their future here.",11,490,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00490
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"But do not get me wrong. Many Singaporeans are grateful for the work that the Government is doing in terms of healthcare subsidies and keeping MediShield premiums affordable. However, they also have friends and family around them with chronic and serious ailments where out-of-pocket expenses and indirect costs are still required for medication and treatments which have increased over time, and so they fear for their own fate.",12,491,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00491
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I acknowledge that there is a danger of the Government requiring larger budgets or increased taxes if more expenses need to be covered. But as we deal with healthcare affordability and CPF savings adequacy in old age, these are often seen as safety nets. We also need to look from the lens of citizens. In addition to these instruments, can one still maintain a comfortable standard of living without being priced out in Singapore?",13,492,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00492
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I also believe it is important that our heartlands, where most Singaporeans and seniors live, must continue to remain affordable and vibrant. Many residents I speak to are concerned that city prices are creeping into our heartlands, with the many malls, food courts and supermarkets replacing our familiar wet markets, mom-and-pop shops and small-time service providers. Today's rentals in the heartlands have also ensured that whatever traditional businesses that remain, end up with almost similar prices to what you can find in the malls and food courts in the city.",14,493,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00493
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Commercialising many of our heartland centres has caused a lot of many traditional businesses being squeezed out. Today, we continue to inherit modern businesses and swanky malls that provide higher order goods. These are typically more expensive and you find carbon copies of shops from the same franchises from heartland to heartland.",15,494,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00494
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"So, I hope to see HDB and NEA playing a more active role to provide a greater balance of affordable rental spaces in our HDB estates. Create more opportunities for traditional businesses – whether it is your friendly neighbourhood barber, the hardware shop, the shoe repair, the locksmith, the plumbers or the tailors in the neighbourhood. They do not just play a part in providing low-cost services, but they also enable the ordinary citizens, including seniors, to participate in the localised heartland economy as business owners or a consumer seeking low costs of living, insulated from city prices.",16,495,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00495
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Our quality of life must prevail even in retirement. I feel concerned when I meet middle-aged citizens, especially those who are doing well today with decent jobs, saying they would like to migrate when they retire so that they can retire comfortably. It is sad when they do not see a place for themselves in this land that they have toiled with blood, sweat and tears over the years.",17,496,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00496
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As I prepared this speech, Singapore was named the most expensive city to live in among 133 cities in 2014. This was a report that was released this morning by the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU). We are now more expensive than Tokyo, Zurich, Paris and Sydney. Apart from car and utility prices, we are now also the most expensive place in the world to buy clothes. So, I urge the Government to look seriously and urgently into our cost of living concerns now and for the long term. For as long as our high costs of living are concerned, it will be near impossible to allay our citizens' fears that we can retire comfortably and with a reasonable quality of life. I truly understand why many feel this way.",18,497,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00497
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, I support Member Inderjit Singh's call earlier for a committee to review our cost competitiveness. Although he meant it for businesses, I say to extend this to the consumers as well to review our cost of living concerns.",19,498,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00498
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, the Government's measures to bridge the income divide have shown some progress – the Gini coefficient fell from 0.478 in 2012 to 0.470 in 2013 and this has shown some reduction in income disparity. Given the Government's commitment to social mobility in a number of our Budget items – education, healthcare costs, job opportunities – I am happy to see visible outcomes of policies that have the PAP Government's mark stamped all over it, reflecting the party's own core values of building a ""fair and just"" society.",20,499,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00499
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We have seen in Budget 2014 how the Government has been able to budget for various policies, including the Pioneer Generation Package, through our surpluses and reserves income. This is no easy feat, as many countries struggle with balancing their Budget. Today, you will also find many political parties trying to claim credit as well with regard to caring for our seniors. But, again, where does the surplus come from? Can you run the economy effectively and generate the surplus and the reserves to account for and support such a measure?",21,500,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00500
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As such, it is imperative for us to progress together as a nation and continue to redistribute our wealth equitably and level up society.",22,501,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00501
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The open market that Singapore operates in is efficient economically and propagates meritocracy. However, our meritocratic environment also generates an outcome where the better-abled will succeed on the basis of merit and those who are more capable will likely earn more. Those who are not as able or who are less capable may not climb up the ladder at the same pace and are likely to earn less. So, this, generally, leads to widening inequality. Singapore, as a small country, in this open, global economy, has no choice but to operate within this regime.",23,502,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00502
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Unfortunately, a free market, left on its own, may not lead to equitable incomes. Thus, this Government has an even stronger role to play to level up the society, given the larger system that Singapore needs to operate in.",24,503,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00503
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"This Budget has shown that despite globalisation and the impact of an open economy, the PAP Government can play a strong and impactful role in creating a fair and equitable society. And I hope, in time, Singapore will recognise how our policies today have helped our people for the long term.",25,504,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00504
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In the long term, however, I foresee that there may be more pressure put on the Government to impose higher taxes on the higher income group or introduce wealth taxes, such as the Buffett tax rule in the US. For now, I think our Budget transfer policies have shown some success but, if the income divide widens further, the Government may need to look into increasing income taxes at the upper end or wealth taxes. However, this needs to be done in a way where such taxes are taken as socially-driven tax measures to help level up society. I agree with Member Alvin Yeo's comments that Singapore cannot go down the path of politics of envy, where people try to level down others who have made it.",26,505,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00505
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Both market-led growth and equal opportunities are important.

Otherwise, we risk our people feeling that Singapore is only for the rich and successful and that their future lies elsewhere but Singapore.",27,506,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00506
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, on the business front, it is quite clear that this is a Budget for the SMEs. The Government has made good strides to listen to the ground over the past years to better assist businesses through various business schemes, while at the same time retaining its focus towards greater productivity and innovation, and at the same time calibrating our reliance on foreign manpower.",28,507,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00507
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The extension of the PIC and the introduction of the PIC+ will help even more SMEs, to give them more time and targeted help to pursue their productivity aims. These productivity-led measures will also help companies address existing cost challenges and business productivity.",29,508,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00508
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I am heartened with the recent progress announced by SPRING Singapore. I am confident that these schemes will bring about stronger productivity improvements among the medium and large-sized SMEs. But there are also concerns whether the PIC and PIC+ can assume a one-size-fits-all strategy and whether the Government needs a different approach for the small-sized SMEs, especially those with 10 or less employees.",30,509,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00509
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"For the small-sized SMEs, the reason why I bring them up is they could end up being a very insulated group. And this will span about one-third of SMEs in Singapore. The PIC and PIC+ generally promote productivity improvements within the company. For the small-sized SMEs, we may need a cross-industry or cross-sector-driven productivity drive. And in this regard, the Government may have to roll up its sleeves further to drive transformations across a cluster of small companies at a time within a business grouping or within a supply chain. For companies of this size, the Government may also need to drive more R&D efforts as they have no capability or resources to embark on R&D. In fact, R&D at an industry or supply chain level for a cluster of small companies may make more sense.",31,510,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00510
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"So, it will be interesting to see if agencies could help connect retail shops or food centres in the heartlands with shared services, e-payments or other innovative service providers. One retail shop, on its own, may not find automation useful without scale. But a business community, put together, may find automation or shared services useful in lowering their business costs and enhancing customer experience. Thus, there may be a need to employ a different strategy for productivity transformation as we get to the harder-to-reach, small-sized SMEs.",32,511,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00511
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The other issue on R&D is the alignment of the R&D centres that are available today. Most R&D centres here, such as A*STAR, are Government-related. I would like to enquire whether these Government agencies have sufficient capacity and the right KPIs aligned to entrepreneurship and SME engagement. Are the KPIs focused more on product research or innovation that can be commercialised? Thus, the alignment has to be a lot clearer for these agencies for R&D and intellectual property to be useful within the PIC framework. We need to look deeper into how our SMEs can capitalise beyond the automation and training aspects of the PIC and move instead into innovation. This is crucial, especially with how we need to differentiate our economy and local companies from our regional competition.",33,512,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00512
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, I believe this Budget has shown that we are able to generate a good mix of social and economic policies for our citizens.

2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"While we look at Government spending in all areas, we should also look into the amount of resources the Government has allocated to enhance our governance.

2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Recent procurement lapses, for instance, those identified in the AGO reports and high-profile corruption cases, have raised questions on the Government's credibility. While the Government was able to address these lapses – of course, there may be some questions remaining as to why they were not identified earlier and whether procurement can be better performed by specialists and divisions that are independent of the users.",36,515,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00515
2014-03-04-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In addition, it is important that we strengthen our regulators and agencies, given some of the other publicised lapses in public services.

But over time, this Government needs to show that with increasing productivity, our quality of life will continue to prevail and living in Singapore continues to be affordable.",42,521,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00521

For instance, if it is a retail space, the tenant is interested in seeing its value only by the amount of traffic it can bring year-on-year and offer rents.

Working just five hours a day and ensuring a minimum salary of $1,000 a month we thought would bring back people to work and address the labour shortage.",19,597,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00597

With more people contributing to the growth of the nation, it is important that we do everything for the good health, which is a prerequisite for being economically productive. In Singapore, we have always cherished and prided ourselves on our spirit of tripartite cooperation at all times for growth and well-being. Historically, through the tripartite arrangement, employees (unions), employers and Government get together to join hands on matters of common interest. The Medisave account contribution is one such case where the contributions are made in the future interest of all three parties. I would like to suggest and propose that we should look at having equal contributions from all the three parties for the Medisave account. At this moment, all and every increase is being borne only by employee or employer and it will be good to have the Government join in as a concerned partner for the welfare of the people.",23,601,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00601

I like that the Government allocated funds for internationalisation and to help the start-up community. These are very useful in building Singapore brands and taking them globally as well as improving Singapore's visibility on the entrepreneurship and business map globally. In this regard, we should incentivise companies to build their own brands. At present, we provide grants for them to acquire brands. But with enough R&D and guidance, SMEs here can and should develop their own brands. The Government should help them in this regard to give them grants and the expertise from our Government agencies on developing R&D, commercialising it and also to develop and market their own brands on the global market. This will also help SMEs build their revenue streams so that they can better cope with the costs. It will also deepen Singapore's position on the global corporate landscape as it helps build Singapore brands and globally competitive companies.

Besides providing education subsidies, the Government and private organisations also provide bursaries and scholarships to those who need them. I suggest that the Government, together with the community, should consider making all scholarship holders ""pay back to society"" through doing social services. What is taken from the society should also be returned to and used in the society.

Singaporeans are living longer and their expectations about their standard of living during their retirement years are generally higher as well.

I am worried that the additional employer contribution rates may be a disincentive to employers to retain the older workers.

This is understandably worrying for Singaporeans whose parents are not pioneers and suffer from chronic and other illnesses. More public education is needed to assure Singaporeans that besides Medisave top-ups, there will be more subsidies at the polyclinic and, for large hospitalisation bills, they will get help under MediShield Life. Some residents who are in need but do not come under existing help schemes should approach the community or grassroots leaders to seek assistance.",9,685,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00685

In simple terms, it benefits both the old and the young as more subsidies for the old would mean a diminished burden for the young looking after them. Our grassroots leaders must be deployed to explain this to residents. At the level of the individual who has to support aged parents, more Medisave and polyclinic subsidies from the Government means that less cash is needed for health-related expenses.

Most of them are single women. Some look after their sick relatives full-time, some part-time. They spend most of their savings on their parents' medical expenses. After their parents pass on, they often face financial difficulties when buying a flat or getting a job.

In other words, taking care of our seniors must be a collective effort – it cannot just be the responsibility of the Government to provide for them.

The Government has introduced the Special Employment Credit (SEC) scheme in 2011 and enhanced it in 2012, as well as introduced a special enhancement for 2015 in light of the increase in CPF contribution by employers. Under the current scheme, up to 8% of their monthly salaries, capped at $4,000, will be co-paid by the Government. For work done in 2015, the enhancement is another 0.5%, which works out to up to 8.5% of monthly salaries. Although this has made it more attractive for companies to employ older Singaporeans, I hope that the SEC can be enhanced yet again, so that employers will be further incentivised to employ our seniors.",5,697,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00697

They travel on their own using public transport, and the senior concession cards for those aged 60 years old and above have certainly come in handy. However, each card is valid for only five years. Replacement is required thereafter. May I propose that the senior concession cards be given as a lifetime card with no expiration date? Replacement is only for lost or damaged cards. And for our seniors who are part of the Pioneer Generation, a nice gesture would be to provide free public transport passes for them. There are only 450,000 seniors who belong to our Pioneer Generation. Let them travel around this nation of ours, which they have helped build, as they please. There are many such seniors who value their independence, the ability to be mobile and move around without having to depend on their children or others.",6,698,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00698

Despite being more than 65 years old, he still works, albeit part-time, earning about $1,000 a month. When I met him at his home during one of my block visits, he lamented the difficulty he had getting a full-time job once he turned 60 years old. He is still fit as a fiddle, walks without any walking aids, very eloquent and has a good memory as well as a jolly sense of humour. However, the one thing that has deteriorated somewhat is his eyesight. So, he no longer drives. But he takes the bus and train to get around and to get to work.",7,699,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00699

2014-03-04-T-003,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"On a related note, I would also like to request the Government to consider introducing parent care leave of at least three days a year. As we espouse the virtues of filial piety and collective responsibility towards our elders and seniors, it is also important to make provisions for those among us who are working and yet have responsibilities towards the care of our aged parents. Just as the Government has agreed to pay for three of the six days of childcare leave without medical certificate for working parents, I hope that the Government can consider doing the same for this proposed parent care leave. Three days a year, and making this provision to civil servants for a start, will send a strong signal to all employers and companies that responsibility and care towards our families include both children and parents, and provision ought to be made for this for employees. The Government can consider how to co-pay and finance parent care leave with private employers and companies.",9,701,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00701

But maybe the Government can consider increasing sin taxes even further, by a few more percentage points, particularly for more expensive alcoholic drinks, such as wines. I am no expert in this but I am sure Deputy Prime Minister Tharman and MOF would be able to work this out. I am sure those who indulge in smoking, drinking or gambling do not mind indulging in our Pioneer Generation instead.",10,702,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00702

This is where we ought to take a step back and look at this Budget with respect to previous years' Budgets and existing assistance schemes. We cannot look at this Budget in silo because, with each annual Budget, schemes and provisions are introduced which span several years. Hence, there are overlapping assistance schemes to ensure continuity and seamlessness of support.",11,703,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00703

In last year's Budget, the revised property tax for owner occupied residential properties and increased personal income tax rebate, were introduced and also targeted to assist middle-income households. Hence, I must iterate that while more has been done to help lower-income and older Singaporeans, middle-income Singaporeans have not been left out. However, I would like to urge the Government to collate the various provisions, benefits and assistance schemes available for middle-income households and earners, above and beyond this year's Budget, and make this information easy to understand and accessible.",12,704,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00704

So, please allow me to begin with a question. How many of us remember what we were doing when we were 16? Where were we, what were we doing, what is our abiding memory of that time of our life?",1,712,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00712
2014-03-04-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"For the average teenager today, at 16, most would be in Secondary 4. It will be perhaps a little bit mundane  a daily schedule of school, home, homework, rest, school, the occasional berating by parents and weekends of enrichment classes or co-curricular activities. There may be evenings of being on the basketball court, or meeting with friends at the movies, hoping to get home in time before curfew and, again, not getting a telling-off from parents. The environment would generally be a safe and cocooned one. One where opportunities are before us, waiting to be seized.",2,713,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00713
2014-03-04-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"But let us, for the moment, toss our mind back to when being 16 was a totally different ball game – our pioneers, our forefathers, the men and women who saw us through the early days. Being 16 in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s was acutely different from what we have today. For many, there was not the opportunity to be an average teenager. No such things as iPhones or even colour TV, no shopping centres to window shop at. At 16 in the 1940s, times were beyond tough. The war was continuing, people struggled to survive at the whims and fancies of a foreign occupier. Rather than the burgers that we have today, tapioca, sweet potatoes and a large serving of hardship were on the dinner table. I visit the Kranji War Cemetary often as it is quite near to my constituency. On a recent walk, I spent time at the Chinese Memorial and one name stood out – Lim Hood Tong. He was a Private and he was all of 19 years when he gave his life in defence of this land, not a nation as yet. That was the reality of the 1940s.",3,714,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00714
2014-03-04-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The 1950s gave way to perhaps just slightly less instability than during the Occupation years, but it was not any easier. Pre-Independence struggles were aplenty, the battle of ideologies. But on the human level, a 16-year-old in the 1950s was certainly no walk in the park as well.",4,715,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00715
2014-03-04-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Many families were large, meaning that there were many mouths to feed and an early start in maturity. Sixteen and working was certainly not out of the ordinary  helping parents to run a stall, doing the odd errands, starting out formal employment was all part and parcel of being 16. Education? Yes, many families regarded it as important. But could it feed a family immediately? And so, during the 1950s, many tough choices had to be made by families.",5,716,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00716
2014-03-04-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Then, came the 1960s – fast and furious, ""swinging 60s"", as many regard it now. But, again, for the average 16-year-old of the 1960s, the tunes on the radio may have attracted attention and so did the glitz and glamour of the era. But, again, the reality of the decade of our Independence still meant tough choices. There were racial tensions, Konfrontasi, joblessness, crime, gangs, all, again, not exactly what we would expect of the idyllic teenage years that we have today. So, when we became independent, student activism was still rife, but so was poverty, so was crime. At our Independence, we were given just three years to come crawling back.",6,717,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00717
2014-03-04-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"But look at where we are today. It was upon the shoulders of generations of 16-year-olds that have gone before us that we have a society that is safe, secure and full of opportunities that the generations before would have craved for. But they were of a tough and stoic generation. I became a new father just one day shy of six weeks ago and I have come to the realisation that parenthood comes with a seemingly impossible set of responsibilities. But most of all, I think for most parents, the hope is our children will continue to have the opportunities as they grow up, that their generation will continue to benefit from the hard work and efforts of the generations before them.",7,718,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00718
2014-03-04-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"But perhaps, more importantly, it is that they remember that it is upon the blood, sweat and tears of the pioneers before us that we have come thus far, that we are able to reap those same benefits. My grandfather was born in 1910. At 16, he came to Singapore and became a printing apprentice. Like so many of his generation, he gave his all and persevered. He raised a large family and eventually managed to set up his own printing press. He made efforts to give back to society, representing the clans, helping to build schools, funding hospitals. But yet he was to suddenly leave behind a large family to fend for themselves when he passed away in an accident. Like many other families of the time, health was not the best. For many of them, nutrition was a problem and so many families faced the same situation.",8,719,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00719

And my mother shared with me how in the early days when things were expensive for them, that she would spend time studying, doing her homework under a dim light and had to rock her baby brother with her toe while he was sleeping in his little 摇篮 or cradle. They did not have much. Sharing a little ice-ball at that time among four siblings came naturally.

2014-03-04-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"However, I would prefer that we see it less as a tribute to our pioneers, less as an effort to honour them. That is, in my mind, what we should not be doing through the PGP. To honour our pioneers, I urge more, so that their stories do not fade away. Not the stories of revolutionaries or the great men of the generations before us. That is the job of historians. But the simple heartfelt stories of ordinary men and women who made extraordinary sacrifices to help Singaporeans and their families succeed. I, therefore, call on MOE/MCCY to preserve and showcase these memories, lest we forget and allow them to fade from our collective memory as the years go by. That pioneering spirit cannot die with them. We can all continue to be pioneers in our own right. To allow a future generation to continue to be hungry for progress is, in itself, a tribute.",13,724,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00724
2014-03-04-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"I also echo the calls of Members like Mr Heng Chee How and Mr David Ong in reconsidering the hidden costs of ageism. I add my voice to the call by Mr David Ong to consider the eventual abolishment of the retirement age. This was done in the United Kingdom in 2011. To me, work should not be considered a privilege. It is a right. And age, in itself, is not a determinant of worth in our workplaces. For if truly meritocracy was what helped our pioneers to build a fair and just society that we have today, then age in itself should not be a barrier to meritocracy. So, I urge MOM to consider this and, with it, naturally, the differentiated CPF rates will become a topic of the past because work has become a right. And so we speak of honouring our pioneers. Let us not put artificial barriers where none should exist. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, in his Budget speech, has urged us to rethink our social norms and perhaps there is no time better than now.",14,725,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00725

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I see the PGP more as an overdue fulfilment of our filial duty towards our pioneers as a society. We owe it to them that we have the Singapore of today. Our safety, our progress, our growth and our success were due to their early sacrifices. So, let it not just be a simple ""Thank you"" and ""Thank you very much"", but a lingering handshake and a warm embrace for an entire generation of Singaporeans.

But more importantly, there was a final recommendation in the paper put forth by PAP.sg which was for the non-tangible factors to be remembered and focused on  that not just our pioneers, but our seniors and our elders in our society should be valued through our collective love, care and concern, of all of us around them, and that we continue to respect them and to give them the dignity of their place in our society.

To this end, management guru Peter Drucker, in 1957, observed that in an age of innovation, ""a practical education must prepare a man for work that does not yet exist and cannot yet be clearly defined. To be able to do this, a man must have learnt to learn."" Think about that for a moment. Do we have an education system that prepares our people for the future?

Like Dr Janil Puthucheary, I agree that the appetite for new ideas and risk-taking must start from young. Yet, our streaming policy and high-stakes testing environment perpetuate the fear of failure, and penalise us for getting wrong answers.

At school, the arts and arts education are just some of the ways to cultivate the creative, collaborative and critical thinking skills that are needed in today's world and in the future.

The ability to create, build and spread ideas is one of the most powerful tools for growth.

Hansel, a Singapore womenswear label, wanted to take advantage of the PIC scheme to purchase a Point-of-Sale system recently. However, they were so cash-strapped that even raising the funds to pay for the system upfront, before being reimbursed from the PIC cash payout, was extremely difficult. I, therefore, join my fellow Nominated Member Mr Teo Siong Seng's call, as well as others' in this House, to help our micro-enterprises and SMEs survive and develop.",18,746,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00746
2014-03-04-T-003,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Sir, sometimes, this is not just about more funding. Grant funding is welcome but they tend to come with onerous application requirements and KPIs. Perhaps, larger companies with the resources and manpower find it easier to manage these processes. But designers running a two- or three-person outfit rarely have the capabilities to do so. In fact, a jewellery designer jokingly told me that, despite her five years' experience as Managing Director of an international advertising agency, she still finds it challenging to navigate the application process! Sir, to help our micro-enterprises access Government funding, we must simplify the grant criteria and processes.",19,747,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00747
2014-03-04-T-003,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"A dollar spent on a local product goes further than one spent on an import. To better support the presence of Singapore design in the market, could we consider ""cluster"" housing for creative enterprises in unused Government buildings or conserved spaces at affordable or low rents? Not only will this bring vibrancy to a precinct or neighbourhood, it builds a strong identity for Singapore's design culture, and international visitors have the unique opportunity to buy products they cannot get anywhere else.",20,748,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00748
2014-03-04-T-003,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Sir, we also need to broaden and soften the KPIs for this sector. Rather than looking at target sales and financials as outcomes, could we not give more value to other forms of impact, like the contributions they make to quality of life and Singapore's reputation internationally? After all, our creative industries have great potential to extend Singapore's soft power overseas. The success of home-grown fashion label Ong-Shunmugam on the runways of New York or at Paris Fashion Week has a tremendous knock-on effect on how Singapore is perceived as a creative hub. The international accolades for ""Ilo Ilo"" have thrown the spotlight not only on Singapore cinema, but on Singapore as a whole. Shown in over 30 territories across the world, it is a powerful way of projecting who we are, our stories and our creativity to a global audience.",21,749,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00749
2014-03-04-T-003,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Sir, the value of our creative industries lies in their ability to seed original ideas, nurture human capital, and play a role in cultural diplomacy. It is not enough for Singapore to be a host to international creative companies. We should also aspire to nurture our own Singapore brands, talents and enterprises in this sector. This has economic benefits, in terms of value capture and building economic resilience. But more importantly, it brings social benefits – it fosters our sense of national pride and identity through Singapore-inspired products, as well as inspires the next generation of creative talent for Singapore.",22,750,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00750

2014-03-04-T-003,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),The past few years have seen an outpouring of frustration from Singaporeans who feel that they have had to welcome too many foreigners too fast. This has had an impact on wages and prices. The fact that such concerns have led to the heartfelt expression of a Singapore identity is both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge lies in the risk of xenophobia – that we shrink to fit our tiny island by becoming small-minded and hard-hearted. The opportunity arises from the basic fact that we are much bigger than that. Space is tight. But our history is one of welcome and accommodation. Singapore has never only been for Singaporeans. That so many people of such diversity would express such a strong commitment to this place is something to be proud of.,25,753,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00753

When I first joined Parliament in 2012, debate over the fate of Bukit Brown cemetery was raging. Pragmatism has prevailed and some exhumations are underway. But we all know it was a turning point. Many Singaporeans discovered a new passion for their heritage. Some even realised their own family history had lain hidden more or less under their noses for decades. The assumption that people will accept development at all costs can no longer be taken for granted. As Prof Wang Gungwu recently wrote about Bukit Brown in mind, ""For a community to thrive, it is vital for each to defend the right to preserve what its members want.""

Safe – security; and busy – commerce. But something in Singapore is still not working well. Why do polls show Singaporeans as amongst the most pessimistic people in the world?

2014-03-04-T-003,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),The Government is right to acknowledge that the Pioneer Generation started working at a younger age but to set the bar at 16 years old at Independence is a little too precise and will exclude Singaporeans who had to quit school to work during those times.,5,771,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00771

2014-03-04-T-003,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),The Government has also acknowledged this fact by allowing people who marginally miss out on the precise criteria to appeal on a case-by-case basis. But what will the authority look for in an appeal? How does one prove that he or she was working before age 16 in an era where employment terms and contracts were mostly verbal for daily-rated and blue collar workers?

The Pioneer Generation Package has addressed a fundamental concern of our elderly citizens – healthcare expenses. The package has even gone a step further by intending to fully cover the premiums of MediShield Life for citizens aged 80 and above in 2014. This is reassuring. However, I seek clarification from the Minister whether this premium relief will also be extended to members who will turn 80 years old in 2015 and beyond.",10,776,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00776

While caring for handicapped parents can be a shared responsibility among family members, caring for a handicapped spouse remains the sole responsibility of the other half. There is no one else to share the burden. Likewise, caring for a handicapped child may also remain the sole responsibility of a sole breadwinner as the other half takes leave to care for the child. Thus, it does not really matter who the handicapped member of the household is, the financial burden on the immediate caregiver is heavy.",23,789,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00789

There is certainly more room for these two lower reliefs to move up for reasons stated earlier. I see no disparity between caring for a live-in handicapped parent or handicapped spouse. Both are lifelong commitments with heavy responsibilities.,24,790,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00790
2014-03-04-T-003,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),I also urge the Government to look into providing more assistance for families with loved ones who are totally incapacitated and need round-the-clock assistance for basic living activities.

Particularly, the Pioneer Generation is appreciative of the recognition and appreciate what the Government and fellow Singaporeans are showing them.",2,793,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00793
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"This Budget is many things to many people. But I think one of the commonalities among the myriad of people with an opinion on this Budget is that it is a generous one. At the very least, 450,000 of our older folks will benefit from the Pioneer Generation Package. But Mr Deputy Speaker, I would argue that because of the many provisions in the subsidies towards their healthcare cost, the beneficiaries go beyond the 450,000 older folks. This is because, rightly or wrongly, I would assume that being an Asian society, many Singaporeans are looking after their elders. So, the savings in healthcare cost spent on their parents would translate to savings for the children of the 450,000 older beneficiaries.",3,794,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00794

They were concerned that the possible shrinking tax base and greying population will present a strain on funding in fulfilling the commitment to the Pioneer Generation Package. They need not worry. The Pioneer Generation fund of $8 billion is not an endowment, but a trust fund. This amount comes directly from one Budget, thus circumventing the need to draw on our reserves for future spending on our Pioneer Generation.",5,796,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00796
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"However, Sir, I am concerned that as we move along, will the Government of the day be expected by future cohorts of seniors to be aided by similar packages? We just heard from the hon Member Mr Png Eng Huat that perhaps the age of 16 in 1965 may not be the cut-off. May I ask Mr Png what age would he feel is appropriate? Would he set it at 1949 and before? Perhaps, he could enlighten us and give us his suggestion.",6,797,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00797
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"With the greying population and a lower tax base, such packages may pose greater pressures on the Government and the future generation. Some years ago, we had to draw on our reserves to meet the needs of many. As they faced the challenges brought about by the global financial crisis in 2008, our Government back then was, indeed, prudent to return the $4 billion back into our reserves the moment the dark economic clouds lifted.",7,798,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00798
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"We need to remain prudent as before. This characterises Singapore from many others. While executing many of these aid programmes, I would go as far as to say that many a time the same prudence at policy level had at the execution level irked many of those applying for aid, and I believe Ms Janice Koh had also touched on that earlier.",8,799,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00799
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Many pointed at the Government for being ham-fisted and the means-testing in place had drawn much ire. However, the Pioneer Generation Package bears no such condition and benefits all above the age of 65, all those born before 1949. This is the right thing to do for our pioneers. While the benefits drawn down by the pioneers may gradually be less as the group gets smaller, one would expect that this fund would, indeed, be sustainable. But I wonder if medical and healthcare cost inflation would affect the draw on the fund. After all, the issues and the pain over the last few years had been about rising medical cost. Therefore, the concern I expressed for future generations and the Government of the day to come up with successive packages expected of them will be a serious contention.",9,800,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00800
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Even with the best intentions and preparations and planning for one's retirement, it is difficult to predict medical and healthcare cost inflation. Speak to any pensioners and they would tell you retirement planning can be a game of Russian roulette; more so for today's workers.",10,801,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00801
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Sir, what is interesting is that during the conversations I had with some of the residents in Clementi on the Budget, they brought up the fact that the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong had also presented Hong Kong's Budget days after us. The same folks pointed out that they were struck by the screaming headlines that Hong Kong could be in deficit in seven to 15 years if no new source of financing is found and if the Hong Kong government continues spending at the rate they have been on healthcare and welfare needs. What a difference the two governments are facing.",11,802,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00802
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Our ability to be able to be in such an enviable position is the combination of consistent practice of fiscal prudence, financial discipline, competent economic management and, may I add, political will. Many years ago, with public consultation, a White Paper and a rigorous debate, the GST was introduced despite much resistance. Many packages were in place to soften the impact of the GST introduction. Even as we speak, GST rebate vouchers featured in the Government assistance for many families. As we see the Japanese having to raise GST and Hong Kong's inability to introduce the same, it does say something about how Singapore faces up to the issues and how we deal with them.",12,803,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00803
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Singapore would be celebrating our Golden Jubilee, our 50th Anniversary as an independent state next year.

2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"The details of how the Government has structured and funded the Pioneer Generation Package have been lauded by both Government and Opposition Members of Parliament. No disagreement with that. Mr Liang Eng Hwa has cautioned that we need to continue to be prudent and responsible. He is right. And I take comfort in knowing that the Government, working with the Pioneer Generation, has brought us here and will continue with the fiscal probity that we have come to expect, and, I dare say, ""enjoy the fruits of"".",14,805,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00805

2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"While we are thankful for the recognition and assistance to the Pioneer Generation and somewhat easing the financial commitment for the children of our pioneers, it must remain a social more that we must endeavour and are duty-bound to take care of our parents and our seniors. We need to watch this carefully. We cannot abdicate the care of our parents and our seniors to the state, even if the state can afford it. We cannot take our eyes off this aspect in the development of our society. Social norms do change and it can come about from the acts of the Government, however sincere and meaningful the intentions may be.",16,807,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00807
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"In other aspects, our radar needs to be up and observing trends where specific policies to tackle issues can overlap yet with another policy that becomes a grandfather's knot. Going back a few years, we saw many of our home-grown industries thriving on the back of the Asian economic recovery and the generation of healthy profits to gain market share. This was achieved through a dependence on foreign labour to meet the demands and boost production capacities. So, weaning off this dependency is painful, but we cannot ignore this. We are on borrowed time.",17,808,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00808
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"However, I am not sure that productivity can be a panacea for this problem of labour. I spoke with some union members and they have seen the push towards productivity taking root. So, the rallying call by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech for a change in social norms towards productivity and, hence, higher pay, is taking root. But there are, as Ms Janice Koh mentioned, smaller micro businesses that will face a very different set of problems. Labour productivity is important. But for some of these micro businesses, they will first need labour.",18,809,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00809
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"On the real estate front, a property market where prices today are reported to be still two-thirds above the 2009 baseline have skyrocketed, bringing along with it rental rates in no small way, contributing to the higher cost for business owners. I am glad that the Finance Minister is maintaining the current trajectory on the property cooling measures.",19,810,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00810
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),Business owners have remarked that it would take time for rental costs to come down as leases renew. The effects of the measures in this respect have yet to be felt by business owners whose rental costs count as another bugbear to their businesses.,20,811,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00811
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"This is probably the third year in a row that the business community is calling for some help, notwithstanding the Government's call for all to boost productivity. There is evidence abound of the local business community struggling and some sinking fast. For instance, cleaning contractors not being able to find manpower, resulting in many of the tables at our hawker centres and food courts with used utensils not cleared; Town Council contractors having a difficult time to hire Singaporeans as cleaners. Our restaurants are closing down or downsizing because of the lack of labour. Examples abound.",21,812,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00812
2014-03-04-T-003,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Sir, a lot of the companies are calling out for help. If we ask the business community in Singapore if they are getting more and more expensive, I would say the ayes would have it. I empathise with the feeling of local business owners and totally understand their challenges. They are caught in a strait-jacketed situation of not getting the foreign workers they need and not being able to get Singaporean workers to do the type of work they need, And, now, in the face of rising business costs, they face the double jeopardy of rising labour costs of higher foreign worker levy and 1% CPF increment for their local workers.",22,813,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00813

2014-03-04-T-003,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,I did not ask the Government to set a lower age. I did ask the Government to err on the side of goodwill and generosity for people at the fringe of the cut-off age when they appeal to be included in the pioneer status.,1,816,2014-03-04-T-003-S-00816
