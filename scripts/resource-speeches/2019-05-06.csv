2019-05-06-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Education in the past three years (a) how many cases of sexual harassment or misconduct have been reported by undergraduate students in each of the Autonomous Universities; and (b) how many of such cases have been referred to the Police for prosecution.,1,1,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00001
2019-05-06-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Education (a) how many cases of serious disciplinary cases involving students at our institutes of higher learning (IHLs) have there been over the last three years; (b) how many students have been expelled; and (c) how does the Ministry ensure that the disciplinary frameworks for the IHLs are robust and consistent.,1,2,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00002
2019-05-06-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Education (a) for each year from 2008, how many cases of on campus sexual harassment and sexual assault at Autonomous Universities were reported to the campus authorities; (b) how many resulted in administrative penalties from campus authorities and no further action; (c) how many resulted in administrative penalties and Police action; (d) what were the nature of the administrative punishments issued; (e) what were the considerations behind determining administrative penalties; and (f) what support was provided to victims in such cases.",1,3,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00003
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Speaker, Sir, can I take the next three questions together, please.",1,4,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00004
2019-05-06-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,5,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00005
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Members have raised three areas of concern. First, the number of sexual misconduct cases across the Autonomous Universities, or AUs, over the years. Second, the adequacy of law enforcement and disciplinary actions in deterring potential offenders. Third, the support systems that have been put in place to help victims, in a timely and effective manner that is sensitive to their needs. I will address the first two aspects, while Second Minister Indranee will cover the final aspect.",1,6,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00006
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, Members may want to pose your supplementary questions after both of us have given our replies.",2,7,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00007
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, incidence rates of sexual misconduct in the AUs. Over the past three years, the six AUs handled a total of 42 disciplinary cases involving sexual misconduct within campuses. But there were another 14 cases committed by students that happened outside of campuses – making a total of 56 cases. I know that Mr Leon Perera in his question referred to cases within campuses. But since the focus of my reply today is on the penalty framework of the AUs rather than campus security, I will refer to all 56 cases today in my reply.",3,8,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00008
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Let me give a breakdown of the 56 cases.,4,9,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00009
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"There were 17 cases in Academic Year 2015, 18 cases in Academic Year 2016, and 21 cases in Academic Year 2017 across all six AUs.",5,10,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00010
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Twenty-five out of the 56 cases were from NUS; two from Yale-NUS which has its own Board of Discipline separate from NUS; 20 were from NTU; and six were from SMU. SUTD, SIT and SUSS had one case each over the last three years. So, the number of cases for each AU is closely related to their student population.",6,11,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00011
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Finally, 37 or about 66% of the cases were related to voyeurism, that is, peeping Toms and filming of people in vulnerable positions.",7,12,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00012
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As the student population changes from year to year, what is more meaningful is to express this as an incidence rate, that is, the number of sexual misconduct cases involving student perpetrators per 1,000 students. That is probably a better measurement. The number was 0.21, 0.21 and 0.20 over the last three academic years, showing no discernible trend.",8,13,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00013
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me now talk about penalties for the offenders. Of the 56 cases, the victims in 37 cases made Police reports. Of these 37 cases, four cases are still under investigation and for two, there was insufficient evidence to make out offences. So, there is a remainder of 31 cases. Out of the remaining 31, 10 cases resulted in jail terms of between 10 days and eight months. And these 10 are serious offences, involving outrage of modesty or multiple instances of voyeurism. These are all arising from Police reports and then Police action. Minister Shanmugam will explain later how the Police deal with these cases.",9,14,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00014
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Separately, apart from Police action, the AUs will carry out their own disciplinary processes through their respective disciplinary bodies and mete out a combination of penalties that is within the AUs’ powers and authority. These range from an official reprimand, which will be reflected in the student’s formal educational record, to suspensions, and expulsion, which is the harshest punishment an AU can administer.",10,15,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00015
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"To determine the appropriate sanctions, each case is evaluated by the disciplinary body, taking into account the severity of the misconduct and any mitigating factors, such as how remorseful and forthcoming the offender was during investigations, the potential for rehabilitation and the presence of any mental health issues. For offenders with psychiatric conditions, sanctions will include requiring the offender to start, or continue, with mandatory counselling and psychological treatment.",11,16,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00016
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Of the 56 cases I mentioned earlier that happened over the last three years, five cases are pending disciplinary hearings and four students withdrew from the University before sanctions were imposed. So, out of the remaining 47 cases, 34 resulted in an official reprimand, 26 resulted in suspensions of up to two academic terms and 20 were banned from entering students' dorms. These numbers do not add up to 47 because typically, an offender received a combination of penalties.",12,17,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00017
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But if we just look at the 10 Police cases involving serious offences which led to jail sentences, there was only one expulsion, which was subsequently reduced to an 18-month suspension after appeal and the taking into account of the offender's psychiatric condition.",13,18,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00018
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I think there is no need for me to repeat my views on the adequacies of the penalties meted out by the AUs, but I will give two strong reasons why the AUs will need to review their disciplinary frameworks with a view to strengthen the penalties.",14,19,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00019
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, we need to better balance the objectives of deterrence and redress for the victims against the rehabilitation of the offender. Balancing these objectives is important for an education institution, but it should not end up with penalties that are too soft and too lenient. Our AUs are important national institutions that educate and nurture young Singaporeans to be contributing and responsible members of society.",15,20,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00020
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"To achieve this, the AUs' disciplinary frameworks should therefore be stringent but fair. ""Two strikes and you're out"" cannot be the standard application. But neither should expulsions be the default for all forms of misconduct. The penalty must continue to fit the offence, but there has to be a significant adjustment at the most egregious end of the spectrum of misconducts when they are serious criminal offences that undermine the safety and security of University campuses. We must ensure that potential offenders know the severe consequences of their actions, including the impact on their future. There has to be a deterrent.",16,21,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00021
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"And if the offender is remorseful, accepted and served punishment, he deserves a chance to make good. This is also the spirit behind the Yellow Ribbon project, and this is how we balance deterrence and rehabilitation.",17,22,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00022
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second reason, we must recognise that voyeurism is a growing concern in Singapore. A recent ""Big Read"" article by TODAY – published last weekend – gave a good explanation that this may be because the young are exposed to the Internet from an early age, and technological advances make video recording easier and more undetectable. This led to some thinking that voyeurism is not a serious offence, and they cannot be more wrong. Coincidentally, MHA is amending the Penal Code, which will be debated this afternoon, to include new provisions on voyeurism.",18,23,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00023
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As our circumstances change, the AUs must likewise keep up with the times and ensure that their policies and processes remain relevant in establishing a safe and supportive environment for all students. I have therefore asked all our AUs, Polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education to review their disciplinary frameworks.",19,24,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00024
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the case of NUS, it has convened a Review Committee led by Mdm Kay Kuok – a member of its Board of Trustees – to review its disciplinary framework. I know many students are not excited by Committees, but this is a necessary process to bring about a considered change to an established disciplinary framework.",20,25,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00025
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Review Committee has started its work, and will release its recommendations in stages. The Committee members will release some preliminary recommendations in the middle of May for consultations and aim to complete their work in June this year. In the meantime, NUS management is taking immediate actions to improve the support systems and campus security, which Second Minister Indranee will elaborate on later.",21,26,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00026
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ultimately, the AUs are tackling the concern on campus and student safety holistically, involving tougher penalties for offenders, better physical security on campus, and stronger support and greater sensitivity for the needs of victims.",22,27,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00027
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me end with just one last comment. This incident provided an opportunity for us to reflect on the character of our society. And I can see that we are a people with a strong sense of justice, who see the importance of differentiating between right from wrong; and this explains the strong reaction to Ms Monica Baey's situation. We also continue to believe in tough but fair systems of punishment to keep the Singapore living environment the way it has been.",23,28,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00028
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"These are characteristics of our society that I am proud of as a Singaporean. But we should always refrain from trial by media, doxxing and resorting to mob justice. No matter how wrong an offender is, we need to respect the due process. During this episode, the harshest punishment for Nicholas Lim came from the social media. I hope that as a society, we will give his family and him the time and space they need, to reflect on his actions, to turn over a new leaf and move forward.",24,29,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00029
2019-05-06-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Monica Baey herself has said, that as hurt and affected as she is, her objective in publicising her story was not to seek revenge for the present case, but to ensure fairness for both the perpetrator and the victim in future cases. So, the most important priority now is for the AUs to see how they can do better, and take concrete steps to improve campus safety and their victim support frameworks and processes. They are strongly committed to doing so, I am confident there will be swift and meaningful changes, and my Ministry will work closely with them on these aspects.",25,30,2019-05-06-T-001-S-00030
2019-05-06-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Education what measures are in place to prevent sexual harassment in all school settings and what will be done to enhance student protection.,1,31,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00031
2019-05-06-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Education what safeguards and measures are in place at Institutes of Higher Learning to (i) protect students from sexual harassment or misconduct and (ii) support affected victims and facilitate case reporting.,1,32,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00032
2019-05-06-T-002,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Minister for Education (a) what measures were put in place to reduce sexual harassment and misconduct in Autonomous Universities and polytechnics after reports of sexualised harassment during orientation activities in 2016; (b) what steps were taken to review these measures subsequently; (c) what were the shortcomings; (d) what steps have been taken to improve; and (e) what further steps are planned.,1,33,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00033
2019-05-06-T-002,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Education (a) what are the forms of training provided at educational institutions to address sexual harassment and assault cases, including support for victims; (b) what are the measures to support victims; (c) what are the policies pertaining to investigating allegations of sexual harassment and assault; and (d) what are the procedures in place to review the effectiveness of such measures and to propose improvements.",1,34,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00034
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Education),"Mr Speaker, with your permission, may I take Question Nos 4 to 7 together?",1,35,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00035
2019-05-06-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,36,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00036
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Minister Ong addressed questions relating to the disciplinary frameworks in the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and the reviews that the IHLs, including the Autonomous Universities (AUs) are undertaking. I will now address the other questions raised in relation to sexual misconduct in educational institutions.",1,37,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00037
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about the prevention of sexual harassment in school settings. Students' safety and well-being are our priority. Schools take a firm stand against sexual harassment and exercise judgement to ensure that disciplinary actions reflect the circumstances of each case. Depending on the facts of the case, a Police report may be made.",2,38,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00038
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Beyond disciplinary measures, students are taught to identify risks to their personal safety and learn to seek help from trusted adults, such as their parents and teachers. Teachers are trained to look out for signs of distress and provide victims first-line help. Both students and teachers are supported by school counsellors and other external agencies, where required. MOE works with the schools regularly to ensure that support measures are relevant and effective.",3,39,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00039
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The other areas of concern raised by Ms Foo Mee Har, Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap and Mr Leon Perera and which I will now address is what support is currently available in IHLs for the victims of sexual offences and whether it is sufficient, as well as what measures are being taken to ensure a safe environment for all students on campus.",4,40,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00040
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In terms of support, the first and most fundamental thing to understand is that sexual misconduct can have a lasting psychological and emotional impact on victims. The sense of violation and fear that victims – male and female – experience is real and can be crippling. For many, the road to recovery can be long and painful. It takes courage for any victim to come forward and report the incident. There must be strong end-to-end support for victims, starting from the time they step forward to report an incident, to post-incident counselling and psychological support.",5,41,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00041
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The recent case reported by NUS student Monica Baey shows that insofar as NUS is concerned, there were shortcomings in victim support and there were clearly areas which were lacking. NUS has acknowledged this and has committed to doing better. NUS is serious about improving its frameworks and processes and has convened a high-level Review Committee to oversee the implementation of various measures by NUS management. One of the immediate steps is the establishment of a Victim Care Unit.",6,42,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00042
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The other IHLs are similarly concerned and are in the process of reviewing their support for victims with a focus on ensuring that the support provided is holistic, timely and accessible. For example, some IHLs have in place 24-hour helplines for incident reporting or counselling services. These ensure that victims or any distressed students receive timely support, even if they come forward outside regular office hours.",7,43,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00043
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"As the IHLs do their reviews, there are three broad areas of focus.",8,44,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00044
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First, support for victims. All the IHLs have full-time counsellors on site to support victims, as well as a larger group of staff who are trained as para-counsellors to provide additional support. Counsellors are also trained in managing such difficult situations sensitively.",9,45,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00045
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Our IHLs will look to strengthen these provisions, taking the victim's entire journey in mind. The support must extend beyond counselling and begin at the point that the victim first reaches out for help. We should also ensure victims feel safe to step forward and report cases when they occur and seek help.",10,46,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00046
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"A good support system must create psychological safety for victims, guide them through the processes and protocols involved in the management of their case, update them on investigations and ensure that their concerns and questions are addressed along the entire journey. All these must be done sensitively and with empathy.",11,47,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00047
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"We also need to recognise that individuals have different resilience and coping levels and that some of the trauma and stress might not manifest immediately. For more severe cases, such as sexual assault, our IHLs will need to be equipped to make judgement calls about the victims’ emotional state and quickly call for external professional help where needed. These are important details that will have to be worked out carefully.",12,48,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00048
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Second, campus security to deter would-be offenders. Currently, CCTVs complement campus security guards to ensure security in common areas and some institutions take the additional precautionary measure of having controlled access to female bathrooms and toilets.",13,49,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00049
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"More will be done. Over this past week, NUS started installing full-height doors and partitions in the restrooms of all its hostels and sports facilities, as well as new locks at the entrances of the hostel restrooms. Additional CCTV cameras are being installed at more locations on campus. NUS will deploy more security guards at its hostels and introduce roving security patrols across campus. These changes will further strengthen privacy and security on campus.",14,50,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00050
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"NUS expects to complete these enhancements in the coming months. As part of their overall review of campus security, the IHLs will take steps to address new forms of threats, such as the illegal installation of miniature cameras. For example, SUSS is collaborating with SPF to train its security staff to inspect toilet cubicles or ceilings for such cameras.",15,51,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00051
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Third, ensuring a collective stand against sexual misconduct in a modern age.",16,52,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00052
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"At its core, the issue is about respect for others. There are some who mistakenly think that voyeurism and verbal harassment are not serious because there is no physical contact with the victims. And this is very simply, just wrong. Voyeurism and other unwanted non-physical harassment exact psychological and emotional harm on victims and, similar to other types of sexual misconduct, have no place in our society. Perpetrators are no less culpable just because they did not come into physical contact with their victims.",17,53,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00053
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"We can and, therefore, must do better to educate students not only on the importance of respect, but also what constitutes harm and violation. The IHLs are committed to this and will be taking steps to strengthen such education. For instance, NUS will be introducing a course on respect and consent at the start of the new academic year for all students, faculty and staff.",18,54,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00054
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Technology has also amplified the potential for harm arising from sexual misconduct. Take voyeurism, for example. With image-capturing devices becoming ubiquitous, especially on mobile phones, such crimes are no longer contained between the victim and perpetrator, and the potential for mass dissemination is much higher. We are updating the Penal Code to deal with technology-enabled sex crimes. Institutional processes must likewise keep up with the times.",19,55,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00055
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Institutions and organisations must also recognise that expectations of how they should respond are changing, not just in Singapore but globally. The “me too” movement is an example. As societal norms and expectations change, all organisations need to keep up with the times, send clear signals that sexual misconduct is unacceptable and equip themselves to deal with sexual misconduct complaints appropriately should they arise.",20,56,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00056
2019-05-06-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"At the end of the day, the best deterrent and protection in such cases is if we respect others, both in the physical and emotional space, and conduct ourselves accordingly.",21,57,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00057
2019-05-06-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have two supplementary questions for the Minister. I think it is good to hear about installing more CCTVs, doors and so on. Those are hardware, infrastructure. I would like to ask is there a more deep-rooted culture of sexual harassment in our campuses. If there is, what action is going to be taken to eliminate this deep-rooted culture of sexual harassment?",1,58,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00058
2019-05-06-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The second question is, I think what we need is education, or even a campaign on zero tolerance towards sexual harassment. So, in this aspect, is there anything that can be done?",2,59,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00059
2019-05-06-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The first question is whether there is a deep-rooted trend of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a type of sexual misconduct. There are several types  outrage of modesty, sexual assault, sexual harassment. At the AUs, the big bulk, about two-thirds, is still voyeurism. Based on the data I gave just now, there has not been a rising trend in the last three years. However, I do also acknowledge all the explanations that some of the literature has given including the ""Big Read"" article in TODAY that I mentioned earlier, that the young today grow up with Internet, they are exposed to pornographic websites, they know of miniature photography and recording devices, and sometimes, they get these materials through their WhatsApp. Over time, they may have the idea that ""Actually, this is no big deal"". This is what we worry about. It has not manifested in terms of higher incidence rates – at least not over the last three years. But we do worry about this underlying trend.",1,60,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00060
2019-05-06-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I do agree with the Members – we need to send a strong signal. It has to be a combination of measures between what I and Second Minister Indranee have talked about, tougher penalties, education, improving the physical security as well as better support for both the victims as well as, sometimes, for the offenders in counselling them and helping them turn over a new leaf.",2,61,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00061
2019-05-06-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"I have two questions for Minister Ong. The first is, had this incident not been taken on the social media and gained so much attention, would the Ministry and AUs have taken actions to review the disciplinary framework? The second question is, the Minister mentioned that the AUs are now undergoing this full review. When they are ready, would the Ministry ensure that the revisions are adequate and serve their purpose?",1,62,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00062

2019-05-06-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"It is true. The thing is if this incident was not taken to social media and had not gained that much attention, would the Ministry and the AUs already have undertaken this review since in the last three years, there was no increase in rates?",1,64,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00064
2019-05-06-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Okay, I see. Should we not have done this earlier, in other words. The AUs do review their disciplinary framework from time to time. NUS' framework was reviewed about five years ago, and it was probably due for review. But I think what this incident has taught all of us is that there is a stronger concern and some underlying trends. I think we do need to make it tougher at the egregious end of the offence. Should we have done this earlier? I wish we had but I think there are many things that we do, sometimes, ahead of time, and we are also being questioned, ""Why do you do it now?"", ""Aren't you going to open up other problems?"" In this case, unfortunately, that did not happen but I think what is more important is immediate action is being taken now. I am confident that there will be swift and decisive actions.",1,65,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00065
2019-05-06-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The second question is how we would know if the measures will be adequate. I think after this furore, the AUs all understand the implications of this.

2019-05-06-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mr Speaker, I just wanted to ask the Minister, I thought 37 cases of voyeurism over three years was quite a lot. Frankly, I am quite disappointed that the AUs did not take earlier action to review their processes to better deal with the complaints. I am wondering would the Minister review why the AUs did not take further action, having seen the number of cases that have been reported over the three years. If we do not get to the root of the problem, then whatever we do, the AUs will not do anything to review the process until the matter goes up to social media. That is one point. Two other queries.",1,67,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00067

2019-05-06-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"And also, whether the Minister will consider asking the AUs to publicise the punishment of offenders to students in the AUs, so that there is also a learning message for everyone that there is some deterrent effect.

2019-05-06-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The first question is again, looking back, why did we not realise that was serious? Of course, we wish that there was a realisation that these are serious offences. Voyeurism is a rising concern. But having said that, today, after this incident, I believe that the AUs are all very aware and I am confident that they will do something swift and decisive. I am confident of that. And we will work closely with them.",1,70,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00070
2019-05-06-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As to publicising the punishment, NUS has actually been publicising the cases, the sexual misconduct cases and the punishment that has been meted out to them. It is available on their students' website; which is why after the latest incident, there were several press reports about past cases, because it was publicly available within the NUS website. I think we can publicise but fundamentally, as what I have mentioned, the penalties are just not stiff enough. We just need to toughen them up and send a strong signal that at the most egregious end of the offences, there must be very stiff punishment.",2,71,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00071

Minister Indranee alluded to the infrastructural changes that are happening in the NUS now, the retrofitting of the shower cubicles, the locks, additional security cameras and so on. It is a shame that it took this incident of Ms Monica Baey coming forward before these changes are actually made given the number of voyeurism offences that have taken place in the previous years. My supplementary question would be, are these infrastructural changes to enhance security being done across the board for all the IHLs? And is there a time frame for this to be carried out?",1,72,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00072

They are expected to be completed in the coming months. For the other AUs, they will have to complete their review. But the short answer is that they are all looking at it and their priority is to make sure that the campus is safe for students.",1,73,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00073

The second question is, are we considering, given the numbers that you have shared, a kind of cross-campus body that would help to manage such incidents? I am wondering because a student does not stay in a University if he has been found to have committed a misconduct or act. Would he then go to another University? And so, is there this cross-campus sharing of information and therefore, that warrants a body to be set up?",1,74,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00074

That is not rocket science. It just needs certain fundamental values which is that you must respect other people, respect their privacy, respect their physical space, respect their emotional space. So, we can and the AUs will be embarking, as I had mentioned in my earlier response, on better education for the students. But fundamentally, it boils down to values. That is a function partly of parents, partly schools and teachers and the individual himself or herself.

I understand that the student in the controversy of this NUS Peeping Tom incident said that he was at the hostel after midnight with the intention to stay over at his girlfriend's hostel room, even though he was not a resident of the hostel. I would like to ask what is the security arrangement for the NUS hostel and the hostels at the other Universities. Would they allow people to go into the hostels after midnight and what is the response from the Universities?",1,78,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00078

So, I think that this particular incident will be cause for the Universities to reflect on how that arrangement should be managed. Obviously, you do not want to prevent friends from coming to see each other, but the proper recording and the security arrangements for that should be in place. So, in short, as a result of this, I think the Universities will be reviewing much more closely.",1,79,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00079

I appreciate the discretion that the respective AUs have to review their procedures in the light of Monica Baey's ordeal. I would like to ask the Minister would he think that there is room for some form of minimum standards that MOE could prescribe to the respective boards that are reviewing the different measures, to ensure they have some kind of minimum standards to which disciplinary actions that will be meted out. This is to send that strong signal that the Minister referred to. Secondly, on the safety measures, what would be some minimum standards where people who live in the Halls would have to observe? Last but not least, what would be some of the minimum standards on training and imparting of skills for the counsellors dealing with this sensitive matter of people being subjected to sexual harassment?",1,81,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00081
2019-05-06-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I think we also need to respect the fact that they are Autonomous Universities having their own boards and governing themselves in a fairly independent way, separate from MOE. So, for us to issue standards or codes or rules to the Universities would not be appropriate. We can do that for Polytechnics because they are Statutory Boards, and we can do that for ITE. But for AUs, they are differently incorporated and structured.",1,82,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00082

2019-05-06-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, just two questions for the Minister. The first is on the issue of standards. The concern here is that what attracts a suspension in one University might only attract a reprimand or expulsion in another. Then, there would be a sense of injustice that the Universities differ significantly on the standards. And that is why I think it is important that MOE does come in with this suasion and coordinated approach.",1,84,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00084
2019-05-06-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The second question is that I think when we look at the disciplinary committees, there is some concern that they may not have the right expertise or skills to discharge all of their functions because, frankly, they are not the Police or the Attorney-General's Chambers. They are not professional adjudicators or finders of facts. So, I wonder what can the Ministry do here to ensure that these committees have the skills necessary to interview the parties concerned, to investigate and to assure the public that justice is being done here.",2,85,2019-05-06-T-002-S-00085

2019-05-06-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The second question is expertise. The disciplinary boards of the review committees will need to have certain members, including having student representatives. But of course, if they need enforcement or legal advice, I am sure they can ask for it and they are able to tap on it. After all, it is a university; lots of different talent in different expertise.

2019-05-06-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Perera and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah have asked about the cases of sexual misconduct in the Autonomous Universities or AUs that were reported to Police. Earlier, MOE had informed Parliament that from Academic Year (AY) 2015/2016 to AY 2017/2018, 56 cases of sexual misconduct were reported to the AUs and 37 of these cases were reported to the Police. There was insufficient evidence to make out offences in two cases, and investigations in another four cases are on-going. Of the remaining 31 cases, 16 were prosecuted in court. There were jail sentences in 10 cases. Supervised probation was imposed by the Courts in four cases and a discharge not amounting to an acquittal was given by the Court in one case.

Two others were given a stern warning. Fourteen of the 15 students who were administered warnings, or 93%, did not re-offend. The one NUS student who re-offended had originally been issued with a conditional warning for a voyeurism offence he committed in 2015; he re-offended in 2017 and the Police prosecuted him in court for both his 2015 and 2017 offences.

The assessment was that his risk of re-offending was low and he would benefit from continual mental health treatment. If he was put in jail, that could get affected. The fact that he did not have any prior history was also relevant. In the end, AGC directed Police to withdraw the charges and he was given a 24-month conditional warning.

But briefly, there were factors which could have justified charging him, the primary one, of course, being that he had done something very wrong. These factors were weighed against other factors, which would justify giving him another chance. The Police weighed both sets of factors, and decided that a conditional warning was appropriate. It was one of those cases, quite usual, normal for Police, where the decision was based on judgement. Police assessed him to be remorseful and likely to reform. He confessed voluntarily within minutes of the offence being committed and well before any Police report was made. He was cooperative with the Police. He had not circulated the video. That had been deleted. Other factors have also been mentioned in the Police statement.",31,128,2019-05-06-T-003-S-00128

As the cases at the Autonomous Universities show, most who were given conditional warnings did not re-offend.

2019-05-06-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"And there is strong public outcry.

We need to send a strong signal to everyone that we have zero tolerance for sexual harassment. I agree with the Minister that we need tougher laws, but I disagree that in sentencing, we compare like-for-like. In fact, the sentencing should be heavier, compared to the previous one. So, I hope, the Minister will consider that.",3,136,2019-05-06-T-003-S-00136
2019-05-06-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me try and answer that. Who makes the decision on assessment for rehabilitation. I went into the factors in some detail just now. The investigating officers and their superiors make the Police assessment. They do this every day. It is not just for victims of sexual offences, but other offences too. But, of course, within the framework of the law, that is why you take into account the severity of the offence, the impact on the victim, the need to deter others – it is a whole set of framework. Within that, you also look at the offender and you make an assessment based on how cooperative he has been. You are sitting down, you are talking to him, you see whether he confessed or he tried to hide. What does his conduct show about him? It does not mean that the assessments will be perfect, but this are highly trained officers who do this every day; they make an assessment. That is then discussed with the AGC, who make the final decision, taking into account the legal framework and the overall set of factors.",1,137,2019-05-06-T-003-S-00137
2019-05-06-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, it is a careful process. I think it is not often that MHA or the Singapore Government is being accused on being soft on these sorts of issues. I think usually the complaints are the reverse; that not enough mercy is shown. We have made that an article of faith that we are tough. We are tough on crime, we are tough on the causes of crime and as a fact that we are putting up amendments to the Penal Code shows, there was never any intention and never any practice of being soft. I think we err on the side of being tough. At the same time, you look at the facts of each case and where it is possible to exercise discretion, you do it. That is done by the Police as well as by AGC.",2,138,2019-05-06-T-003-S-00138
2019-05-06-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The second point is that MHA gives consideration to the offenders, when, really, more concern and care should be given to the victims. I absolutely agree. The impact on the victims is very important. Not just for the victim but also to deter similar conduct and it will protect others. The reason why the crime rate in Singapore is so low, is because people generally understand a few things  one, if you commit an offence, it is likely that you will be caught; second, if you are caught, there is a very high likelihood that you will be charged, depending on the offence. If you are charged, there is a very high likelihood that you will be found guilty because the investigation will be thorough, the facts will be presented, there is a professional set of lawyers dealing with it and the Courts are staffed by highly trained lawyers. So, if the evidence is presented, properly assessed, then it is likely to result in a conviction. But, of course, if there is no evidence, or the evidence is weak, it will be thrown out. And in fact, AGC would often not even proceed on the basis that of there being no adequate evidence.",3,139,2019-05-06-T-003-S-00139
2019-05-06-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, this framework, I think, is well understood on the ground. Which is one of the reasons why the crime rate is low as well in Singapore. You cannot do something and get away with it, by and large. How is it balanced, what were the factors that are taken into account, I have said in specific cases in my answer. But I agree as a method of approach and principle, yes, of course, what has happened to the victim is extremely important and nothing I say detracts from that.",4,140,2019-05-06-T-003-S-00140
2019-05-06-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, we have to send a strong signal, what I meant like-for-like was this  you have a set of facts, a certain decision was taken to prosecute or to give a conditional warning. You then have another case, with a similar set of facts. I think fairness requires that, in both cases, the outcome is similar, so there is consistency. Consistency does not mean leniency, please do not mistake me. Consistency means you have decided to charge, then you will decide in a subsequent case to charge. If you have decided to give conditional warning and the factors are broadly similar, then you will tend towards giving a conditional warning. But, of course, you will look at whether there are any other factors. So, it is more that there has got to be a certain consistency in the way the law is apply and is processed, not just in the Courts. Of course, we can look at the precedence for consistency, but also from the perspective of the Police and AGC. That is what I meant.",5,141,2019-05-06-T-003-S-00141

Problem gambling, regardless of your background or your income level, should still be combated, which is why I continue to make to make the call to do do away with the annual entry fee. Because if we acknowledge that problem gambling plagues people from all backgrounds, then having a higher disposable income should not be a criterion to keep entry permit on an annualised basis.",1,147,2019-05-06-T-004-S-00147

The gaming revenue makes it commercially viable for them to offer the non-gaming facilities, as one integrated package.",1,174,2019-05-06-T-007-S-00174
2019-05-06-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The two IRs have not decided to activate their additional gaming options. If both IRs exercise their options for additional gaming area in full, gaming area as a proportion of total floor area will drop from 3% today to 2.3%, as the expansion of the non-gaming area is much larger. The IRs have also stated that the additional gaming provisions will be targeted at higher tier, non-mass market players, who are mostly tourists.",2,175,2019-05-06-T-007-S-00175
2019-05-06-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Based on the Gambling Participation Survey conducted by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), the probable problem and pathological gambling rate of Singapore residents has decreased from 2.6% in 2011 to 0.9% in 2017. This includes all forms of gambling such as casino, horse racing and online gambling.",3,176,2019-05-06-T-007-S-00176

2019-05-06-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the S$9 billion investment by the two IRs will introduce additional world class attractions and experiences for both tourists and locals. These are expected to attract an additional 500,000 international visitors each year and contribute S$500 million annually to Singapore’s economy. The investments will also create up to 5,000 new jobs directly and increase business opportunities for Singapore companies.",5,178,2019-05-06-T-007-S-00178

As the Minister for Finance had explained at Budget 2018 and Budget 2019, Singapore's healthcare spending will rise with an ageing population and advances in medical treatment, drugs and technologies. We need to be well-prepared for this, by building additional healthcare capacity and ensuring that we have sufficient financial resources to fund the higher healthcare spending in a sustainable manner.",9,182,2019-05-06-T-007-S-00182

Our revenue base is diverse and resilient, including taxes on personal and corporate income, consumption and property.

2019-05-06-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I thank the Member for his supplementary question. The IR business model, as I explained in my answer, means it is an integrated package. You need the gaming activities to come together with the non-gaming activities so that it is commercially viable for the operators. Currently, more than two-thirds of their total revenue comes from gaming. So, for the new facilities, the theme parks, the 15,000-seater arena, these are expensive facilities which without the gaming provisions, the additional gaming provisions as options for the operators, they may not find it commercially viable to make these additional investments to create these additional jobs. This was actually explained by the CEO of MBS and I quote him, he said, ""The casino revenue generation is very important because it pays for things that sometimes lose money, sometimes have a very low return, or that are just very expensive.""",1,186,2019-05-06-T-007-S-00186

And when we discussed with them, they told us that they understood why we had to do this in a package. They welcomed the additional social safeguards that the Government will be introducing and, more importantly, I think there was a commitment that we should continue to work together hand-in-hand to help tackle the problem of gambling, including online gambling, new types of risks facing Singaporeans.

2019-05-06-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I think I have explained in my answer earlier. They understood why we had to do this as a package. They noted that the rate of problem gambling has been coming down but, as Minister Desmond Lee explained, just because the rate has come down does not mean that we, therefore, become complacent, we continue to take a serious view on how we can tackle this problem together. So, the community partners, the religious groups, the voluntary welfare groups said that they welcome the additional social safeguards – the increase in the levy, the additional safeguards.

2019-05-06-T-007,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I have answered the question actually. Land cost will be determined by the Chief Valuer based on the market value. This is again a long-standing practice. The IRs will pay the fair market value as determined by the Chief Valuer. The second part of the question  of course, we made some projections in terms of with the increase in the number of visitors, tourists, what is the additional value-add to Singapore's economy. I mentioned the number $500 million annually. But the exact number depends also on the on the global economy, depends on how well we grow our tourism sector because, mind you, the IRs are not the only thing we are going to develop to grow our tourism sector. We also have Mandai. We also have the Greater Southern Waterfront. We are going to rejuvenate Orchard Road.

It is sad but undeniable that the direct causes determined by the COI that resulted in the death of CFC(NS) Pang were preventable had there been compliance to safety rules. It was not for lack of knowledge of these rules or inexperience of personnel working on the SSPH gun. The COI determined that prior to the incident, all the three personnel in the gun – CFC(NS) Pang, the GC and the ME-Tech – had received adequate training to be aware that whenever the gun barrel is moved, they must be in a safe position. It was clear to the ME-Tech that CFC(NS) Pang was not in a safe position. Notwithstanding this, the ME-Tech merely told CFC(NS) Pang to move closer to him or move away, instead of stopping the gun movement. When CFC(NS) Pang replied that the gun barrel would not hit him and did not move away from where he was, the ME-Tech could have ensured that CFC(NS) Pang moved away to a safe position or pressed the E-stop button.",28,235,2019-05-06-T-008-S-00235

At the same time, he saw that CFC(NS) Pang was not standing in a designated safe position. Instead of ensuring that CFC(NS) Pang was in a safe position before lowering the gun barrel, he thought that there was sufficient time for CFC(NS) Pang to move away as the gun barrel was lowered. If the GC had ensured that CFC(NS) Pang was in a safe position before activating the gun barrel to standby position, the incident would not have happened.",29,236,2019-05-06-T-008-S-00236

He was also professional when executing his tasks. CFC(NS) Pang started his Full-time National Service in October 2008. He had attended several courses and training during his Full-Time National Service, graduating with an overall ""A"" grade from the Armament Basic Technician Training (Turret). He had also attended the Maintenance Vocational Training on his sixth ICT in February 2018 in preparation for Exercise Thunder Warrior.

The Army safety culture should be enhanced and special emphasis should also be placed on the safety culture of the NSmen who must be equally cognisant of all safety regulations and procedures. The SAF could involve NS commanders in the review of the Training Safety Regulations (TSRs) as this will instil greater ownership by NSmen in terms of safety.

It pertains to the first handout, the summary of COI's findings on chronology of events, specifically item (6) where the ME-Tech informed CFC(NS) Pang in a mixture of Mandarin and English that the gun barrel was going to be moved to the ""standby"" position.

2019-05-06-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question is more general. Looking forward, and I think for servicemen who are born in Singapore, we probably understand a little bit of Mandarin and Malay, if you are an Indian, but for certain servicemen who could be new citizens, language could be an issue. Going forward, how does SAF intend to resolve issues that could crop up where in a situation of extreme panic, language potentially could be a cause for an accident?",3,273,2019-05-06-T-008-S-00273

As I have said, the COI made explicit reference that they knew the safety rules, ex ante, before they went to do maintenance and while they were doing maintenance; and while the gun barrel was moved. All three were clear that no one should stand in the path of the gun barrel.

2019-05-06-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, those indeed are the questions that as a system, and as commanders, we are dealing with. That is why we started the Inspector-General's Office. I spent a few years as Minister for Manpower. I set up the Workplace Safety Council during my tenure as Minister and visited a number of safety systems. This was following, if you remember, the two incidents – Fusionpolis and Nicoll Highway. For these two incidents, we undertook a safety review, as Mr Nair has said, of the systems, we went to visit a number of other countries which have better safety records. Professionally, all the safety officers or those who have been involved with these, will tell you it boils down to culture. It is just not the articulation of rules. It is how you internalise every act to the point that you take that extra effort. You can tell people that you have to put on seat belts; you can tell people you should not use your handphone while you are driving. There is no rule that says that you should not look at your handphone while crossing the road. But you see people doing it.",1,279,2019-05-06-T-008-S-00279

And you have to do it in a systematic way to tighten, first of all, is it lack of knowledge or is it unclear rules or rules that are difficult to follow. If we find any of these, then you amend them. But ultimately, I think where we have reached is that you have to take care of yourself and your buddy; and you have to internalise this. And we found, in fact, a gap, that while we are paying a lot of attention to live firing exercises, one would think that in maintenance, you do not have high risk.

This is what the SAF, the Army, the Artillery and the Inspector-General's Office (IGO)	asked themselves. Is this indicative of a systemic lapse? Is this prevalent? If you have an isolated incident here and there, you can fix it. And I think the sense is, and this is not widespread because this is a first such incident. When this happened, I asked how many accidents have there occurred before, major injuries. This is the first for 15 years of operation. And I think this my surmising – this is nothing to do with the COI; the COI did not say this. I think NSmen or crew operators can understand when the gun is being fired and at great speeds; and if it hits you, serious injuries, so you better pay attention to the rules. But you underestimate, even at maintenance, that how can this happen. So, that just drives home the point that you have to observe safety rules that rigorously. We must not make safety rules so onerous that you cannot comply. But in this instance, it just meant a few seconds of waiting before the gun was lowered – and we measured it. I think it does not take more than 10 seconds – for the gun to be lowered, to be parked, as the safety manual say, to begin your work.",2,285,2019-05-06-T-008-S-00285

If you build enough automatic stop systems, when we have to push the button and go, we have to push many buttons to start deactivating things that we have put into place. Can you do it for the training equipment? Yes. And you would remember that when we spoke about the Bionix incident, that indeed is what we have done. We have got buttons that somebody can stop. And we have only done it for training equipment.",1,288,2019-05-06-T-008-S-00288

2019-05-06-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. I have one clarification for the Minister for Defence. Earlier in his speech, he mentioned that the New Zealand Attorney-General exercised his discretion and declined to investigate the incident. However, we know from other instances, for example, Gavin Chan's death in Australia, that the Queensland authorities did actually investigate and there was a Coroner's Inquiry held there. So, I would like to ask the Minister  did the New Zealand AG indicate any reason why he declined to do so? Going forward, should such an unfortunate incident happen in other countries, would we or would we not expect the foreign government to investigate?",1,291,2019-05-06-T-008-S-00291
2019-05-06-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, we do not have any information why the AG did not exercise his authority to commence an inquiry into the death. He could have. Be mindful that we are training in some other country and we are subject to their jurisdiction and we have to respect their laws. Different laws apply differently to different countries. In Australia's situation, I am not sure that he had the discretion to not investigate.",1,292,2019-05-06-T-008-S-00292
2019-05-06-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, in this case, the AG decided that they would not and, therefore, we started the COI. That was not to mean that even if they did investigate, we will not have a COI. But it was now, in the Australian case, as you said, Gavin Chan's case, there were two sets of investigations – theirs and our COI.",2,293,2019-05-06-T-008-S-00293

The Merdeka Generation Package applies to Singapore citizens born between 1 January 1950 and 31 December 1959.

The Bill will expand the definition of rape to include penile penetration of the anus and mouth. Currently, the offence of rape covers only penile penetration of the vagina. We take the view that the label of ""rape"" is appropriate for non-consensual acts involving penile penetration of the anus and mouth. This reflects the high degree of violation and the physical and health risks involved. With this Bill, both men and women can be victims of rape. Clause 110 gives effect to this.",5,323,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00323

Clause 121 sets out three misconceptions of fact that would vitiate consent  sexual nature of the act; sexual purpose of the act; and identity of the perpetrator doing the act. We decided not have a positive statutory definition of consent. Section 90 of the Penal Code currently sets out the situations where consent is negated.

This view was shared by the PCRC and many others during the public consultation process. There were some concerns that the decriminalisation of attempted suicide would reduce the deterrent effect, and cause an increased number of suicides. However, bear in mind that persons who attempt suicide typically are so distressed that the deterrent effect of criminalisation is very low. The present situation is that hardly anyone is prosecuted and punished for this offence in the first place.",12,330,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00330

I assure you that this is not the case. Every effort will still be made to prevent suicides. The Bill amends other laws to ensure that the Police will still be able to intervene in suicide situations.

Where the abetment of attempted suicide is of a minor or a person who lacks mental capacity, higher maximum punishments will apply – 15 years' imprisonment. If hurt is caused to the minor or the person who lacks mental capacity in the course of the abetment, the maximum punishment is imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years.

First, it will continue to be the case that ignorance of law and mistake of law will not be a defence.

Children below 10 years old, and those between 10 and 12 years old who are not mature enough to understand the nature and consequences of their conduct, will not be convicted.",24,342,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00342

It would be very difficult to show that the victims relied upon the fraudulent representations of the bank employees who manipulated LIBOR. Calculations for LIBOR are complicated, and may not be understood by these victims. Yet, the LIBOR-fixing scandal is egregious, with far-reaching consequences on financial markets and products. We must be able to take action against such dishonest behaviour.",2,347,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00347

For such cases, prevention is better than cure.

We have made some amendments to the sentencing framework to ensure that the sentences prescribed are proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Members of this House will be familiar with mandatory minimum sentences (MMS). MMS refers to a sentence where the law mandates that a judge must impose a minimum jail term or another sentence such as caning for a particular offence.",8,353,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00353

We recognise that society has become safer, less violent, and more mature. It is therefore timely to review all the offences which attract MMS today. We have decided to retain MMS for offences in the Penal Code, Misuse of Drugs Act and illegal moneylending offences. MMS will also be retained for offences which attract a mandatory sentence of caning. These offences are serious, and generally involve elements of physical confrontation and violence.",9,354,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00354

2019-05-06-T-011,,,"Currently, courts can already exercise judicial mercy in very rare cases where humanitarian considerations arise. This gives us an idea of the degree of exceptionality that is required. The introduction of presumptive minimum sentences is not a softening of the Government's stance against such crimes.

The Senior Parliamentary Secretary has given the Government's view on some of the key proposed amendments. I intend to set out the Government’s position on two major areas of the law which we are amending. One, better protection of vulnerable victims; and second, dealing with sexual offences. We are setting out new offences and enhancing penalties where minors are involved. Some additional conduct of a sexual nature will be specifically criminalised.",1,360,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00360

PAVE is a VWO which works closely with a variety of other agencies, including the Government. They told me about this case, which was one of the reasons why I decided we ought to change the law here. They helped a lady by the name of Cindy. Cindy had suffered horrific abuse from her live-in partner. She was found by the Police in the year 2000, almost completely blind, with slash wounds all over her body and with broken bones. She had suffered horrific abuse over the eight years.

Of course, there is the underlying psychological problem, that if the woman does not want to leave and continues to suffer the abuse, then our agencies or the VWOs will have to try to find a way of identifying these woman – usually women – and then, encourage them to take the steps.",12,371,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00371

New offences are being introduced, where there is serious abuse of vulnerable victims. I remind Members of another case, Daniel Nasser, two years old. He was abused by his mother and her live-in boyfriend over a period of at least five weeks. They kicked and slapped him almost every day. They stomped on his chest.

The reason is that it is difficult to show that they had the requisite mens rea, that is, the mental elements that were present to meet the requirements for the conviction for murder. I think we have to take a strong stance against such abuse. I refer to clauses 83, 104 and 171.",14,373,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00373

2019-05-06-T-011,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The United Kingdom and Australia have similar offences.

He was living with his father and his father’s female partner. The boy suffered 21 different injuries within 48 hours before his death, including a fatal fracture to the left femur. It occurred within 12 hours prior to his death. It was established that only the father and his partner were present during the period when the fatal injury was inflicted. The father had been absent for around two hours. Both defendants were charged for murder and both claimed they did not to know how the injuries were sustained. In Singapore, under our proposed amendments, the father and partner both can be charged for causing or allowing a young child's death. So, you can look at clauses 83, 104 and 171.",19,378,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00378

For example, a husband violently abuses his wife and his children. The concern is that the abused wife may herself be found liable under this offence if she did not intervene to prevent her husband from abusing the children. This is even though she may not have really been in a position to intervene. That should not be the case. The clauses in the Bill require the court to consider past or present experiences of those of the accused persons of abuse as well. The Court needs to determine the steps the accused person could have been reasonably expected to have taken to prevent the abuse of the vulnerable victim.",20,379,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00379

In some countries, cases have emerged of men agreeing to use a condom but secretly removing it before or during sex. It is known as ""stealthing"". In these cases, the quality of the consent provided by the victim would be compromised by the deception. We have identified, and also if men, usually men, mislead their partner on their sexually transmitted diseases, that is also covered. We have identified these two types of deception because they carry serious risks to the victim and represent a greater violation of the victims’ sexual autonomy. You can refer to clause 119.

They will help ensure that Singapore continues to be a safe home for our people, particularly women, children, and vulnerable persons.",77,436,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00436
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, this Bill has the monumental task of reforming Singapore’s criminal law. It is the result of an immense effort by the many stakeholders – MinLaw, MHA, the AGC, Law Society, the Criminal Bar and members of public who have provided the valuable feedback. The product is a formidable piece of legislation.",1,437,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00437
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, today, I would like to discuss six broad themes underlying the amendments and the discussions leading up to the presentation of this Bill in Parliament.",2,438,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00438
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The first theme is the protection of victims in vulnerable positions. In particular, vulnerable victims who are unable to defend themselves, victims of abuse within a marriage and minors who have been victimised by abusive or lewd acts.",3,439,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00439
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),Clause 83 introduces offences which improve the law's capability to address situations where sustained abuse and neglect results in the unfortunate death of a vulnerable victim. Some of us remember the case of Annie Ee. Annie was a 26-year-old waitress with intellectual disabilities. She was physically and psychologically abused by her flatmates for eight months until she died with severe injuries. This law will ensure the perpetrators in a case like Annie Ee's will be dealt with accurately and effectively – matching culpability with an appropriate sentence.,4,440,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00440
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Another case. In 2015, the case of Joshua Robinson surfaced. He was found to have in his possession 5,902 obscene films, 321 of them containing child pornography, featuring children as young as two years old. Robinson had even shown a six-year-old girl an obscene video while her father was training at a gym. Many Singaporeans raised concerns that the sentence of four years' imprisonment was inadequate. Clause 117 of the Bill addresses that. That clause introduces the offence of sexual activity or image in the presence of a minor below 16 years of age. This is relevant to the proposed section 376ED – it should be supported.",5,441,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00441
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"During the debate on the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill in 2007, Ms Ellen Lee raised the point that the exceptions to marital rape immunity are inadequate to address serious abuse in marriage. In particular, Ms Lee cited the case of PP against N where the marital relationship was already highly strained and the husband forcefully dragged her back to their matrimonial home, tied her hands, gagged her and ""raped"" her.",6,442,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00442
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),The changes to section 375(4) in clause 110(b) address that and puts into clear focus the victim’s interest. This is a bold move and should be supported. I am also glad that Ms Lee’s conscientious voice in 2007 has made an impact in the changes we are discussing today.,7,443,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00443
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Many countries talk about the rights of the accused. Yes, that is important, but a good justice system is also victim-focused.",8,444,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00444
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, onto another topic within the first theme. Singapore-hosted webpages saw an exponential increase in child pornography content. In 2015, there were 10. But in 2016, there were 211. In the first 10 months of 2017, this number almost doubled to 412. The amendments to this Bill improve our law’s capability to deter such lewd content and punish the purveyors of it. We must protect our children. They are innocent and must be shielded from depraved and corrupt humans who seek offensive pleasure from such lewd acts. Hence, the proposed sections 377BG to 377BK, which punish purveyors of child pornography or child abuse content are important and timely.",9,445,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00445
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, I move on to the second theme, that is, to ensure culpability even where the criminal acts are committed overseas. One key way is to tackle crimes committed through the Internet. The proposed section 4B(1)(c) does so by specifying that certain offences committed outside Singapore but which affect Singapore are punishable as though the act had been carried out in Singapore. This is especially useful for financial crimes which can be committed remotely, with no respect for territorial boundaries. This ensures that the arm of Singapore's law can reach overseas actors who create harm in Singapore. This is key for a highly connected hub such as Singapore. It is an amendment that is needed and welcomed.",10,446,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00446
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, I move on to the third theme. The new presumptive minimum sentence is another important feature of this Bill. The proposed section 303A of the Criminal Procedure Code in clause 169 introduces more flexibility in sentencing by allowing the court to impose a sentence less than the presumptive minimum sentence if exceptional circumstances made it unjust to impose a first-time offender with the presumptive minimum sentence.",11,447,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00447
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"At this stage, I should declare that I am a lawyer in private practice and sometimes act as Defence Counsel in criminal cases. From my experience, it is good to give our Judges the discretion to impose accurate sentences. This may involve, at times, lighter sentences where there are strong mitigating factors which put the offenders’ acts in perspective. Allowing a judge to mete out a lower sentence – even lower than the presumptive minimum – could prove very useful where an offender is quite clearly on the lower spectrum of the culpability scale. It makes for more accurate justice. However, I do have a clarification to ask.",12,448,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00448
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In the new subsection 4, it says that ""in any written law, unless the context requires otherwise, a reference to a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment shall include a reference to a presumptive minimum sentence."" Could the Minister elaborate on whether such a rationale applies to all existing regulatory and criminal laws or whether it is restricted to only the laws contained in the Penal Code? For example, how would subsection 4 apply to the Misuse of Drugs Act which already has a carefully calibrated deterrent-rehabilitation regime through the availability of the Drug Rehabilitation Centre at one extreme and the Long Term Imprisonments 1 and 2 options at the other extreme?",13,449,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00449
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In short, Sir, presumptive minimum sentences will have the advantage of creating some broad consistency in sentencing across courtrooms and across cases, but allows much needed flexibility where the merits of the case justify a lower sentence. Such flexibility allows for more accurate justice.",14,450,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00450
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, I move to my fourth theme. While it is good and necessary to carry out an extensive review of our criminal laws every 12 years or so, would MHA and MinLaw consider creating a set of legal tools which could deal with morphing criminal threats of the future? In a world where technology progresses so rapidly, the potential criminal activities and their modus operandi may be morphing so quickly that even though we have a robust new criminal law framework now, the law may still not be wide enough to address criminal methodologies of the future.",15,451,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00451
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, would MHA and MinLaw consider the suggestion to introduce a Schedule or the possibility for subsidiary legislation through which the Minister can respond quickly to the morphing criminal phenomenon without needing to come to Parliament. For example, in the Misuse of Drugs Act, the Minister does not need to come to Parliament to update the list of drugs, especially new psychoactive drugs. In this way, the law addressing the harms of drugs is flexible, versatile and able to respond quickly to the threat.",16,452,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00452
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"An example of what could be done for a Penal Code provision is by introducing a Schedule for section 409 of the Penal Code. It was held by the Singapore Court of Appeal in the 2018 case of Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung, Kong Hee & Others that the provision contained in section 409 on criminal breach of trust by an agent does not cover key officers of a charity and officers of a society.",17,453,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00453
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"If there was a mechanism for a readily amendable Schedule or subsidiary legislation, and the original offence in the primary legislation was broad enough and consistent with Parliament's intention to encompass such a situation, then rather than having to come to Parliament to amend the provision to plug loopholes, the Minister could expand on the limbs of an existing provision to tighten the law through a Schedule or subsidiary legislation. While this cannot apply retrospectively, it would be a quick and efficient way to plug loopholes for future cases. Could MHA and MinLaw consider this suggestion, please?",18,454,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00454
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"My fifth theme covers section 377A. Sir, I support the Government's decision to retain the provision.",19,455,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00455
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Since speaking on the topic in Parliament in 2007, I have followed the debate in other countries and studied the multiple legal challenges in various jurisdictions which seek to redefine marriage, gender, adoption rights, spousal rights and what is taught in schools. This has caused me to believe that retaining a provision such as section 377A, even if it is unenforced, continues to be a good approach for our country. The provision remains relevant and necessary. Sir, I am of the view that the environment the traditional family unit offers to children supports the state in creating the best environment for the upbringing of children. This environment should be protected. We should build it up and not tear it down. Therefore, my views expressed in 2007 have not changed.",20,456,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00456
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, my sixth theme covers section 309. Clause 89 repeals section 309 – the offence of attempted suicide. I have concerns regarding its repeal. Yes, attempted suicide is an issue which must be addressed with great sensitivity and the topic must be respected with all the attendant empathy it so clearly deserves. However, I have looked at the Ministry's arguments for repealing section 309 and I hold a different view. Section 309 should be retained. In a way, retaining it is the more compassionate approach because, in my view, preserving the provision will save more lives. Retention of the provision has a further advantage. It prevents euthanasia from making its way to our shores.",21,457,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00457
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, do I believe we should help members of our society who are contemplating suicide? Absolutely. Do I think we should enforce section 309 against people who attempt suicide? In most cases, no. But keeping the provision is still of immense value. Why? I humbly submit that there are six reasons.",22,458,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00458
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"First, because it sends a normative signal that taking one's life is not the answer to life's problems, to the extent that the law prohibits it.",23,459,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00459
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Second, the repeal of section 309 may send the signal that taking one's life is acceptable to broader society when, in my view, that is not society's thinking.",24,460,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00460
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Three, all the attendant treatment, support, care and counselling can be provided while still retaining the provision. Indeed, when this happens, society would benefit from the deterrent effect of the law. This means that the law would help deter some future suicides in society, while, at the same time, the people who need the counselling and care are able to receive it.",25,461,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00461
2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I cite the inspiring words of a courageous young lady who wrote a forum page letter in the Straits Times in February 2019. I quote her  ""As someone who overcame suicide and is now a passionate advocate for the sanctity of life, I am sad to see suicide being decriminalised in our nation. Suicide is truly a multi-faceted and complex issue, and the law should not be excluded from having a deterrent effect on people who see death as the only option in their difficult circumstances. I gave up the idea of further suicide attempts after Police officers gently reminded me that attempting suicide was an offence. There was no need for the authorities to restrain or prosecute me, for I was cooperative and clearly in distress. In recent years, I managed to persuade a young foreigner from killing herself just by informing her the offensive nature of suicide in our nation.

2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Fourth reason, I agree with the Ministry that the stigma against those suffering from mental health should be removed. Indeed, I have spoken up in Parliament about removing such a stigma and increasing community support for those suffering from mental illness in 2018 and in 2019. Such a stigma is not fair. We should not hold mental illness against the person who has it. But the removal of section 309 does not need to be part of that destigmatisation exercise. Why? Because there is a risk that the number of suicides will increase if there is no provision to deter the act. Broader society will have no legal deterrent and those attempting suicide may consider the absence of a prohibition as a licence to attempt the act. If that were to happen, society loses and we could see an increase in the number of suicides in future. I feel duty-bound to articulate that concern in this House.",29,465,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00465

Also, as the devices can be more easily concealed, there could be even more cases that go unreported than before.

While there has been an effort to educate the public on the dangers of recording images of oneself online in compromising positions, some, especially youths who are more tech savvy, may land themselves in these situations. While filming these images, they were expecting total privacy between the consenting parties. However, if things do go sour, these films could be distributed as part of revenge. While the victims are able to contact platforms to take the videos images down, there could be countless sites hosting these images. And it would require time for such action, during which the images could have been seen by a great number of people. Also, if it falls into the dark web, it could potentially be there forever. Hence, we need a greater deterrence for this too, as the distress and hurt caused to the victim would be much greater than in the past.",6,477,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00477

2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, approach towards causing hurt. For the past decades, the offence of voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code has been a non-arrestable offence, meaning that the police are ordinarily not able to arrest the suspect without a court warrant. In addition, being a non-arrestable offence, the typical advice given to VCH victims is that the police will not investigate the matter unless the victim goes to court to obtain a Magistrate’s order to direct the police to investigate, or the victim can pursue a private summons against the perpetrator. Pursuing a private summons will require the victim to spend time, effort and costs without police assistance.",9,488,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00488
2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"VCH is a common offence that occurs daily. When I last filed a Parliamentary Question in 2014 on the incidence of VCH, it was revealed that the cases reported to police amounted to about 10,000 cases a year. This is a large number compared to other reported offences. In fact, the total crimes recorded last year was about 33,000 which, I believe, excludes the 10,000 VCH reports. The figure of 10,000 cases is also likely to be an under-estimate, as many cases go unreported. Of the 10,000 reported cases, only about 600 resulted in criminal charges being filed, a rate of about 6%.",10,489,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00489
2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The PCRC is right to note that some past scenarios of VCH can, in fact, be quite serious. In some cases, the injuries may be permanent; there may be elements of bullying or of being outnumbered by a few assailants. Accordingly, I am supportive of the introduction of section 323A to create a new offence of causing grievous hurt even though only hurt was intended. This will now be an arrestable offence attracting higher punishment of up to five years' jail, which the police will be empowered to investigate without a Magistrate’s order.",11,490,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00490
2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"At the same time, the Committee rightly pointed out that some victims may sustain injuries which are serious and yet do not fall within the definition of grievous hurt, for example, multiple injuries caused in a prolonged attack. The Bill’s response to this is to raise the maximum imprisonment for VCH itself from two years to three years, but to continue to keep it as a non-arrestable offence. It was stated in the PCRC Report that the need for a Magistrate’s complaint would ensure that only meritorious cases were investigated by police. The Report further emphasised that the police did itself take the initiative to investigate and prosecute in the “egregious” cases.",12,491,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00491
2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I have some queries about this approach. First, I noted earlier that only 6% of VCH reports resulted in criminal charges being filed. What kinds of scenarios have resulted in the police initiating investigations and prosecutions without a Magistrate’s complaint being filed? How are VCH cases currently triaged for action or non-action? Secondly, of the balance 94% of cases reported where no charges were filed, what is the police assessment of the purpose of the victims when they reported the cases to police? Is there a mismatch of expectations? For example, did most victims expect the police to take some action? From time to time, VCH victims express surprise and disappointment that the police are not taking up their complaints. Thirdly, does the Ministry not acknowledge that relying on victims to file a Magistrate’s complaint requires victims to have the resources and a certain fortitude to navigate the legal system on their own? It is probable that this requirement to see a Magistrate may not necessarily flag out the most meritorious cases, but cases with the most determined victims.",13,492,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00492
2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, I am mindful of the workload of the police and I am not asking for all VCH cases to be made arrestable. The changes proposed in the Bill to create the new section 323A and to increase the maximum punishment for section 323 are improvements and will facilitate more robust responses to the more serious VCH cases. Nevertheless, I think the situation needs further clarification and further monitoring to ensure that members of the public get justice for hurt offences.",14,493,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00493
2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, vulnerable victims. In this Bill, there are particular groups of victims deemed as vulnerable and in need of extra protection. These groups are  children under 14 years of age, domestic workers, vulnerable adults and victims in intimate or close relationships. Such extra protection is found in the amendments to the Penal Code at sections 73 and 74A, and the new sections 74B to E. These sections prescribe that where a victim belongs to one of these vulnerable groups, the offender could be sentenced to twice the maximum punishment applicable to the offence. However, this potential exposure to twice the maximum punishment is subject to a caveat  that if the offender can prove that the victim was capable of protecting herself or himself in the same way as an ordinary person, then the exposure to double punishment would not apply. I am concerned about what this caveat means and how it would potentially undermine the extra protection that was intended. To be more explicit  in what way could it be shown that a domestic worker, a dementia patient or a child under 14 was capable of protecting themselves as any ordinary person? Clarification on this point would be most instructive.",15,494,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00494
2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, while the Penal Code may be amended to enhance punishments, it would be far better if the provisions were not invoked but, instead, achieve the goal of general deterrence, that is, to prevent incidents from happening in the first place. In this regard, what plans does the Government have to publicise these changes, either to the general public, or in a targeted manner?",16,495,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00495
2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, I have a query on minors between 16 but under 18 years old. This Bill introduces new offences to protect those above 16 but below 18 years, if the accused was in a relationship with the victim that is defined as, I quote, an “exploitative relationship” under the new section 377CA. This is an important signal to parents, step-parents, guardians and other persons who are able to exercise some control or influence over the minor not to take advantage of young persons below 18. Protecting minors under 18 is consistent with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which Singapore has signed and ratified.",17,496,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00496
2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In this connection, I would like to clarify the amendments being proposed to the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA). Under clause 171 of the Bill, enhancements are being made to protect children and young persons from being ill-treated and from being sexually exploited. Under the current CYPA, the definition of “young person” has a cut-off of 16 years, but the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has announced that it will raise the cut-off age for protection of young persons from 16 years to 18 years. MSF recently conducted a public consultation and intends to table the change later this year. Can MHA clarify whether the changes it is making to the CYPA under this Bill will be brought into effect at the same time that the definition of “young person” is raised to 18 by MSF?",18,497,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00497

I do not know whether I heard him correctly and he may correct me if I am wrong. But I understood him to be suggesting that certain tools be given to the Government to react quickly to emerging crime trends and one of the examples he gave was that, for example, CBT, as an agent, the Minister should be enabled to gazette new categories of relationships that would come within section 409. I am not sure whether I heard him correctly, perhaps he could clarify that.",19,498,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00498
2019-05-06-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, I feel that this suggestion, if it is correct, is quite dangerous as I do not think it is proper for the Government to be given the power to enact new criminal sections without coming to Parliament. In fact, in the City Harvest case, the Court of Appeal made quite clear that there is need for reform but that should be left to Parliament. So, I hope he is not suggesting that Parliament relinquish its responsibility and delegate to the Minister such vast powers to create new criminal conduct.",20,499,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00499

2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"Yes. I thank Ms Lim for the clarification. Actually, if Ms Lim had listened to my speech carefully, I had actually used the Misuse of Drugs Act as an example of a situation where, if there are new threats, that is, new drugs in the forms of, for example, new psychoactive substances that have hitherto not been deemed as illicit under the Misuse of Drugs Act, then to include that in the Schedule and to say that thereafter the consumption of those types of drugs would be illicit would make for a much more flexible regime. So, I am suggesting that if there are broad categories of provisions – I used CBT as an example, CBT is actually 406 but it can be read with 409 – if you look at that, the broad context of it, is it sufficiently broad as a primary legislation to encompass different permutations in subsidiary legislation? And I never asked for it to act retrospectively. So, I am looking at possibilities to make the system deter future activities through a more flexible use of legal tools. That was my point.",1,502,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00502

That would be against the Constitution in the first place. But what I am expressing concern about is that I do not know whether he is suggesting that the Minister be given powers, even prospectively to gazette new offences, new categories of offences that would come within certain sections. I mean, is he saying that MHA is too cautious to have this Bill to spell out certain categories and the Minister should be allowed to gazette new categories as and when he thinks it is necessary?",1,504,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00504

2019-05-06-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"Actually, that is not what I am suggesting. I am suggesting a situation where, if you look at other threats that we are facing and one threat is drugs, that the threats morph, that the threats can change in future and, if we have a Schedule, as we do in the Misuse of Drugs Act or classification of drugs that makes a certain type of drug which has yet been concocted and has harm as being illicit to consume, then I think that is a valuable example or a valuable way of looking at whether we can develop our own criminal law in the form of the Penal Code to explore such an avenue. I am not advocating a free rein of the Minister to make, willy-nilly, new offences without coming to Parliament. That was not what I said in my speech.",1,506,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00506

I wish to commend the Government on its acceptance of the Penal Code Review Committee's recommendations relating to the extension of enhanced penalties for offences committed against the vulnerable amongst us, namely, domestic helpers, vulnerable persons, persons below 14 years of age, victims in intimate relationships and victims in close relationships. The purpose of these sections is clearly to recognise the systemic vulnerability of certain victims and, therefore, the need for commensurate enhanced punishment.",3,529,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00529

This sub-section renders the section setting out enhanced punishments inapplicable where the accused person is able to prove that his/her relationship with the victim did not adversely affect the victim's ability to protect themselves from harm. Similar wordings appear in the proposed sub-sections 74A(2A), 74B(3), 74C(3) and 74D(3) found in clause 18 of the Bill",4,530,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00530

There are sadly enough cases of domestic worker abuse. One employer was charged last year for having punched her domestic worker so much over the course of a two-year period such that the latter had become blind in her left eye in addition to suffering from an injured right eye. It is not difficult to imagine a similarly abusive employer, in an attempt to avoid being sentenced with enhanced punishments, citing the exception provided in the proposed sub-section 73(2) and claiming that the mere fact of employment did not adversely affect the domestic helper's ability to raise her arm to stop the punching.",5,531,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00531

It is suggested that the perpetrator be compelled by law to disclose the source from which access to the images or recordings was gained.

2019-05-06-T-011,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Whilst it is agreed that a tough stance ought to be adopted in the punishment of perpetrators in order that minors below 14 years of age could be protected, it must be noted that punishment alone would not deter or reduce such crimes. Education of minors is essential to enable them to recognise criminal acts against them and just as essential is that the minors must know where they can go to immediately for help and support.",14,571,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00571
2019-05-06-T-011,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Hence, a robust support system must be established and it is suggested that our schools step up their support system as teachers and school counsellors are usually who the minor will go to for help.",15,572,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00572

2019-05-06-T-011,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"In addition, a support system for perpetrators after their release from prison would help to prevent re-offending. Serial offenders could be monitored either by regulators or their counsellors for a period assessed by their counsellors to be necessary and for a holistic approach towards rehabilitating such perpetrators, mandatory regular reporting to their counsellors could be directed.",17,574,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00574

2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome the extensive revisions in the Criminal Law Reform Bill. The careful consultation process that led to this Bill started with the formation of the Penal Code Review Committee in July 2016 and culminated in extensive public engagements after publication of the PCRC Report in September 2018. This should be a model that any complex, far-reaching legislation should follow.",1,586,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00586
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I will speak on the relationship between the law and society. Sir, this Bill is necessary because social standards change over time and yet the law evolves only when statutes are changed or when precedent is set. We no longer believe today that marriage implies the automatic consent of a spouse to sexual relations. It is right that this Bill repeals the marital rape immunity. But the law may also shape society. If laws are not properly limited and implemented, the law may have significant unintended and adverse effects on social behaviour. Less recognised is the fact that social standards also give the law effect. Without a shared consensus around the justness of the law, victims will hesitate to seek justice and offenders will be emboldened.",2,587,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00587
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"My concern on the unintended adverse effects of the law relates to this Bill's enhanced protection for vulnerable persons. This Bill enhances criminal law around offences against vulnerable persons, in line with recent reforms, such as the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018. This is important because in our ageing society, the number of vulnerable elderly will increase significantly in the coming years. It is right that the Bill expands protection for such vulnerable adults by making it clear, in the new section 304B of the Penal Code, that neglect and abuse leading to the death of a vulnerable adult are serious offences. Section 304C further provides that persons in the same household have a duty of care to stop such neglect or abuse. Sections 335A and 335B make similar provisions for abuse and acts that endanger life or personal safety. In last year’s debate on the Vulnerable Adults Act, many Members spoke on how vulnerable adults need the protection of the law. I will not reiterate those arguments.",3,588,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00588
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"What I want to clarify is how these increased protections in criminal law will sit with the rights of the vulnerable elderly to choose how to live out their days in the manner they consider the best. In the book ""Being Mortal"", American surgeon Atul Gawande reflects on the excessive focus that modern medicine places on prolonging life rather than on ensuring a high quality of life.",4,589,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00589
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Medical interventions towards the end of life often cause great harm to the dignity or autonomy of patients. The patient must trade the comforts of home for endless nights and days in the intensive care unit. The patient must endure becoming dependent on others for every little aspect of daily living. The additional days or even weeks of life in this state are not always considered worthwhile. Given these trade-offs, many among the elderly, when faced with a medical emergency or a serious illness, may wish to avoid treatment. They will expect their families to interpret and act on their wishes.",5,590,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00590
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I want to be clear I am not discussing euthanasia. While I agree with this Bill's proposal to decriminalise attempted suicide, I think society is rightfully more cautious on the matter of abetting suicide, which is what euthanasia is in practice. These are still very serious offences under the Penal Code.",6,591,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00591
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"But there are a wide range of practices at the end of life which are not euthanasia in the ordinary sense. Some practices are widely accepted, such as choosing to refuse resuscitation or artificial life support. These are codified in the Advance Medical Directive Act. Others are more controversial, such as refusing nutrition, medication, or medical advice and treatment.",7,592,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00592
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Consider some examples of decisions made by persons near the end of life. End-stage renal failure patients may choose to stop dialysis. Patients with cancers and other diseases addressable through medical interventions often refuse treatment. The elderly may wish stay at home, instead of going to the hospital when their health deteriorates significantly. Former US President George H W Bush, at the end of his life, informed his staff he did not want to return to hospital and, as a result, he passed on peacefully at home.",8,593,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00593
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, which practices may be caught under the law as neglect by the family leading to death of the vulnerable adult? What makes an otherwise accepted practice neglectful, given that there will be concerns about the mental capacity of vulnerable adults and their physical inability to seek treatment without the support of their family? Which practices do we want to proscribe in the law?",9,594,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00594
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, the law is like Chekov's gun. If the law is written in the first chapter, then we can expect it will be used in the next. Consider some concrete examples. Family members may disagree on the appropriate medical intervention for a gravely ill vulnerable adult and, if they cannot prevail in a discussion, they may consider involving the law. A gravely ill vulnerable adult may lose autonomy in their decision to stop treatment, because the family is both concerned the adult lacks mental competence and the family fears breaking the law. A healthcare or social work professional may refer a case to the police because they believe the vulnerable adult or the family is refusing treatment so as to constitute neglect.",10,595,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00595
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"There may be cases where the family does fail in its duty of care. Yet, we do not want cases to be referred unnecessarily to the law. The Terry Schiavo case in the United States created a protracted legal battle over the so-called right to die. Mrs Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state and her husband, who was her legal guardian, argued she would have wanted withdrawal of artificial life support. Her parents disagreed. The case was exploited for political purposes and resulted in a 15-year legal battle.",11,596,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00596

2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"This House has expressed grave concerns about the growing practice of defensive medicine. Given that aggressive medical intervention in the last stage of life is often futile, costly and harmful to the dignity and autonomy of the patient, we would not want such interventions to become routine simply because of legal precedent, or fears by medical professionals and family members about their potential legal liability.",13,598,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00598
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"So, I ask the Government to provide clarity. What is expected of the medical treatment of a vulnerable elderly adult near the end of life in the home environment? To what extent can, or should, the wishes of the vulnerable adult be respected with regards to medical treatment and other acts that affect life? For example, is it neglectful if the family does not convey a gravely ill vulnerable adult to hospital, because of their expressed desire to pass on at home? What if the vulnerable adult wishes to stop routine medical medication and consultation? How can families assure themselves that their actions are lawful and in furtherance of the vulnerable adult’s wishes to live a good life until the end?",14,599,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00599
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I note that the Minister for Social and Family Development touched on these issues in the debate on the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018, which also enhanced penalties for offences against vulnerable adults. This Bill, however, proposes specific sections of the Penal Code which may affect the autonomy of vulnerable adults and their families in making end of life decisions and so, should be addressed separately today.",15,600,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00600
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Next, my concern on the social standards that give the law effect are centered on this Bill’s expanded protection from sexual offences. These revisions, include removal of the limited marital immunity defense for rape in section 375 of the Penal Code and substantive new provisions in sections 376 and 377 on consent, voyeurism, sexual exposure and child abuse. This is progressive and important.",16,601,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00601
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"But I fear that enhancing these provisions against sexual offences may be meaningless if we are ultimately hypocrites as a society and we do nothing about the social norms that tolerate such behaviour. The experience of many countries in recent years with the #MeToo movement is instructive. In many countries there are already strict laws against sexual offences and sexual harassment. Yet despite decades of actively enforced law, we had the #MeToo movement – a grassroots movement by women fighting against sexual harassment as a daily fact of life that women felt they had to accept in order to progress in their chosen careers. The law, in short, was not an effective recourse for many women around the world. Nor did the law restrain the behaviour of many men.",17,602,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00602
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"These issues are also present in Singapore. Ms Monica Baey has bravely highlighted her own experience as a victim of voyeurism, which has shown inadequacies in how her institution handles sexual misconduct cases. After she came forward, other women reported similar experiences. As Ms Baey posted on Instagram on 1 May 2019 and I quote  ""I hope that Singapore has reflected on what has happened, why this blew up as big as it did and learn not to avoid issues but rather face the hard reality – sexual misconduct and assault is much more prevalent than it appears to be.""",18,603,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00603
2019-05-06-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, these revisions of the law are just a means to the end. The social objective must be to create the conditions for a society where the law is rarely applied because all segments of society accept that these acts are wrongful and there are strong cultural and social norms against such sexual offences. The criminal justice system cannot undo the harms caused by a sexual offence. The trauma of an offence will remain with the victim for life. Serious efforts to correct this must start with attempting to understand the actual incidence of sexual offences and harassment in Singapore, the social conditions around the normalisation and perpetration of such offences amongst some social circles and applying the right educational and policy levers to correct those social conditions. Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill.",19,604,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00604
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, please allow me to declare my interest as a litigation lawyer. I have a practice. Given the Bicentennial Commemoration this year, I think it would be apt to pay tribute to the original framers of the Penal Code, which is one of the oldest pieces of legislation in Singapore, in the administration of criminal justice in Singapore. Prof Ho Peng Kee, then the Senior Minister of State of Home Affairs, colourfully described the Penal Code as ""the mother of all statutes"" when it was last reviewed in this House in 2008. There are masterful commentaries about the history of the Penal Code in two text books. The first book is ""The Criminal Law in Malaysia & Singapore"" by Professors Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong. Incidentally, Prof Stanley Yeo and Prof Chan volunteered as members of the Penal Code Review Committee. The second book is ""The Development of Singapore Law  Historical and Socio Legal Perspectives"" by Prof Andrew Phang as he then was. I relied on these commentaries in the preparation of my speech.",1,605,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00605
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The principle framer of the Penal Code was Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay. In 1837, the Law Commission, which he chaired, produced the draft of the Penal Code. For the draft, Lord Macaulay drew inspiration not just from English common law but two other sources  (a) the French Napoleonic Penal Code of 1791 and (b) Livingstone’s Code for Louisiana which was printed in 1833.",2,606,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00606
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"He drew from the best ideas from continental Europe, America and UK. Already then, it was not uncommon to trawl the world for best ideas to be incorporated into draft legislation. Eventually, the Penal Code was introduced in India in 1860. A decade later, substantially the same copy of the Indian Penal Code with its 511 sections was enacted as law in Singapore through Ordinance 4 of 1871 when Singapore was part of the Straits Settlement. Since then, law students, lawyers and our Courts have referred to Indian case law when interpreting our Penal Code provisions.",3,607,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00607
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"What were the main objectives of the Penal Code then? The principle objective was to codify common law criminal offences – which is really judge-made law – and in the words of Prof Phang, ""replace the manifold systems of criminal law then existing"" with a single code. The Penal Code allowed lay people to understand what kind of action and behaviour amounts to criminal conduct as well as the precise ingredients that make up the offences. Almost 150 years later, the Penal Code continues to play an important role in the administration of the criminal justice system. It clearly withstood the test of time. The Penal Code is applied every day in the State Courts.",4,608,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00608
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Given the evolving nature of our society and our mores, the Penal Code had to be, and indeed was, revised from time to time ensure its relevance. As mentioned earlier by the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Amrin, the last revision of the Penal Code was done by this House a little over a decade ago in 2008.",5,609,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00609
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I have reviewed the work of the Penal Code Review Committee (PCRC) chaired by the hon Minister Ms Indranee Rajah and co-chaired by Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin. The PCRC members are all eminent people drawn from the judiciary, legal service, Ministries, academia and private practice. Together, with their collective knowledge, experience and wisdom, they are uniquely well-placed to undertake the review. As we heard from Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin, they delivered a 500-page tome. I believe that this House owes the PCRC a debt of gratitude for executing the gargantuan task of updating the Penal Code so well. I also commend MHA, just like what Assoc Prof Walter Theseira said, for conducting extensive consultation with the public and VWOs before presenting this Bill.",6,610,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00610
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"A simple perusal of the Bill will reveal the extraordinary breadth of the review that was undertaken. We see updates on the following areas  (a) the extra-territorial criminal jurisdiction of the offences; (b) concepts of fault and physical elements that usually make up an offence. These elements are the equivalent of the ""computer source codes"" of the criminal provisions; (c) general defences that may be raised by accused persons; (d) creation of new offences and enhancement of sentences to protect the vulnerable and minors and to deal with modern circumstances and advances in technology; (e) updating of sentences to ensure their deterrent effect; and (f) removing offences which are seen as anachronistic or irrelevant.",7,611,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00611
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The recommendations that the Committee made took into account issues raised by our Courts in many judgments.

2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I would now like to make several observations and comments on the Bill. First, I am glad that the hon Minister, through a notice of amendment issued on 26 April 2019, accepted my suggestion made outside this House after the First Reading of this Bill to remove the thought crime provisions; namely sections 121A and 121B in the Penal Code.",9,613,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00613
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Presently, it is an offence to imagine the death or hurt or imprisonment or restraint of the President and the accused, if convicted, may be sentenced to death or imprisonment for life. It is also an offence to imagine the deposition of the President from the sovereignty of Singapore. These are clearly anachronistic provisions. It simply does not sit well with the mores and values of present-day society. I am not alone in making this call. The hon Member Mr Charles Chong made this call in 2008 in this House. He said, ""It is of course right that anyone who plots, plans or actually takes action against the person or the Office of the President ought to be punished, but merely 'imagining' any of these – should this really be in our books?"" It did not appear Mr Chong's question was answered then. Nonetheless, it has been answered now.",10,614,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00614
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Second, I note that proposed section 120A dealing with ""criminal conspiracy"" is significantly narrower. The proposed provision would have the effect of decriminalising a conspiracy to commit an illegal act, which was defined as anything that furnishes ground for a civil action. May I please ask what is the rationale for this? How does the narrowing of the definition of ""criminal conspiracy"" reflect on the expected sense of behaviour within our society? How does this square with the retention of the offence of criminal defamation under section 500 of the Penal Code which focuses on vindication of reputation. As Members know, people who have been defamed, also have a right of civil action too. I have also noted that, potentially, aggravated acts of defamation, such as ""threats imputing the unchastity of a woman"" under section 506 of the Penal Code; and ""insulting the modest of a woman"" under section 509 of the Penal Code are proposed to be repealed. What then is the basis to continue to make defaming another a criminal matter in these circumstances?",11,615,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00615
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Third, I have misgivings just like the hon Member Mr Christopher de Souza, on the proposal to abolish section 309 of the Penal Code which currently criminalises an attempt to commit suicide. I appreciate the point made by Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin as well as the PCRC that ""persons who commit such offences should undergo treatment instead"". I wish to point out though that section 309 of the Penal Code, read with the Criminal Procedure Code, now allows the Court to impose on persons convicted for the offence of attempting suicide, mandatory treatment orders aimed at providing psychiatric treatment for such persons in lieu of the jail term provided in the Penal Code. This would therefore take care of the concern expressed by the PCRC.",12,616,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00616
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"There is also a practical function. It allows the Police to intervene by arresting and sequestering the person in a safe environment; for example, a padded cell, so as to stabilise his or her condition. I understand from Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin that it is proposed that the Police be given powers to intervene. I seek a clarification, on the basis and extend of these powers, as well as, when is it expected for these Police Officers to be vested with such powers. Finally, there is a signalling effect to would-be offenders, and this is a point that was made by speakers before me too.",13,617,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00617
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next point, I believe there is a basis to consider amalgamating Penal Code provisions which cover the same ground as provisions in specific pieces of legislation. This will allow for more uniform application of the law dealing with the same area. In addition, reforms of these areas can be done more quickly, instead of waiting for the next review of the Penal Code.",14,618,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00618
2019-05-06-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In this regard, I commend the move to transfer the Chapter XX offences dealing with ""offences relating to marriage"" to the Women’s Charter. Similarly, the Penal Code provisions dealing with kidnapping could have been consolidated with the provisions in the Kidnapping Act. This also would be an opportunity to deal with and remove an anomaly in sentencing. Kidnapping under the Kidnapping Act may be punishable by death. It is not the case in Penal Code.",15,619,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00619

I seldom hear of these provisions in the Penal Code being invoked nowadays. Again, the Penal Code punishment for corruption offences is lighter than the Prevention of Corruption Act equivalent.

2019-05-06-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"First, I strongly support the proposed amendment that targets voyeuristic activities.

Unfortunately, the current law we have is inadequate to address the problems brought about by the advancements in micro camera technologies and the prevalence of such cameras to the general public.",2,646,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00646
2019-05-06-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"There is a need for targeted laws to outlaw the act of observing or recording a person without their consent.

Can the PIs continue to conduct surveillance operations to collect evidence for their clients?",3,647,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00647
2019-05-06-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Next, I am in full support of the repeal of marital rape. This is a long-awaited change. Married women should have the same access to protection as unmarried women. But there remain practical challenges in implementing this. Some of my residents have also spoken to me to voice concerns over potential false allegations of rape by an estranged spouse. This is not inconceivable for strained relationships. I would therefore like to ask what safeguards are there to ensure such allegations are carefully dealt with.",4,648,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00648
2019-05-06-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I also welcome the proposed new section 304C which makes it an offence to cause or allow the death of a child or a vulnerable person. Notable cases in recent years have made this change necessary. In 2016, two-year-old Mohamad Daniel Mohamad Nasser died after five weeks of abuse by his mother and her boyfriend. In 2017, a couple tortured 26-year-old waitress Annie Ee Yu Lian who had intellectual disabilities for eight months. She subsequently died. In both cases, the victims were vulnerable and abused by their care-givers.",5,649,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00649
2019-05-06-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"The new provision proposed in section 304C would apply to both the person who committed the unlawful act as well as to someone who witnessed the abuse, but stood by and did nothing to stop the abuse. While this deterrent will provide greater protection to vulnerable people by putting the onus on witnesses to report the abuse, but what if the witness was also a victim of abuse – either mentally or physically – by the perpetrator?",6,650,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00650
2019-05-06-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"For example, take the case of a mother who is a victim of abuse herself and out of fear, she did nothing to stop the abuse to her child. She would have been liable under the new proposed section 304C. I would therefore urge that we consider such circumstances and the mental state of the individuals before we consider prosecution.",7,651,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00651
2019-05-06-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, another proposed amendment is to raise the minimum age for criminal responsibility to 10 years old, up from the current seven. I note that this was a recommendation by the Penal Code Review Committee, which was of the view that raising the minimum age would not be a significant risk to public safety. While this change might seem reasonable if we compare the minimum age to global benchmarks, I have my concerns and ask that we could perhaps also look at things in a local context. Let me explain.",8,652,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00652
2019-05-06-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Locally, we are experiencing an increasing trend of reported cases of children beyond parental control (BPC). The number of cases has risen from 71 in 2016, to 108 in 2018. The ages of these children are also getting younger. Statistics from MSF show that for those between 11 and 12 years old, the number of BPC cases increased almost three-fold from three in 2016 to eight in 2018, while those in the age band of 13-14 years old saw an increase of more than two-fold, from 24 cases in 2016, to 56 cases in 2018. According to recent reports by MSF, we are also seeing BPC cases involving children 10 years old and younger.

2019-05-06-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, this upward trending of beyond parental control cases goes against the proposed increase of minimum age for criminal responsibility. I worry that it would lead to a phenomenon where unruly, unsupervised young children can possibly commit crimes without liabilities. We must watch this trend carefully. We need to pay close attention to young at-risk children, as well as the number and age of young offenders arrested for crime. More importantly, are there plans to effectively arrest the trending increase of beyond parental control cases?",10,654,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00654
2019-05-06-T-011,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Lastly, the proposed amendments to the Penal Code have generally resulted in increases to the maximum jail sentences.

What would be the impact on our prisons, and does our Prison Service have the resources, both in terms of infrastructure and manpower, to support this?",11,655,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00655

Sir, this is an extensive Bill which covers many areas of amendments of the Penal Code and several other Acts.

2019-05-06-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] A few years ago, we were jolted by the news about the death of Ms Annie Ee, an intellectually disabled person who was abused, tortured and punished by her housemates. Many people condemned the heinous acts inflicted on Annie, especially in view of her condition which made her more vulnerable to abuse, and those who committed those acts were people who were close to her. After the court case ended, many felt that the sentence imposed was not commensurate with the crime. At that time, many asked why the couple who committed the offences were not charged with murder. The couple had pleaded guilty to various charges of causing grievous hurt. The current legislation requires the prosecutor to prove that the final action committed had led to death. This was difficult to do when the torture took place over a long period of time.",2,658,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00658
2019-05-06-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Another case that jolted Singaporeans was the one where there was abuse inflicted on a toddler, Muhamad Daniel Muhamad Nasser, who was only two years old. He was kicked and slapped by his mother and her boyfriend almost every day and forced to eat dried chillies. The toddler eventually died due to head injuries. These cases shake us to the core as human beings. These people who commit atrocities on defenceless victims deserve a heavier punishment. It is a reflection of our principles as a society to strongly condemn inhumane actions towards those who are vulnerable.",3,659,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00659
2019-05-06-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Over the past several years, we seem to see several cases involving victims who are unable to defend themselves and the current punishment do not appear to be commensurate with the heinous crimes inflicted on the victims. According to a report by the Straits Times in September 2018, at least five such cases were brought to the courts between 2016 and 2017, compared to seven cases between 2000 and 2011.",4,660,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00660
2019-05-06-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Something needs to be done, and I am glad to see proposals within this Bill that increases the punishment on those who abuse and torture defenceless victims, who are unable to defend themselves because of their own condition and also because they have close relations with the perpetrator. There are also suggestions for a new type of offence for abuses that lead to the victim’s death. I think this is a good thing and I support the recommendations.",5,661,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00661
2019-05-06-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"(In English)  When people first heard about what happened to the late Annie Ee, there was condemnation against the heinous acts carried out against her. When people heard about the charges and the punishments imposed on the perpetrators, many voiced out their concerns that the punishments were not commensurate to the severity of the crime and the fact that Annie, was especially vulnerable as she was intellectually disabled. At that time, the Attorney-General's Chambers explained the specific circumstances which led to her unfortunate death and the limitations of the law which requires evidence that the abuser had the intention to cause death or fatal injury.",6,662,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00662
2019-05-06-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Therefore in cases, where the abuse consists of a series of acts that eventually leads to death, the abuser is likely to be prosecuted under the crime of causing grievous hurt, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years' jail, with possible fine and caning. In Annie’s case, the perpetrators eventually pleaded guilty to various counts of causing grievous hurt and causing grievous hurt with a weapon.",7,663,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00663
2019-05-06-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Cruelty against vulnerable individuals particularly offends our sense of morality as the victims are helpless and their ability to protect themselves is limited. To quote the Penal Code Review Committee, society reserves ""special disapprobation"" for the abuse of vulnerable people by their care-givers or others in a position of trust. There must therefore be appropriate and commensurate penalties against offences of such nature. I am therefore supportive of the proposed enhancements of the penalties for offences against vulnerable persons in this Bill.",8,664,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00664
2019-05-06-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I note that in the wake of Annie Ee's case, the public also reflected on how such a prolonged abuse could have taken place with no one reporting the same to the authorities. The Vulnerable Adults Act, which was the outcome of and was in response to various concerns regarding abuse against the vulnerable adults, which had been raised even preceding Annie Ee's case, also took into account recent cases and allowed for more detection of abuse and protection for the vulnerable. The amendments proposed today, addresses the other concerns about penalties and hopefully forms a deterrent against such heinous conduct. I would like though, to seek a clarification about how the proposed clauses in this Bill would sit vis-a-vis the terms in the Vulnerable Adults Act. In particular, I would like to seek clarification on the difference between the definition of ""vulnerable person"" in this Bill and ""vulnerable adult"" in the Vulnerable Adults Act. I believe a clarification may aid in the future applications of both pieces of legislation.",9,665,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00665
2019-05-06-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Clause 83 of this Bill seeks to introduce new sections 304B and 304C to the Penal Code. The new section 304B relates to causing death of a child below 14 years of age, domestic worker or vulnerable person by sustained abuse. The new section 304C relates to causing or allowing death of child below 14 years of age or vulnerable person in the same household. I note the distinction made between the two new sections. I would like to seek a clarification on why the offence of ""causing or allowing a vulnerable victim to die"" is applicable to persons in the same household who have frequent contact with the victim, while the offence of ""allowing neglect, physical or sexual abuse"" appears to only be applicable to care-givers and employers of domestic workers. What is the rationale for the difference in the scope of liability in these provisions?",10,666,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00666

The Minister had earlier addressed this concern. I note that the offence will only be made out if there is a failure to take reasonable steps to protect the victims. I appreciate and thank the Minister for the clarification. Mr Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding my queries and comments, I support this Bill.",11,667,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00667

In recent decades, in 1973 – there were enhancement of punishments to curb the use of violence by criminals; in 1984 – introduction of more deterrent punishments for certain offences; in 1998 – enhanced punishments for abuse of domestic helpers; and in 2008, a decade ago – amendments to expand the scope of offences.",2,669,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00669

This is the result of two years of discussion by the Penal Code Review Committee (PCRC). There are 169 substantive recommendations. After the recommendations, there was engagement with more than 700 stakeholders and with submissions from over 60 individuals and organisations.",3,670,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00670
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I applaud the committee and the Ministry for undertaking this much needed review. There has been robust consultation, and the taking on board of suggestions and feedback. As the Bill involves many changes which many of my hon colleagues have already covered, I will confine my speech to two particular areas which I had previously raised in this House.",4,671,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00671
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"First, on gender neutrality. In May 2016, I highlighted that our current penal code is not gender neutral and made a request to the Ministry to consider reforming our Penal Code. This was in relation to the April 2016 case of PP vs Zunika Ahmad. In this case, she was acquitted by the High Court of six charges section 376A(1)(b) of sexually penetrating a 13-year-old in a landmark decision. The case was subsequently heard in appeal before the Court of Three Judges. The apex court overturned the High Court decision. The hon Chief Justice emphasised that section 376A was to be gender-neutral.",5,672,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00672
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"While the Court has recognised the gender neutrality of section 376 as it stood at that time, I am heartened that the PCRC has also proposed amendments to sections 375 and 376, so that the definition of ""rape"" would include non-consensual penetration and mean that men can be victims of rape as well. It also expands protection to cover a victim that is an adult male who is forced to engage in penetrative sex against his will by a female perpetrator. This brings the statutes up to date and affords men, especially juveniles protection.",6,673,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00673
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"We do not as yet have such confusion in our laws that have led to unbelievable circumstances elsewhere, such as in the 1993 case heard before the court in Kansas in the United States. Hermesmann vs Seyer was a pivotal case in the US, where a woman convicted of statutory rape of a minor and was pregnant as a result of the act, later successfully sued to claim child support from her victim. It is hope that such a situation would never arise in Singapore.",7,674,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00674
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Second, with regard to Child Abuse Material, I raised a question in April 2017 to ask if the Minister of Home Affairs will introduce specific laws on child pornography. I am glad that the public consultations show broad support to criminalise non-fictional child abuse material. The new section criminalises non-fictional child abuse as well as fictional child abuse material where it is indistinguishable if the child portrayed is real or fictional.",8,675,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00675
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The punishments are hefty and rightfully so. A term of imprisonment which may extend to 10 years, and liable to fine and to caning for using or involving a child in production of child abuse or producing child abuse material under 377BG (2) and 377BH (2). The term of imprisonment which may extend to seven years, and liable to fine and to caning for distributing or selling child abuse material as well as a term of imprisonment which may extend to five years, and liable to fine and to caning for advertising or seeking child abuse material.",9,676,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00676
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"However, child abuse material should be abhorrent in whatever form it takes, whether it is non-fictional or fictional, and I add whether it involves a real child or a virtual one. The law seeks to recognise the special harm and depravity inherent in child abuse material and child pornography. As such, any material, in any form, should be considered equally abhorrent for its intent.",10,677,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00677
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Therefore, I ask that the Ministry to consider including the criminalising of all fantasy or virtual child abuse material, which is what is usually termed as non-photographic pornographic images of children (NPPIC). Criminalised NPPIC should include but not be exclusive to  cartoons, animations and drawings. Even if they are not indistinguishable that the child portrayed is real or fictional.",11,678,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00678
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"We will not be alone in this – sections 62-68 of the UK Coroners and Justice Act, sections 1466A(a)(1) and (2) of the US Protect Act, section 1(17) of the Thailand Criminal Code Act. The UNHCR Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child in relation to the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography also refers to child pornography as any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a child primarily for sexual purposes.",12,679,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00679
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Existing legislation is not as robust. Sections 6(1) and (2) of the Undesirable Publications Act only imposes a conviction for a first offence to a fine of $2,000 to an amount not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or three years. The same is so for the Film Act. The late Dr Victor Cline, who was Professor of Psychology, did in-depth research into sex addiction and pornography. He describes four stages of sexualisation – addiction, escalation, desensitisation and actualisation. His research shows those addicted to pornographic materials will want and will seek more explicit or extreme material and likely end up desiring to act out what they have seen.",13,680,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00680
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Just earlier this afternoon, Minister Ong Ye Kung also alluded to the normalisation of behaviour with the availability of obscene material online. Minister Shanmugam also spoke in his speech for the Second Reading of this Bill that the inclusion of materials which are indistinguishable whether the child portrayed is fictional or non-fictional is to remove the defence by any accused that the material that he or she has been caught with is fictional. Therefore, should it not be the case that all child abuse material in whatever form it takes should be criminalised?",14,681,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00681
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),I therefore believe there is fertile ground to include all child abuse material as I have described because technology will make it ever harder to distinguish real and virtual as well as the psychological correlation progressing from virtual to real consumption,15,682,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00682
2019-05-06-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Although I believe that the amendments to the Penal Code as proposed under the Criminal Law Reform Bill are much needed and have been robustly discussed, I ask that my proposal to criminalise all forms of child abuse material including NPPIC be considered. Notwithstanding my comments and proposal, I support the Bill.",16,683,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00683
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the proposed changes to the Criminal Law Reform Bill are timely and relevant. In general, these amendments reflect sentiments on the ground. The amendments have broadly enhanced protection for the vulnerable in the society and tackles emerging crime trends. I am glad our legal justice system is sufficiently nimble to move with the times and I stand in support of the Bill.",1,684,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00684
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"However, there are a few sections which I have some concerns with.",2,685,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00685
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"According to World Health Organization (WHO), Singapore ranked 62 out 176 countries with suicide rate of with almost 10 suicides per 100,000 people. This also means that Singapore has 2.5 times more deaths from suicide than transport accidents in 2017, when 361 people killed themselves. In terms of trends, men accounted for over 66% of these deaths. The number of elderly aged above 60 who took their own lives also reached an all-time high in 2017, at 129 suicides. This is the highest since suicide tracking started in 1991.",3,686,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00686
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"With the current Bill, section 309 of the Penal Code is repealed. This means that attempted suicide is no more a crime. We finally recognise that it is more important to rehabilitate and support those who want to commit suicide, rather than arresting and prosecuting those who have attempted suicide.",4,687,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00687
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"As a Police officer in my younger days, I had attended to suicide cases as well as attempted suicide cases. In one very memorable instance, I had to visit a young lady in the hospital after her second failed attempt at suicide. I had to record her statement and warned her that it was an offence to attempt suicide. She was indifferent. She could not care less about what I said. A few days later, she made a third and final attempt, and was successful.",5,688,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00688
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"For people who are determined to end their lives, arrest and threat to charge her in court is a poor deterrent to re-offending.",6,689,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00689
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"With that in mind, I would like to ask the Minister how many cases of attempted suicide were reported from 2010 to 2018? Of those, how many persons were arrested? How many persons were arrested repeatedly?",7,690,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00690
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Under the current law, abetment of suicide is a crime. I would also like to ask the Minister, how many cases of abetment of attempted suicide were reported from 2010 to 2018?",8,691,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00691
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),The above statistics are important for us to understand the underlying trends of suicide rate in Singapore and the effectiveness of our suicide prevention programme.,9,692,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00692
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"With the decriminalisation of attempted suicide, I hope that Government agencies will not trivialise the act of attempted suicide especially if the Police are no longer involved or are playing a minor role. I hope more resources, not less, will be channelled to help those who attempted suicide. More resources in terms of counselling to help the victim and victim’s families. More resources in terms of in-depth study on the causes of attempted suicide and suicide. It is through this approach that we can better preserve the sanctity of life.",10,693,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00693
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Perhaps we could look at what the Koreans have done. Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world and the highest among the OECD countries. What the South Korean government did was to conduct an extensive study on 70,000 people who committed suicide from 2012 to 2016 to establish a National Surveillance System on Suicide Trend to analyse patterns and statistics on the causes of suicide and who is more likely to attempt suicide.",11,694,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00694
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"It built strong local networks by educating medical and social workers on the ground, so they can immediately respond to those thinking of taking their own life. It also strengthened depression tests to identify those who might be at risk .",12,695,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00695
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"We can take a leaf from Korea’s experience. At the minimum, I suggest that we should mandate those who attempted suicide to go for counselling or treatment. For this to work, our anti-suicide effort needs to be an inter-Ministry collaboration, involving the Police, MSF and other stakeholders.",13,696,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00696
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Another area we have to be concerned with is teenage suicide. This is particularly problematic because the youths are shockingly vulnerable. Suicide is the leading cause of death for those aged between 10 and 29 in Singapore. These youths and teens are increasingly at risk of self-harm due to bad influences through social media and challenges. Such dark challenges could disguise as Momo Challenge, Blue Whale Challenge or hashtag #kys, that is, ""kill yourself"". When the youths feel stressed, they can also easily go online to search for methods on how to kill themselves.",14,697,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00697
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Thus, I hope that even with the decriminalisation of attempted suicide, the Police should not wash their hands completely. Whenever there is such self-harm reported, the Police should still be alerted to rule out any abetment of suicide. The Police can still be the referral agent to mandate Singaporeans who have attempted suicide to seek help.",15,698,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00698
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Next, section 323  voluntarily causing hurt. The new section 323A fills in the gap between hurt and causing grievous hurt with intention. The Bill also enhance the punishment when hurt is inflicted on domestic workers, vulnerable persons and persons less than 14 years old. This is timely, appropriate and necessary.",16,699,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00699
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"However, there is still a gulf between how the Police handle voluntarily causing hurt cases and that of voluntarily causing grievous hurt. Voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 is a non-seizeable offence. There are many injuries which do not fall under ""grievous hurt"". Grievous hurt relates to very serious injuries such as fracture, blindness and other permanent disability. Very often, ""hurt"" can be serious resulting in profuse bleeding, hospitalisation or a few days of medical leave. Yet, it is still not serious enough to be classified as grievous hurt and the offence is not seizable.",17,700,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00700
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The problem of non-seizable offence is that the Police cannot make any arrest without a warrant. The victim of voluntarily causing hurt has to lodge a Magistrate's Complaint with the court. This is an onerous administrative process costing $20 and requires the victim to lodge the complaint personally in court. He also has to buy a medical report from hospital or clinic to state how he has been hurt. This whole process is obviously a deterrent. Only when the victim of voluntarily causing hurt may a Magistrate complaint that the Police will be directed by the Magistrate to investigate. Hence, many perpetrators, many persons who try to hurt other people, get away quite easily.",18,701,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00701
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In UK, you can get arrested for committing such offences. Common Assault, which includes pushing, slapping or merely spitting at people. Such offences carry a maximum penalty of six months in prison. Actual bodily harm, which is a step up, constitutes actual physical harm which does not need to be serious. Actual bodily harm include bruises, scratches and bite marks and the offence carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.",19,702,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00702

How many cases were eventually prosecuted in court?",20,703,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00703
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"One extreme is to follow the UK's example of making ""voluntarily causing hurt"" to be a seizable offence. I do not think the Police are ready for this. I would like to propose somewhere in between.",21,704,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00704

2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In the first place, there is no good reason for a person to assault another without provocation. Worse still, a customer service staff should not be assaulted by the very customer he or she is trying to serve. If the Police can initiate investigation for such assault cases without the need for the victim to lodge a Magistrate's complaint, it will go a long way to deter such violent act and bring justice to the victim in a fast, decisive and appropriate manner.",23,706,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00706

These were classified as causing hurt and not causing grievous hurt. The Police did not necessarily investigate unless the victim spent money and time to go to the Magistrate Court to raise a complaint. Otherwise, they would not get any help. So, out of these 40 incidents, only four cases were finally prosecuted in Court. The majority of the victims could only look at the passengers going scot-free.",25,708,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00708
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Currently, there is a huge difference between ""voluntary causing hurt"" and ""voluntary causing grievous hurt"". The definition of ""grievous hurt"" includes serious injuries like fractures or blindness. Even if the victim was badly beaten up and was hospitalised for a few days, he may not be considered as suffering from grievous hurt and the incident may not be investigated. If he wants some form of justice, he has to pay for a medical report of his medical examination, take leave and pay another $20 to lodge a complaint at the Magistrate Court. Only then will the Police investigate. All these take time and money, so it does not appear to be fair to the victims.",26,709,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00709
2019-05-06-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Therefore, I would like to suggest to the Minister that the Police should proactively investigate incidences of ""voluntary causing hurt"" under certain circumstances, even though the victim was not deemed to have suffered grievous hurt. For example, if the injury is serious enough to warrant more than one day of medical leave to recover, or if a customer beats up service personnel, the Police can investigate immediately and charge the perpetrators in court.",27,710,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00710

2019-05-06-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Deputy Speaker, this review of the Penal Code is timely and addresses many of the evolving societal concerns and new crime trends that warrant enforcement. For example, the repeal for the immunity for marital rape restores dignity to women who suffered but were not accorded due justice. Decriminalising attempted suicide while ensuring similar powers to require treatment marks a good balance between legislative powers and rehabilitation. I remember rather vividly, as a young Police officer, I had to serve a warning to a young lady, paralysed from waist down, whose injuries were as a result of a failed suicide attempt. It felt unnecessary and discomforting then.",1,718,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00718
2019-05-06-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Similarly, legislation against voyeuristic activities and revenge pornography reflects the tighter legislation needed for the digital age. Very frequently, our aged laws are not able to protect victims as technology progresses much faster than legislation. Our law enforcement officers are often left with a patchwork of legislation across different statutes, stewing in their frustration to restore justice. Left unaddressed, the digital world is no different from a crime-ridden ghetto where self-branded vigilantes prevailed and whose very inhabitants in this ghetto are also intimidated by these self-branded cops. This set of Penal Code amendments will restore order and justice for many victims.",2,719,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00719

Would the Police have the powers to compel the owners of these sites to remove such voyeuristic materials? In addition, would private investigators also be prevented from taking such private videos even though it is presumably required in the course of their work?",4,721,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00721

Because of the speed of trades, malicious and rogue traders can make a lot of money in a short span of time. They can also cause lasting damage and collapse financial systems. Specifically, MHA has introduced section 424A and section 424B to tackle situations, such as the London Whale case involving J P Morgan or the Manipulation of the LIBOR in 2012 involving multiple banks. These amendments are important because of the growing number of financial fraud cases and the sophistication of the rogue traders.

2019-05-06-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Under the new section 424A, the penalty of imprisonment up to 20 years is twice as heavy as the current section 420 offence of cheating. The latter requires that there must be wrongful loss or that there is a clear victim but not the new section. While I note the need for a strong deterrence, can the Minister clarify why no victim is required as compared to the existing cheating offences?",6,723,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00723
2019-05-06-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I would also like to seek the Minister's clarification on the following. First, why is this new section needed instead of strengthening, for example, the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289)? Second, the need for strong deterrence for financial manipulation is abundantly clear – the immense financial windfall breeds greed and might destabilise financial systems. Noting that the penalty is heavy compared to existing cheating offences, how is our regime compared with those of foreign legislation? Were there previous cases in Singapore in recent years where we were unable to prosecute the perpetrator because there was no equivalent of a section 424A?",7,724,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00724
2019-05-06-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"According to section 424A(2), the new section 424A also does not require any of the three sub-sections, namely, section 424A(1)(a), (1)(b) and (1)(c) to be material for the offence to be made out. Because the sub-sections need not have to be material and presumably more situations might be investigated under section 424A, under what circumstances does MHA envisage that such a piece of legislation would be used? Third, what is the likely impact on the compliance requirements of our financial institutions upon the passing of this law?",8,725,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00725
2019-05-06-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Notwithstanding the above clarifications, I believe that this enhanced Penal Code will empower our law enforcers to protect us better. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.",9,726,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00726
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I stand in support of the sweeping changes introduced by this Bill to ensure that our criminal laws and regime are well-placed to tackle new crime trends and are aligned with societal norms of our times.",1,727,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00727
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I would like to start by commending the Government's decision to provide for a longer three-month period between the First and Second readings of the Bill. This allows both parliamentarians and the public to better understand and seek clarifications on such a crucial and comprehensive Bill. I hope that this practice would be similarly adopted for other Bills which are equally important and extensive. I would also like to commend the progressive reforms this Bill introduces.,2,728,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00728
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Another applaudable aspect of this Bill is the Penal Code Review Committee's extensive efforts to obtain public input in this review. More than 700 stakeholders participated in the engagement sessions and more than 60 individuals and organisations provided written feedback. The Committee included leading practitioners and thought leaders from academia and the private and public sectors.,3,729,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00729
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"To further strengthen this commendable effort at engaging the public, would the Government also consider including civil society groups on future review committees for any legislation? Civil society voices could have been especially value-adding and beneficial to the review process, given that many of these groups provide direct services and have expertise in the different issue areas subjected to review. In fact, these groups may have more experience dealing with certain groups of victims that avoid the authorities or are less inclined to report crimes and can provide valuable insights on these blind spots. I hope that it will become a standard practice for civil society to be included in committees spearheading legislative review rather than just at the consultation stage.",4,730,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00730
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Next, the Bill takes the progressive step of abolishing the offence of attempted suicide. This recognises that suicide attempts stem from deep-seated issues and a punitive approach may not be appropriate or sufficient in addressing them.",5,731,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00731
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Beyond legislative reform, we can go further in addressing the needs of those who attempt suicide by ensuring that the authorities have the skills and resources to respond appropriately when these cases arise. Police officers are deployed when an attempted suicide case is reported. Police officers are trained in responding to emergency situations, but may not have sufficient training in handling the complex socio-emotional issues often associated with attempted suicide cases. There is considerable value in having trained professionals who can be at the scene to do any assessment on mental health or provide psychological interventions where necessary. Similar trials have been conducted in the United Kingdom.",6,732,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00732
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have four recommendations to make here.,7,733,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00733
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, will the Ministry look into improving the quality of response to attempted suicide by setting up a ""specialist team with psychological first-aid training"" that can be deployed when attempted suicide is reported?",8,734,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00734
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, given that it may take time to train a specialist team, will the Minister consider deploying social workers, together with Police officers, when responding to attempted suicide cases? This would help ensure that there are experts on the scene who will be able to handle all aspects of the situation better.",9,735,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00735
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Third, will the Ministry consider making it mandatory for frontline Police officers to undergo psychological first-aid training? This will ensure that the process is not as distressing for people who attempt suicide.",10,736,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00736
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Finally, will the Ministry look into expanding the functions under the existing MyResponder app by SCDF for responding to attempted suicide cases? The MyResponder app works by notifying Community First Responders, who are members of the public trained in CPR or AED procedures, of nearby fire and medical cases. The app could similarly notify trained social workers or counsellors who are available and in close proximity to the scene of attempted suicide cases so that they can assist the Police with negotiation efforts.",11,737,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00737
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Next, the Bill repeals the marital immunity for rape, something which I and many Members of this House have spoken up about and which had been strongly supported by members of the public and representatives from the religious, legal and social sectors during the public consultation process. Rape is wrong in any context.",12,738,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00738
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister confirm if marital immunity for rape is completely removed? Currently, section 376A penalises acts of sexual penetration against minors under the age of 16 but does not apply where there is spousal consent. Similarly, section 375(1) provides that penile-vaginal penetration of a girl under the age of 14 is rape but does not apply when there is spousal consent. The position is the same under the new section 375(1A) for oral or anal penetration.",13,739,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00739
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Section 376A(5) states that it is not an offence for a man to penetrate his wife if his wife is 13 years old and above. This means that it is possible for a child between 13 and 16 years old who is in a marriage to give spousal consent to sex even though it would otherwise be considered as rape. Sir, the age of the child should be the only factor here and not whether she is married to the man.",14,740,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00740
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"One other positive aspect I would like to highlight is the raising of the Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility (MACR) from seven years old to 10 years of age, where children below this threshold are considered incapable of crime. While this is a step in the right direction, would the Government consider further raising this minimum age to 12 years old, in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)? Paragraph 32 of the CRC recommends that states increase the MARC to the age of 12 years old.",15,741,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00741
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Some have argued that logical thinking and problem solving skills only develop between 11 to 15 years old. Some also suggest that intellectual abilities reach adult levels at only 17 years old. Children with underdeveloped logical thinking, problem solving and intellectual abilities are more likely to exhibit risky and potentially criminal behaviour.",16,742,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00742
2019-05-06-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"While this change puts us on par with the laws in England and Hong Kong, Sir, I believe that Singapore could benefit from setting a positive precedence for other countries by meeting the internationally acceptable standard or level of 12 years old. Sir, notwithstanding my above clarifications, I stand in support of this Bill.",17,743,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00743
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill. These changes are wide-ranging and welcomed. Singapore’s Penal Code was enacted in 1871, a legacy of the colonial era. It started as a codification of the criminal law for easy administration by Colonial officials in far out territories, many of whom would not be lawyers.",1,744,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00744
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"While criminal law in England has not been codified in a single bill, the codification of the criminal law in the Penal Code has always been intended for the criminal law to be easily understood by a wider audience. Even a layperson reading the Penal Code would find the law clearly stated and helpful illustrations provided on how the law was to be applied. This is unlike other pieces of legislation.",2,745,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00745
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Of course, the Penal Code has undergone extensive changes over the last century and a half and this latest set brings the Penal Code up to date with many of the latest developments in crime trends. It also makes important changes to further protect vulnerable victims. In making these changes, the Penal Code has retained the easy-to-understand drafting style that clearly sets out the offences and penalties involved as well as helpful illustrations. While the Penal Code itself is long, each of the offences is clearly set out and organised and a layperson should be able to understand the charges against him when charged for any of these offences.",3,746,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00746
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In relation to vulnerable persons, this Bill makes provision for greater penalties for offences against the following  domestic workers; vulnerable persons; persons below 14 years; people in intimate relationships; people in close relationships; and ""intimate relationships"" refers to partners, sexual or not, and ""close relationships"" include broader family.",4,747,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00747
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"These are important changes that recognise special vulnerability in these relationships. All involve situations where one person is likely to be dependent on another or in a position of special trust with that person. And the abuse of that special position by committing a crime, therefore, fully justifies a sterner penalty and sends the right signal.",5,748,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00748
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"On a related note, though in a different part of the Bill, the marital immunity to rape has also been abolished. This was a point that I and others in this House had raised on previous occasions. It has always been in my view a quirk of the law when it was argued a man could not rape his wife even if she did not consent to having sex with him.",6,749,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00749
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Some of the reports of husbands abusing wives are particularly heinous, and while they may have involved sex forced through violence, the perpetrator could not be charged for rape but would often be charged with a lesser charge for the related violence. This was usually unsatisfactory for the victims. This amendment addresses this matter.",7,750,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00750
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"There is also a series of offences that seem to be aimed at mischief that can have serious consequences. This includes making false reports of dangerous objects, such as declaring there is a bomb on the train when you know there is not one, causing or contributing to serious fire and this seems clearly to capture cigarette butts thrown down rubbish chutes that may cause fires. There is also criminalisation of negligence in respect of things like machineries tearing down buildings and even dangerous animals, which is fair because this makes it clear that people who have responsibility doing these tasks should take additional care.",8,751,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00751
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I also welcome the changes to the Code in relation to crimes that have become particularly damaging in the Internet age. These include specific offences in relation to voyeurism, the taking of intimate photos or videos of a person without their knowledge, possession of the same, or even gaining access to it. These are broad-ranging powers which criminalise not only the obtaining of such information but also those who gain access to it.",9,752,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00752
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Child pornography is another area that receives special legislative attention, with a wide range of offences covering those who exploit children to provide the material, those who profit from it or distribute it and those who access it.",10,753,2019-05-06-T-011-S-00753
2019-05-06-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, this Is a broad-ranging Bill that thoughtfully covers emerging areas in crime and also provides greater protection of vulnerable people.

2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,Members spoke positively about the amendments relating to vulnerable victims. Members spoke eloquently and passionately about the need to protect the vulnerable. Victims like Annie Ee and Daniel Nasser were mentioned in many of the Members' speeches. No words can express the sorrow their families went through. We hope that the new laws protecting vulnerable victims will help to deter such cases from occurring.,2,758,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00758
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Ms Rahayu asked about the difference between ""vulnerable person"" in the Bill and ""vulnerable adult"" in the Vulnerable Adults Act (VAA). The VAA provides powers to the State to take intrusive measures, such as removal of the vulnerable adult from their living conditions. Hence, a narrow definition of ""vulnerable adults"" was adopted in the VAA. This is to strike a balance between respecting individual autonomy and protecting those in need of help using intrusive protective measures. Those that do not meet the high threshold in the VAA can and have been helped in other ways.",3,759,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00759
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"The PCRC was of the view that the definition in the VAA was too narrow for the purposes of the Penal Code and it recommended for ""vulnerable persons"" in the Penal Code to be wider to cover more persons. This sends a strong deterrent signal and can potentially reduce the need to resort to intrusive remedial measures as envisaged in the VAA. The VAA was only recently passed. We should give it time and MSF will keep a close watch to ensure the interests of the vulnerable in the community are looked after and the balance appropriately struck.",4,760,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00760
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Ms Rahayu and Mr Melvin Yong spoke about the proposed section 304 offence, and whether persons who are also suffering from abuse might be prosecuted for not taking action. The provision provides that a person is not guilty of an offence under section 304C if she could not have been expected in her circumstances to take steps to protect the victim from the significant risk of grievous hurt. We have also provided that such circumstances include her past or present experiences of abuse as a result of an unlawful act by any member of the same household as her.",5,761,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00761
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Ms Rahayu also asked about the differences between the new sections 335A and 304C. The bases for the introduction of these offences are quite different. The offences of ""failure to protect"" has been proposed to cover persons who owe these vulnerable victims a duty of care. It reflects society's view that these people are responsible for the safety and well-being of the vulnerable victims in their care, custody or control. The offence of ""causing or allowing death"" applies to members of the same household as, and who have frequent contact with, the victim. This offence was introduced to overcome an evidential difficulty where two accused persons who have the exclusive opportunity to harm the vulnerable victim deny any ill-treatment of the victim.",6,762,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00762
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Ms Anthea Ong and Ms Sylvia Lim asked about conditions under which the Courts may apply enhanced penalties for the offences against vulnerable victims. The enhanced penalties allow the Courts to punish offenders more severely if they prey on the vulnerabilities of certain persons. If the vulnerability did not make the person more susceptible to the offence, the offender will be subjected to punishment but not enhanced punishment. A person with a physical disability, for instance, may not necessarily be vulnerable, say, in respect of a white collar crime like fraud. There has to be a link between the vulnerability and the offence for enhanced punishments to apply.",7,763,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00763
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Ms Irene Quay and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah made suggestions to improve the reporting and detection of domestic violence. Domestic abuse should, in the first instance, be reported to the Police. Police are trained to deal with such cases and have the legal powers to intervene quickly to stop any imminent or on-going abuse. Police also work with MSF to ensure that the victim receives care and, if required, will physically separate the victim and the assailant. MSF will consider the Members' suggestions. As Ms Quay acknowledged, much has already been done by MSF.",8,764,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00764
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked how the amendments relating to abuse and neglect of vulnerable victims interact with decisions associated with palliative care. The Bill does not affect bona fide palliative arrangements. The Bill, for example, at section 304C, introduces obligations on persons in the household who have frequent contact with the victim and who are aware of a significant risk of grievous hurt being caused to the victim to take steps which could reasonably have been expected of such persons to take, to protect the victim from the significant risk. This involves a fact-sensitive exercise.",9,765,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00765
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Mr Patrick Tay and Er Dr Lee spoke about rehabilitation of offenders in Prisons. Psychiatric intervention will be provided to selected offenders where necessary and feasible. Prisons' programmes also include psychology-based correctional programmes, family programmes and work programmes. Mr Tay suggested that psychiatric treatment or psychological counselling be mandatory for sexual predators after the completion of their sentence. We will consider this suggestion. Mr Tay will be aware that offenders who are subject to the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS) for certain serious sexual offences are required to undergo community supervision and must comply with conditions, such as counselling and case management.",10,766,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00766
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,Mr Melvin Yong spoke about the impact of the amendments on Prisons' resources. The Ministry will monitor the impact of the amendments on Prisons and continue to ensure that Prisons will be adequately staffed and resourced.,11,767,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00767
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Members had a discussion earlier about the possibility of certain Penal Code offences being amended by Schedule. In general, Parliament should have oversight of criminal offences of general application, such as those in the Penal Code. There is agreement that we do not retrospectively make acts criminal. On section 409, we acted to reform section 409 as quickly as practicable, considering the need to consult the relevant stakeholders. I believe that the amendment has benefited from parliamentary scrutiny. In the case of the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is a specialised legislation and the Schedule lists classes of substances. If we only list specific molecules, the peddlers will change one of many of the component molecules. So, there is, in that case, a particular operational context.",12,768,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00768
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah spoke about minors dating adults and of dating websites. We share Er Dr Lee's concerns and our response is multi-pronged. The amendments today will deal with sexual exploitation of minors by adults. We want to prevent predatory conduct by adults against minors. We have amended the sexual grooming offences. We have also introduced a sexual communication offence to deal with sexting between an adult and a child. These address grooming behaviour upstream. We will closely monitor and take action against the users of dating websites or social media sites if they exploit young persons.,13,769,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00769
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Mr Alex Yam spoke on criminalising all forms of child abuse material. The distribution and sale of fictional child abuse material are criminalised as ""obscene material"" in the Penal Code and will be subject to enhanced penalties. The current maximum penalty is three months and it will be enhanced to two years. We thank Mr Alex Yam for drawing our attention to the international developments and we will monitor the situation closely.",14,770,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00770
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Er Dr Lee spoke about cases where parents have clearly ignored sexual abuse of their children. She asked about abettors and those who repeatedly witness abuse but do nothing. The amendments criminalise the failure of caregivers to protect children from ill-treatment, which includes the subjecting of the child to sexual abuse. Where death is caused to the child or young person, the maximum imprisonment term has been increased from seven to 14 years. Where death is not caused, the maximum imprisonment term has been increased from four to eight years.",15,771,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00771

2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Members supported the introduction of the new offence of voyeurism and distribution of intimate images. Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Desmond Choo and Mr Melvin Yong asked about the impact of the new offences of voyeurism and distribution of intimate images on private investigators, persons who report crimes, or caregivers. There are defences where the recordings are for legitimate purposes. Specific requirements apply to qualify for this defence. Among others, the act has to be done without malice, with reasonable cause and the image or recording is used for contemplated or pending Court proceedings and is not kept longer than necessary or required.",17,773,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00773

They would, if the distribution takes place after the provisions take effect. If their offending acts occurred before the new laws are in force, they would be dealt with under prevailing laws.",18,774,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00774
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,Mr Tay also suggested that the Courts be allowed to make orders which essentially involve the deletion of the offending images or recordings. The Courts can order the disposal of any property which has been used in the commission of an offence. The CPC was amended last year to specifically allow an order for the deletion of data on a computer or mobile phone where the data was the subject of an offence.,19,775,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00775
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,Mr Tay also spoke on dealing with the source of the offending images. The source of the images will be identified through Police investigations and the Police will do its best to track the source. Those in possession of the images have to cooperate in investigations to provide information on the originators of such material.,20,776,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00776

The answer is all non-consensual sex with one’s spouse will be an offence. His question also discusses sex within marriage involving minors. It is not tenable to completely ban minor marriages today. A majority of countries around the world share the same approach. The legal age of marriage is set at 18 years of age.

2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,Instituting a new positive definition of consent could generate further uncertainty in view of the fairly settled law in this instance. The PCRC studied this issue and found that the experience of England and Wales in having a positive statutory definition does not help in clarifying the scope of consent.,30,786,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00786
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,Ms Ong has suggested greater public awareness about the contours of consent. We will work with agencies and organisations to improve on public education in this area.,31,787,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00787
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Members spoke on the repeal of attempted suicide. I was particularly struck by Mr Desmond Choo’s first-hand account from his days as a Police officer where he had to serve a warning to a semi-paralysed lady who had attempted suicide.

2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Mr de Souza set out his concerns regarding the decriminalisation of attempted suicide. Let me be clear. The abetment of attempted suicide is still a crime. The amendments actually enhance the penalties for abetment of attempted suicide significantly. The amendments multiply the maximum punishment by 10 times to 10 years’ imprisonment, and for certain other categories. Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide remain illegal.",33,789,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00789

Comprising police officers and psychologists, they are trained in negotiation tactics and suicide intervention. Officers are also trained to ensure their own safety. Social workers, for instance, at SOS and SSOs, can be involved later after the Police have ensured the safety of various parties. We will look into Mr Ng’s suggestion on psychological first aid training.",34,790,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00790

2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Mr Murali spoke about Police intervention and treatment. The safeguards that were previously there – Police intervention, SCDF intervention – will still be there, post-decriminalisation. Where appropriate, Police can still exercise powers under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act. There will still be mental health treatment for appropriate cases. But, as Ms Anthea Ong highlighted, not all cases involve mental illness. For others, counselling or family support may be needed. The Government will continue to maintain statistics, taking into account inputs from the various agencies which respond to suicide attempts.",36,792,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00792

2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,Mr de Souza asked for a study to be conducted following the decriminalisation. We will monitor the situation post-amendment but we must remember that suicide attempts happen for various reasons. An increase or decrease in the number of attempts may not be attributable to criminalisation or decriminalisation.,38,794,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00794

The Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) operates a 24-hour hotline to counsel persons in distress. The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) operates a 24-hour Mental Health Helpline to assess and triage cases and activate home visit teams if necessary. To make it mandatory means that we will have to enforce the need to go for counselling, and are likely to do so on pain of punishment. Again, we are trying to move away, in this area, from criminalisation to help. So, we should tread carefully in this aspect.",41,797,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00797

There is currently no scientific consensus on what the MACR should be. So, we looked at factors such as prevailing criminal activity among the various age groups. We assessed that there would not be a significant threat to public safety to raise the MACR to 10 years of age. Persons of 10 years of age or above and under 12, can still avail themselves of a defence if they can show that they have not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge the nature and consequences of his conduct.

This includes VCH against these vulnerable victims.",45,801,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00801

2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Ms Lim and Mr Ang asked about the various scenarios in which Police initiate investigations for VCH cases without any of Magistrate's complaint. These include  acts of VCH which cause serious injury which falls short of grievous hurt; acts of VCH involved in road rage; VCH cases involving secret society members; racially or religiously aggravated VCH cases and acts of VCH against public service workers such as taxi drivers, transport workers or nurses. We will continue to monitor the situation with regard to VCH and study the various suggestions. Post-amendment – we can assess if there is a need to create a more expedited framework for the resolution of other types of VCH cases and if this can be done without compromising due process or compromising the delivery of Police response to other more serious offences.",48,804,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00804
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Mr Murali asked about the proposed revision to criminal conspiracy. There are no reported instances of the use of section 120A of the Penal Code against conspiracies to engage in non-criminal conduct. There is no strong policy reason or public imperative to keep it in the Penal Code. There is available recourse for such civil wrongs through the civil courts. The same approach is taken in the UK under the Criminal Law Act 1977, where criminal conspiracy is limited to agreements to commit offences.",49,805,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00805
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"The Member also spoke about criminal defamation. The assessment on criminal defamation is different. While there is civil recourse for defamation, the policy assessment is that there may be certain cases of defamation where criminal sanctions are required to reflect the seriousness with which society regards such conduct. It overlaps with a civil wrong, but so do other crimes such as theft and fraud. A policy decision has been made for these acts to be treated both as crimes and as civil wrongs.",50,806,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00806
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Mr Murali has proposed moving the Penal Code offences relating to kidnapping or corruption to other specialised legislation. We will consider Mr Murali’s feedback, and will also ask CPIB to consider it as well. I should address one point though. The Member said there was an anomaly in sentencing; kidnapping in the Kidnapping Act is punishable by death but this was not the case in the Penal Code. The apparent inconsistency can actually be reconciled. The heavier penalties under the Kidnapping Act are due to the fact kidnapping for ransom is involved. Conversely, the kidnapping offence in the Penal Code encompasses a much broader range of conduct, including less serious conduct.",51,807,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00807
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Mr Desmond Choo sought clarification on the need for an identifiable victim for the new fraud offence. The new offence of fraud does not require an identifiable victim. The LIBOR case is a clear example where dishonest gain can be made through the financial system without there being an identifiable victim or loss caused. It is very difficult to find a lay person who understands how LIBOR is calculated, given the arcane nature of the mechanism. Proving loss is also extremely difficult, because LIBOR is an inter-bank lending rate and it only impacts ordinary consumers indirectly, and the impact depends on the practices of each bank. For example, in setting fixed deposit interest rates linked to LIBOR. If it is clear that someone acted dishonestly to gain a benefit, he should be punished.",52,808,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00808
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Mr Choo asked why this new section was required in lieu of strengthening the Securities and Futures Act (SFA). The SFA regulates specific financial transactions and products, whereas the fraud offence will cover any kind of dishonest or fraudulent behaviour for gain. The new fraud offence puts a stop to the game of ""catch-up"" with actors who have a strong financial interest in finding loopholes in regulation. So, this law can be used against such actors.",53,809,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00809
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Mr Choo also asked about how the regime compares with that of foreign jurisdictions. The proposed Fraud offence is adapted from the UK Fraud Act 2006. It has a heavier maximum punishment – 20 years’ imprisonment as opposed to 10 years’ in the UK – to account for the fact that a single count of fraud can encompass a single deceptive scheme which affects multiple victims. The higher maximum punishment is to ensure that complex, large-scale frauds receive the appropriate sentence.",54,810,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00810
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Mr Choo also asked about the lack of a materiality requirement in the new offence. The purpose of the new fraud offence is to focus on the culpability of the offender and not the effect it may have had on the victim. Requiring proof of materiality requires a shift of focus back to the victim and how material they found the falsehood, and this is inconsistent with the purpose of the new fraud offence.",55,811,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00811

They include provisions in laws outside the Penal Code, including certain offences under the Passport Act, the Fisheries Act and the Immigration Act. But the listed offences do not include provisions in the MDA. The list of offences presumptive minimum sentences will be applied to is tightly scoped. We are not introducing a general doctrine that a mandatory minimum sentence should be replaced by a presumptive minimum sentence.",56,812,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00812

We agree that public education and awareness raising is vital; and we know that the amendments today need to be known beyond this House. We will continue to work on this together with Members and community partners. Yes, the law has its limits. The law can shape social norms, but it is only one factor. The legal direction is clear. Families, schools, media and the wider community, including NGOs, also play important roles in shaping norms, and we look forward to working together.",57,813,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00813

In my speech, I asked the Ministry, there is a provision where the definition of public servant, where the Police engage law enforcement officers on the ground, such as private security officers or auxiliary police officers, they are treated as public servants if they are carrying out law enforcement, crowd control duties and so on. So, would private security officers be treated as public servants in this aspect?",1,817,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00817

2019-05-06-T-013,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"The second point is on the question I raised about whether there is a possibility, as part of the social norms of sexual offences, these offences are under-reported in Singapore.

2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"On the issue of palliative arrangement, as I mentioned, it is a fact-sensitive exercise. The elements of the offence have to be made out, but certain indicators like the evidence of abuse and all that would have to be looked into. There will be police investigations and the Courts will have to weigh evidence and the Prosecution as well would have to look at the evidence to see whether there is any merit to the complaint. So, the intent of the Act, is not to go after bona fide palliative arrangements. I think that is as far as I could go but quite a lot of it is fact-sensitive.",1,821,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00821

We have made changes to our various processes, including reporting processes and the provisions today as well.

The intent behind the amendment to section 121A is to remove the limbs of the offence that do not require the offender to commit any physical act or omission. These are colloquially known as “thought crimes”. While this was not proposed by the Penal Code Review Committee, the Government reviewed this, and is of the view that this should be amended to keep the law updated.",1,881,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00881
2019-05-06-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"There is value in retaining section 121A, but we should limit its scope. In that regard, the Government proposes to remove the words “compasses, imagines, invents, devises or intends”, and replace them with “plans”. This will remove the “thought crime” limbs of the offence. The term “plans” refers to early preparatory acts which may fall short of the “substantial step” requirement for attempts or criminal conspiracy to be made out. This will allow for authorities to intervene at an earlier stage of planning than what is currently allowed under the law of “attempts” and “criminal conspiracy”. The death penalty will also be removed as a punishment option for this offence, and an imprisonment sentence of up to 20 years will be included as a sentencing option.",2,882,2019-05-06-T-013-S-00882

2019-05-06-T-015,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the impact to Singapore in the event of a prolonged stoppage of water treatment operations at the Johor River Waterworks; and (b) what are Singapore's obligations to provide treated water to Johor under such a scenario.,1,1117,2019-05-06-T-015-S-01117
2019-05-06-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB will shut down its Johor River Waterworks when the Johor River is affected by pollution upstream of our waterworks. Johor also has water treatment plants along the Johor River, upstream of the Johor River Waterworks, and will shut down the plants when pollution occurs upstream of them.",1,1118,2019-05-06-T-015-S-01118
2019-05-06-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Since 2017, there have been seven pollution incidents along the Johor River which caused PUB's Johor River Waterworks to be temporarily shut down. These incidents have been traced to illegal discharges from premises such as palm oil mills and chicken farms within the catchment area. These pollution incidents typically cause disruptions ranging from several hours to several days. So far this year, there have been two pollution incidents, with the most recent one on 4 April 2019, where there were high ammonia levels in the Johor River.",2,1119,2019-05-06-T-015-S-01119
2019-05-06-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Given the importance of the Johor River to the water supply of both Singapore and Johor, we have expressed our concern over the frequent recurrence of pollution incidents to Malaysia, both at the federal and state levels. Most recently at the Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat in April, Prime Minister Lee raised concerns over pollution in the Johor River and the severe impact of pollution incidents on both countries.",3,1120,2019-05-06-T-015-S-01120
2019-05-06-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Under the 1962 Water Agreement, Singapore is entitled to draw 250 million gallons per day (mgd) of water from the Johor River, while Johor is entitled to buy treated water up to 2% of the total quantity of water we import to Singapore on any given day, or about 5 mgd when Singapore draws its full entitlement. In practice, we have been selling Johor 16 mgd of treated water, which is in excess of their entitlement, at Johor's request. We do so on a goodwill basis without prejudice to our rights under the 1962 Water Agreement. When we are unable to import any water from Johor due to pollution, Singapore has no obligation to supply treated water to Malaysia.",4,1121,2019-05-06-T-015-S-01121
2019-05-06-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"During these pollution incidents, PUB works closely with the Johor authorities to flush the polluted water column from the Johor River. Such collaboration between PUB and its Johor counterparts has helped us to manage the pollution incidents. PUB conducts stringent water quality tests to ensure that the raw water from the Johor River is suitable for treatment before resuming abstractions and operations. During such temporary disruptions, PUB steps up production at desalination plants and local waterworks to meet Singapore's demand.",5,1122,2019-05-06-T-015-S-01122
2019-05-06-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Nevertheless, pollution incidents along the Johor River impacts the water supply of both countries, and remain a serious concern.

2019-05-06-T-016,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu,asked the Minister for Health in light of the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and fungus including Candida auris (a) whether the Ministry will be revising its strategy on measures to deal with superbugs; and (b) how will preventive measures be strengthened in our hospitals and clinics.,1,1124,2019-05-06-T-016-S-01124
2019-05-06-T-016,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Health in light of the dangers of multidrug-resistant pathogens such as candida auris, what measures are being planned to ensure that public confidence in our hospitals remains high.",1,1125,2019-05-06-T-016-S-01125
2019-05-06-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The emergence of microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and fungi which are resistant to standard drugs and treatments, a phenomenon also known as Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), is a global public health issue. While AMR can occur naturally in some microorganisms, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials such as antibiotics globally in healthcare, as well as the animal and agricultural sectors, have led to accelerated development of AMR. Due to increased global connectivity, there is a growing risk of AMR being spread internationally. Singapore, being a global travel hub, is exposed to the importation of AMR organisms.",1,1126,2019-05-06-T-016-S-01126
2019-05-06-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Candida auris is one example of an antimicrobial resistant fungus. It was first identified in 2009 in Japan and subsequently reported from other parts of the world, including Singapore. The first case of Candida auris here was reported in 2012. To date, a total of 16 cases have been detected in the public and private hospitals. Investigations showed that the cases are unlinked, and there is no report of local spread.",2,1127,2019-05-06-T-016-S-01127
2019-05-06-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We have put in place a number of measures to address the development and spread of AMR in Singapore. These include regulation on the prescription and retail of antibiotics to minimise the risk of misuse and overuse, and public education campaigns on the proper use of antibiotics, such as HPB's ""Use Antibiotics Right"" campaign in 2018.",3,1128,2019-05-06-T-016-S-01128
2019-05-06-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Within our public hospitals, there are Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes to guide doctors in making appropriate antimicrobial drug use, and Infection and Prevention Control measures to reduce the risk of spread of antimicrobial-resistant organisms. Notwithstanding these measures, we can expect infections with antimicrobial-resistant organisms to occur from time to time as microbes can naturally acquire AMR and antimicrobials still need to be used for treating infections. Healthcare institutions must therefore remain vigilant in surveillance and maintain high levels of infection prevention and control to prevent spread of AMR. MOH also works with healthcare institutions to monitor antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections.",4,1129,2019-05-06-T-016-S-01129
2019-05-06-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As AMR is a cross-border issue, MOH also participates in regional and global collaborations to tackle the AMR challenge.",5,1130,2019-05-06-T-016-S-01130
2019-05-06-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We launched the National Strategic Action Plan on AMR in end 2017 to outline our long term approach towards AMR. This was the result of a joint review by MOH, National Parks Board, Singapore Food Agency, National Environment Agency and PUB, Singapore's national water agency. The plan is aligned to the global action plan on AMR. Under the plan, we are progressively implementing enhanced measures in the priority areas of Education, Surveillance, Research, Prevention & Control of Infection and Optimization of antimicrobial use. The AMR Coordination Office was also established as the national coordinating body to facilitate the implementation of the National Strategic Action plan on AMR.",6,1131,2019-05-06-T-016-S-01131
2019-05-06-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Beyond actions taken by agencies and professionals, individuals too play a part in the prudent use of antibiotics or antimicrobials. We encourage patients and consumers to consult doctors on the best course of medical treatments, take antimicrobials according to doctor’s advice and only when indicated. Everyone of us must also practise good personal hygiene to protect ourselves from infection.",7,1132,2019-05-06-T-016-S-01132
2019-05-06-T-017,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the average CPF balance for individual CPF members at varying percentiles from the 5th to the 95th percentile; and (b) whether the CPF Board will consider offering differentiated interest rates so those with lower CPF balances can receive more interest to build up their balances and a lower interest rate for those who have high balances.,1,1133,2019-05-06-T-017-S-01133
2019-05-06-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The CPF system is already designed to be progressive through limits on CPF contributions and differentiated interest rates.,1,1134,2019-05-06-T-017-S-01134
2019-05-06-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"There are monthly and annual limits on the amount of CPF contributions a member can make. Mandatory CPF contributions from ordinary wages are capped at the salary ceiling of $6,000 per month. The maximum amount of mandatory and voluntary contributions that a person can make in a calendar year is subject to the CPF annual limit, currently at $37,740.",2,1135,2019-05-06-T-017-S-01135
2019-05-06-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"CPF members with lower balances earn a higher effective interest rate than those with higher balances. This is because CPF interest rates are differentiated based on a member's CPF balance. Balances in the Ordinary Account earn 2.5% per annum, while those in the Special Account, Retirement Account, and MediSave Account earn 4% per annum. On top of this, since 2008, an Extra Interest of 1% is paid on the first $60,000 of combined CPF balances. Since 2016, CPF members aged 55 and above also receive an Additional Extra Interest of 1% on the first $30,000 of their combined CPF balances. Hence, members aged 55 and above enjoy interest rates of up to 6% for the first $30,000, up to 5% for the next $30,000 and up to 4% for balances above $60,000.",3,1136,2019-05-06-T-017-S-01136
2019-05-06-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Members' balances can vary widely due to their unique circumstances, such as differences in age, employment, income, and withdrawals for retirement payouts and housing payments. In 2018, for active CPF members turning 55, more than six in 10 had at least the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) of $85,500 in their Ordinary and Special Accounts. Over time, we expect members' CPF balances to increase with rising income and labour force participation.",4,1137,2019-05-06-T-017-S-01137
2019-05-06-T-018,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many appeals have been received from applicants or joint applicants for BTO flats who have obtained BTO flats more than twice in the last five years; (b) how many of such appeals have been approved; and (c) whether the Ministry will review and revise the existing schemes to accommodate such applicants and allow a conditional third chance to be given to such applicants.,1,1138,2019-05-06-T-018-S-01138
2019-05-06-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"All eligible Singaporeans can purchase two subsidised BTO flats from HDB, and they have to pay a resale levy for the second purchase.  We have also allowed seniors aged 55 and above to buy a flat from HDB for a third time, but this is limited to a 2-room Flexi flat on a short lease. We are unable to extend housing subsidies for non-elderly households to buy a third new flat, as this would not be fiscally sustainable.",1,1139,2019-05-06-T-018-S-01139
2019-05-06-T-018,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"However, HDB does receive such appeals and will consider each one on a case-by-case basis. Over the last five years, HDB received about 790 appeals to buy a third subsidised flat. About 150 were approved, based on exceptional circumstances. In particular, if an appellant and his/her spouse are buying a subsidised flat together, and the spouse is a first-timer, HDB may consider making an exception on account of the fact that the spouse has not yet taken up any housing subsidy.",2,1140,2019-05-06-T-018-S-01140
2019-05-06-T-019,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the Ministry's position on developers who offer two-year deferments to prospective buyers; (b) whether the buyer and seller stamp duty will be based on the date of signing the Option-to-Purchase obtained earlier under the two-year deferment plan or on the date of signing the Sale and Purchase Agreement; and (c) whether developers are required to pay stamp duty for unsold units after five years even after an Option-To-Purchase has been obtained but a Sale and Purchase Agreement has not been executed yet.,1,1141,2019-05-06-T-019-S-01141
2019-05-06-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Since October 2007, the Government has disallowed deferred payment schemes for uncompleted private residential properties. So deferred payment schemes are only applicable for completed private residential developments. As with any property transaction, buyers should exercise due diligence and prudence before committing to a purchase under such a scheme.",1,1142,2019-05-06-T-019-S-01142
2019-05-06-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For the purpose of stamp duties, a unit is only considered sold when the Sale and Purchase (S&P) Agreement has been executed. The buyer's and seller's stamp duties are based on the date of execution of the S&P Agreement. Likewise to qualify for ABSD remission, developers will have to ensure that all units within the development are sold, with the S&P Agreements executed, within the prescribed period of five years.",2,1143,2019-05-06-T-019-S-01143
2019-05-06-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Defence (a) why does SAF still require 10 working days to process NSmen make up pay for in-camp training; and (b) whether SAF can reduce the current processing time of 10 working days.,1,1144,2019-05-06-T-020-S-01144
2019-05-06-T-020,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"NSmen who have submitted their claims are paid their Make-Up Pay within 10 working days from the start of their ORNS activity. The primary reason for this timeline is to verify the NSmen's training attendance before payment is made, to ensure accountability in the use of public funds. In practice, NSmen are typically paid within five working days for Low Key In-Camp Trainings (ICTs) and seven working days for High Key ICTs. In some cases, a longer time may be needed to verify claim details with NSmen and their employers.",1,1145,2019-05-06-T-020-S-01145
2019-05-06-T-020,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We regularly review our systems and processes to make the process of claiming Make-Up Pay more efficient and convenient for our NSmen and their employers. Employers are encouraged to register with the Direct Reimbursement to Employers of Claims for NS Training, or DIRECT, scheme. Under this scheme, the employer will continue to pay the serviceman his usual pay and claim reimbursement from MINDEF.",2,1146,2019-05-06-T-020-S-01146
2019-05-06-T-021,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,"asked the Minister for Education (a) in the last three years, what has been the trend and number of workplace accidents in schools involving school cleaners engaged by the Ministry; (b) what is the percentage of such school cleaners who have undergone training related to workplace safety and health (WSH); and (c) whether the Ministry can consider mandating all cleaning team leaders and supervisors in schools to attend the WSH Hazard Identification and Risk Management Course to reduce potential workplace injuries sustained by school cleaners.",1,1147,2019-05-06-T-021-S-01147
2019-05-06-T-021,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Since the current school cleaning contract commenced on 1 October 2017, 35 cases of workplace accidents involving school cleaners were reported to MOM, out of about 3,300 school cleaners engaged. About half of these cases reported involved slips and falls.",1,1148,2019-05-06-T-021-S-01148
2019-05-06-T-021,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MOE has been, and will continue to work with our cleaning contractors to pay attention to workplace safety and health issues for school cleaners. To reduce potential workplace injuries, MOE requires all our appointed cleaning contractors to provide a Workplace Safety and Health Officer to carry out risk assessment and monthly cleaning safety checks in schools. In addition, MOE holds regular meetings with our cleaning contractors to look at safety concerns and work together to improve workplace safety for our school cleaners.",2,1149,2019-05-06-T-021-S-01149

2019-05-06-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether any Singaporeans, Singapore Permanent Residents or families with a Singapore-nexus have been casualties in the bombings in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday 2019; and (b) what can our security agencies learn from the bombing incidents to help deter similar acts of violence from happening in places of worship in Singapore.",1,1155,2019-05-06-T-023-S-01155
2019-05-06-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka was one of the most horrific terrorist attacks since 11 September, leaving more than 250 dead and 500 wounded.",1,1156,2019-05-06-T-023-S-01156
2019-05-06-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"There were no Singaporeans among the casualties, and we do not know of any Singapore Permanent Residents who were injured either. However, a Singapore-based British lawyer, Anita Nicholson and her two children Alexander and Annabel, were killed. We are deeply saddened. MFA has been working with our Honorary Consul-General in Colombo to monitor the situation closely and to help Singaporeans there.",2,1157,2019-05-06-T-023-S-01157

2019-05-06-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, international cooperation is crucial to combating terrorism. In the lead-up to the attacks, it was reported that the Sri Lanka authorities had received information from foreign counterparts. Unfortunately, it appears that not enough was done to follow up on the information. In our region, security agencies regularly share intelligence for our common fight against terrorism. Such collaboration has helped to thwart many plots and attacks.",4,1159,2019-05-06-T-023-S-01159
2019-05-06-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, the importance of security forces being able to respond swiftly when attacks occur. In periods of heightened threat, Police will step up deployment at places with high human traffic and at sensitive locations such as places of worship. We are ramping up the number of Police In-Situ Reaction Teams deployed on the ground at areas with high footfall, such as Orchard Road and Marina Bay, to provide quick response. They are highly trained to deal with terror incidents, and complement the existing Emergency Response Teams and Rapid Deployment Troops.",5,1160,2019-05-06-T-023-S-01160
2019-05-06-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, it is important to have strong support from building owners to adopt enhanced security measures. The Police will work closely with them to enhance the security of their premises. These include installing hostile vehicle mitigation measures, CCTVs, deployment of security officers for checks on persons and belongings, and even structural hardening against bomb blasts.",6,1161,2019-05-06-T-023-S-01161
2019-05-06-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As for places of worship, MCCY has distributed a security advisory to them. Later this year, MCCY will also be introducing the SGSecure Community Network Crisis Preparedness Accreditation Scheme for religious organisations.

If they react appropriately, they will stand a better chance of survival, and perhaps even prevent the attacks in the first place. As part of SGSecure, we sensitise Singaporeans to identify and report suspicious items and behavior, to ""Run, Hide, Tell"" when the attacks are in progress, and to help fellow Singaporeans who are injured with ""Press, Tie, Tell"".",8,1163,2019-05-06-T-023-S-01163
2019-05-06-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Sri Lanka attacks are another clear example of the need to act decisively and firmly against radicalisation, whether online or on the ground. The leader of the attacks, Zahran Hashim, had been preaching messages of hate against non-Muslims for a period of time. The group he led was not large, but he was able to use social media to spread his message to a wider audience. Despite his active propagation of messages of hate, neither Zahran nor his group were picked up. And his messages of hate were not stopped. This allowed him time and space to brainwash many Sri Lankan Muslims into carrying out the attacks, including some prominent and well-off members of the community.",9,1164,2019-05-06-T-023-S-01164

Up till 2009, Sri Lanka was embroiled in a decades-long civil war between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils that killed more than 100,000 people. More recently, there had been riots between the Sinhalese Buddhists and the Muslims. Now, the Catholics and Christians have been targeted. This is very sad.",11,1166,2019-05-06-T-023-S-01166

Our racial and religious harmony did not come about by chance, and it should never be taken for granted. It is fragile, and can all too easily be shattered, not just by distrust in the aftermath of a terror attack, but by careless and irresponsible words and expressions during times of peace. Nor should we believe that no one will be offended, and allow offensive speech or hate speech in public discourse.",12,1167,2019-05-06-T-023-S-01167

In such cases, although HDB is not a party to the S&P Agreement between the developer and the buyer, HDB actively seeks to facilitate a fair and satisfactory outcome. For instance, if HDB receives feedback from DBSS flat owners on new or recurrent defects, whether during or after the DLP, HDB will surface the issues raised to the developer and urge the developer to address the issues with the owners. These issues may be complicated due to differences in views on what constitutes a defect.

In addition, the 2006 birth cohort was a transitional cohort where parents could choose to either close the CDA at the end of the year their child turned six, or extend the CDA till the end of the year their child turned 12. Parents who chose the latter also had the flexibility to close the CDA at any time when the child was between seven and 12 years old.",1,1185,2019-05-06-T-028-S-01185

2019-05-06-T-034,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Seletar Airport has been operating as a visual airport for decades. This means that pilots flying to and from Seletar Airport need to be able to clearly sight the runway and their operating environment when landing and taking off. This also means that during bad weather, flights may have to be delayed or diverted to other airports.

CEA also received complaints on potentially misleading or inaccurate advertisements, and complaints on alleged misconduct, such as failure to declare conflict of interest.",2,1223,2019-05-06-T-037-S-01223
2019-05-06-T-037,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There are three courses of action that CEA can take to punish errant estate agents and salespersons – Court prosecution, action by CEA's Disciplinary Committee, or the issuance of warning letters. Over the past three years,",3,1224,2019-05-06-T-037-S-01224

2019-05-06-T-038,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Generally, there is no prohibition against the resale of goods and services in Singapore, including concerts and sports events tickets, subject to the terms and conditions of the event organiser. The margin which resellers can command is freely determined between willing buyers and sellers.",1,1229,2019-05-06-T-038-S-01229
2019-05-06-T-038,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,Event organisers can prohibit resale. Some have put in place measures to curb the unauthorised sales of their tickets. These include printing the names of event goers on tickets and stating clearly that the tickets are not transferrable. Event organisers may also conduct identification checks and void tickets which have been sold by unauthorised sellers.,2,1230,2019-05-06-T-038-S-01230
2019-05-06-T-038,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Government's approach on consumer protection is based on promoting fair trading by businesses and helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions. We encourage consumers to take steps to protect themselves before making their purchases. Consumers who are purchasing tickets of concerts and sports events can, for example, check the terms and conditions of such tickets carefully before making their purchases, and compare the resale price with the original price of the tickets. If consumers are unsure about the legitimacy of the tickets they are about to buy, they should approach the official event organisers for verification to avoid paying for a ticket which may be subsequently voided by event organisers.",3,1231,2019-05-06-T-038-S-01231
2019-05-06-T-038,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"If consumers have reason to believe that suppliers have engaged in unfair trading practices in the sale of tickets, for example, false and misleading claims, they can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) with details of these practices for CASE to assist them in seeking redress from the suppliers. The Competition and Consumer Commission is also empowered with investigation and enforcement powers under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act to take action against errant suppliers who persist in unfair trading practices. The Police can also investigate if there is fraudulent activity involved in the sale of tickets.",4,1232,2019-05-06-T-038-S-01232
2019-05-06-T-038,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,We assess that our current position strikes an appropriate balance between protecting consumers and allowing market forces to operate.

2019-05-06-T-039,Irene Quay Siew Ching,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching,asked the Prime Minister with regard to public agencies' exemption from the Personal Data Protection Act (a) whether he can list out the specific clauses in the current laws and instruction manuals that provide for public agencies' accountability on data breaches (not misuse of data) in public IT systems; and (b) whether he can explain how these clauses in the laws collectively impose a high standard of responsibility on all public agencies.,1,1234,2019-05-06-T-039-S-01234
2019-05-06-T-039,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):,"Public agencies and their officers are subject to data protection provisions set out in the Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA) and the Instruction Manual 8 (IM8), as well as in other related legislation. The PSGA criminalises the acts of unauthorised disclosure of data, misuse of data and the re-identification of individuals from anonymised data. Public officers found guilty of these offences can be fined up to $5,000 and/or face a jail term of up to two years. Besides the PSGA, other legislation also criminalise the act of unauthorised disclosure of data, such as the Official Secrets Act, the Banking Act, the Income Tax Act, and the Statistics Act. These provisions serve to deter public service officers from and punish them for the irresponsible use and handling of data. Please refer to Annex A for a list of the relevant clauses in the aforementioned Acts.",1,1235,2019-05-06-T-039-S-01235
2019-05-06-T-039,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):,"Apart from criminal proceedings, public officers found to be negligent in protecting data under their control can face internal disciplinary actions, as provided for in the Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations 1999.",2,1236,2019-05-06-T-039-S-01236
2019-05-06-T-039,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):,"Apart from such legislative sanctions, the government has a number of measures to prevent or minimize the chances of a data security breach and to minimise the consequences of a data breach. All public agencies are required to comply with the provisions of the IM8. The IM8 complements the broad data provisions in the PSGA by setting out the rules and requirements that agencies have to adhere to in order to manage and protect government data under their control. The IM8 prescribes specific measures to protect government data. For example, the IM8 mandates Internet surfing separation, the disabling of USB ports from being accessed by unauthorised devices, and the use of passwords to protect files that contain personal data. The IM8 also prescribes certain data protection processes, such as the prompt removal of access rights, the detection of inactive users and the regular review of system access rights.",3,1237,2019-05-06-T-039-S-01237
2019-05-06-T-039,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):,"Agencies are regularly audited for their compliance with the IM8 requirements, as well as the effectiveness of the measures implemented. The objective of audits is to enable agencies to uncover process and system gaps that should be addressed before a data incident occurs. Where such gaps are identified, agencies are required to draw up plans to close these gaps within a specific timeframe, and the progress of these plans are monitored until the gaps are fully closed. Besides regular IM8 audits, agencies' data management practices may also be audited by the Auditor-General. The outcomes of these audits are reported in Parliament and publicly available; agencies' actions to close the gaps are tracked until completion. Serious irregularities can be brought to the attention of the Ministry of Finance for internal action, as part of the audit process.",4,1238,2019-05-06-T-039-S-01238
2019-05-06-T-039,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):,"The deterrent measures in the PSGA and other legislation, the prescriptive measures in the IM8, as well as the regular IM8 compliance audits, collectively impose upon public agencies and public officers a high level of responsibility for data protection. Data security is essential to upholding public confidence in the Government's ability to deliver a high quality of public service to our citizens through the use of data. The Public Sector Data Security Review Committee, commissioned by the Prime Minister and chaired by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, will recommend ways to enhance the policies and practices the public sector already has, to keep pace with advances in technology. This includes keeping accountability measures up-to-date to ensure that data security remains a priority among public service leaders, and to ensure that policies and practices are continually improved to maintain a robust data security regime. The Committee will present its findings and recommendations to the Prime Minister in November 2019.",5,1239,2019-05-06-T-039-S-01239

2019-05-06-T-040,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,asked the Minister for Transport what are the steps that LTA has taken to ensure that the Thales signalling system used on Singapore's MRT system is safe for operation in light of the train collisions at Joo Koon station in 2017 and on the Tseun Wan line in Hong Kong recently.,1,1243,2019-05-06-T-040-S-01243
2019-05-06-T-040,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Ensuring the safety of rail operations is our top priority. The recent train collision on the Tsuen Wan line in Hong Kong is a reminder that we must always be vigilant every step of the way, from robust system design, to rigorous testing and commissioning, and responsible operations and maintenance.",1,1244,2019-05-06-T-040-S-01244
2019-05-06-T-040,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Thales SelTrac Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling system is an established product and has been adapted for use on 86 metros across 40 different countries. Hong Kong's Tsuen Wan line and Singapore's North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) also use the system. Each system is however custom-built to the metro's unique architecture and specifications, with software logic tailored for the local needs and conditions.",2,1245,2019-05-06-T-040-S-01245
2019-05-06-T-040,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Hong Kong authorities are investigating the 18 March 2019 train collision. This may take a few months. We will study the investigation report when it is available. There were media articles linking the incident to a dual backup system which was uniquely designed for the Tsuen Wan line's signalling system. None of our MRT or LRT lines use such a system. Regardless, we should avoid unnecessary speculation into the root causes of the incident until the formal investigation report is available.",3,1246,2019-05-06-T-040-S-01246
2019-05-06-T-040,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Joo Koon incident in late 2017 was due to complications from concurrently operating the NSEWL's legacy and new CBTC signalling systems on the same line. We understand that this was not the case for the collision on the Tsuen Wan line in Hong Kong. The NSEWL now operates entirely on the CBTC signalling system, so a similar incident to Joo Koon will not recur.",4,1247,2019-05-06-T-040-S-01247
2019-05-06-T-040,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Arising from the Joo Koon incident, LTA invited Thales to set up a CBTC simulation laboratory in Singapore – the first of its kind in Asia, and the largest by Thales in the world. This has allowed LTA and SMRT to perform additional tests to fine-tune the CBTC signalling system's software and hardware before it is implemented on our rail lines. It has also contributed to the NSEWL's vast improvement in rail reliability.",5,1248,2019-05-06-T-040-S-01248
2019-05-06-T-041,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA has considered reducing the speed limit for non-expressway roads to improve road safety in light of LTA's push for the use of bicycles, e-bicycles and personal mobility devices on our streets and roads; and (b) if not, what are the considerations that LTA takes into account for not doing so.",1,1249,2019-05-06-T-041-S-01249
2019-05-06-T-041,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Road speed limits are set to ensure that motorists can travel safely and efficiently.

All three medicines were manufactured by Hetero Labs Limited. Following the recall of several losartan medicines in US due to the presence of a nitrosamine impurity, N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid (NMBA), HSA tested the suspected losartan medicines and they were found to contain trace amounts of NMBA which are above the acceptable limit",1,1298,2019-05-06-T-053-S-01298

Before being approved for sale, the medicines are evaluated to ensure that they meet the required international standards of quality, safety and efficacy. After approval, HSA conducts post-market surveillance, which includes monitoring of global developments and risk-based product sampling and testing for compliance to quality and safety specifications. Products found to be deficient in quality will be withdrawn from the market. Manufacturers are also required to test all batches of medicines, including the levels of specific impurities, to ensure that they comply with stipulated standards.",2,1299,2019-05-06-T-053-S-01299

In the case of the recalled losartan medicines, testing for nitrosamines like NMBA was not previously part of the testing parameters of ARB medicines as NMBA was not expected to be generated in the manufacturing process. This approach is similar to that adopted in other countries including the US, Canada and the European Union.",3,1300,2019-05-06-T-053-S-01300

While these general consumer goods are not required to be pre-approved before they are sold in the market, ESG monitors safety issues in such goods via consumer feedback and overseas consumer product notices and will work with suppliers to address any safety concerns quickly. Based on the information it gathers, ESG conducts tests on selected consumer products in the market to ensure that they are safe. Suppliers found with non compliant products will be asked to rectify or stop sale. This risk-based approach towards product safety regulation allows general consumer products, which have lower safety risks, to enter the market quickly without the need for comprehensive but resource intensive testing. This approach balances safeguarding consumers safety and ensuring market efficiency.",1,1313,2019-05-06-T-056-S-01313

2019-05-06-T-062,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On poor food handling practices, SFA has taken enforcement actions for the lapses found and required operators to rectify the lapses. SFA has stepped up surveillance and engagement of all food operators, particularly for food caterers supplying food to pre-schools, and during festive seasons. Advisories are issued periodically to remind food operators to ensure that their food handlers observe good food hygiene and safety practices, and that their Food Hygiene Officers (FHOs) fulfil their duties to ensure good food hygiene and safety practices, and adherence to time-stamping requirements.",4,1342,2019-05-06-T-062-S-01342
2019-05-06-T-062,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Food handlers and FHOs working at premises that have been suspended due to food hygiene and safety lapses are required to undergo re-training and be re-certified for Basic Food Hygiene Course (BFHC) and WSQ ""Conduct Food & Beverage Hygiene Audit"" programme respectively. SFA will continue to work with the industry to build a strong food safety culture among food business operators through strengthening their food safety management systems as well as competencies of food handlers and FHOs.",5,1343,2019-05-06-T-062-S-01343
2019-05-06-T-062,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"At the same time, SFA is taking steps to strengthen the regulatory regime for food hygiene and safety. For a start, heavier penalties will be imposed on food operators involved in significant food poisoning incidents. Total composition amounts will be increased and food operators who commit serious food hygiene and safety offences will be prosecuted in Court. In appropriate cases, SFA will also press for deterrent sentences to be imposed by the Court.",6,1344,2019-05-06-T-062-S-01344
2019-05-06-T-062,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"A multi-pronged approach to incorporate good food hygiene and safety practices as well as good environmental and personal hygiene to prevent and control infection is important to mitigate gastroenteritis. In the recent spate of outbreaks in pre-schools, SFA and the Early Childhood Development Agency issued an advisory to emphasise the need to maintain environmental cleanliness and put in place infection control measures. This includes reinforcing good personal hygiene practices in every individual to prevent the spread of diseases and to protect oneself from acquiring infections. For instance, areas with vomitus must be properly cleaned with bleach to disinfect, and children and pre-school staff who are sick should stay at home so as not to spread infection.",7,1345,2019-05-06-T-062-S-01345
2019-05-06-T-062,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Fundamentally, food safety is a joint responsibility across the industry, consumers and the Government as food can be contaminated at any point along the food supply chain. While SFA continues to be vigilant and ensures that regulatory measures are in place and properly enforced, the industry and consumers must also play their part to upkeep high standards of food, environmental and personal hygiene at all times.",8,1346,2019-05-06-T-062-S-01346
2019-05-06-T-063,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources how can the Ministry work with our financial institutions and funding bodies to divert more support for environmentally sustainable projects while reducing exposure to those with adverse impact on the environment.,1,1347,2019-05-06-T-063-S-01347
2019-05-06-T-063,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,MEWR recognises that our financial sector plays a key role in advancing our environmental objectives. We work closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to promote green financing in Singapore and to increase the financial sector's awareness of environmental risks and opportunities.,1,1348,2019-05-06-T-063-S-01348
2019-05-06-T-063,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government has taken a pragmatic approach through the adoption of international standards, market-led best practices and capability-building in the development of green financing in Singapore.

2019-05-06-T-063,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(i) In 2015, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) issued the Guidelines on Responsible Financing. Our local banks have all adopted these guidelines to evaluate their borrowers’ Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks and help borrowers improve their sustainability profiles. Most recently, in April 2019, the local banks announced their decision to cease the financing of new coal-fired power plants.",3,1350,2019-05-06-T-063-S-01350
2019-05-06-T-063,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(ii) The Singapore Exchange (SGX) introduced the ""Comply or Explain"" Sustainability Reporting Guide for listed companies, beginning from the financial year ending on or after 31 December 2017.

2019-05-06-T-063,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(iii) To encourage the issuance of green bonds, MAS introduced a Green Bond Grant Scheme in 2017, which helps to defray the cost of certifying sustainability oriented bonds as green bonds. This Scheme leverages international green bond standards to promote convergence and harmonisation with regional and international markets. Over $4 billion of green bonds have been issued to date.",5,1352,2019-05-06-T-063-S-01352
2019-05-06-T-063,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government also supports capability-building initiatives as they are key to companies understanding and incorporating ESG risks and opportunities across their core businesses.

2019-05-06-T-064,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will implement public education programmes to inform parents and students about the facts regarding vaccines so that they can make informed choices regarding voluntary vaccines.,1,1355,2019-05-06-T-064-S-01355
2019-05-06-T-064,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Parents have been supportive of the school-based vaccination programmes, and there is high take-up of vaccines offered in schools. For example, the take-up rate of vaccination against second booster doses of diphtheria as well as the vaccination against polio, both offered in schools at Primary 5, are above 90% each. For the recently rolled out Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination, the opt-in rate has been slightly over 90% for the first 25 schools covered so far. In addition, measles vaccination coverage among resident children is at 93% for the second dose at 7 years of age.",1,1356,2019-05-06-T-064-S-01356
2019-05-06-T-064,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We want to encourage high vaccination take-up rates to achieve herd immunity, so as to protect against the outbreak of potentially serious diseases such as measles, diphtheria and polio. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) conduct public education programmes to the general public as well as to parents and students to ensure continued support for the vaccination programmes. For example, through HealthHub, HPB's online health information portal, members of the public can access information on immunisation as well as details on age-appropriate immunisation for children.",2,1357,2019-05-06-T-064-S-01357
2019-05-06-T-064,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For school-based vaccination programmes like the HPV vaccination, the Ministry of Education (MOE) supports HPB in the distribution of an information package prior to the school visit for HPV vaccination, to enable parents to make informed choices. The information package includes a factsheet on HPV vaccination, a brochure on the risk and prevention of HPV, and a letter providing information on the HPV school-based programme. MOE will continue to work with MOH to sustain support for vaccinations offered in schools.",3,1358,2019-05-06-T-064-S-01358

2019-05-06-T-065,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"All primary schools already offer Higher Chinese to students who have the interest and ability to do so. Demand for Higher Chinese is healthy. Over the past five years, over a quarter of Chinese students offer Higher Chinese at PSLE.",1,1360,2019-05-06-T-065-S-01360
2019-05-06-T-065,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Many Primary schools start offering Higher Chinese from Primary Three, and all will offer it from Primary Five. This is in line with our priorities in lower primary education – to ensure students settle well in school, and build a strong foundation in literacy, numeracy and social skills – rather than to specialise them too early.",2,1361,2019-05-06-T-065-S-01361
2019-05-06-T-065,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This will also allow schools to make use of the two years of Chinese Language instruction at Primary One and Two to assess if the child has the interest and ability to offer Higher Chinese from Primary Three. Even without offering Higher Chinese, however, the Chinese Language curriculum at Primary One and Two is designed with enrichment modules to stretch students with stronger ability and interest.",3,1362,2019-05-06-T-065-S-01362
