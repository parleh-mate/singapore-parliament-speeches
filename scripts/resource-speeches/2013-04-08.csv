2013-04-08-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Prime Minister when will MAS review its car loan policy to ensure that Singaporeans will have reasonable opportunities to purchase a car with adequate financing.,1,1,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00001
2013-04-08-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Prime Minister in view of the recent changes to car ownership policies (a) how has this impacted the livelihood of used car dealers; (b) how many used car dealers are there currently in Singapore and how many workers do they employ; (c) what is the current stock of used cars held by these dealers; and (d) what measures will the Ministry take to ease the financial hardships faced by these used car dealers.,1,2,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00002

2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, as MAS had explained in its press statements, and as I had elaborated during the Committee of Supply (COS) last month, the restrictions on car loans were introduced for two reasons  first, to encourage financial prudence among consumers, particularly in light of the current prolonged period of low interest rates; and second, to moderate the demand for cars, which has been driving up prices of Certificate of Entitlement (COE) and car prices sharply, including over the last year. Higher COE prices contribute to a higher inflation rate and create negative spillover effects on the broader economy.",1,5,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00005
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah highlighted the plight of used car dealers. She did so during the Budget debate and she is asking about it now in this PQ that she has filed, and what we can do about that.",2,6,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00006
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As Members would know, to help the used car industry adjust to the new environment, MAS announced last Friday that it would lift the financing restrictions for two months for used cars that were acquired by dealers prior to the introduction of the restrictions. In making this decision, MAS gave consideration to the fact that demand had fallen more significantly for used cars, and also that the used car industry found it challenging to dispose of the inventory that was acquired at higher in built COE values before the introduction of the restrictions.",3,7,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00007
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"However, it is not possible to relieve the industry from the impact of the restrictions on a continual basis without undermining the policy objectives of promoting financial prudence, moderating the demand for cars, and cooling COE prices. So, MAS will not be extending the concession beyond this two-month period.",4,8,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00008
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The two-month relaxation of the rules will in fact provide a good window for the used car industry to clear much of its previous inventory. Data from LTA indicates that of the 11,000 used cars acquired before the introduction of the restrictions, 4,000 were sold in the one month since the financing restrictions were introduced. So, 11,000 used cars were acquired before, and in the one month since the financing restrictions were introduced, 4,000 of these 11,000 used cars were sold. Based on this trend, and with the temporary lifting of the financial restrictions, dealers should be able to sell most of the remaining 7,000 used cars within the two-month window.",5,9,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00009
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MAS will continue to monitor developments in the COE market and will recalibrate the financing restrictions for all cars, new and old, in response to market conditions – in particular, a sustained moderation in COE prices. But we will not for some time revert to the pre-February situation of having no financing restrictions on car purchases.",6,10,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00010
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We understand that the used car business has grown in recent years and many dealers have done very well, especially when COE prices were moving up. The industry should take advantage of the temporary reprieve for its inventory, and adjust to the new reality in the car market. If the industry should eventually consolidate and employees are affected, the Government will do its part to help them through the transition, and to find new jobs in other industries.",7,11,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00011

2013-04-08-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Acting Minister how the Government came to this financing restriction of 50% to 60% to encourage financial prudence. Perhaps, the Government can shed some light on how it came to the financing limit of 50% to 60% and not 70% to 80% financing for vehicles. Secondly, the latest COE prices suggest that the COE prices have not come down very much. This seems to suggest that there is quite strong demand for vehicles. The feedback is that this car loan restriction policy has benefited those who are better-off, and younger citizens who may need a slightly higher loan would be disadvantaged. How can the Government assure Singapore citizens that the policy is not intended to be disadvantageous to those who are having this aspiration to buy a car?",1,13,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00013
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his follow-up questions. On how the percentages for the loan limits were derived, it is really a judgement of looking at the past trends and at what is necessary in order to moderate the demand for cars, which is the objective of this whole exercise and review. Having looked at the current situation where we have very low interest rates and very easy financing, we did not feel that was prudent. And so we looked at how we can have appropriate adjustments to moderate the overall demand for cars, which was the intent of the policy. Based on that and the assessment on what is necessary, MAS felt that it was necessary to have something that was significant – not just a 10% to 20% adjustment. I think this would not have been sufficient to achieve the intent of the policy. We needed something that was more significant in terms of moderating demand.",1,14,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00014
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We tiered it so that for those who are purchasing the smaller vehicles, there would be a higher loan limit. So, from that point of view, first-time buyers – people who are looking at buying a smaller vehicle – with the loan limit, while it is slightly higher, would still allow them to purchase a car with a higher quantum.",2,15,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00015
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"It is really a balance. As I mentioned earlier in my COS reply as well, these adjustments are not permanent. The policy will continue to be recalibrated and adjusted based on looking at how the COE market adjusts to these new policies. We have had only one month of data and I do not think we should judge the outcome of the policy just based on that one single data point. We will have to look, over a period of time, how the COE market adjusts and then if indeed the policy objectives are achieved, as I said earlier, MAS will be continually reviewing and adjusting its policies accordingly.",3,16,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00016
2013-04-08-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Acting Minister and MAS for giving the second hand car dealers this 60-day breathing space. I have two supplementary questions. First, I would like to ask the Acting Minister why he has mentioned so soon that there will not be any extension to the reprieve? I would think that we should monitor and see whether there is a genuine reason for any extension or not. Secondly, if I heard the Acting Minister correctly, this curb is introduced in order to cut inflation. How effective would it be, because for those who need a car, they would still need to buy a car? This only adds on to their business costs.",1,17,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00017
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, I will answer the two questions on the extension and why we have decided not to go beyond. We have made very clear that it is a two-month window. I think it is precisely because we have taken in the feedback, studied the issues very carefully, and worked out what would be a reasonable window to help the used car dealers deal with this particular problem where they have an inventory of used cars with a higher built-in COE value. We recognise that it poses problems for them because of the changes in policy, and we would like to help them clear this particular inventory. If Members look at the data that had been presented – 11,000 used cars purchased before; 4,000 sold within one month – I think two months is a very reasonable window. If Members also look at used car sales, in the past, it was about 5,000 a month. In the month since we introduced the financing restrictions, it has come down to about 4,000. Prices have softened somewhat – about 10%.",1,18,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00018
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The used car sales are still happening. The market is adjusting. With two months, they should be able to clear the inventories that they have. The adjustment we are making now in providing this temporary lifting of two months is particularly to address this problem, and within this two-month window, the problem should be able to be resolved. That is why we have decided that the two-month window should be a definite period.",2,19,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00019
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the impact on inflation, yes, we are hoping to moderate the impact on inflation. The Member talked about business costs, but commercial vehicles are not included in the financing restrictions. Overall, by moderating the demand for cars, this will have an impact on COE demand and therefore, have an impact on moderating inflation as well.",3,20,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00020
2013-04-08-T-001,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Acting Minister two supplementary questions. First, with the car loan tightening policy requiring a much higher amount of payment in cash, I am concerned that those who are less cash-rich will resort to raise the necessary funds by taking up personal loans from banks or moneylenders. Personal loans now attract a much higher interest rate, averaging six to 12 times higher than car loan rates. This will add significant financial burden to consumers. I would like to ask the Acting Minister how we can prevent this situation from happening as we have seen in other countries when the loan-to-value (LTV) is very low.",1,21,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00021
2013-04-08-T-001,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"The second question is on how to help people who need a car as an essential form of transportation. For those who need the car for family care-giving obligations or as part of their job requirements, I wonder whether the Acting Minister would consider a different category of loan financing. For example, giving up to 80% LTV for cars but capping the loan value to 50%, therefore creating a new segment of financing for low-cost cars.",2,22,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00022
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the first question of whether there are other means of financing that people will resort to like moneylenders and bank loans which would then circumvent the financing restrictions or put more pressure and add to the burdens, I think it is something which we will have to monitor. I do not think we have seen any signs of this happening. We would also have read the media reports of how financing restrictions have been extended to non-financial institutions as well. So, to the extent that we can, the financing restrictions have been extended. I do not think we have seen any signs of loan behaviours being driven to moneylenders. We will continue to monitor and make sure that that does not happen.",1,23,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00023
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second point on whether we can extend the LTV for different categories of buyers to make it easier, in the end, it is really about managing the balance between achieving the intent of the policy and making sure that there are some exemptions that we can give to those who are deserving. We have already announced some of the exemptions earlier in the Budget and COS sessions. We should keep to the current position for the time being and look at the impact of the policy, whether it, indeed, achieves our policy objectives which are, as I stated earlier, to ensure prudence and moderate inflation. And then, we can adjust along the way.",2,24,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00024
2013-04-08-T-001,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Acting Minister that MAS calibrated the policy according to the reaction from the ground. From 1995 to February 2003, the restriction on car loan was 70%. After that, for the next 10 years, there was no restriction. Now, with the new restriction announced at this year's Budget, MAS has within a month, assessed the ground feel and changed the policy. Would the Acting Minister consider two months later, depending on the situation, taking a moderate line of having a restriction of between 70% and 100%?",1,25,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00025
2013-04-08-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the question. It was something that Mr Lim Biow Chuan also alluded to earlier in his follow-up question. As I said, we will continue to monitor developments in the COE market and we will re-calibrate our financing restrictions for all cars, new and old, in response to market conditions, in particular, if there is a sustained moderation in COE prices. We have just announced this policy. We have granted a temporary lifting of the financing restrictions for a particular objective, which is for the inventories that were built up. We would like to help the used cars dealers release these inventories without too much difficulty. Having taken this step, let us maintain the policy and look at whether it achieves its objectives over the coming months. MAS will continue to review the policy and re-calibrate based on the outcomes that it observes in the COE market.",1,26,2013-04-08-T-001-S-00026
2013-04-08-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"asked the Prime Minister whether the Public Service Division has completed its review of the salaries of Administrative Service officers, the judiciary and statutory appointment holders and, if so, whether highlights of the changes can be shared.",1,27,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00027

2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"For the review, I had asked PSD to take into account the need to continue to have market competitive salaries in order to recruit and retain persons of high ability, integrity and commitment to be capable public service leaders. This is consistent with the view of the independent Committee chaired by Mr Gerard Ee which reviewed political salaries and which was debated in this House last year.",2,29,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00029
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Ee's Committee felt that civil servants, judicial appointment holders and statutory appointment holders are ""pursuing professional careers, albeit in the public sector. Competition for talent in these groups is very keen, not just in Singapore but overseas as well"". They concluded that ""civil servants, other statutory appointment holders and judicial appointment holders should be paid salaries that are competitive with the market"".",3,30,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00030
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"In carrying out the review, the PSD also maintained the policy that Civil Service salaries should lag, and not lead the market even though they take reference from the market. PSD looked at multiple sources of data and also engaged Mercer, an international expert on remuneration issues. Using this data, the conclusion of the review is that current salaries are at about the right level, and will be maintained, that is, there is no need to raise them or to cut them. There will be some adjustments to certain salary ranges and start points to smoothen out salary progression.",4,31,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00031
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"There will, however, be two structural changes made to the salary framework. First, pensions will be removed. A Long-Term Retention Package will be introduced for the Administrative Service to retain officers for leadership and policy continuity within the Public Service. For the judicial and statutory appointment holders, a gratuity plan will be introduced. Both the gratuity plan and the Long-Term Retention Package are essentially of the same value as pension and are taken into account in the overall salary levels when carrying out salary comparisons. The removal of pension for the statutory appointment holders and the Judiciary will require constitutional amendments. These amendments will be tabled in Parliament in due course.",5,32,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00032
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"Second, the Gross Domestic Product Bonus (GDP)Bonus currently received by the officers and appointment holders will be replaced with the National Bonus similar to that for political appointment holders. Unlike the GDP Bonus which is tied only to GDP growth, the National Bonus is linked to a broader set of indicators, such as the socio-economic progress of the middle and lower income Singaporeans.",6,33,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00033
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"Mdm Speaker, the Government will continue to regularly review the salaries for the Administrative Service and the judicial and statutory appointment holders to ensure that they remain competitive. When doing so, PSD will not follow any specific formula, but will examine and take reference from a number of different sources, including market surveys by compensation specialists of salaries of professionals and executives in comparable jobs, and salary data from IRAS. This is no different from how it reviews the salaries of all other civil servants regularly to ensure that we are able to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of persons at all levels with the commitment and ability to serve the public and, in so doing, uphold the quality of the Public Service.",7,34,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00034
2013-04-08-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Madam, I am glad to note from the Deputy Prime Minister that the Government is using among various sources independent experts to reassess the appropriateness of salary scales for its top services in the Government. I would like to ask  going forward, is the Government continuing to use that as a way to ensure that the scale is relevant and competitive, instead of a straight peg to the private sector salaries, or as the Deputy Prime Minister said, a lag behind certain benchmarks in the private sector? With these changes, in terms of removal of pension and the bonus calculation, how is the Government in a better position to attract and retain top talent in these elite services of the Government service? My final question is  besides compensation, in the Public Service, integrity and public ethos are equally important, how is the Government ensuring that high standards are maintained in the service?",1,35,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00035
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"I will take the last question that Mr Baey has raised first. Commitment and integrity are very important for the Public Service, and these are key things which we assess our public officers on and demand very high standards of. So, when an officer is found to have not lived up to the standards of integrity and honesty that we require for public servants, we do not hesitate to take action against him. We can see examples of that already.",1,36,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00036
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"In order to make sure that we can recruit and retain officers of high quality throughout the Public Service, not just the Administrative Service and the Judiciary, but everywhere, including policemen, teachers, accountants and the average civil servant who serves the public wholeheartedly and does his best to serve the public, we will continue to pay competitive market salaries. That is the best way to make sure that we can continue to recruit and retain officers in the Public Service to serve members of the public. But we will take suitable comparators for each job in the Public Service where there are equivalent jobs in the private sector. For example, if a person works in an administrative job in, say, the back room of one of our organisations, we will try and take a comparable job in the private sector and set the salary according to that. If a person is an accountant, economist or a lawyer, we would take comparables as well. Similarly, we will apply the same principles for the Administrative Service and the Judiciary.",2,37,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00037
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"In terms of maintaining competitiveness and sufficient numbers, we have seen in the past from our experience that where salaries have gone out of line with what is happening in the market, we have had difficulties in recruiting and retaining officers. Because we have maintained salaries at a comparable level – we lag, we do not lead – but at a comparable level, we have been able to maintain our recruitment and our retention.",3,38,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00038
2013-04-08-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),May I ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether competitive salary is the only way to retain talent within the Public Service? There had been Administrative Officers who left the service and have become seemingly quite critical of Government policies. Is there a provision for Administrative Officers to come up with differing suggestions to the Government and have a proper dialogue with the Government so that policies that we develop would be able to match their expectations of what they are expected to do within the Civil Service?,1,39,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00039
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Obviously, salaries are not the only way in which we recruit, attract and retain officers. The officers also look for worthwhile jobs, a job which is respected by others in the community and also they are motivated by being able to do something larger, for the community, for Singaporeans as a whole. So, they are motivated not by just the bottom line of a company, but really their bottom line is the well-being of all Singaporeans. These are the motivations of public officers who come in and will stay for a long time.",1,40,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00040
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"There are many opportunities and avenues for officers to express their views. In fact, before a policy decision is arrived at, there are often very many different options which are explored. In that process, officers are encouraged to exercise their initiative and creativity in developing these policies. A number of the policies that have been developed have had significant inputs from our officers, for example, the Jobs Credit Scheme, Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) and so forth. These are important inputs that they have provided. There may well be a difference in views of what is a better policy or what is a better way of executing things, but these are natural in any organisation. But we do expect, that once a decision has been made, our officers will follow through and see through the execution well. That is also expected of any organisation that an officer serves in.",2,41,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00041
2013-04-08-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his explanation. During the debate last year, one of the key issues that we raised was connectedness. When we talked about salaries, there was also a concern that political office holders were not that connected because of the scale of salaries that they earned. For members of public who are watching this right now and the feedback that the salaries are still going to remain for Administrative Service Officers, the question would be how do we ensure that the Administrative Service continues to be connected and understanding of public sentiments as well as public needs. The feedback that we often get is that civil servants are highly paid and, therefore, there is a concern whether they are still connected to the ground.",1,42,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00042
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"This is, indeed, one of the things which the Public Service as a whole, not just the Administrative Service Officers, needs to take very seriously. There are many avenues for this. I would say that the ongoing ""Our Singapore Conversation"" has been a very useful exercise in hearing public feedback, getting views, not just on policies but on how policies are executed and transmitted. Those have all been very valuable opportunities. We also encourage our public officers, whether they are Administrative Officers or not, to get involved in the community. A good number of them actually have spent some time volunteering for various good causes. We also institutionally and structurally have our public officers, especially our Administrative Officers, attach to various organisations, for example, the CDCs. I know of one of our officers now who is working in the frontline in one of our public hospitals, dealing with public feedback. This provides opportunities for our officers to gain an understanding of issues on the ground, and we will find more opportunities for them.",1,43,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00043

I have three questions to ask.",1,44,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00044
2013-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"What is the actual formula that is currently being used for pegging Civil Service pay, especially for the top civil servants? Is it pegged at the 90th percentile or 75th percentile because that is a typical way by which the private sector, for example, will peg their salaries? The second question is this. The Deputy Prime Minister spoke about the Long-Term Retention Plan. I would like to find out a little bit more about that. How much of it is a financial component and how much of it is a non-financial component? Also, in HR management, what is the onus, therefore, on the employer, which is the Civil Service itself, to build other non-financial factors, such as culture, to make people want to stay and want to contribute to build our nation together? The last question is really on accountability. Political office-bearers now, we know, go to the polls every five years and if they do not perform and for various reasons, they are out. In the private sector, CEOs are evaluated based on either the bottom line or non-bottom line, certain KPIs, and so forth. So, it is pretty obvious for their accountability. I just want to seek the Deputy Prime Minister's clarification on what would be the accountability for top civil servants in the work that they do? They are almost on par or, if not, higher than what the Cabinet, for example, is making. So, I would like to seek clarification from the Deputy Prime Minister.",2,45,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00045
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"There are quite a few questions. I will try and answer all of them. If I forget some of the questions, please repeat them. I will try my best to answer them. On accountability, we do have a process by which officers are assessed by the Head of Civil Service and also the Chairman of the PSC on an annual basis. Officers have, of course, to state their KPIs and performance indicators. In the process of coming to their assessments, the Head of Civil Service and the Chairman of the PSC do consult the Ministers whose Ministries these officers are working in. So, that is one process.

We do indeed sometimes choose the 75th percentile, and sometimes the 90th percentile, depending on the range and the group of persons that we are looking for.",3,48,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00048
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,These are basically similar to HR principles that are used in the private sector. We do use HR consultants from the private sector who have experience in compensation and remuneration to help us to devise the schemes that we have. There are probably several other questions which I have not answered but I will be happy to answer them.,4,49,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00049
2013-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"What about the Long-Term Retention Plan? How much of it is made up of the financial components, and how much of it is non-financial?",1,50,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00050
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"While I spoke only of the monetary side, which is the Long-Term Retention Plan, of course, there is a whole range of other things which motivate a person to stay. The most important motivation for a person to stay in the Public Service is that he gets happiness out of other people's happiness – it basically comes down to that. If you get happiness only from the remuneration package that you have, then I think the Civil Service is really the wrong place for you. Your ultimate satisfaction and happiness must really come from seeing other people happy, other people doing better in life – that is, our fellow Singaporeans, the public at large and the community. So, that is the ultimate satisfaction for a public servant. We try to bring that across to our public servants in the course of their work, in the courses that they attend and so on. But that motivation comes from inside the person as much as it does from what somebody tells him. So, that is one aspect.",1,51,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00051
2013-04-08-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The other aspect of motivating our people is we try and give them development opportunities. We have a system where officers have 100 hours of training a year. We give our officers opportunities to go for developmental courses, both within the Public Service and also other kinds of courses, to improve themselves or to get higher qualifications, postgraduate degrees and so on. These are ways in which we develop our officers, keep them motivated and also increase their ability to contribute to the Public Service and to Singapore.",2,52,2013-04-08-T-002-S-00052
2013-04-08-T-003,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang,asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is the average number of downgraded personnel in each annual cohort of full-time National Servicemen; and (b) how many of these are assigned to clerical or administrative jobs each year.,1,53,2013-04-08-T-003-S-00053
2013-04-08-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mdm Speaker, National Servicemen are medically assigned a Physical Employment Standard (PES) according to their medical history and health condition. The PES of the full-time National Serviceman (NSF) is one factor which determines their suitability for various vocations within the SAF. It is not the only factor, it is one factor. Other factors include the SAF's operational and manpower requirements, as well as the educational qualification of the individual and his physical fitness. But, generally, PES A and B full-time National Servicemen can be deployed to all vocations, while PES C NSFs can be deployed to combat support and combat service support vocations. Mr Fang asked for percentages. The corresponding percentage for PES A is 27%, PES B is 58% and PES C is 8% at enlistment.",1,54,2013-04-08-T-003-S-00054

I would just like to express gratitude at this point to the Minister and the Ministry for the work they have done in making National Service a worthwhile and fulfilling experience for all NS men. As an NSman myself, I have experienced it first-hand. At the same time, I have heard feedback, especially from full-time NSmen in clerical positions, who complain that they do not feel fulfilled or actively engaged in a useful way for the two years of their experience. My clarification is in two parts.",1,56,2013-04-08-T-003-S-00056
2013-04-08-T-003,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"Would it be possible for clerical and administrative functions within the SAF to be outsourced in the way that a lot of the cookhouse functions and some of the training functions have been outsourced to commercial suppliers? As a follow-on from that, would the then non-combat personnel who were allocated clerical and administrative tasks be possibly deployed to carry out some social functions in the same way that many militaries in other countries, including Singapore, contribute during humanitarian disasters or crises to help the broader community. This would then contribute more to Singapore's concept of Total Defence in the economic, social, psychological and civil areas, as well as the military.",2,57,2013-04-08-T-003-S-00057
2013-04-08-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Madam, there are two principal considerations when replying to Mr Fang. One is that the SAF and MINDEF fully recognise that when we take these National Servicemen when they are serving their National Service, we have a very strong responsibility to make sure that they are safe. The medical classification or the PES classification allows us to deploy them in areas which are not detrimental to their health or their disease conditions. That is the first principal consideration.",1,58,2013-04-08-T-003-S-00058
2013-04-08-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The second is that, at the same time, even those with limited physical ability – as I said, PES E – we want to continue still to deploy them, as the Member said, to meaningful vocations within the SAF. And where it is safe and possible to do so, we have actually, over the years, expanded the list of vocations that they can do.",2,59,2013-04-08-T-003-S-00059
2013-04-08-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Pointedly, how do you ensure that even those with administrative activities or responsibilities continue to be meaningfully deployed? I think they still can. For example, the unit can be deployed in operations and while they are doing administrative duties, they ought to see that as part of the function of the whole. But I recognise the challenges that when they are limited to clerical duties, they may think that they do not contribute to Total Defence. But they still serve a meaningful role. We will have to continue to engage this group and to find ways in which they feel that they can better support our NS and defence activities.",3,60,2013-04-08-T-003-S-00060

2013-04-08-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Outsourcing – that should not be a motivation. Even whether we outsource or not, that is a separate consideration for how do you meaningfully use a small group of National Servicemen with medical conditions that make it difficult for them to be involved in the more combat vocations? For example, we have outsourced, as the Member said, chefs and so on and so forth but that is not our principal driving force. I think the main challenge is, even for those who have PES E or PES C, if we can meaningfully deploy them into combat service support vocations, we will. And for those who we cannot, we still need to engage them and make sure that their time in NS is meaningfully spent.",1,62,2013-04-08-T-003-S-00062

2013-04-08-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The foreign worker tightening policy will impact the construction industry in two ways. First, the man-year-entitlement (MYE) quota for new projects will be further reduced by 15% in July this year, so this would bring the cumulative MYE cut since 2010 to 45%, which is quite hefty. Second, the foreign worker levy will be further increased in phases over 2014 and 2015, with the exception of the levy for higher skilled workers employed within the MYE quota. These measures aim to steer the industry towards skills upgrading, mechanisation, and streamlining workflow to improve productivity and to reduce the reliance on foreign workers. During the process of adjustment, construction time and cost may be affected.",1,67,2013-04-08-T-004-S-00067
2013-04-08-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Like other developers, HDB will likely be impacted by the tightening on foreign worker policy, despite there being no delay to the construction timeline for HDB's BTO projects so far. Having said this, HDB should be less affected as it uses prefabrication construction extensively, which helps to raise productivity and reduce on-site labour requirements. Currently, 60% to 70% of the super-structure of HDB projects is constructed with precast components. Indeed, HDB is the market leader in prefabrication. HDB is however, monitoring the situation very closely.",2,68,2013-04-08-T-004-S-00068
2013-04-08-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"If any contractor is unable to proceed with the construction work, HDB will consider allowing the contractor to novate the contract to another contractor. HDB could also terminate the employment of a non-performing contractor and engage a new one to complete the remaining work.

With the many projects that are to be rolled out over the next few years, is there any consideration that the Ministry will look into relaxing the quota for the foreign worker? Next question is that, yes, pre-casting is in fact widely used in HDB projects. Is the Ministry going to help the contractors to resolve some of the crunch? I was told that pre-casting yards also cannot cope; they have dormitory shortage, they face long delays at dumping grounds as well as the shortage of engineers, architects and so on.",1,72,2013-04-08-T-004-S-00072
2013-04-08-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, the Acting Manpower Minister has repeated several times that there will be no turning back on this tightening policy. Let us forget about options or possibilities of further relaxation. If you look at the growth of the foreign worker population for the last few years, the construction sector is really a laggard in productivity. The bulk of the increase in foreign worker numbers is really due to this sector.",1,73,2013-04-08-T-004-S-00073
2013-04-08-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"We are determined to work together with the construction industry to try to upgrade and raise productivity.

Our internal guidelines state that by 2020, we should try to push up our productivity by another 20% to 25%, if possible.",2,74,2013-04-08-T-004-S-00074

We just got to press on with the job of raising productivity. The tightening is necessary. Yes, there is heavy pressure on us to deliver on building more HDB flats and also MRT trains and so many other infrastructural projects. We must work together as a team, together with the developers, contractors, engineers and the architects, to try to achieve productivity that has been achieved in other countries. Indeed, we have been talking about this for a long time. I remember when I joined the Civil Service 36 years ago, we have been talking about productivity being very low in construction. Thirty six years later, now that I am in MND, we are still talking about this subject.",3,75,2013-04-08-T-004-S-00075

Senior Minister of State Lee Yi Shyan is chairing an inter-Ministry committee because this work involves many agencies to try to make sure that this tightening policy maximises the upside that we hope to achieve. And what is the upside? The upside is increased productivity in the construction sector, and minimise the downside. What is the downside? The downside is delay in project completion or costs may go up. But if you do it well, we may be able to maximise upside with minimal downside. That is the intent that we want. On precast and prefabrication yard difficulties, their difficulties are my difficulties and we intend to work together as a team. Because when they succeed, I succeed.",5,77,2013-04-08-T-004-S-00077

Given the Minister's assurance to keep BTOs prices low, yet the cost of building will invariably be higher due to the higher foreign worker levies. How can we account for the additional cost that the Government will need to bear, going forward? Even though the Minister said that some of the tenders have not come in but, I guess, the cost escalation will invariably be pushing upwards. Could the Minister share how the Government is going to address this cost that the Government is looking to undertake?",1,78,2013-04-08-T-004-S-00078
2013-04-08-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As I said, we are still awaiting new tender bids to come in and we will see. Tender bids, of course, partly depend on cost of the operator but also on the competitiveness in the industry. So far, there has been good stability in HDB tender bid prices in the last couple of years, which have been very reassuring for me. But even if tender costs should go up, we have already delinked the BTO prices from resale price index, which is the subject of the next question. If, indeed, it comes to that, then the Government subsidy just grows, and we will absorb that increased cost so that we can continue to be able to achieve the objective of ensuring affordability of HDB flats.",1,79,2013-04-08-T-004-S-00079

We recognise that as the economy restructures towards productivity-driven growth, tight labour market conditions may lead to an increase in wage costs during the transitional period. In turn, this could exert upward pressure on the prices of some consumer services, especially those with high labour content. However, as the Government is helping companies to defray some of the wage increases over the next three years through the Wage Credit Scheme, the pass through of higher wages to consumer prices is likely to be dampened. The Government is also committed to helping companies raise productivity through the various productivity initiatives. In the longer term, with productivity gains, firms will be able to afford higher wage costs and cope with higher business costs, without having to pass on the increased costs to consumers.",4,90,2013-04-08-T-006-S-00090

I want to emphasise that it is not axiomatic that just because wages increase that prices must go up, and inflation must be a consequence, because the key elements here are whether those wage increases are underpinned by productivity and other enhancements in the economy. That is why in our measures, we are not just talking about support for wage increases by companies, which is an important part of the transition process, but also a key part of the strategy is to work on productivity at the national level, at the sectoral level and at the company level. So, we have to look at the real economic outcomes as well as the impact on prices through wage increases in order to draw a conclusion over a longer term.

In the event of an outbreak of a pandemic, the public healthcare institutions would temporarily cut back on elective surgeries, outsource certain services where possible, bring back temporary healthcare support staff where appropriate, and redeploy the staff to tackle the higher load due to the pandemic. So, by cutting back, say, for instance, the electives, we will be able to redeploy some of these staff.

I am very happy to hear from the Minister of State about the recruitment increase in nurses and allied health workers. But is the Minister of State aware about the difficulty to recruit students into the nursing courses and the allied courses like physiotherapy, occupational therapy and radiography? These are areas where workers are really in demand and in need in Singapore. I hope we will look also into ways of how to promote such occupations and the ways to encourage our younger generation to consider such careers in the healthcare industry.",1,109,2013-04-08-T-007-S-00109

The response so far to this campaign in terms of advertisements on TV, radio, online and so on has been positive.

2013-04-08-T-008,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Since 2007, IDA has put in place a Code of Practice for the Provision of PRS. The Code sets out the duties for PRS providers and their billing network operators to prevent accidental subscriptions and wrongful charges for unsolicited service. For example, PRS providers must clearly publish the prices, terms and conditions of their services. This information is displayed upfront within their advertisements. Before the PRS providers charge end users for the services, PRS providers must ensure that consumers take explicit steps to subscribe to the service, such as sending a purchase confirmation to the PRS provider via a distinctive prefix number ""1460"". This is to help consumers easily identify these providers to be offering chargeable services. Only upon receiving such confirmation will PRS providers activate the service.",3,122,2013-04-08-T-008-S-00122

Repeat offenders could also have their licences suspended or cancelled. To-date, Madam, IDA has taken enforcement action in 26 PRS cases. Such action ranged from the issuance of warnings to the imposition of financial penalties commensurate to the degree of contravention. For five cases, warnings were issued without financial penalties, whereas financial penalties were imposed for the remaining cases, with the highest being $100,000.",4,123,2013-04-08-T-008-S-00123

I was not involved in it personally but I looked at the files, I looked at the records. There was consultation done with different groups, stakeholders and heritage groups. The Singapore Heritage Society was consulted. They were supportive of the bid. When the then-MICA and NHB decided to move forward, they went ahead to make the submission for the tentative listing but we were not sure that we would be able to get even a tentative listing. I suppose at that stage, the sense was that there was no need to tell people that we were making this first step for a tentative listing yet because there was no certainty that we would even get a tentative listing. Now that we are on a tentative listing, then we are ramping up the efforts to make a formal submission for inscription as a World Heritage site.

At the same time, we also need pedestrians and cyclists to be alert, and practise good habits when using pedestrian crossings.",3,148,2013-04-08-T-010-S-00148
2013-04-08-T-010,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Mdm Speaker, there is evidence that motorists are becoming more impatient on roads. Cars would butt into the pedestrian crossings at turnings and drive across even when pedestrians are using the crossing. I have three supplementary questions. I would like to ask the Second Minister if he would consider changing traffic rules so that all vehicles come to a stop behind the stop line at the junction with the traffic light red for vehicles, whenever it is green for pedestrians, and that motorists not be allowed to turn around the bend until the red man at the pedestrian crossing appears. This may lose a few seconds for the motorists, but may save the lives of pedestrians and cyclists using the crossings.",1,149,2013-04-08-T-010-S-00149
2013-04-08-T-010,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Second, I would like to ask the Second Minister if he could mount a road safety campaign dedicated to pedestrian and cyclist safety, and educating motorists to look out for them at crossings.

We will certainly convey the Member's suggestions to them.",1,151,2013-04-08-T-010-S-00151
2013-04-08-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, on road safety campaign, we have an on-going effort in terms of ensuring road safety awareness for all road users – motorists through the Basic Theory and other forms of training for their driving, as well as for pedestrians, whether it is children through the Road Safety Park and other road safety efforts, or the elderly through the Road Safety Ambassadors programme. We are continuing this effort – the Traffic Police, in particular – in order to not just work on enforcement, but also on engagement and education. These are important pillars, as the Member has highlighted. We will continue in this regard.",2,152,2013-04-08-T-010-S-00152

These amendments strengthened our fire safety regime and contributed to Singapore's success in maintaining its good track record in fire incidences and fatalities. In fact, Singapore's fire fatality rate is lowest when compared to major cities such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York and London.

The fire occurred at the fifth level of the multi-storey car park. Post fire investigation revealed that there were extensive illegal fire safety works, with full height partitioning segregating part of the car park into storage facilities. Apart from contributing to the fire load with excessive storage of combustibles, the unauthorised partitioning covered up the original openings at the fifth level of the car park and impeded the natural ventilation. These resulted in a heavily smoke-logged environment which made it very difficult for SCDF to put out the fire. Due to the severity of the fire safety violations and consequences, the management was brought to Court and fined the maximum sum of $60,000 on two charges involving unauthorised fire safety works and change of usage.",5,161,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00161

2013-04-08-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Clause 13 amends the second condition such that the Commissioner's Closure Order (CCO) may be issued when it is ""necessary for the safety of persons that the premises should be closed immediately"". This will allow the SCDF to act quickly and decisively to address fire safety violations.",10,166,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00166
2013-04-08-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Clause 13 gives SCDF additional powers to deal with recalcitrant offenders. Currently, the CCO has to be rescinded once the fire hazard is abated. However, there may be premise owners who continue to violate the fire safety requirements, such as permitting overcrowding, once SCDF's inspectors leave the site. Clause 13 gives the Commissioner the authority to effect the CCO for up to the full duration of the 72 hours, even after the fire hazard has been abated. This will only apply to a small group of premise owners that have a poor track record and where SCDF deems it necessary for the safety of persons that the premises be closed immediately. The premise owner will be considered to have a poor track record if he has had three or more court convictions for fire hazard offences during the past 24-month period. Imposing the CCO will send a strong signal to recalcitrant premise owners. However, I would like to assure all Members that the CCO will only be used as a last resort. As far as possible, SCDF will rely on other measures such as fines and court-imposed closure orders to compel premise owners to put in place the required abatement and mitigation measures.",11,167,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00167

This is indeed very tragic. Preliminary findings have revealed that the high death toll was due to numerous fire safety lapses such as faulty fire extinguishers, absence of clear exit lights and overcrowding. This incident illustrates the importance of compliance with fire safety requirements, otherwise there could be dire consequences.",12,168,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00168

This is to align the penalties with similar offences under the Building Control Act and ensure that the penalties continue to have a deterrent effect. The fire safety offences affected include unauthorised fire safety works, failure to supervise fire safety works, non-compliance with closure orders and continuing offences. In particular, the penalties for serious offences such as unauthorised fire safety works and failure to supervise fire safety works will carry an increased fine of $200,000 and/or 24 months imprisonment compared to the current fine of $50,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment.",13,169,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00169

Clause 17 amends section 21, which deals with fire emergency plans, by renaming the Fire Emergency Plan required for designated premises as an Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The intention is to require owners of designated premises to draw up plans to cater not only for fire emergencies, but also for fire-related emergencies, such as gas leaks and chemical spillages, that may cause injury or the loss of lives. The Emergency Response Plan will also require owners of designated buildings to notify the SCDF immediately in the event of a fire-related mass casualty incident, which is defined as having 10 or more casualties.",14,170,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00170
2013-04-08-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Clause 18 amends section 22 to require premise owners of designated buildings with Fire Safety Managers (FSMs) to also appoint Company Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) for the premises. This will expand the coverage of the CERT scheme which has been implemented for the chemicals sector since 2008. The function of the CERT is to respond immediately to emergencies prior to SCDF's arrival in an emergency situation. Time is of the essence in an emergency and the CERT provides a first line of defence in mitigating incidents. Having a competent and well-trained CERT minimises the risks to lives and property, and disruptions to operations. A good example is Exxon Mobil's CERT team which was mobilised when a fire occurred at one of its pumps on Jurong Island in April 2011. The CERT was immediately activated to assist in the emergency. Because of the fast response rendered by the CERT prior to SCDF's arrival, the fire was extinguished within five minutes, preventing further damage to other parts of the premises.",15,171,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00171

Clause 10 inserts new sections 8B and 8C to enhance the investigative powers of SCDF officers. Currently, SCDF's fire investigators have the powers to collect samples of substances for analysis and evidence during fire investigations, only if the substances are petroleum or flammable materials. Fire investigators have to be empowered by the Police to collect other types of evidence. The proposed amendments will allow fire investigators to collect any samples required to test for fire resistance or flammability. They will also be able to retrieve any other materials to assist them in their investigations, or as evidence.",16,172,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00172

There are over 100 vehicle fires in Singapore per year and it is important that SCDF's officers have the powers to investigate such fires. SCDF will also be able to detain or impound vehicles and aircraft to establish the cause of fires.",17,173,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00173

SCDF is the regulatory body for Petroleum and Flammable Materials (P&FM) and it currently regulates the import, storage and transport of such materials. The current licensing regime authorises SCDF to stipulate control measures and carry out inspections, audit checks and enforcement actions. Clause 40 inserts a new section 36A into the Act, to extend this licensing regime to cover pipelines conveying P&FM. As more pipelines are developed, there is a need to ensure that they adhere to the relevant design, construction and maintenance standards. The pipeline owner is also required to formulate an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and establish a Company Emergency Response Team (CERT) that will respond quickly should an incident occur. In accordance with the ERP, the CERT will provide an immediate first response to deal with any pipeline incident.",18,174,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00174

And the contractors will be required to inform the license holders of their intention to conduct earthworks. Prior to commencement of the works, the contractors will have to take precautionary measures such as marking out the pipelines and maintaining a safety distance from the pipelines. This is important so that earthworks do not endanger the lives of others in the vicinity of the pipelines.",19,175,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00175

SCDF took over marine fire-fighting and rescue functions from the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) on 1 April 2012. This allowed us to provide an integrated response for both land and sea emergencies. SCDF will also be given the powers to facilitate its operations such as obtaining information on layout plans of ships for the purpose of fire-fighting and rescue and to investigate fires on board vessels at sea, regardless of the country or registration of the vessel. Clause 45 inserts a new section 43 into the Act to allow SCDF to continue MPA's practice of imposing charges on vessel owners for extinguishing fires or protecting life and property in the event of fires on their vessels, whether in inland waters or at sea.",21,177,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00177

2013-04-08-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, I am in general support of the rationale for the Bill, however, I wish to seek some clarifications on clauses 17 and 18 which require designated buildings to provide Emergency Response Plans and to have Company Emergency Response Teams. Specifically, I wish to ask what role SCDF will play to collaborate or partner with building managements to comply with the new requirements, and whether the burden being placed on the fire safety managers under the new scheme is, perhaps, a bit onerous.",1,180,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00180
2013-04-08-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, Madam, the new requirement for emergency, not just fire, plans. Clause 17 amends section 21 of the Act to require owners or occupiers of designated buildings to have in place not just a Fire Emergency Plan but an Emergency Response Plan. The new requirement is supposed to obligate building management to cater for all emergencies, not just fires, that may cause injury or loss of lives. Earlier, in his second reading speech, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that the emergencies should be fire-related but I do not see this restriction in the legislation. So, I would appreciate if the Senior Minister of State could clarify further on the scope of the emergencies to be catered for. Clause 18 will amend section 22 to require that buildings which are currently required to have fire safety managers shall also have competent Company Emergency Response Teams as part of emergency preparedness.",2,181,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00181
2013-04-08-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, the need to prepare response plans for emergencies is self-evident, and this is especially so in our high-density urban environment. In addition, the proximity of our homes, work places and recreational spaces means that when emergency plans are drawn up for buildings, they should be able to respond to not just critical incidents from within the building but those which could potentially come from nearby facilities and even the external natural environment.",3,182,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00182
2013-04-08-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"What then is SCDF's optimal collaborative role in emergency planning? Madam, the law currently places the responsibility for emergency planning squarely on the building owners and occupiers. Under the Act as well as Fire Safety (Fire Emergency Plan) Regulations 2008, they have to prepare and execute the emergency plans, conduct regular drills and gather tenants to form Fire Safety Committees. The role of the SCDF itself is reflected as issuing of guidelines about the contents of plans, reviewing records and so on. SCDF's role appears to be as regulator and auditor. Under this Bill, building management will have an even more onerous statutory obligation, with wider coverage to include non-fire emergencies, which will require more specialised expertise. What will SCDF do to assist building management in drawing up the required emergency response plans?",4,183,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00183
2013-04-08-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Even though the building management should bear the primary responsibility for the plans, the benefits of SCDF being involved in drawing up the emergency response plans would be tremendous. SCDF could advise on matters which the building management has no knowledge of or control over. Examples of such matters would include  the potential emergencies from outside the building which the management should plan for; whether there is potential to share emergency resources with nearby facilities; and even which open areas to use as assembly points, especially at our blistering pace of urban renewal. Worldwide, it is increasingly recognised that public-private partnerships in emergency planning, involving both Government and private organisations, will improve the quality and practicality of the emergency plans. At the same time, through joint efforts, SCDF would have a good grasp of the private sector expertise and resources available which could be tapped on in national emergencies.",5,184,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00184
2013-04-08-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Could Ministry explain how SCDF will collaborate with the building managements to comply with the new requirement and to improve the quality of emergency plans? For instance, would SCDF provide a template for building managements to use and adapt?",6,185,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00185
2013-04-08-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, Madam, the role of Fire Safety Managers and the Company Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). Clause 18 will amend section 22 to require buildings with fire safety managers to now have CERTs with competent in-house staff. The proposed section 22 (3A) states that it is the building owners or occupiers who are required to maintain the CERTs. However, the MHA's Press Release dated 14 January 2013 indicates that it will be the responsibility of the Fire Safety Managers (FSMs) to ensure that the response plan guidelines are complied with, including upgrading the competencies of the in-house teams to form CERTs.",7,186,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00186
2013-04-08-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Is this task too onerous for the FSM to be held responsible for? The FSM in a building is likely to be a mid-level employee with several corporate roles, for example, he could be an occupational safety and health officer doubling up as an FSM. To place on him the responsibility of ensuring that competent CERTs are in place which comply with SCDF guidelines on emergency response seems very onerous.",8,187,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00187
2013-04-08-T-011,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Will the Government assist building managements to comply with this new requirement of CERTs and if so, how? For instance, are there any plans to develop new training courses in emergency response planning to cater specifically to the new statutory requirement for CERTs?",9,188,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00188
2013-04-08-T-011,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker, for allowing me to speak on the Bill. I welcome the Bill's overall objective of raising the fire safety standards of buildings and premises, and improving the level of fire safety in Singapore. In particular, I support the move to enhance the preparedness of our people and premises in dealing with emergencies. Emergencies like fires can have severe consequences, causing injuries, deaths and serious damage to property. Hence, acting ahead of the curve and being proactive is important. However, I have some concerns about whether the new requirements may be too onerous for premise owners.",1,189,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00189
2013-04-08-T-011,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"For instance, the Emergency Response Plan covers both fire as well as fire-related emergencies. My question is  how will the owner know what types of emergencies he has to plan for? And in the first place, will the owner know how to draft such a plan, or does he have to engage a consultant? What are, if any, are the requirements for Fire Safety Officers (FSOs) for the various types of properties or buildings?",2,190,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00190
2013-04-08-T-011,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Secondly, the formation of CERTs requires manpower. Some businesses are already facing labour shortfalls, so I am worried whether the industries, especially the SMEs, are able to cope with this requirement. Can the Minister clarify whether the premise owners are required to hire dedicated staff to form CERTs? Also, who will conduct the training and how long is the training for?",3,191,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00191
2013-04-08-T-011,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Lastly, while it is important for premise owners to adopt the Emergency Response Plan and CERT framework to provide a contingency plan and an immediate first response during emergencies, we should also target the general public to educate them on the importance of fire safety and prevention.

I would like to draw the analogy with airlines and how we, as passengers feel safe and confident that the air crew are well-trained and equipped to respond to emergencies. Likewise, premise owners should provide this same level of assurances to those who work and visit their premises.",2,195,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00195
2013-04-08-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Let me first address Mr Arthur Fong's concerns on whether the compliance cost will be significant and too onerous on premise owners. I would like to reassure Members that SCDF has conducted extensive consultations with various stakeholders including building owners from the commercial and industrial sectors over the past year.,3,196,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00196
2013-04-08-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The stakeholders understood the need for these additional safety requirements and were generally receptive to them. They recognise that being prepared and having a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan, coupled with a competent Company Emergency Response Team (CERT), would help them mitigate incipient incidents and minimise potential damage. Most buildings and premises already have plans for fire-related emergencies such as the In-Place Protection Plan and the Arson Prevention Plan. The Emergency Response Plans (ERPs) serve to integrate all these plans together.",4,197,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00197
2013-04-08-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked whether SCDF will be working with premise owners to formulate their ERP and identify the resources required for response. Indeed, SCDF's role goes beyond just auditing and approving plans. SCDF is committed to supporting and working closely with premise owners in the development and formulation of ERPs just as it is doing for the existing fire emergency plans. During the audit process, the SCDF works together with the premise owners to make improvements to their plans and capabilities. SCDF has also published guidelines on for the formulation of such plans on its website. These would serve as a basic template for most plans.",5,198,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00198
2013-04-08-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As to the query why the ERP includes fire-related emergencies, this is because FSA is about fire and safety measures, and therefore the ERP includes fire related emergencies. The FSMs are also trained to conduct in-place protection should there be gas leaks or chemical spills that may endanger others in the building.",6,199,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00199
2013-04-08-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, the Fires Safety Managers, being certified by SCDF, which I believe Mr Arthur Fong was referring to, are trained in both fire and fire-related emergencies to assist premise owners in formulating the ERPs. Should circumstances change, premise owners can also approach SCDF directly for help in updating their plans. Fire stations also conduct regular exercises at various premises. In these exercises, SCDF and CERT work together with premise owners to test and validate their plans to ensure they work well holistically.",7,200,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00200

2013-04-08-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The requirement of CERT has already been implemented for the chemical industries since 2008 and is working very well. The proposal therefore is to extend the CERT scheme to other premises to formalise their existing in-house fire fighting teams and raise their competencies. The role of an FSM today is to ensure and enhance the fire safety standard within the premises. To do so, the FSM is trained in basic firemanship, emergency planning and fire safety management. Premises will typically not need additional manpower for CERT as the CERT can be made up of existing FSMs and include members of the buildings, security, maintenance staff and volunteers from the tenants as it stands today.",9,202,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00202
2013-04-08-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,We have discussed this with the various stakeholders during the industry consultation. I would like to assure Ms Sylvia Lim the assessment is that the compliance requirements are not overly onerous.,10,203,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00203

One exercise held during EP days is the Vertical Stretcher Challenge where SCDF has leveraged on the energy and enthusiasm of students to spread important fire safety messages. This exercise, whereby the students race across the corridors with stretchers, serves to educate the community on the importance of having a clutter-free corridor which will aid emergency responders during an emergency.",15,208,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00208

In addition, SCDF works closely with the National Fire and Civil Emergency Preparedness Council, PA, HDB and Town Councils. Most recently, they have put up fire advisories at lift doors. These serve to create awareness amongst residents of fire hazards in common areas and to remind them to alert their Town Council if necessary.",16,209,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00209

It was mentioned in the press release issued by MHA on 14 January that under this new scheme, the FSMs will be required to ensure that the response plan guidelines are complied with including upgrading the competencies of the in-house CERTs. And as I mentioned in my speech earlier, the FSM in the scheme of the organisation is not a very high level employee, so I would like the Senior Minister of State to confirm that the legal liability does not fall on him if there is non-compliance but on the building owners and management.",1,212,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00212

Therefore apart from the owners, the FSM is the competent, certified personnel on the ground for the owners to make sure that the compliances to the Fire Safety Act are met. This includes having the requisite number of people who should be able to help and step forward should an emergency occurs because the SCDF cannot come instantly.",1,213,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00213

Therefore, we have to put the onus on somebody to ensure that the plans are up to date and relevant to the buildings, as the buildings and CERT personnel may change over time, and also ensure that the CERT are up-skilled to the right level and are updated to ensure that new challenges are being met and that they are trained to ensure that they can coordinate and work well with the SCDF.",2,214,2013-04-08-T-011-S-00214

It is common for internationally active financial groups to be organised under holding companies. As Singapore develops as an international financial centre, more global banks and insurance companies are locating parts of their global operations in Singapore. At the same time, our domestic financial institutions are growing regionally and some may find a holding company structure more suited to their purpose.",3,224,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00224

2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Group-wide supervision allows MAS to assess the impact that a financial institution's relationships with other entities in the group may have on its safety and soundness. The concept of group supervision is of course not new. Financial groups in Singapore are mostly headed by banks and are already subject to group-wide supervision by the MAS. The Bill extends group-wide supervision by MAS to an FHC and its financial group. It is aimed at mitigating intra-group contagion risks, preventing the multiple use of capital within the group and limiting concentration risks at the group level.",5,226,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00226
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The FHC Bill is in line with international regulatory developments. Key international supervisory committees such as the Joint Forum have called for greater oversight of unregulated entities in financial groups, in particular the parent FHC. The IMF has also cited the limited legal authority over FHCs of cross sector financial groups as a weakness in some financial systems. Many regulators are therefore widening their scope of group-wide supervision to include FHCs, either directly through an FHC regulatory framework or indirectly through a regulated entity like a bank or insurance subsidiary. Australia, Canada and the US are among the countries that have established legal frameworks for FHCs. The EU is moving in the same direction of strengthening regulatory authority over their FHCs.",6,227,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00227

Unlike banks and insurance companies, an FHC is a non-operating holding company and will not engage in financial transactions directly with the public. It may also not be exposed to the same risks that a bank or insurance company may encounter in the course of business. In deciding which FHC to regulate, MAS will consider how the regulation of the FHC and its financial group can enhance the effectiveness of prudential oversight of the financial group.",11,232,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00232
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The Bill sets out the following criteria by which MAS will assess whether an FHC should be designated for regulation. First, MAS will regulate an FHC if it is the ultimate parent of a financial group with a bank or insurance subsidiary in Singapore. In such cases, MAS is the home supervisor of the financial group and has responsibility for group-wide supervision of the financial group. Second, there are FHCs that are themselves subsidiaries of a parent FHC or financial institution. For these intermediate FHCs, MAS will assess the importance of the FHC's bank or insurance subsidiary to Singapore's financial system or to the intermediate FHC group when deciding whether to regulate the FHC. For foreign-owned FHCs, an additional consideration would be the extent to which the parent holding company, incorporated overseas, is subject to effective group-wide supervision by its home supervisor. MAS will list the names of FHCs designated for regulation in an order published in the Gazette.",12,233,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00233

Hence, it is necessary to require shareholders with substantial or controlling interest in designated FHCs to obtain approval for their shareholding interest, just as the Banking Act and Insurance Act currently require for significant stakes in Singapore-incorporated banks or insurance companies. The shareholding and control thresholds at which approval will be required will be consistent with existing thresholds under the Banking Act and the Insurance Act. MAS will consider whether the shareholders are fit and proper and the nature of their likely influence over the conduct of the FHC when assessing applications for approval.",14,235,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00235

To achieve alignment in the regulatory approach towards financial groups, whether they are held under a bank, an insurance company or a designated FHC, regulatory requirements under the Banking Act and the Insurance Act will be mirrored in the FHC Bill where appropriate.

Mdm Speaker, following the Global Financial Crisis, the changes in the global financial landscape have been swift and active. In the West, many banks are deleveraging and shedding assets. In Asia, many banks are capitalising on domestic growth trends to grow their balance sheet.

2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Secondly, this theme on ""Smart Regulation"" should continue to guide the MAS as they prescribe prudential requirements to support the safety and soundness of the FHC group. These will include the requirements on minimum liquid assets as well as the extent of leverage assumed. Here, may I suggest less reliance on a ""strait jacket"" regulatory approach but a focus on risk-based supervision with regulatory methodologies that take into account, and are tailored to accommodate, the risk profile of the FHC under review.",6,247,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00247
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Thirdly, may I suggest that the Bill be cognisant of the fact that many FHCs operate under other jurisdictions, or they are already regulated. Many are also rated by international rating agencies. These rating agencies or rules promulgated by other jurisdictions already set expectations on permitted leverage and liquidity management. These should perhaps provide a good starting point for the MAS and it is important that these rules set are not, from the perspective of the FHC, inconsistent with those of other constituents. Level-playing field considerations should also be taken into account.",7,248,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00248
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, the Financial Holding Companies Act was publicly consulted, allowing all constituents to provide feedback. May I ask that the same consultative approach should continue when the MAS formulates subsequent rules and directives pursuant to this Act?",8,249,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00249
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"In conclusion, Singapore's value proposition as a premier international financial centre rests on our pillars of transparency, sustainability, stability and international competitiveness.

2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I welcome this Bill. It is a timely piece of legislation to support the growth, integrity and robustness of our financial sector. The justifications for regulating financial holding companies (FHCs) derive from the same need and imperative to regulate financial intermediaries directly.",1,251,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00251
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"The proposed legislation can provide for a more effective regulation of the financial sector, a vital part of our economy. Implicit in this Bill is the recognition that the regulation of banks and insurance companies as financial institutions is incomplete or inadequate. Indeed, we must assume that commonly controlled financial institutions will typically act in concert, with all the attendant challenges such as the need to preserve the solvency of the regulated entities, the need to prevent systemic disruptions through related entities acting in concert, and to prevent uncompetitive practices.",2,252,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00252
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"My interest in the Bill is not so much on the technical aspects. The Bill strikes me as being well drafted and comprehensive in its scope and coverage. Rather, my interest relates more to the guiding principles on regulating FHCs.",3,253,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00253
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),There are three areas of interest. The first revolves around the potential for regulatory gaps arising from overlapping or perhaps inconsistent regulatory structures as a consequence of FHCs having a presence in several jurisdictions. The second area coheres around how the proposed legislation would deal with variations in organisational form of FHCs. And the third area centres on the regulatory approach towards holding companies controlling different types of regulated entities. Let me deal with them in turn.,4,254,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00254
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"We should not be surprised that FHCs, local or foreign, will expand across jurisdictions. A basic assumption of holding company legislation is that regulatory controls of some sort must extend beyond the boundaries of regulatory entities and reach their corporate affiliates. Yet, international comity and the lack of enforcement reach require that laws with extra-territorial jurisdiction should be the exception rather than the rule.",5,255,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00255
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Let me illustrate with an example. If a holding company in country A acquires a regulated entity in Singapore, the logic of holding company regulation requires that regulatory authorities in country A concern themselves with the activities and conduct of the holding company in its home jurisdiction, country A. However, if Singapore's regulatory authorities apply our holding company laws to the said firm, the potential for overlapping and inconsistent regulatory structures arises.",6,256,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00256
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"If Singapore defers to country A's regulatory system, the supervision of the holding company may then be inadequate and the supervisory policies of Singapore may be undermined.",7,257,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00257
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Even if the differences in supervisory regimes are not substantial, Singapore-based financial institutions may well, understandably so, object to a more lenient regulatory regime for foreign-based holding companies. So, I think here is a question of whether the law is over-inclusive or under-inclusive.",8,258,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00258
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Madam, I acknowledge that such a ""regulatory gap"", if it can be described as such, is unavoidable. Perhaps, with time, harmonised systems of holding company regulation may evolve. Nonetheless, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister  how does the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) intend to deal with such regulatory gaps?",9,259,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00259
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Notwithstanding the limitations, the legal, political and practical problems of maintaining an effective system of holding company regulation in a multi-national global economy bear close watch. We must be mindful that FHCs may engage in ""regulatory arbitrage"" whereby FHCs seek out and take advantage of loopholes and differences in regulatory systems to avoid certain types of regulation.",10,260,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00260
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"In this connection, can I ask the Deputy Prime Minister what are the ballpark numbers on foreign and local FHCs that are likely to fall within the jurisdiction of the proposed law? I note that the law applies only to local FHCs.",11,261,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00261
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"In the second area relating to organisation forms, it is conceivable that, besides the traditional holding company structure, alternative organisational forms for a FHC are possible and likely. This could be in the form of affiliations through downstream subsidiaries, or expanded activities conducted within a single regulated entity, otherwise known as the universal banking model. Each organisational form presents different regulatory pressure points and concerns.",12,262,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00262
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"As such, I would like to ask  how does the proposed legislation deal with variations in organizational form of the FHCs? Can the proposed regulatory regime manage different types of organisational structures that FHCs are organised under?",13,263,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00263
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"The third broad area of interest relates to the appropriate regulation of financial holding companies with controlling interests in diverse regulated entities, such as banking, insurance, and securities. Where a holding company controls different types of regulated entities, two overlapping and potentially inconsistent systems of holding company regulation may well apply.",14,264,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00264
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"What legal rules should take precedence and apply in this context?

2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),Questions of fairness and efficiency and effectiveness naturally present themselves in such situations. Should we work towards a harmonised system of holding company regulation without also first making changes in the direct regulation of financial intermediaries?,16,266,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00266
2013-04-08-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Overall, this Bill adds to our regulatory arsenal. We should not be afraid of prudent and sensitive regulation given that there are many benefits for financial institutions operating in Singapore. I regard such regulation as being necessary if we are to ensure that our financial sector continues to inspire trust and confidence of all stakeholders. The Bill is, in my view, necessary to protect against anti-competitive harms and to ensure that there is systemic robustness in our financial institutions and financial system. Going forward, the ability of the MAS and other regulatory agencies to regulate with the right dose of prudence, firmness and integrity is vital. Madam, on that note, I support this Bill.",17,267,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00267
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Ms Tan Su Shan and Asst Prof Tan for their comments on the FHC Bill. Ms Tan referred to ""smart regulation"", or regulation that is no more burdensome than is necessary to achieve our regulatory objectives. That is indeed, as she mentioned, the MAS' approach and we will continue to take that approach. In other words, maintain high standards of regulation while ensuring that the application of regulation, be it liquidity requirements or leverage caps as she mentioned, is risk-appropriate, that is appropriate to the risks posed by the institution or the group and proportionate to those risks.",1,268,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00268
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The FHC framework was therefore designed such that FHCs in Singapore are not automatically subject to regulation. MAS will designate an FHC for regulation only where doing so can enhance the effectiveness of prudential oversight of the financial group. Let me explain further.,2,269,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00269
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Under international supervisory standards, the supervisor in the jurisdiction where the ultimate parent FHC is based is expected to carry out consolidated supervision of the financial group. MAS will therefore designate for regulation FHC of a financial group that is headquartered in Singapore. An example would be DBS Holdings Ltd.",3,270,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00270
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"By this same principle, the home supervisor of a parent group to which a foreign-owned FHC belongs is also expected to carry out consolidated supervision of its financial group, including the group's entities operating in Singapore. However, MAS may also designate a foreign-owned FHC in Singapore for regulation in two situations. The first situation is where the foreign bank or insurance company in Singapore is significant to our financial system. The second situation is where the bank or insurance subsidiary is significant to a subgroup of related companies, in other words, to an intermediate FHC group based in Singapore. MAS will designate such a foreign-owned FHC for regulation if doing so can enhance prudential oversight of the financial group and provide assurance to Singapore depositors or policy holders that potential intra-group risks posed to the Singapore bank or insurance company are adequately supervised.",4,271,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00271
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"With regard to Asst Prof Tan's question of how many FHCs we envisage being subject to regulation under the Bill, at this point in time, there are five FHCs that meet the criteria to be designated for regulation under the Bill. All five are FHCs of banking and insurance groups that are headquartered here.",5,272,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00272
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Ms Tan also commented on the need for consistency with international regulatory norms. That is key to MAS' approach. The FHC Bill is consistent with international regulatory developments on and standards for group supervision.,6,273,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00273
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Let me now address the specific areas raised by Asst Prof Tan and Ms Tan.,7,274,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00274
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Asst Prof Tan spoke about the possibility of ""overlapping regulation"" or ""regulatory gaps"" arising from differences in regulatory regimes in different jurisdictions. He gave the illustration of an overseas financial holding company in Country A, subject to Country A's regulation, which acquires a regulated entity in Singapore, subject to MAS' regulation.",8,275,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00275
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Let me explain how the regulatory regimes across jurisdictions interact. MAS will impose regulatory standards on the solo regulated entity in Singapore, which may be a bank or insurance company licensed under the Banking Act or Insurance Act. The foreign regulatory authority in Country A, the home jurisdiction, will exercise regulatory oversight over the FHC, including the regulated entity in Singapore, at the group consolidation level. So there is a division of responsibilities in the regulation of the solo entity and the regulation of the group.",9,276,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00276
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"There could indeed be overlapping regulation with regard to the regulated entity in Singapore due to MAS and the foreign regulatory authority addressing risks at different levels, namely the solo and the group levels.",10,277,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00277
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"However, in respect of the regulated entity in Singapore, MAS as host regulator would not defer to the foreign regulator with regard to the solo regulation of the bank or insurance company. The entity is subject to MAS' minimum regulatory standards. MAS' FHC regulations will nevertheless not apply to the FHC itself in this instance, as it is not incorporated in Singapore.",11,278,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00278
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Further, amongst banking and insurance regulators – and Asst Prof Tan rightly points to the potential for overlapping regulation or regulatory gaps − there are well-established principles for cross-border collaboration and cooperation, not perfect, but they are working principles, including information sharing, to facilitate effective group supervision of cross-border financial groups. In fact, this has been a very important emphasis, post-financial crisis – getting more effective, international collaboration for the supervision of cross-border and cross-sectoral financial groups. So, MAS will collaborate actively with its regulatory counterparts to ensure adequate supervision of the bank or insurance subsidiaries in Singapore.",12,279,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00279
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"I should add that MAS will also apply similar regulatory standards to solo entities in Singapore, regardless of whether the bank or insurance company is held by a holding company based in Singapore or overseas.",13,280,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00280
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Next, Asst Prof Tan also asked about how the proposed FHC Bill would deal with various organisational forms of financial groups. Related to this, Ms Tan had also commented on the need for a level playing field.",14,281,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00281
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The FHC Bill sets out MAS' regulatory approach and powers for financial groups that are organised under a non-operating FHC. As Asst Prof Tan mentioned, financial groups or downstream financial subsidiaries could also be held under a Singapore-regulated operating entity such as a bank or insurance company.",15,282,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00282
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Regardless of organisational forms, MAS, as the financial regulator, seeks to ensure a consistent regulatory approach. For example, a banking group organised under a non-operating FHC will be subject to rules at the group level that are consistent with rules that apply to a bank-held financial group regulated under the Banking Act. That is the basic principle. To achieve this, the regulatory requirements for a bank under the Banking Act are mirrored in the FHC Bill, where appropriate.",16,283,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00283
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Finally, Asst Prof Tan asked about the regulatory approach for FHCs of mixed groups; in other words, groups which operate businesses in more than one regulated sector, in particular in both banking and insurance. That is a good question. We will use a predominance test to assess whether at the group level, the FHC is principally engaged in banking or insurance business. An FHC group that is assessed to be predominately banking, for example, will be required to adhere to potential rules governing the banking sector at the group level, such as large exposure limits. In practice, the financial groups in Singapore are either predominantly banking or insurance. However, this could evolve over time and there could be hybrid groups where there may be more of a balance between banking and insurance. It is entirely possible. In all instances, MAS will assess the group in totality to obtain a holistic picture of its risks and determine the appropriate regulatory or supervisory treatment. So, it is not a binary treatment where it is either banking regulation or insurance regulation. There will be hybrids and we will have to look at the group in totality.",17,284,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00284
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"In summary, MAS has proposed a single piece of legislation, in the form of this FHC Bill, to strengthen MAS' prudential oversight of financial groups in Singapore. A single Bill to regulate all FHC group structures offers clarity and consistency, as far as is appropriate, in our regulatory approach to bank groups, insurance groups and mixed financial groups held under an FHC.",18,285,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00285
2013-04-08-T-012,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Going forward, MAS will formulate the detailed regulations to bring into operation the FHC Bill. And we will, as Ms Tan suggested, continue to, first, consult widely; and second, to ensure that we apply a risk-appropriate approach. Over the course of the past year, as I mentioned, we have consulted the industry on both the broad policy proposals as well as the draft Bill. And when it comes down to the detailed regulations, we will engage in more specific discussions with the lawyers, the individual institutions and all other stakeholders.",19,286,2013-04-08-T-012-S-00286

More recently, some developers have started to mark their units at a higher price, while offering significant discounts through rebates and other benefits such as furniture vouchers. Such inflated sale prices mask the real transacted prices and undermine transparency in the property market.",14,305,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00305
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan),"The proposed amendments will require developers to provide accurate information on residential transactions to the Controller of Housing in the same way they would to the Monetary Authority of Singapore for the purpose of loan applications. In other words, they will need to disclose any price discount, rebate, or any other benefit, including the reimbursement of any stamp duty or tax granted to home-buyers.",15,306,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00306
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan),"In addition, section 11 of the current Act will be amended to give the Controller of Housing legal power to collect and publish information on building projects, units sold and made available for sale by developers, and sales transactions. Data collected will be published in an aggregated fashion, as frequently as weekly, to aid home-buyers in timely decision-making.",16,307,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00307

2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan),"First, the amended section 7 will expand the grounds on which the Controller of Housing can revoke or suspend a licence. New grounds for revocation include the failure of the developer to furnish information concerning the development project, sale of the project and sales transactions. The amendments to section 25 will also debar persons who have been convicted of, or have served a sentence of imprisonment for, a fraud or dishonesty-related offence in or outside Singapore, from holding or continuing to hold responsible positions in a licensed housing developer for a period of five years.",18,309,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00309
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan),"Second, this Bill will require developers to make public their audited financial positions. Currently, section 10 of the Act requires a developer to publish its last audited balance-sheet and profit and loss account. This section will be amended to require a developer to submit its audited accounts and the report of its auditor to the Controller of Housing. In addition, the developer must allow the public to freely inspect the accounts and report for a period of 24 months either via the Internet or at its place of business.",19,310,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00310
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan),"Third, this Bill empowers the Minister to set rules regulating the marketing and promotion of residential units. This goes beyond the existing regulatory scope of advertisements. The new rule-making powers will allow us to regulate marketing and promotional activities across a variety of channels and platforms. They will also allow us to ensure that the marketing and prospective sale of residential properties are conducted in an orderly and transparent manner, with due regard for the interests of all buyers.",20,311,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00311
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan),"For instance, rules could be introduced to regulate the practice common among some developers to collect blank cheques from prospective buyers as a form of advance booking for a residential unit. Although developers will retain flexibility in their marketing and promotional activities, the new rules will empower the Minister to regulate such activities if there is a need to do so in the future.",21,312,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00312
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan),"Fourth, this Bill substantially increases the monetary penalties for non-compliance. For example, the maximum fine imposed on developers who fail to comply with any of the conditions laid out in their licences will be raised from $20,000 to $100,000; they could also be subject to an imprisonment term of up to three years.",22,313,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00313
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan),"Madam, we believe that this Bill is timely. A home is, in most cases, the single largest investment in one's lifetime. It is only right that home-buyers are provided with the appropriate tools and legal safeguards to make informed decisions. This Bill will also enhance the professionalism of the residential property industry. With that, Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.",23,314,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00314

2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I support this Bill. Given that land commands an exalted premium in Singapore, it is not surprising that residential property is not just what a typical Singaporean thinks of, it is also what he thinks with. Residential property, HDB or private, is the single largest asset for the vast majority of Singaporeans. HDB dwellers often aspire to upgrade to private housing. Private housing developers are very attuned to these upgrading aspirations and the fear factor among prospective buyers that characterises an exuberant private residential property market.",1,320,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00320
2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Many major life decisions are made with residential property being a key factor. For example, the location of one's residential property can be very much influenced by where one wants his children to be schooled. Courting couples often make the leap into a future together by first purchasing their matrimonial homes, often with the marriage proposals coming later!",2,321,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00321
2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"In short, we do not just think of property when purchasing a new home.

2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"The residential property market remains robust in my view, despite several rounds of cooling measures.

2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"As a result of the lucrative profits that can be made, housing developers often compete to out-do each other, sometimes through unscrupulous means, often at the expense of the eager but unsuspecting homebuyer. Advertisements are either economical with the relevant information or may even misrepresent. The truth will only be known when the homebuyers receive their keys and see their properties for the first time. By then, it is too late to back out.",5,324,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00324
2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"To be sure, there is the legal doctrine of caveat emptor. Although a buyer, whether of a piece of cake or a residential property, must be aware of he is getting into, it is also clear that property buyers need protection as consumers given the big-ticket item that a home purchase is. There must be responsibilities and duties that come with the privilege of being a licensed housing developer. Such a licence cannot be the fast lane to unscrupulous profit making.",6,325,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00325
2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"We often see advertisements of private residential developments surrounded by lush greenery, with the nearest residential development being some distance away.

2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Madam, developers should not be allowed to profit from deliberate inaccurate representation of the housing units available for sale. Further, given the information asymmetry that often exists between the buyer and housing developer, the information playing field should be made as level as possible so that prospective buyers can make informed decisions. Caveat emptor and consumer protection cannot operate if housing developers do not provide relevant information that is presented clearly, accurately and easily accessible.",9,328,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00328
2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"As such, I welcome clause 16 to empower the Minister to provide for the regulation of the display of show flats, with accuracy of representation being the desired goal. In May 2012, the Housing Developers Rules were amended to better protect home buyers by requiring developers to provide not just more but also accurate information such as the scaled location plans, unit floor plans and detailed breakdowns of a unit's floor area. This is to enable homebuyers to make better-informed decisions concerning a significant asset.",10,329,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00329
2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),This must be the key objective of the law before us today. Caveat emptor still applies but homebuyers should not have to navigate treacherous waters because of housing developers' penchant for varying formats and selectivity in presenting relevant information. Would the Senior Minister of State be able to elaborate on how his Ministry intends to more robustly enforce the law?,11,330,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00330
2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"In this regard, I welcome the various clauses in the Bill to require developers to provide more comprehensive and timely information to the public and the regulatory bodies.

2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"In particular, clause 19 of the Bill, which requires developers to lodge with URA information pertaining to the discounts provided for units sold, can give transparency a much-needed boost. Generally, clause 19 also enables URA to collect and publish more comprehensive and timely information on the transacted prices of private residential properties. Such information can help reduce the frenzy and fear factor that accompanies information gaps. In this regard, does the Ministry have any plans to make as much consolidated market information available freely as opposed to a fee-paying basis than what it is at the moment?",13,332,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00332
2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"The Government has a responsibility to ensure that the property market is not one denominated by the lack of information, allowing unscrupulous developers to prey on consumers, and to have prospective home buyers go into needless price bidding wars that only serve to power the over-exuberant property market.",14,333,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00333
2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"As the residential property market is likely to remain a sellers' market for the foreseeable future, the need to tighten the entry of housing developers is necessary. There should not be fly-by-night housing developers which are not interested in the industry as long-term players. Similarly, the residential property market demands that developers should not have directors who have been convicted of, or have served a sentence of imprisonment for a fraud or dishonesty offence in or outside of Singapore within a period of five years before the date of the housing developer licence application. It is better to be prudent in this regard.",15,334,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00334
2013-04-08-T-013,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Madam, the Bill provides for fines to have five-fold increase in quantum. I doubt that this will be sufficient to sustain the deterrent effect that the Bill seeks to endow in the regulatory framework. The quantum of fines still pales significantly when compared with the potential profits to be made. Can the Senior Minister of State provide the number of housing developers licences granted and revoked or not renewed in the last two decades? I believe the figures will demonstrate how lucrative it is to be a housing developer even on a one-off basis. I should add that there is nothing wrong with that except that the profits must be fairly earned and not derived through unethical means.",16,335,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00335

2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, allow me to declare my interest in this topic as a conveyancing lawyer and the President of the Consumers Association of Singapore. Every year, thousands of properties are sold by housing developers directly to purchasers. Except for shoe box units, most of these properties are sold at prices ranging from half a million to about $2 million to $3 million. For many buyers, it has been their lifelong aspiration to upgrade from living in HDB public housing to living in a private property with condominium facilities. It is also usually their largest financial commitment in their life. Many of my clients tell me that the cheque amount for payment to the developer is the largest amount cheque which they had signed.",1,339,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00339
2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Unfortunately, not every purchase of a private property from a housing developer ends with the happy fulfilment of their aspiration. Unlike the purchase of completed private properties, buyers from a housing developer do not get to see the physical structure of their property. They buy based on the layout plan in sales brochures and/or from seeing the layout in the developer's show flat.",2,340,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00340
2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I have received frequent feedback from buyers that after they collect the keys to their properties, they realise that the unit which they had bought look quite different from what they had seen in the developer's show flat. Buyers complain that the size of the flat look smaller because the flat which they bought would usually include a planter area and an air-con ledge. However, in the show flat, these areas may not be reflected in the show flat which makes the show flat look bigger.",3,341,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00341
2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"There are also some complaints that there were brick or structural walls in the actual flat but which had been cleverly hidden in the show flat design; and that the ceiling of the flat looks much higher giving the impression of a greater volume of the flat. Many show flats also do not show the doors to the room and how much is the required space to swing open the doors. Thus, what they see in the show flat may not be what the buyer actually gets when the buyer receives the keys.",4,342,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00342
2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The reality is that many property buyers do buy their properties based on what was represented to them in the show flats. As such, I support the proposed amendments at clause 19 of the Bill to empower the Minister to introduce rules and regulations to ensure that housing developers do not erect show flats in a manner that gives a false impression to buyers or to depict houses or flats with inaccurate information.",5,343,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00343
2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I also support the proposed amendments at clause 19 (d) of the Bill which is to empower the Minister to prescribe rules to regulate marketing activities of developers. In particular, I am concerned that some developers when advertising the location of their development would represent in the location maps that the development is situated much nearer to MRT stations or to other amenities and schools than they actually are. In other words, these developers take liberty with the location map. They shrink the distance from the MRT station or amenities to make it look nearer to the development. To me, such form of marketing is misrepresentation and should not be allowed and I understand that rules have been amended in 2012.",6,344,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00344
2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"There were also developers who had advertised that Phase 1 of the development has been fully sold out without stating how many units have been offered for sale in that particular Phase.

2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The Government should also disallow the current practise whereby estate agents deliberately queue at the launch of a new development to create the hype that there are many buyers wanting to purchase limited units in a development.

2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),I also urge the Government to ban the practice of allowing agents to collect blank cheques from potential buyers to buy a property. Such practice may result in market manipulation in that developers can set the price that they wish to sell since they already have a blank cheque in their hands. It may also lead to fraudulent behaviour by unscrupulous estate agents.,10,348,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00348

Whilst it may be argued that the grant of such rebates discounts or vouchers would benefit the consumer or the buyers, the fact is that such rebates in any form distorts the market. It means that any potential buyer would not be able to know what is the market price for the property, since he would not know the discount given to the previous buyer through such rebates or vouchers. Thus, I also support the proposal to regulate the grant of rebates or other benefits in this clause.",11,349,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00349

2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Currently, the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act provides that a licence is only required if a housing developer develops more than four units of housing accommodation. Thus, if a developer builds only four units of housing accommodation, he does not require a developer's licence and he is not subject to the regulations imposed under the Act. Would MND consider imposing the requirement for a housing developer's licence for any development of more than two units? This will reduce the risk of any buyer who buys a property from an unlicensed developer.",13,351,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00351
2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Next, in the prescribed sale and purchase agreement for a property subject to the Housing Developer's rules, there is a provision in the agreement that the developer has a margin of error of up to 3% in the actual area of a property for which the developer does not need to compensate the buyer. In view of the high prices of properties, would the Government be prepared to reduce the margin of error to 1% of the area of the property? Thus, if the actual area of the property is smaller by more than 1% of the area stated in the sales and purchase agreement, the developer would have to compensate the buyer.",14,352,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00352
2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Next, would the Government also consider excluding the unusable areas like planter box or air-con ledge in the computation of the area sold by the developer?

2013-04-08-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Finally, if I may ask the Senior Minister of State, what is the intent of the Government in deciding to delete section 22(2)(b) of the Act?

2013-04-08-T-013,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"I have heard recently from several friends and acquaintances that the developers have now become very innovative in marketing their new launches. I was told that they will advertise that a particular flat is, say, 1,400 sq ft, for example. But when they view the property, they realise that it does not seem as big as 1,400 sq ft. When they probe, they are then reluctantly told by the marketing or the sales agent that the 1,400 sq ft size includes the bay windows, balcony, the access area, and in one case, I was even told that the personalised parking lot was included. I stand corrected. So, in effect, the property size was much smaller.",2,356,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00356
2013-04-08-T-013,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"For such misrepresentation of details, we must take the developers and the marketers to task so that potential buyers know exactly what they are getting themselves into and are not misled by such jargons. Given the high property costs in Singapore now, we do not want buyers here to spend through their noses and not receive the accurate value for what they think they are buying or paying for.",3,357,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00357
2013-04-08-T-013,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"The same goes with the show flats that developers put up. I have heard that the developers have many tricks up their sleeves and employ them to make the show flats look much bigger and nicer than what the actual property looks like or comes with. In other words, in many instances, the show flat is an illusion. Such tricks include higher ceilings and mirrored walls to make the apartment look much more spacious than it actually is, or lavish fixtures and fittings to make the property look much more appealing. I think we should mandate that the developers do not use these tricks any more. Show flats should be mandated to look as close as possible to the eventual product sold to the customer. I hope the Minister will take this into account when deciding the specifications of the show flats for developers. Overall, I am happy that this Bill includes provisions that will help developers play a fair game with potential buyers.",4,358,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00358

Yes, we recognise that the Bill is taking the necessary steps to protect buyers and even the developers in some cases of potential fraud. But to specifically assume that an ex-convict guilty of fraud offences is likely to do so is I feel unfair and playing to stereotypes.",5,359,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00359
2013-04-08-T-013,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"We must remember that the ex-convicts, when released into society, sometimes struggle to earn equivalent jobs again in our society. Especially those who were convicted of white collar crimes and are educated may not be able to find professional jobs again and may have to settle for odd jobs or low-skilled jobs to earn their living. For many, jobs in such sales positions may be a second chance to earning a decently paid job again and we should not close that door on them. I fear that after this Bill is passed with these provisions, developers may on the whole not hire ex-convicts at all, in the fear of running afoul of the law. That would be sad, as we should do all we can for the convicts to assimilate back into society.",6,360,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00360
2013-04-08-T-013,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"I must make an appeal that the authorities do not take a harsh stance on associations in this regard. In some communities in Singapore, some of the places of worship and some of the important community social organisations are registered as associations due to historical reasons. It is important for some of these organisations to develop their own property either for operational or administrative use or to raise revenue. So, in this context, requiring them to have prior paid-up capital may not be possible for such associations and they may still be fund raising from their members to develop the property. I hope the Minister will look into associations, therefore, on a case-by-case basis and not unduly penalise the ones who are not-for-profit and are important components of our social fabric. On the whole, Mdm Speaker, I support this Bill.",7,361,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00361
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. Many agents sell properties based on three reasons  location, location and location. But for many buyers, the decision to buy a property should be based on what is inside the unit, what is outside the unit and what is surrounding the unit.",1,362,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00362
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Let me share the experiences of my residents at a Design, Build and Sell Scheme project in Ang Mo Kio, feedback from others and my own visits to many show units recently.",2,363,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00363
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, let the show units accurately reflect the space inside the unit as well as what is available inside. Many were frustrated that their kitchen, living room and bedroom appeared smaller when they moved in. In some cases, show units that they visited had interior designs that gave the illusion that it will be spacious, similar to the point mentioned by the hon Member Mr Lim Biow Chuan earlier.",3,364,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00364
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Amendments to the regulations in 2012 requiring that developers indicate accurate to scale floor dimensions is a step in the right direction. But that is not enough to achieve ""what you see is what you get"". For example, one will notice that many show units do not come with doors. Upon collecting their keys, some were appalled that they could not even open the door to the toilet without it banging against the toilet seat. A resident showed me in his new flat how he could not open the door to his wardrobe after he put in his bed. He had to change the door to a sliding one because the design had not catered for that.",4,365,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00365
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Perhaps we can expand the regulations. When we visit a show unit, we should be able to see what we will be getting upon making a purchase. For instance, any walls that may have been removed for interior design needs should be accurately reflected in the show units, including the thickness of the wall on the floor and not just a solid line on the floor. I also hope that, in future, doors will be installed in show units as well.",5,366,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00366
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Secondly, let us move to what is outside the unit. In the past, residents were not informed by the developer regarding the dimensions of the balcony, aircon ledge and planter box. It was only until they moved in and did a physical measurement that they realised the dimensions of these areas. In fact, a floor area of 1,200 sq ft could have up to 100 sq ft of space occupied by these features, a point made in an article in today's The Straits Times Forum Page that indicate that the recent change of such a regulation is in the right direction because now consumers know what they are getting into and the developers are required to indicate what are the sizes of these areas.",6,367,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00367
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"However, many continue to be unaware of the restriction concerning what they can do with the balcony area or planter box area. Some thought they can install full-height windows but did not know they were not allowed to. However, it was shown in the show units that it was there although it was for display purposes only. They now have to pay money to uninstall what they have installed. Developers should make it clear, not only in bold print in their collateral but also at show units that such fixtures are not allowed. It is not viable for residents to have to separately check with HDB, URA and BCA on the various restrictions.",7,368,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00368
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Thirdly, let us look at what is surrounding the unit. Some residents who bought units next to vacant land were upset when they found out that new Build-to-Order flats or new institutions would be constructed next to their blocks after they have moved in. They shared that the developer had not indicated any new residential development on that particular plot of land in the collateral. Instead, the artist's impressions showed the development set amidst lush greenery and even omitted some other existing flats. I reviewed some of the old brochures that they shared with me and it clearly showed unobstructed views.",8,369,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00369
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"In fact, a staff from the developer informed me and the residents that all land use plans are available from URA, and buyers can go down to Maxwell Road to do their own checks to find out what are the actual plans around the development and to go to the Internet to check what ""plot ratio"" means. Yes, the onus is on the buyer to do his or her own checks before making a purchase. However, many lack the awareness and know-how to go about doing so. Some of the artist's impression drawings can often be misleading.",9,370,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00370
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I am glad that the Ministry has addressed some of these concerns in last year's changes to the regulations. I would like to propose that developers show accurate spatial distance between existing and to-be-constructed new buildings and land use plan. This should cover a 2-km radius around the housing development which is put up on sale. This 2-km radius is similar to the Primary 1 registration Phase 2C coverage because they specifically, in their marketing collateral, promote that as an attractive option. Whether there will be an educational institution, condominium or religious institution nearby should be made known to the buyers. Many developers are only keen to show shopping malls, schools and facilities.",10,371,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00371
2013-04-08-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Finally, the amendment to the Bill to improve quality of information given by the developers to the buyers is timely. One area which is not currently addressed is the information given by property websites. Many such sites have popped up recently and many buyers are turning to them for reference. Moving forward, I hope that the Ministry can look into ensuring that any representation or reproduction of housing accommodation and land use featured by these websites is accurate. Of course, there are many challenges dealing with property websites, but I believe this is an area which will be increasingly important. Madam, with that, I support the Bill.",11,372,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00372
2013-04-08-T-013,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, I declare my interest as a bank employee. Mdm Speaker, I support the objective of the Bill which provides additional safeguards in two ways, namely, improving quality of information and enhancing governance of developers to home buyers and better protection of their interests by ensuring that the Act remains relevant and effective in light of industry developments and dynamic property market trends.",1,373,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00373
2013-04-08-T-013,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I noted the Bill will provide four areas of improvement  showflats, information of sale transactions, marketing activities and disclosure of financial status. Accurate and timely information on market values of homes is important to buyers. Inflated sale prices can mislead buyers and undermine market transparency and lead to distortions of the home market. Hence, it is important that full disclosure and publication of all rebates, discounts and other benefits, whether directly or indirectly granted by developers, should be made known to the home buyers, and such information should not be wilfully withheld by developers. Such benefits should include legal and valuation subsidies, whether in part or in full, by third-party, including financial institutions.",2,374,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00374
2013-04-08-T-013,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Developers shall also make known to the public the total number of units that have been sold to the inter-related parties, such as directors, their immediate families and business associates, to ensure transparency of sales information. In addition, there have been public criticisms over questionable practices, for example, collecting blank cheques in advance, paying people to queue outside showflats to create hype, and misrepresentations of sales bookings and so on.",3,375,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00375
2013-04-08-T-013,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"While the Bill is set up to address these issues and inject new rules to regulate irregular marketing activities, they may be administratively difficult or challenging to enforce, thus resulting in ineffectiveness of enforcement action. It is always a question of balancing between rigidity and practicality. Nevertheless, having a robust market regulating framework is key to ensuring an orderly and transparent market for the benefit of buyers and maintaining public confidence in the housing market.",4,376,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00376
2013-04-08-T-013,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"While the developers and their marketing agents have been focusing on the distinct features and attractiveness of the project site, including proximity to amenities and facilities, such as popular schools and shopping, it may be prudent for the developer to adopt a balanced and objective approach in his publication of sales information to highlight the potential trade-offs arising from being close to such facilities, such as schools and shopping malls, as these areas could produce noise and heavy traffic congestion.",5,377,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00377
2013-04-08-T-013,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),There has been a mandatory requirement for financial institutions to ensure investors are aware of the prevailing and investment risk factors so that investors can make informed decisions. I hope a similar practice could be encouraged to minimise unnecessary and undesirable disputes between buyer and developer and its marketing agent.,6,378,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00378
2013-04-08-T-013,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, property purchases require radically larger financial commitments from buyers. The financial health of developers is paramount and is important information to home buyers. The Bill that requires the developer to submit audited accounts for the financial year and auditors' report as opposed to the present requirements that require the developer to publish the last audited balance sheet and profit and loss account is only welcomed by home buyers. This will help facilitate more prudent decision-making by potential home buyers. This will instill discipline in developers to ensure a clean bill of health that will serve home buyers' interests.",7,379,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00379
2013-04-08-T-013,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"However, there is a need to provide better clarity to the rules. A special purpose vehicle is usually set up by the developer to undertake a property development. Therefore, home buyers should be allowed to have access to the audited accounts and auditors' report of the ultimate holding company or the developer company to have a more complete picture of the overall health of the developer. In the absence of holding-subsidiary relationship, perhaps the developer could provide a bank confirmation that the shareholder has the financial means to ensure the completion of the development.",8,380,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00380
2013-04-08-T-013,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, I appreciate the Ministry's efforts to consult the public, real estate professional bodies and consumer associations regarding the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) (Amendment) Bill. In conclusion, I think the refinements are in the right direction. They will improve the quality of information and resources to the public so that it enables home buyers to make better informed and more prudent decisions. Secondly, they will enhance the governance of developers to ensure they carry out business activities in ways that best serve the public interest. The Bill injects greater rigour in accepting and assessing licence applications. Sales suspensions and revocations of licence are good deterrence for errant developers. With that, I support the Bill.",9,381,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00381

2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Many of the suggestions raised by the Members relate to the provisions we can include under the Housing Developers Rules and not so much the Act per se. So, let me assure the House that we will take these views into account as we embark on the changes to the Housing Developers Rules, following the passage of this Bill.",2,383,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00383
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Let me also respond to the various points raised one by one. Asst Prof Tan, Mr Lim, Mr Dhinakaran and Mr Ang suggested that showflats be better-regulated. We agree and are, therefore, prescribing showflats as an area in which the Minister shall be empowered by this amendment Bill to make precise rules. While we have yet to finalise all the new rules, we have thought about a number of areas which we intend to tighten up. For instance, we intend for all structural and external walls to be erected in the showflat, in the same thickness as the final product. All ""add-ons"", such as furnishings, finishes and interior fittings, must be duly labelled and made known to the buyers. The Controller of Housing will also be granted investigative and enforcement powers to enter and even close show flats if serious breaches are discovered.",3,384,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00384
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mr Lim asked if the Government would consider reducing the margin of error, as stipulated in the prescribed sale and purchase agreement, from 3% to 1% of the area of the property. This provision of a margin for error exists as variations in floor area could arise due to construction difficulties or the use of different construction methods. Our view is that this plus or minus 3% could be reviewed in the future if technology allows for more accurate construction methods. We have received very few complaints on this matter over the past 10 years.",4,385,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00385
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"With regard to Mr Lim's suggestion on the exclusion of unusable areas such as planter boxes and air-conditioner ledges, in the computation of the area sold by the developer, we do not think it is necessary to do so now. Today, developers are already required to indicate on the plans and in the showroom the exact dimensions of such ancillary spaces so that buyers can make informed purchasing decisions. Although these areas are perceived to be less useable, they are, nonetheless, functional spaces which constitute a residential unit and it is the responsibility of home owners to maintain them. As such, these areas should still be computed as part of the strata area of a unit. Even if developers were required to exclude such areas from the computation of prices, they could compensate for this by marking up the average per-square-foot price of other parts of the unit.",5,386,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00386
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mr Lim also urged the Government to disallow some of the practices of real estate agents, such as the deliberate forming of queues at the launch of a new development, as well as the collection of blank cheques from potential buyers to buy a property. For a start, the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) is already working with the relevant Government agencies and the real estate industry to set guidelines on the collection and proper use of cheques. We have also made provisions in this Bill and will monitor the situation before assessing if further regulatory safeguards are needed.",6,387,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00387
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mr Ang has called for greater regulation of property websites which may provide inaccurate information to the public. He has also called for more information to be supplied to buyers on the developments, features and amenities in the vicinity of the housing project, a point echoed by Mr Lim as well. These are suggestions that we will consider as we refine the Housing Developers Rules with the passage of this Bill.",7,388,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00388
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,Asst Prof Tan has asked if we will make as much market information freely available to the public without the need to pay a fee. I wish to inform the House that comprehensive real estate market information is already provided free-of-charge to the public on URA's website. Such information is also provided through mobile Apps made available by URA which home-buyers can download free-of-charge if they want to access information on-the-go. This Bill will enable us to enhance the existing information to be provided and to do so in a more frequent and timelier manner.,8,389,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00389
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mr Lim asked for the rationale behind the deletion of section 22(2)(b) of the Act. We have deleted this clause as the function of regulating names of buildings and estates is now under the Street and Building Names Board. Since April 2010, the Urban Redevelopment Authority has taken over the secretariat functions of the Board. So, names of housing developments should still have to be approved by this Board.",9,390,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00390
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,Asst Prof Tan suggested that the Bill can go further to provide the Minister and/or Controller of Housing with more power to make rules so as to promptly respond to rapidly changing market practices that attempt to tilt the playing field to the disadvantage of home-buyers.,10,391,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00391
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mdm Speaker, the approach we are taking with this Bill is a balanced and fair one. We fully recognise how dynamic the private property market is. Hence, it is important for us to be nimble in the face of new concerns and problems which may arise now and in the future. This Bill already empowers us to make rules in several key areas, if and when necessary. So, I thank Asst Prof Tan for his suggestion.",11,392,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00392

2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mr Lim asked if the Act could be extended to impose the requirement for a housing developer's licence for any development of more than two units. This is, indeed, an issue we are looking into. However, we will need more time to fine-tune the implementation details to ensure that small developers are not over-burdened by new requirements, without compromising the protection extended to home-buyers. We will consider this in a future round of the amendment of the Act. Suffice to say, on average, less than 1% of our development comprises five units or less.",13,394,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00394
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Asst Prof Tan has also asked for the number of licences granted and revoked or not renewed. I would first like to clarify that a licence for each project undertaken by a developer is valid until the project is completed. There is, therefore, no renewal of licences involved. Since 2000, some 6,800 licences have been granted to developers. Of these, there has, so far, been no licence revoked but there have been a small number of cases in which the Controller of Housing has disallowed developers from selling units off-plan. I believe this attests to the overall professionalism of the industry.",14,395,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00395
2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Asst Prof Tan and Mr Lim are of the view that the increased fines are still not hefty enough and may not be a sufficient deterrent to the cash-rich developers. I understand their concerns if fines are the only deterrents developers are liable to.

2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"For example, the Controller of Housing can prohibit a developer from marketing and selling homes until all units are fully completed. This applies not only to the project in question, but also on the developer's future projects. Developers' revenue inflows will be severely constricted as they cannot rely on instalment payments received during the construction process to fund development of the project. There is also the negative impact on the developer's reputation amongst would-be buyers. A developer also risks affecting his track record, which is a key assessment criterion for future licence applications.",16,397,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00397

2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mr Dhinakaran commented that there is an over-generalisation of former convicts in this Bill. Let me clarify that the Bill does not permanently prohibit companies from hiring ex-offenders. Instead, the Bill imposes a five-year debarment period during which ex-offenders cannot take up responsible positions in a licensed firm. This approach is consistent with the disqualification for persons convicted of fraud and dishonesty-related offences from holding company directorships under the Companies Act.",18,399,2013-04-08-T-013-S-00399

2013-04-08-T-013,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mdm Speaker, let me conclude by saying that the Bill is not a short-term response to the current state of the private residential property market. It is a timely and necessary exercise to enhance the administration of the Controller of Housing function and ensure that the Act remains relevant and effective. It seeks to protect buyers of uncompleted private properties by stipulating greater clarity in product information and developers' obligations in marketing and transaction. Our developers here have largely been responsible and professional in their dealing and, with this Bill, we hope we will raise the professionalism and efficient working of the industry.

2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"First, the Bill introduces new leave benefits in the form of paternity leave and shared parental leave to encourage fathers to play a bigger role in bringing up their children. Second, the enhancement of existing childcare leave and adoption leave. These are to better help working parents manage work and family commitments. Third, we will enhance maternity benefits to better support working mothers whose employment arrangements make them ineligible for maternity leave today. Finally, we will extend protection for working mothers against dismissal without sufficient cause and retrenchment, to cover the full term of pregnancy.",5,411,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00411
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mdm Speaker, fathers play an important role in raising children. To encourage fathers to take on shared parenting responsibility, the Government is introducing one week of Government-paid paternity leave and one week of Government-paid shared parental leave. Both leave types are subject to a reimbursement cap of $2,500 per week. We wish that all fathers will make good use of all these leave schemes for their families.",6,412,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00412
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"All lawfully married natural and adoptive fathers are eligible for paternity leave. The natural father must have served an employer for at least three months immediately preceding the child's birth. In line with maternity leave, the fathers can consume paternity leave in a block within 16 weeks after the child's birth. If there is mutual agreement between the employer and employee, paternity leave can be consumed flexibly within 12 months from the child's birth.",7,413,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00413
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),Shared parental leave is contingent upon the mother being eligible for 16 weeks of maternity leave. The eligible mother can choose to allocate one week of shared parental leave to the father. This can be done on a new Shared Parental Leave Allocation System available on the Central Provident Fund Board website.,8,414,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00414
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Employers can also log into the system to check on their employees' maternity leave or shared parental leave entitlement. To give certainty to employers, the allocation of shared parental leave, once done, cannot be changed. The only exception is if the father's employment is terminated before he has consumed the allocated leave, in which case, the leave will be returned to the mother. As couples can allocate the shared parental leave within the child's first year, they should have sufficient time to decide on the arrangements.",9,415,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00415
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"I now come to the second part. Let me elaborate on the enhancement of existing leave schemes. In 2008, we increased childcare leave from two days to six days per parent per year, to better support working parents in taking care of young children under the age of seven. Recognising that parents also need time away from work to see to the needs of their children in Primary school, the Government will extend two days of childcare leave to parents of Singapore citizen children aged seven to 12 years.",10,416,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00416
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"To be eligible, parents must have served their employer for at least three months. Each parent will be able to take two days of childcare leave per year, subject to an overall cap of 12 days over the six years between the child's seventh to twelfth year. The leave is fully paid by the Government, subject to a cap of $500 per day. If a couple has children in both age groups, that is, below seven years and seven to 12 years, an overall cap of six days of childcare leave per parent per year applies.",11,417,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00417
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"We are also enhancing the Adoption Leave. In 2004, the Government introduced voluntary Government-paid adoption leave. Employers who grant adoption leave to female employees who adopt a child below the age of 12 months could receive salary reimbursement for up to four weeks. With effect from 1 May this year, the four weeks of adoption leave will be made a statutory provision for adoptive mothers who have served their employer for at least three months. The payment for the four weeks of leave will be subject to a cap of $10,000.",12,418,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00418
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"We have also made changes to provide more time for mothers to take adoption leave. Currently, adoption leave can only be taken after the court appoints the Director of Social Welfare as Guardian-in-adoption of the child, or when the dependant's pass has been issued. With effect from 1 May this year, adoptive mothers can take adoption leave earlier, from the date the adoptive mother applies to the court to adopt a local child, or, in the case of a foreign child, when the adoptive mother receives in-principle approval for a dependant's pass. Adoption leave can also be taken within the child's first 12 months, instead of within six months previously. All the above arrangements will apply to paternity leave for adoptive fathers.",13,419,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00419
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),As we are granting adoption leave ahead of the court's issue of the Adoption Order; we have included provisions for the Government to recover the paid adoption leave and paternity leave benefits in the event that the Adoption Order is not issued within one year from the adoption application or the in-principle issuance of the dependant's pass; or if the child does not obtain citizenship within six months from the Adoption Order.,14,420,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00420
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Shared parental leave, paternity leave, adoption leave and extended childcare leave will apply to self-employed mothers and fathers as well. These parents would need to be engaged in their trade, business, profession or vocation for at least three months, except when consuming shared parental leave.",15,421,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00421
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"While not part of the M&P package, we have taken this opportunity to extend some leave benefits under the Child Development Co-savings Act to never-married single parents. As announced in my Ministry's Committee of Supply session, we will extend the childcare leave and unpaid infant care leave to unwed single parents with effect from 1 May, if they have a Singaporean Citizen child and served an employer for at least three months. This move is in line with my Ministry's efforts to enhance support for vulnerable families, of which single parent families are one such group.",16,422,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00422
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"The third aspect of the Bill is provisions to provide maternity support to more working women. Today, some do not qualify for any maternity leave due to their employment arrangements. These could be women who have worked for some time, but their contracts expire before the delivery of the child. They could also include women who are on multiple short-term contracts.",17,423,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00423
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"With the new Government-paid Maternity Benefit (GPMB) scheme, they will now enjoy the Government-paid share of maternity leave in the form of a cash benefit. They are eligible if their total employment or self-employment duration is at least 90 days in the 12 months preceding delivery. Mothers can receive the GPMB for births on or after 1 January this year.",18,424,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00424
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"The mother will receive eight weeks, or 56 days, of GPMB for her first or second child, or 16 weeks, or 112 days, for her third and subsequent child. GPMB will be based on the average income earned over the 12-month period preceding birth. Mothers who have worked for longer periods before giving birth will receive a higher benefit. The GPMB is capped at $10,000 for every 28 days.",19,425,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00425
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Generally, a working woman cannot receive both maternity leave and GPMB. The only exception to this is if a mother's contract ends before she could fully consume her maternity leave. In such cases, the mother can receive GPMB in addition to the maternity leave, such that she receives paid maternity benefits of up to eight weeks for the first or second child, and 16 weeks for the third or subsequent child. This ensures that the mothers whose contract expires before or after delivery can receive equivalent paid maternity benefits.",20,426,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00426
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Let me emphasise that the GPMB is not to replace the paid maternity leave. For the majority of women, they remain employed after child-birth and continue to benefit from the normal maternity leave provision.",21,427,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00427
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"This brings me to the fourth aspect of this Bill, which is ensuring that mothers are better protected from being denied their maternity leave benefits due to termination of employment. The Bill has extended the protection period for pregnant employees. From 1 May 2013, pregnant employees who have served an employer for at least three months and obtained a doctor's certification of pregnancy prior to the notice of dismissal will be protected against dismissal without sufficient cause, or retrenchment, throughout their pregnancy. This means that employers will be required to compensate or reinstate pregnant employees with their full maternity leave benefits, if employers dismiss pregnant employees without sufficient cause or retrench them.",22,428,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00428
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"This is an enhancement to the existing provisions, where pregnant employees' rights to maternity leave benefits are only protected during the three months preceding delivery for retrenchments, and six months preceding delivery for dismissals without sufficient cause. The Bill makes such provisions through related amendments to the Employment Act, which also applies to the maternity leave provisions under the Child Development Co-Savings Act.",23,429,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00429
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"MOM has also reviewed the offences and penalties provisions to ensure that employers do not deny their employees their leave benefits. The changes bring the associated penalties for employers who fail to grant or pay for the various statutory leave schemes in the Child Development Co-Savings Act, in line with other employment offences in the Employment Act. Employers who commit an offence in relation to the various leave schemes can be penalised with a fine of up to $5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months. For repeat offences, the penalty is a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months.",24,430,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00430
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),The maternity leave and childcare leave provisions are under both the Child Development Co-Savings Act and Employment Act. Any maternity leave or childcare leave offence on or after 1 May 2013 under one Act will be considered in determining if an offence is a repeat offence in the other Act.,25,431,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00431
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"In formulating the enhancements, the Government has consulted the Tripartite partners and other stakeholders extensively. Whilst providing working parents with more leave entitlements to help them better balance work and family commitments, it is important to ensure that employers' concerns over the impact on business costs and operations are also taken into consideration, so as to mitigate any adverse effects on the employability of the parents. Hence, the new leave schemes, namely, paternity leave, shared parental leave, the two-day extended childcare leave and adoption leave, are all fully Government-paid. Before going on leave, employees should work out with their employers arrangements that best meet the needs of both parties while minimising disruptions to business operations.",26,432,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00432
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"The Bill is scheduled to come into effect on 1 May. Notwithstanding, the Government will reimburse employers who voluntarily grant their employees the extended childcare, paternity and shared parental leave schemes from 1 January this year, even before the enhancements are made mandatory through legislation. This is to encourage employers to be generous and start granting the leave benefits early.",27,433,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00433
2013-04-08-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mdm Speaker, encouraging marriage and parenthood is an important and worthwhile goal for Singapore. It is also one in which Government legislation alone cannot accomplish. And let me conclude this portion by urging all employers and the community to not only embrace the new measures but also do their own part to create a more positive environment for marriage, parenthood and family life. It is through a whole-of-society effort that we can make Singapore A Great Place for Families. Madam, I beg to move.",28,434,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00434

2013-04-08-T-014,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill. The amendments contained in this Bill are of immense importance nationally as it helps address a persistent problem that has been affecting our country for a number of years. And if not addressed, the issue of low birth rate may continue to undermine nationhood and economic growth in Singapore going forward.",1,436,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00436
2013-04-08-T-014,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"I would like to make some key points on this Bill that I feel are relevant. Employers here have generally been accepting and supportive of the measures that the Government has announced in encouraging a more flexible work arrangement and even to increase the paid maternity and paternity leave for parents. We must be cautious that in trying to entrench some of these measures in legislation through this Bill, that we do not make it too onerous or unnecessarily burden employers with the mandated measures. What I really mean is that while we proceed with these measures and hope that they result in the desired effect, we must ensure that employers receive adequate protection. I am encouraged that the Government has taken responsibility of bearing the costs of the mandated leave but there are other costs that employers may be exposed to.",2,437,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00437
2013-04-08-T-014,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Chief among these is the possibility of employers being misled or misinformed on information from employees on these measures. I would like to suggest that since we have enforced in this Bill that errant employers be taken to task, a similar mechanism should also be enshrined for errant employees. Hence, if any employee is found to be supplying inaccurate or misleading information, there should be mandated penalties for this errant employee in respect of this Act. Such strong penalties will deter employees from going down this road in the first place and also protect the employers from incurring such unnecessary costs. With these mechanisms in place, I am sure that the confidence in these pro-parenthood measures will be preserved and kept high.",3,438,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00438
2013-04-08-T-014,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"But I recognise that confidence has been kept from both sides and that adequate and equal effort should be made that both employers and employees are protected. To uphold the sanctity of these pro-parenthood measures, I suggest that it is important to not only promote transparent practices and ethical and accurate representation, but also to encourage red-flagging contrary practices. But for this to happen, there must be clearer protection of those who come forward to report such deviances.",4,439,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00439
2013-04-08-T-014,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"What I am asking for is a clear whistle-blower mechanism which will protect those who dare come forward that these policies are not being adhered to or abused. For instance, should an employer not be practising these measures and unfairly deprive its employee of these privileges, the question still remains if the employer will be reported to the Government. Will the employee concerned or someone associated with the company risk losing his job in reporting this incident? If there is a whistle-blower policy, then those who surface such deviant practices will have more confidence in coming forward.",5,440,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00440
2013-04-08-T-014,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Similarly, if an employee is misrepresenting information and abusing the pro-parenthood privileges accorded to an employee, then he or she should be reported. But will any colleague, relative or friend come forward knowing that it may jeopardise his or her relationship with the alleged employee? If there was a clear whistle-blower policy which protected their identities, I think transparency will be better achieved and, hopefully, create a strong deterrent against deviations in the first place. I feel such a step will help protect the sanctity of the pro-parenthood measures and help achieve their intended outcomes.",6,441,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00441
2013-04-08-T-014,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"It is important that we recognise that these measures are done to help prop up birth rates in Singapore. It is hoped that some of these initiatives, particularly allowing parents to spend more time with their young children while still receiving an income, will help encourage them to take a step forward in starting or expanding their families.",7,442,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00442
2013-04-08-T-014,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"While we try to entrench some of these measures into our legislation, I hope we also recognise that more can be done to achieve greater results in this regard. Take adoption, for example. I applaud the Government as it has decided that parents who adopt will also be accorded maternity leave, although for a shorter period. Nevertheless, this is a step in the right direction.",8,443,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00443
2013-04-08-T-014,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"However, this Bill suggests that the maternity and paternity leave be allowed in the first 12 months from the date of the birth of the child. I would like to point out that for an adopted child, some adaptation needs to be allowed here. For starters, not all parents may adopt children at the time of their birth. It could be possible that the parent adopts the child when the baby is already many months old, possibly even a year old. The parents who do so will be excluded from maternity or paternity leave since they have already passed the 12-month criteria. And if this is, indeed, an important determinant, it would push adoption demand for newly born babies and perhaps result in older babies being neglected by potential adopting parents.",9,444,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00444
2013-04-08-T-014,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"I think we need to appreciate that regardless of when the baby is born, any parent adopting a child will need to spend some time with the child to familiarise and acclimatise the child to new surroundings and build new bonds. So, my suggestion is that if the parents adopt a child of up to two years old, meaning the child is still an infant, then the parents be allowed to take their maternity and paternity leave not in the 12 months from the date of birth of the child, but in the 12 months from the date of adoption of the child. For parents adopting children of more than two years old, perhaps the maternity and paternity leave can be reduced and it can also enforce its criteria to be in the 12 months within the adoption of the child. Adoption is, indeed, one alternative source of expanding families in Singapore, particularly for those who are unable or unwilling to use traditional or medical conception methods. So, we should facilitate adoption and not keep the door only half open.",10,445,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00445

But it will take more than the proposed changes in the Bill before us today to create a genuinely pro-family environment in Singapore. Ultimately, all stakeholders need to see that a pro-family environment is to their advantage, whether it is the Government, business or society.

This introduction of shared parental leave provides for a working father to share one week of the mother's 16 weeks of maternity leave, subject to certain requirements. This provision of shared parental leave is significant and reinforces section 46 of our Women's Charter (Cap 353), which was remarkably innovative when the Charter was first enacted more than 50 years ago in September 1961. As a society, we seem not to give sufficient recognition to section 46(1) of the Charter which states  ""Upon the solemnisation of marriage, the husband and the wife shall be mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union and in caring and providing for the children."" Section 46(4) of the Charter reinforces the theme of equality in a family unit.

Therefore, given the differential entitlements where leave is concerned for natural and adoptive parents, are we sending the signal that an adopted child is valued less, or that adoption is not encouraged?",12,458,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00458

While not under the ambit of the Bill before us today, we cannot avoid the issue of unwed mums and the reality of the Child Development Account (CDA), which is under the purview of this Act.

Further, the Child Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA) seeks to ensure that such Credits are used in ways that would directly benefit the child.",13,459,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00459

2013-04-08-T-014,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"The challenge pivots on how the state can uphold this policy without discriminating against children born to unwed mothers. These children did not choose to be born. These children are Singaporeans as well – they have a stake in Singapore, and we have a stake in their well-being.

Unwed mothers also do not receive the Baby Bonus cash gift of $6,000 and the Government's co-matching contribution of up to $6,000 in the Child Development Account (CDA).

Why not take the next logical step of equalising the remaining parenthood benefits? Equalising benefits for unwed mothers helps not just the mother but her child as well.

We should give them the due recognition for making this difficult choice. I note that a single unwed mother can become eligible for the Baby Bonus if she marries the biological father of her child before her child turns 12. However, some single mothers may not end up marrying the man for various reasons and this should not prevent them from receiving the same benefits. Providing these benefits will help reduce their financial burden which, for some unmarried women expecting a child, could tip the scales in favour of keeping the child instead of choosing to undergo an abortion.

In response, the Acting Minister assured me that the Government does not judge people by their status. I was glad to hear this because I took it to mean that the Government is not trying to shape moral behaviour using parenthood benefits. The Acting Minister also told me that there will always be some help that we give to married couples and there will be another package of help that we give to singles. That being the case, what alternative package of help is the Government giving to unwed mothers?

Unwed mothers have to single-handedly care for their child, take on the role of both father and mother, and hold onto a job to pay the bills. They also have to face the social stigma of being single and unmarried. On top of all that, they are denied many of the parenthood benefits that married, divorced and widowed mothers receive.

For more than two decades since 1959, the Government had in place aggressive population control policies that heavily discriminated against large families. So, when the state goes from saying that a third child is a bane to saying that the child is a boon, citizens would be quick to note that having children, to the Government, seems only a means to an end, which is, economic prosperity.

And, ultimately, each must be treated with equal dignity and compassion, and provided equal opportunities, no matter what their family backgrounds are, like how rich their families are, how intelligent the parents are and what family type they belong to.

Government is already investing heavily in this area to improve quality and availability. I hope it continues to do so, working closely with the private and non-profit sectors. However, currently, I think there are too many assistance schemes. So, why do we not streamline and merge all the pre-school subsidy schemes, including the co-savings component of Baby Bonus, into one standardised voucher for each child that is sufficient to provide a basic, no-frills pre-school education free for the three years leading up to Primary school?",18,499,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00499

Nearly a fifth of marriages result in divorce within the first 10 years, the prime time for most to have children. Couples need to work on their marriages more and be open to external help in marital counselling.

Low fertility is prevalent in countries where there is gender equity in social institutional settings, like in schools and the workplace, but gender inequality in family settings. In the home setting, women often continue to take on many of the traditional wife and mother duties, while also holding paid employment, resulting in fewer working women having fewer or no children. It is great to see a lot more fathers nowadays in Singapore actively involved in raising their children but, on the whole, gender expectations in Singapore still need to be discussed and refined.",21,502,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00502

It acknowledges parents' need for time off to attend to their children's needs, especially if both parents are working. The current leave entitlements are provided, regardless of the number of children that a couple have. This does not give them the additional support they would need should they have more children. If we want to encourage parents to consider having more than one or two children, we should try to provide as many avenues as possible to support their child-rearing efforts. So, I hope the House would consider giving couples with more than two children the additional support they need, especially in this area of leave entitlements for parents.",3,509,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00509
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"The second point I would like to raise pertains to the shared parental leave for fathers. The amendment to the Bill now allows for fathers to have one week's paternity leave, as well as share another week of parental leave from the 16 weeks' maternity leave provided to mothers. This recognises the important role of the father in a family and the much-appreciated support his physical presence will bring to his wife, especially in caring for a young baby.",4,510,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00510
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"However, the additional week of shared parental leave will not apply to fathers whose wives are stay-at-home mothers. As MSF seeks to encourage fathers to take on a more active fathering role, I hope the Ministry can consider including this group of fathers so that they, too, can enjoy two weeks of leave to bond with their newborn.",5,511,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00511
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),The third and last point I wish to highlight to the House today is the protection of pregnant women. The amended Bill will enhance protection for pregnant employees. Working mothers will be entitled to maternity leave benefits from their employer if they are dismissed without sufficient reason or retrenched at any stage of their pregnancy. I support this and I feel that we can do more to protect pregnant women at the workplace.,6,512,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00512
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"While the Child Development Co-Savings (Amendment) Bill has addressed unfair dismissal and maternity benefits, I hope this House can look into the other areas of maternity protection – such as health protection at the workplace and ensuring arrangements for mothers' breastfeeding and expression of milk. These two areas are part of guiding points provided by the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Maternity Protection Convention 2000 No 183 and Recommendation No 191.",7,513,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00513
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"For instance, are there specific guidelines or regulations to protect pregnant mothers and breastfeeding mothers from risks related to chemical, physical and biological agents, industrial processes, movements or postures that could lead to harm? Do employers carry out assessment of such risks in order to adjust working conditions or hours for pregnant or breastfeeding mothers? Are mothers able to request for a change in job scope or roles so as to protect themselves and their child?",8,514,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00514
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"The ILO recommends that mothers are given one or more daily breaks or a daily reduction of hours of work to breastfeed her child. These breaks or the reduction in daily hours of work are to be regarded as working time. So, are our workplace environments built to support breastfeeding mothers? Last Friday, an article in The Straits Times brought to our attention how it has now become compulsory for some shopping malls to provide nursing facilities. Likewise, I think we should review the design and environment of workplaces and help them create or modify facilities to support breastfeeding mothers. As SMEs employ over 80% of our local workforce, could we also provide assistance to our SMEs that need funding or expertise in this area?",9,515,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00515
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"The difficulties that nursing mothers face were widely reported and discussed by several mothers in yesterday's Sunday Times article entitled, ""Helping Mothers Express Themselves"". Ms Fatimah Abdul Rahman had to endure a smelly and unhygienic staff toilet before she gave up expressing at work and it was so very different when she joined KK Hospital later. In KKH, she found a dream nursing room; it has five cubicles, breast pumps, steam steriliser and the works. Of course, not all companies can be as well equipped as KK Hospital but all companies should exercise basic understanding and support for our nursing mothers. Nursing mothers not only juggle work demands, they also face unhappiness from bosses or colleagues when they take time out to express milk.",10,516,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00516
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"As a mother of two young children, I understand the inconvenience faced by nursing mothers. Nursing while at work can take tremendous patience, discipline and lots of coordination. I also struggled to juggle all that a few years ago. That is why it is not surprising that many mothers find it very hard to keep breastfeeding after they return to work. So, let us all give them the support that they deserve.",11,517,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00517
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"In essence, increasing support for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, and supporting parents and fathers in their family responsibilities are big steps in the right direction. We cannot do less. If we want to reverse the declining birth rate, we need to give strong signals to parents, mothers, men and women thinking of having children that they are not alone in this area of parenting. The state cannot be a nanny but it can assist parents in parenting through setting pro-family polices and creating family-friendly environments in workplaces and taking the lead to set examples for companies and organisations to follow.",12,518,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00518

2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xxxx.] Mdm Speaker, I support the Child Development Co-Savings Amendment Bill wholeheartedly. Besides the above-mentioned three suggestions, I also want to emphasise that although the Government provides various supporting schemes, we still need employers' cooperation. Only with their combined efforts can we create a pro-family workplace culture. I recently read a report on Japan's declining birth rate and the ageing problem. One point worth noting in the report is that Japan's employers generally believe low birth rate is the country's and society's problem, not their companies' problem. Therefore, it is not something that workplaces can help to resolve.",14,520,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00520
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Singapore's employers may be more proactive in their attitude. However, many employers believe that we can rely on importing foreign workers to solve the problems of declining birth rate and manpower shortage. If we allow this trend to continue, eventually, our society will not be able to develop in a sustainable manner. Our young people will leave Singapore to look for opportunities overseas and start their family there, simply because they cannot find high-quality jobs in Singapore. Our population problem will become even worse then.",15,521,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00521
2013-04-08-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Hence, I urge companies and employers to make the workplace more pro-family and pro-marriage so that your offices can become a place where employees can marry and start a family with peace of mind. More important than Government policies is the employers and supervisors' flexibility towards employees' needs for family life during different life stages. Employers should help them start a family and contribute their best to the company. Only with the combined efforts of the Government and the companies can we build a youthful, vibrant and hopeful Singapore.",16,522,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00522

In fact, personally, I feel that we need to tackle the problem even more upstream which is, helping women to find partners. Why do I say so? I observe that in my cohort, in my tutorial group, there were four ladies; only two are married. In a university female basketball team, out of five players, only two are married. So, it is between 50% and 60% who are not married and that is why I feel that we need to tackle the problem upstream.",3,525,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00525

Improve the process, such as a shorter wait at clinics and more family support in terms of housework and so on, perhaps will help.",4,526,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00526
2013-04-08-T-014,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Many parents have also set higher expectations in bringing up their own children. No longer are they like our parents who would leave us to fend for ourselves at school and in our studies because they were busy looking for three meals for the family then. I remember during my time, after school, I would just have to go to the kitchen to look for porridge. If there was no porridge, I would then have to wait until dinner. My parents would never ask me whether I had homework, whether I had finished my homework or not.",5,527,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00527

They want to give their children everything they did not manage to have during their time, including enrichment programmes, swimming classes, drawing classes and, perhaps, table tennis classes as well. Well, this is good. However, in the process of trying to achieve this, they are confronted with some real challenges. And the problem with the challenges is that it is not just about money but it is also about finding the time to create the right environment and the social support to meet the standards they set for their children. I believe this is where there is a gap between what benefits the Government has been able to offer to get them to have children and their ability to bring up their children thereafter. The bigger issue which remains unaddressed is this ""thereafter"".",6,528,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00528
2013-04-08-T-014,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Take the example of a child who is growing up. The parents need to find time – and I mean quality time – to oversee the child's studies. They would want to find time to send the child for enrichment programmes on weekends. Worse still, some of them are unable to get good caregivers to take care of their child while they are at work. Remember – not every family wants their child to be put into childcare. Remember – not every family is fortunate to have good domestic helpers who can do the housework and oversee the child. We know how domestic helpers can create as many problems as they are able to help in some homes. So, as parents, they worry about what is going on at home. Plus, in today's context, getting a domestic helper is not cheap. In addition, some are less fortunate than others and their children grow up with problems in their studies or with emotional problems that require special attention. The children may not be able to cope with their schoolwork or their social environment, spend too much time playing computer games and so forth. All these add on to the challenges that parents face after childbirth.",7,529,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00529
2013-04-08-T-014,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The steps taken by the Education Ministry to run kindergartens is a step in the right direction. What prospective parents need is support after the child is born. I believe many can afford the fees for childbirth as they enjoy medical benefits. Their problem is what next, after the child is born. We have so far focused on dangling the dollar to get married couples to have children. Our policymakers have not adequately addressed the emotional and social support after the child is born. And I encounter many such issues that parents raise on bringing up children. The modern child is learning so fast that if the parents cannot cope, it will be a lost opportunity that can never be recouped. Hence, I hope the Ministry will continue to search for the answers. If we can find the answers, then the joy of bringing up children will be the draw. They will no longer see the child as a burden or a hindrance to career development.",8,530,2013-04-08-T-014-S-00530

2013-04-08-T-014,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"There are several compelling reasons to do this. One, the amount of paid maternity leave by the Government should increase with later confinements to indicate greater support for working mothers who have more children. In addition, the amount of time that a working mother needs to take care of a newborn and an older child or children is definitely more. Imagine nursing yourself back to health after giving birth, and taking care of a newborn baby and two older children who may be below the age of seven each – all at the same time. As a working mother of three children myself, I know how challenging that can be. Once one child falls ill, the others are quite likely to fall ill as well.

Giving low-income families more help under the Package may inadvertently send a message that is incongruent with our emphasis on being self-reliant. Instead, the Government helps low-income families through a range of social assistance programmes, such as in income support, housing, education and healthcare.

Where we are able, we try to share the fruits of our labour with families, especially those who need it more. I hope Members of this House will agree with me that, within the finite pool of resources that we have, we should always try to help those who have less with a bit more. That is the way we go about designing our policies. Of course, some people might feel that they should get a bit more; some people might feel otherwise, but we should all agree that within the finite pool of resources that we have, we should help those with less, much more. That speaks for an inclusive society.",24,604,2013-04-08-T-016-S-00604
2013-04-08-T-016,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"So, whether it is in terms of leave schemes or balancing the requirements between employees and employers, we will continue to find that balance. But the Government can only provide that part of the circle. We need the support of the employers, the businesses and the community to make for a more inclusive, more pro-family environment.",25,605,2013-04-08-T-016-S-00605
2013-04-08-T-016,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Beyond all the policies that the Government has, at the end of the day, the individuals, the parents come into contact with their employers day in, day out. They go into the work environment every day. What they experience will shape their perception towards the family. How pro-family the employers' practices are will shape and influence decisions made by the individuals. How we design our living environment, even our recreational environment, will send a signal to everyone about how welcoming we, as a society, are towards families and families with young children. How do we, as a community, respond to children screaming and running around us? Do we frown upon them or do we look at them with appreciative eyes? That speaks to the young parents deciding whether or not to have a child.",26,606,2013-04-08-T-016-S-00606
2013-04-08-T-016,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"So, I agree with Members that we all have a responsibility and a part to play in making this pro-family environment possible, whether it is in the neighbourhood or in the workplace. We all can do our part.",27,607,2013-04-08-T-016-S-00607
2013-04-08-T-016,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Ultimately, that decision to start a family and have children is a deeply personal one. We can have all the correct policies, incentives and benefits and all the help schemes in the world, but if at the end of the day, our individual priorities and value systems are not geared towards having a family, then no matter what policies and help schemes we have, we will never be able to have that pro-family mindset.",28,608,2013-04-08-T-016-S-00608
2013-04-08-T-016,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"We are not doing this because we are trying to see babies as economic digits.

2013-04-08-T-016,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Children are not economic digits. Children are part of our family life. It saddens me when people take out a balance sheet to try and calculate all the pluses and minuses financially, numerically, before they decide to make that leap of faith. I am sure our parents, with much less than us, never did that before they conceived us. If they had done so, maybe we would not be where we are. We would not even be here today. But it is a deeply personal choice.",30,610,2013-04-08-T-016-S-00610
2013-04-08-T-016,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"What we can do is to make sure that we educate our young people and help them at every stage of their lifecycle. This is the reason why MSF has embarked on the Family Matters initiative. It is a life-cycle approach towards promoting family life, getting our people to share in the joys of family from young till they go out to work, and even after they have their children, at every stage of their lifecycle. From young, we have to start inculcating in our youths an appreciation of family life, that the family is the anchor of all that we do and it gives meaning to all that we do. When they are older, we try and help them to have the opportunities to meet their life partners, to settle down. Even after they got married, we try to give them help to make sure that we lessen the burden and the fear of starting a family. That is important.",31,611,2013-04-08-T-016-S-00611
2013-04-08-T-016,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"But I am quite sure this will not yield us benefits in the short term, because this is a long-term challenge. It takes us many years to build that pro-family environment and mindset. And we want to make this possible across the entire environment – from the workplace to the community – which is why we are going to spend $40 million in the next three years to encourage that environment, to work with employers, to work with community partners, to bring that about. And we want to use all channels, all mediums, to send this message forth, and that is important.",32,612,2013-04-08-T-016-S-00612
2013-04-08-T-016,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"If we get this right, then we will never talk about children as being a digit, because children become an intrinsic part of our family, part of our meaning in life. So, this is what we seek to do. At the end of the day, whether we talk about the M&P package or the TFR at the macro level, it boils down to individual decisions at the micro level. And this is where we need to have our values right, our priorities right, and then we can go forth and build that community that is pro-family, that business environment that is pro-family.",33,613,2013-04-08-T-016-S-00613

2013-04-08-T-018,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Since the SARS crisis in 2003, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has been putting out education campaigns regularly to emphasise the importance of good hygiene practices to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. Several key strategies have been used.",1,637,2013-04-08-T-018-S-00637
2013-04-08-T-018,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Firstly, HPB uses mass media, such as radio, TV commercials and print media, to increase the population's knowledge and awareness on how respiratory diseases are transmitted and can be prevented. Examples of this approach would include the flu campaigns that are rolled out twice a year, around May and November.",2,638,2013-04-08-T-018-S-00638
2013-04-08-T-018,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Secondly, HPB proactively reaches out and educates the public on social responsibility and good hygiene practices through workplace programmes and community talks. Behaviours, such as hand washing and covering one's mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, can help to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. Individuals are also reminded to seek medical attention promptly if they have symptoms, such as fever and cough. These educational messages, while simple, will help to reduce the spread of diseases like influenza.",3,639,2013-04-08-T-018-S-00639
2013-04-08-T-018,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Thirdly, educational outreach to schools is an important strategy in promoting personal and social hygiene. Interactive skits for primary school students as well as the ""Health on Wheels"" initiative that also targets pre-schoolers, ensure that these messages are delivered in a fun yet effective way. HPB also launched the ""Let's Wash Hands"" initiative in primary schools in 2012. This programme sets out to reach all Primary 1 and 2 students by 2015. Initiatives for relevant stakeholders, such as parents and teachers, have also been implemented.",4,640,2013-04-08-T-018-S-00640

An example of this work would be the programmes for staff and volunteers at community centres and eldercare centres. These interventions couple the awareness of flu and other respiratory diseases with practical application of necessary skills like mask use and proper hand washing techniques.",5,641,2013-04-08-T-018-S-00641

2013-04-08-T-022,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Sinkholes can occur naturally when earth beneath the surface is eroded, typically by water, resulting in subterranean cavities. In the excavation of underground structures, cavities can form when water or fluvial sand leaks into the excavated area. If these cavities are not detected and filled up in time, they will eventually cause a sinkhole.",1,657,2013-04-08-T-022-S-00657
2013-04-08-T-022,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For the Downtown Line, there has been only one incident of sinkhole to date. This happened on 16 March 2013 at Woodlands Road. Investigations show that due to the varied nature of the ground conditions, the excavation works of Downtown Line Stage 2 (DTL2) had led to differential ground settlement, causing an underground water pipe to rupture. The soil movement, coupled with water from the ruptured pipe, weakened the ground under the road and resulted in the sinkhole.",2,658,2013-04-08-T-022-S-00658
2013-04-08-T-022,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On 23 July 2012, there was also an incident of a localised road depression along Bukit Timah Road resulting from tunnelling works for DTL2.

2013-04-08-T-022,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"There had been a number of other sinkhole incidents, but these were not related to any MRT construction activity. In the Keppel Road incident in January this year, investigations found that the sinkhole was caused by an old water pipe bursting. A car was trapped but no one was hurt in the incident. In the two cases on Clementi Road in March 2013, preliminary investigations show that the erosion of soil into an old abandoned utility manhole may have caused the sinkhole and led to the road caving in again after the first sinkhole had been filled. A motorcyclist was reported to be slightly injured trying to avoid the sinkhole.",5,661,2013-04-08-T-022-S-00661
2013-04-08-T-022,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"To minimise the occurrence of sinkholes, prior to any major underground construction, LTA carries out comprehensive investigations of ground conditions and ensures that appropriate construction methods are used. Extensive instrumentation is installed to monitor the ground and building settlement at all times. In addition, LTA closely monitors the condition of the roads, especially those near to excavation sites or where tunnelling works are ongoing, to look out for signs of ground settlement or movement. Tunnelling control parameters are also strictly followed to ensure safety. In addition, LTA checks for potholes, cracks and other physical defects on all roads in Singapore regularly.",6,662,2013-04-08-T-022-S-00662
2013-04-08-T-022,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"I assure Members that the safety of motorists is of utmost importance. My Ministry takes a serious view of these incidents. LTA will step up its monitoring efforts. This includes installing more extensometers, which are geotechnical instruments that locate and measure settlement, displacement and deformation in soil and rock, as well as opening up small sections of the pavement or road surface adjacent to excavation sites to physically check for the presence of any voids underneath. To minimise the risk of sinkholes forming due to soil erosion into abandoned utility structures underneath public streets, as in the case of the sinkhole that re-collapsed at Clementi Road, LTA will work with the utility agencies and companies to check their underground structures and records, and to carry out the necessary removal or rectification works. LTA will also work with the utility agencies to tighten the monitoring and maintenance regime to prevent rupture of underground water pipes which will weaken the ground and lead to formation of sinkholes.",7,663,2013-04-08-T-022-S-00663

In deciding on new routes or service improvements, LTA also incorporates planning information, public feedback, data from its ticketing system, and ground checks. New routes are typically added in areas where there are new public housing developments, such as Yishun, Sengkang and Punggol, and generally implemented in tandem with their completion.",1,665,2013-04-08-T-023-S-00665
2013-04-08-T-023,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"With more buses on the road, more priority will be given to them. Today, there are about 180 kilometres of bus lanes and over 200 locations where the Mandatory Give Way to Buses Scheme is implemented. Over the next two years, the coverage of bus priority measures will be enhanced with 30 more kilometres of bus lanes and the Mandatory Give Way to Buses Scheme will be increased by another 150 bus stops. The number of bus hubs, where several buses can pick up passengers at the same time, will also be quadrupled from the existing 10. Enforcement of bus priority schemes will be stepped up, as infringements will result in delays for buses.",2,666,2013-04-08-T-023-S-00666
