2018-02-27-T-001,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,"asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) in the past five years, how many parents have provided false information to secure a place for their child in a school; (b) how are such cases handled by the authorities; and (c) whether the child in question is allowed to remain in the school that he or she has been enrolled in when the parents have been found guilty of providing false information.",1,1,2018-02-27-T-001-S-00001

2018-02-27-T-001,Ng Chee Meng,The Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Where there is reason to believe that false information may have been used, MOE will refer the case to the Police for their investigation and action. In cases where the verdict is finalised and the parent is convicted of the charge, the child who was previously registered in a school based on false information would be transferred to another school with available vacancies.",3,4,2018-02-27-T-001-S-00004
2018-02-27-T-001,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Minister for the answer. I have a couple of supplementary questions. First, in such cases, does the Ministry or the school provide counselling services for the child that is affected by this rather unfortunate turn of circumstances? Does the Ministry then follow up to see whether the child is adjusting well in the new school? My concern, of course, is coming from the perspective of the welfare of the child.",1,5,2018-02-27-T-001-S-00005
2018-02-27-T-001,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the clarification. Yes, if needed, we will extend the necessary support both educationally and emotionally to the child affected.

Police's experience suggests that cases of trespass committed by youths were often due to peer influence or a desire to seek thrill in their free time. These youths would trespass into unoccupied schools, rooftops and other places.",5,12,2018-02-27-T-002-S-00012

2018-02-27-T-002,Amrin Amin,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Where appropriate, Police work with stakeholders to enhance the security of sites to prevent and deter trespass. For example, there are signs in restricted areas, such as military installations and training grounds, as well as SLA's state lands, to warn the public against trespassing. Police have also put up Crime Alert signages at areas where there have been incidents, and work with Town Councils to ensure that HDB rooftops are secured to prevent unauthorised access.",9,16,2018-02-27-T-002-S-00016

JTC will continue to look at the demand and if there is more demand, we will see how best we can create some spaces for innovation and Launchpads for entrepreneurs to take off.",1,67,2018-02-27-T-007-S-00067
2018-02-27-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what has been the number of international passengers for Changi Airport in 2017; and (b) what are the growth rates for international passengers for the past five years for Changi Airport compared to the same data for competing regional air hubs, including Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta.",1,68,2018-02-27-T-008-S-00068
2018-02-27-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Speaker, between 2012 and 2017, the number of passengers at Changi Airport grew at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4%, reaching 62.2 million passengers in 2017. In the same period, the number of overseas visitors who came to Singapore by air grew at a CAGR of 4.1%.",1,69,2018-02-27-T-008-S-00069
2018-02-27-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),,2,70,2018-02-27-T-008-S-00070
2018-02-27-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"The five-year CAGR for international passengers handled at the Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta airports were 10.2%, 7.4% and 3.5% for the period 2011 to 2016, based on publicly available full-year data. We do not have data on the number of overseas visitors the three foreign airports handled.",3,71,2018-02-27-T-008-S-00071
2018-02-27-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response. Given that the CAGR for Bangkok and Jakarta are quite substantially higher than Changi Airport, does the Ministry have any concerns that, over time, the competitiveness of our air hub will be eroded vis-à-vis Bangkok and Jakarta? What are some of the plans that the Ministry is looking into to mitigate that?",1,72,2018-02-27-T-008-S-00072
2018-02-27-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Indeed, the region's airports grow at different rates but, contextually, we must look at the growth conditions as well. Bangkok and Singapore Changi Airport are at about the same base but, in Bangkok, they have two different airports to serve the domestic and the international market at Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi Airports. With this advantage and also the domestic growth of LCCs, they have a 10.2% growth. We are watching this – as we always do – to make sure that Changi is competitive.",1,73,2018-02-27-T-008-S-00073
2018-02-27-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,,2,74,2018-02-27-T-008-S-00074
2018-02-27-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Whereas for Jakarta, it starts at a lower base, much lower numbers of passengers per year. When it starts off with different initial conditions, we have different growth rates. Nevertheless, what we want to do for Changi is to anchor it as a premier air hub, as we have done for so many years, which, also in time to come, will involve building a T5 for the expanded capacities to handle increased projected volumes of passengers.",3,75,2018-02-27-T-008-S-00075
2018-02-27-T-009,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,"asked the Minister for Manpower of the number of university graduates aged 40 years and above in 2016 who had left their jobs or were retrenched in that year, how many have managed to secure employment thereafter in (i) the same industry they were in or (ii) a different industry respectively as a result of the SkillsFuture movement.",1,76,2018-02-27-T-009-S-00076
2018-02-27-T-009,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, data on the number of employees who left their jobs but who were not retrenched is not available. There were about 5,000 retrenched local PMETs aged 40 and above in 2016. About one-third of those who subsequently found jobs re-entered the same industry, while the rest took up jobs in a different industry.",1,77,2018-02-27-T-009-S-00077

2018-02-27-T-009,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Singaporeans looking for a new job or career can tap on the Adapt and Grow initiative to supplement their own efforts. In 2017, more than 6,000 PMETs aged 40 and above found jobs through career matching services or programmes, such as the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) and Career Support Programme (CSP), which provide training and wage support to bridge mismatches in skills or wage expectations. This is an increase of almost 50% compared to 2016.",3,79,2018-02-27-T-009-S-00079

2018-02-27-T-009,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Second Minister for the answer. It is quite heartening to know that there are Singaporeans being emplaced with jobs even after they are retrenched. However, in conversations with residents and some volunteers, not many are aware of the whole slew of SkillsFuture initiatives and schemes available. Whenever we mention SkillsFuture, the first thing that comes to mind is the $500 SkillsFuture Credit.",1,82,2018-02-27-T-009-S-00082
2018-02-27-T-009,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),Is there any data that the Ministry has to show the level of awareness and knowledge that Singaporeans have about the various schemes and programmes under SkillsFuture? And are there plans to increase outreach or roadshows to inform and explain to Singaporeans that there are many different schemes and programmes under SkillsFuture that they can tap on?,2,83,2018-02-27-T-009-S-00083
2018-02-27-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for her questions. Actually, for SkillsFuture, the Minister is seated right here and he is better placed to answer that question. But I will try my best. We work as a team.",1,84,2018-02-27-T-009-S-00084
2018-02-27-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Indeed, if you consider the fact that SkillsFuture is a relatively new movement, the fact that so many people know of its existence is, to my mind, quite remarkable. Notwithstanding the fact that the one thing that is on their top of mind recall is the $500 credit.",2,85,2018-02-27-T-009-S-00085

2018-02-27-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I think, increasingly, individuals are beginning to learn more about SkillsFuture. If you look at the perspective of the students, if the student is in a Polytechnic, he would know that there are programmes, such as Earn and Learn, which is one of the SkillsFuture programmes. If they are already in the workforce, SkillsFuture has launched two major initiatives. One is an advisory for individuals; second, there is an initiative to reach out to businesses to help them, in turn, help their own employees make better use of the many schemes that are available under SkillsFuture.",4,87,2018-02-27-T-009-S-00087

I should add that, in addition to SkillsFuture, likewise, we also conduct outreach on Adapt and Grow initiatives because, depending on individuals, whether they are actively looking for a job or they are just seeking to replenish their repertoire of skills in order to be ready for a transition in the future, I think it is worth our while to reach out to all of them. Many different types of approaches and channels will have to be exercised for that purpose.",6,89,2018-02-27-T-009-S-00089
2018-02-27-T-010,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether IMDA places a limit on the number of mailboxes a postman has to cover each day; (b) whether there are regulations in place to safeguard the working conditions of postmen; and (c) how does IMDA plan to support SingPost in adopting technology or redesigning jobs to improve accuracy and efficiency of mail sorting and delivery to ease existing workloads.,1,90,2018-02-27-T-010-S-00090
2018-02-27-T-010,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Mr Speaker, the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) does not limit the number of letter boxes each postman serves. As a licensee, SingPost is required to plan and optimise its operations to meet the IMDA's Postal Quality of Service (QoS) standards, namely, to deliver 100% of all basic letters within two working days of posting. IMDA will take regulatory actions, such as imposing financial penalties, if SingPost fails to meet these standards.",1,91,2018-02-27-T-010-S-00091

2018-02-27-T-010,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Sir, I understand that SingPost recently reviewed its postman delivery routes to ensure that the daily delivery workload is equitably distributed amongst its postmen. Currently, each postman delivers mail items to approximately 2,000 dwelling units, or roughly 20 HDB blocks daily. In designing a postman's delivery route, SingPost ensures that each postman is able to complete his delivery within a standard six-hour delivery window. During peak periods where there are higher mail volumes, SingPost may engage temporary postal workers for sorting duties, redeploy staff or request postmen to work overtime to ensure that mail is delivered in a timely manner. Postmen who work overtime are given overtime pay.",3,93,2018-02-27-T-010-S-00093

2018-02-27-T-010,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"The Member asked about regulations to safeguard the working conditions of postmen. Mr Speaker, SingPost has to comply with prevailing labour legislation that protects the rights and welfare of its workers. I am told that over the past few years, SingPost has increased the postmen’s salary and that MOM has not received any valid salary-related complaints over the last five years.",5,95,2018-02-27-T-010-S-00095

2018-02-27-T-010,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"The Member also asked about leveraging technology to improve mail operations. I understand that SingPost has been actively adopting technology and has invested $100 million over the last few years to improve its operational efficiency. For instance, SingPost invested in a $45-million mail sorting machine that has automated 95% of the mail sorting process. To make it easier for its postmen to deliver mail, SingPost has also introduced more delivery vehicles, such as three-wheel scooters and customised mail delivery trolleys. IMDA is fully supportive of SingPost's on-going efforts to adopt technology and redesign jobs.",7,97,2018-02-27-T-010-S-00097
2018-02-27-T-010,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Minister for the reply. IMDA has also stated that it would be conducting a full investigation into the incident where the postman was dismissed for throwing away mail. Can the Minister share what the scope of the investigation is and, based on this investigation, if SingPost will be further reviewing the workload of postmen and postwomen?",1,98,2018-02-27-T-010-S-00098
2018-02-27-T-010,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"IMDA is doing the investigations. I do not have the details as yet.

2018-02-27-T-010,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"At the end of the day, as I have mentioned earlier, we control the outcome through our Quality of Service standards and, if there are lapses in SingPost, we will have to deal with it accordingly.",2,100,2018-02-27-T-010-S-00100

I will speak on the economic measures during the MTI Committee of Supply (COS) debate.",2,118,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00118
2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),I am glad that the introduction of the carbon tax would be phased in gradually to monitor the impact and applaud the Government’s commitment that the projected $1 billion revenue collected over the first five years will be used to support projects that will achieve greater emission reductions.,3,119,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00119

2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The timing of the GST increase, at least three years from now, should not come as a surprise as both the current and previous Ministers for Finance have already made it quite clear that we do have sufficient revenue to meet the increased expenditures for this term of Government. So, this increase in GST is not a deferred tax. It is meant to take care of future spending increases beyond 2020.",6,122,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00122
2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I appreciate the Government sharing this way ahead of time so that Singaporeans and businesses can better prepare for the increase.

2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We know the reason why we need more revenues.

In the next decade, this trajectory is likely to continue with even higher healthcare and other recurring expenditures.",8,124,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00124
2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In some ways, as Members of Parliament, we have a part to play in these rising expenditures. To progress as a society and to improve the well-being of Singaporeans, we are relentless in pushing for more spending in many areas, such as education, housing, healthcare, transport and others. We asked for more subsidies to help low- and middle-income families; we ask for more facilities in the constituencies we represent. It is our duty to improve lives.",9,125,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00125
2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, I must admit I am one of those. For example, I requested the Minister for Health for a polyclinic in my constituency three years ago. I am glad that construction will start this year. But I know that it would cost the Government tens of millions of dollars to build a polyclinic and, when completed, it will incur recurring operating and maintenance expenses in perpetuity. I have made another request to the Minister for Health for a Senior Care Centre, which I understand will cost about $1 million to build and, of course, will come with its operating costs thereafter.",10,126,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00126

2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I believe most Singaporeans can understand why the expenditures are rising. The question is how do we find more revenue to pay for these rising expenditures. Some had suggested why not increase the share of Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) beyond 50% and asked if the Government is too prudent or conservative in managing the finances. So, let me offer my thoughts on this.",12,128,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00128
2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"When I studied Civil Engineering at the Singapore Polytechnic, one of the structural engineering concepts that I learned was this term known as the ""Factor of Safety"". Essentially, what it meant is that whether it is a building or a structure like a bridge or a tower, engineers will design and build structures with a load carrying capacity way beyond the expected or intended loads ‒ often between two and three times. This is to reduce the probability of the structure collapsing due to unforeseen factors to a negligible level as you can never be 100% sure that the inputs that you use will be accurately captured in the calculations. There could be unexpected extreme wind loads or seismic movements due to major earthquakes nearby, for example, or other possibilities.",13,129,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00129
2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, buildings and structures are purposely built much stronger than needed for normal usage, with a ""factor of safety” added to, hopefully, cater for the extreme unexpected emergency situations.",14,130,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00130
2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Similarly, when we look at the long-term finances of a country, should we not also load a “factor of safety” so that, as a country, we will never be caught in a position where we are unable to decisively respond to an unexpected crisis or disaster? Should we not want to ensure that we have the ability to fight back and recover from an extreme risk event? And these risk events could be known unknowns to us or total unknown-unknowns to us. It could be weather calamities, severe global or regional economic crises or even geopolitical crises in the region.",15,131,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00131

There are many factors that can result in higher than forecasted surpluses ‒ better-than-expected economic performances, actual expenditure and revenue deviating from the forecast, better investment returns, among others. As the Government ‒ like most other governments in the world ‒ adopts a cash accounting approach, as opposed to accrual accounting like companies, the annual Budget position can be significantly affected when there are changes to payment timings for big ticket items.",30,146,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00146

2018-02-27-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Government is a net creditor and does not need to borrow, other than the issuance of Singapore Government securities which are to help create a risk-free bond market yield curve. However, for the entity that builds the Government-invested infrastructure, borrowing at the project level does require higher financing costs because of the risks associated, such as construction risk. This could result in a negative situation from the Government's standpoint where borrowing rates may be higher than the returns derived from investing the reserves. Hence, it makes smart sense to tap on the Government guarantees to reduce the borrowing costs. I find this a refreshing approach.",39,155,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00155

We need to talk more on this issue and seek buy-in from Singaporeans on the approach that the Government is taking. Importantly, to expound on our value system about each generation – past, present and future – doing our part to shoulder the funding of a socially cohesive and economically vibrant future Singapore. To a certain extent, this Budget has brought to attention this issue and offers some clarity on how we intend to achieve this inter-generation equity.

By bringing Singapore's low gambling tax rates of 5% to 15% closer in line with Macau's rate of 39% and Australia’s rate of up to 45% in some states, the authorities can collect much of the $3 billion intended to be drawn from a two-percentage point GST hike.

Under the existing NIRC framework, 50% of expected net investment returns is already contributing the single largest source of funds for Government expenditure. Its contribution has risen steadily over the years, such that $1 in $5 of Government spending now comes from NIRC. This high dependency on NIRC, I think, represents a significant vulnerability for Singapore, given the volatility that comes naturally with any investment portfolio. Even the best investment managers will admit that they can only manage risks, not returns. To ensure a sustainable fiscal position, there may be a need, some time in the future, to consider a limit upon which Government spending can tap NIRC to avoid over dependency, over and above the current NIRC framework.",10,169,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00169

Shortage of skilled talent will constrain our efforts to transform our economy, with the problem becoming more acute as economic growth gains pace.

With our people as the only natural resource, we must begin from the starting point that each and every one of our students, each and every one of them, regardless of race, language or religion, can not just succeed, but excel in the economy of tomorrow. The focus cannot be on acing examinations alone as a means of securing a child's future, as is overwhelmingly the case today.

They fear that poor PSLE results will evince a bleak future, with their children condemned to schools dominated by problematic students who, in their estimation, do not like to study or cannot communicate well, hence, setting their own children up for mediocrity.

But there is another downside – and a very important one – that requires us to hasten educational transformation. Streaming and ranking serve to reinforce the inequality the Finance Minister warned about in his Budget speech.

However, it is no secret that Singapore's approach to budgeting is highly conservative, with land sales excluded from the Government's income, even as more resources are required to take care of our elderly population through to 2030 and beyond. Reasonable Singaporeans take the view that there is scope to consider how elderly Singaporeans can be better protected in their twilight years, with the burden of additional taxes like the GST held off for as long as possible.",21,212,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00212

The Government is, by far and away, the largest landowner in Singapore. The majority of all land here comprises 99-year or less than 99-year leasehold properties. Seen in this light, should not the current generations be allowed to benefit from some percentage of today's land sales with the knowledge that such land regenerates itself in value for future generations, providing successive Governments with the recurring source of income? Should Singaporeans, who are now expected to live well into their 80s, reap more benefit from land sales so as to justify better social protection for them?",22,213,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00213
2018-02-27-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Even as land is scarce in Singapore, it is also highly valued, with land sales likely to be very healthy in the decades to come right until our HDB flats run down their leases and well into the second half of the century. As much as the development of the port in Tuas will cost money, the move of port facilities from Tanjong Pagar will free up prime and valuable waterfront land adjacent to Shenton Way. After 2035, a massive tract of land where the current Paya Lebar airport sits, massive by Singapore's standards at least, will be available for sale to the Government of the day. In between, the Government, as the largest landowner, has many sites open for development that will ensure steady growth of the reserves for the foreseeable future.",23,214,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00214

2018-02-27-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Firstly, excluding land sales prevents the Government from unnecessarily selling land to meet expenditure needs. However, this argument can potentially be addressed with a cap on spending revenue from land sales, for example, not more than 20% of the value of average land sales over 20 years, or 20% of land sales for that year, whichever is lower. This would give no good reason for an ill-advised government to ramp up land sales when in government to increase its own income.",25,216,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00216
2018-02-27-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second argument on the ""Factually"" website posits that income from land sales is invested and is already available to the Government for spending through the NIRC framework. While this is a stronger argument and certainly true, not co-mingling the income from land sales with other reserves for investment also brings with it the prospect of greater transparency to the public and of mitigating the consequences of poor investment decisions most dramatically highlighted by GIC's partial divestment of its stake in UBS and losing billions in the process, as reported last year.",26,217,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00217
2018-02-27-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, the Workers' Party is open-minded about looking at different modalities of funding future Budgets with the view to strengthening social protection frameworks. This also promotes a healthier discussion of fiscal issues amongst our population. Of course, the money has to come from somewhere. But there are two ways of framing this conversation. One, is to say that proposals that seek to improve and suggest better social protection for Singaporeans are tantamount to raiding the reserves. The other is to take a strategic perspective of our reserves position – something only the Government can holistically do in view of the significant information asymmetries – look at how quickly the world is changing and always assess how Singaporeans can be better protected ahead of time.",27,218,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00218
2018-02-27-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To reiterate, allowing a portion of the revenue for land sales will also not stop the reserves from growing. They will continue to grow and disproportionately benefit future generations. But looking at using land sales also gives the Government of the day more flexibility to ensure that current generations of elderly Singaporeans' healthcare needs, for example, are adequately budgeted for, leaving more scope for the Government to strengthen social protection for the current generation of Singaporeans. Inter-generational equity is a subject that deserves greater discussion.",28,219,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00219

However, there was inconsistency in the treatment of some additional taxes that will no doubt add to the Government's coffers before that. For example, the Government was able to confirm that the imposition of the carbon tax would bring an additional $1 billion a year of revenue after implementation. However, no estimates were provided on the likely additional revenue that would be added to the Government's income with the inclusion of the GST on imported services.",31,222,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00222

There is also the question on the move to become a cashless society and the impact this will have on sectors which have traditionally been thought to under-declare their income, such as self-employed hawkers and taxi drivers. This prospect will become less probable with the advent of more electronic transactions and, in turn, is likely to have a positive effect on tax revenues.",32,223,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00223

These are necessary investments to keep the Singapore economy humming along. However, the people who keep it humming must be equipped to succeed in tomorrow's economy. Equally, the security of elderly Singaporeans, each generation a pioneer generation of an improbable country in its own right, should not be made to feel insecure in their old age, particularly when it comes to healthcare.

Such spending increases are an improvement that have been made possible by Singapore's continuing economic progress. There are many areas of Social Development, no doubt, that require urgent attention. New areas of needs arise as society develops and the economy matures. Sustainable solutions to such challenges require a focused and targeted approach.",15,243,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00243

As a sovereign developed nation, it is our responsibility to be prepared to bear the burden of maintaining these vital connections. The building of national defence capabilities is a fundamental priority that cannot be ignored. The experiences of other advanced economies show that the failure to maintain up-to-date defence capabilities could lead to a diminished capacity to play a full role in defence partnerships.

But as the experiences of several countries have shown, a strong response with a decisive and sufficiently large package of measures meant that the cost of the responses could usually be recovered if the intervention successfully revived asset valuations that had been downgraded by the crisis. In order for this to occur, the resources needed to mount the rescue packages had to be available in the first place.",19,247,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00247

Residents ask for financial help, they want lower transport fares, they appeal for more bus services to bring them to their specific destination; they ask for low-cost rental flats, they ask for blue CHAS cards, for higher healthcare subsidies and they ask for less expensive medical treatment at clinics and hospitals and the list goes on.",1,252,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00252

In the Budget Statement, the Finance Minister explained that the Budget is a strategic and integrated plan. He asked Singaporeans to take a longer-term view, and set out our strategic challenges clearly and plainly. He indicated that the Government will spend more on healthcare by building more hospitals, polyclinics, nursing homes and eldercare centres. The Government will also spend more on infrastructure projects like the rail network, construction of Terminal 5, Tuas Port as well as the High Speed Rail. More will also be spent on education and security.",5,256,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00256
2018-02-27-T-016,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"These priorities of the Government resonate with me. Indeed, healthcare is always a concern for many Singaporeans as there will be more and more seniors as we live longer. Many elderly citizens whom I speak to worry about high healthcare costs, especially those who suffer from chronic diseases or had suffered stroke or require long-term medication for cancer. In my constituency walkabouts, I see more and more residents on wheelchair or needing help with their mobility. More spending on healthcare will make it affordable for those who need help in their retirement years.",6,257,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00257
2018-02-27-T-016,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),Having improved infrastructure will also allow better accessibility and convenience for many people and create a better environment for all Singaporeans. Lower transport fare is welcomed because public transport is a necessity and public transport should be kept affordable. An increase in education spending is also welcomed as it will prepare our children for the future challenges in the world. Increasing the financial support for students from lower-income families will mitigate the gap between the well-off students and lower-income families.,7,258,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00258

In allocating more resources to these areas of priorities, I urge the Government to consider and to ensure that the lives of all Singaporeans would improve. I understand the need to take better care of the poor and needy and those with low-income. But I urge the Government not to forget the struggles and difficulties of the rising number of middle-class citizens who may feel sandwiched by Government policies. They perceive some of the policies as not helping them. Hence, I urge the Government to implement policies which would help those in need and, at the same time, be fair to citizens who have contributed to build Singapore.",9,260,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00260

Keep an eye on the retirees and the middle-income Singaporeans so that they, too, can share or enjoy the growth of the country.

It is not always possible to expect the Government to keep increasing the spending on healthcare, security and other social spending without thinking of how to fund such spending. In particular, if the increase in GST would help reduce the healthcare burden on all citizens, if it helps subsidise transport costs, if it provides more care for the lower-income, it should be something that we should all support as we are helping the majority of Singaporeans, for the lower-income, middle-income and seniors.",13,264,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00264

It is always easy to say spend more today and save less for the future. What should be the right balance is a question that everyone has an opinion about. To me, we should exercise prudence and try to spend within our means, especially if our expenses are on recurrent spending on healthcare, security and other social spending.",18,269,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00269

But does he not agree that actually the Government's definition of land sales includes leases. In fact, the cut-off period when you include a lease as a sale is actually a 10-year lease.

I am glad that the Government will, hence, observe the principle of 开源节流 when constructing large-scale infrastructure. Because such investments are huge, the Government is looking at allowing Statutory Boards and GLCs, like LTA, to fund them by borrowing or issuance of bonds, in order to avoid tapping into the national reserves.

From FY2019, the rate of growth for the block budgets of Ministries will be reduced from 0.4 times of GDP growth to 0.3 times. As Singapore is already an ageing society, there will be more and more areas that will require spending in the future. We need to stringently control Ministry spending, monitor closely the policy implementation processes, plug loopholes in the abuse of Government resources, raise the quality of public projects and avoid the vicious cycle of problems arising from Government spending and then having to spend more money to resolve problems – this is truly how 开源节流 could be meaningfully carried out.",7,290,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00290
2018-02-27-T-016,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"As for the adjustment of the Goods and Services Tax, this has been widely speculated before. It turned out that the Government would not immediately raise the GST, but would do so at least three years later, giving sufficient time to businesses and consumers to adapt. I would like to convey the views of some smaller retailers, particularly those from the northern part of Singapore. They are worried that following the GST increase, many consumers will swarm into Malaysia, particularly Johor Baru, to shop for daily products. These retailers believe that this is very likely to happen because the Singapore-Johor Rapid Transit System Link will start operating in 2024. With the ease of travelling, more convenient customs clearance, easier conveyance of goods and the strength of the Singapore dollar vis-à-vis the Malaysian ringgit, the lure across the Causeway would only grow greater. Come 2026, the surge in north-bound traffic could be even higher, as the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High Speed Rail is projected to be operational by then and there will be many convenient places to shop along the route.",8,291,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00291

To local businesses that provide similar services, this is a long-awaited equitable measure. According to the Department of Statistics, Singapore imported close to S$225 billion worth of services in 2016. This is a significant figure. Such purchases include software applications and a variety of Business-to-Business (B2B) services, including accounting and IT.

Whether it is the provision of services through the B2B or B2C model, there is a likelihood that charges from both ends may exploit technical or policy loopholes to gain an advantage in areas, such as during the transaction, the computation of tax assessment and tax rebate.

Only when our companies thrive and develop, they could then contribute more to Government revenue. The Government has continuously been helping our companies to transform and upgrade. Next, companies themselves have to be more proactive to push the pace of transformation and innovation. Workers need to learn new knowledge, new skills, while bosses must use a new mindset to develop new markets. Transformation is like stretching the body, where periodic pains are unavoidable.

It is now going to be extended for another three years to encourage more companies to give back to society. Some businesses hope the Government could take a further step to raise the deduction to 300%. This could encourage even more people to make generous donations, contributing both money and effort to build a more caring and united society.",12,295,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00295

I focus on ageing here. I highlight that ageing is not uniformly experienced, and that men and women experience ageing and are affected by ageing very differently. There are, therefore, gender inequalities we need to tackle if we are to meet the challenges and opportunities of ageing successfully. Our policies targeted at ageing must factor in the gender differences for them to be effective. I focus on three sets of issues, namely, issues related to the gender income gap, issues with supporting caregivers and the economic and health security of seniors.",1,297,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00297
2018-02-27-T-016,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member):,"Let me start with issues related to the gender income gap. A study using data from MOM last year showed that the gender pay gap has not improved in the decade from 2006 to 2016. The gap in median monthly income between male and female has remained at around 18% to 19%, with women earning some $610 less than men.",2,298,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00298
2018-02-27-T-016,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member):,"It is unacceptable that we have not made any progress in closing the gender pay gap in 10 years. We need to tackle the gender pay gap because it will affect our future senior women and their retirement security. Already, women are living longer than men and CPF LIFE is structured in such a way that discriminates between gender, with women paying a higher premium and getting less payouts. The gender pay gap has, therefore, a compounding effect on the retirement security of women. Using the CPF LIFE Payout Estimator on the CPF Board website, my estimate is that, on the average, men will be getting 25% more income than women from CPF LIFE due to the gender pay gap.",3,299,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00299
2018-02-27-T-016,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member):,"The gender pay gap varies across sectors. There has been some attention on the gender pay gap in the finance sector and in senior management, but I think we should actually pay more attention to the majority of our women workers who are labouring in other sectors. Health and social service is still a sector that has one of the largest gender pay gaps, with women earning around $1,540 a month less than men. The health and social service sector impacts ageing and our seniors the most. It is also a sector that is, arguably, the most susceptible to what Minister Ong Ye Kung has noted as a key factor underpinning the gender pay gap, that is, the social norms and expectations placed on women. Minister Ong called for a mindset change. But this is also a structural issue.",4,300,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00300
2018-02-27-T-016,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member):,"The crux of the matter is nursing. Nursing makes up the bulk of the health and social service sector and most nurses are women. Nursing is also in high demand because of ageing. A strong professional body of local nurses is essential for us to successfully meet the challenges of ageing. For many decades, there has been an erosion of status and value attributed to nursing, which culminated in the 2013 Population White Paper footnote mistake in classifying nursing as a low-skilled job that is difficult to offshore. The apology and correction from Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean then was swift and right, and I believe there has been a narrowing of the prestige gap between nursing and other professions since 2013. But there are still two other associated issues.",5,301,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00301
2018-02-27-T-016,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member):,"First, while wages for nurses have been improving, there is still a lag. Based on mid-2016 data from MOM, the median gross monthly income from work of all full-time employed residents is $4,056, while the figure for nurses is $4,300. This is a ratio of 1.06. This is not too different from similar ratios for OECD countries.",6,302,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00302

Part of the reason for the gender pay gap is linked to women returning to the workforce after taking a prolonged break due to pregnancies or childcare responsibilities. Little recognition is given by employers and the Government to the years women spent in service to the family and to the nation to bear and raise children, unlike men who are often given a salary premium for the two years spent in National Service.",12,308,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00308

Like nurses, most caregivers are women. So, again, we see gender closely connected to ageing. As with nurses, getting our policy right in supporting caregivers is essential for us to successfully meet the challenges of ageing. There are two issues associated with caregivers. If we can resolve these two issues, we will be able to support a strong body of caregivers who would form the bedrock of our silver care system, close the loop between healthcare and community care, and allow our seniors to successfully and actively age in place.",15,311,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00311
2018-02-27-T-016,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member):,"The first issue is recognition and reward for unpaid caregiving. It was estimated that there were over 210,000 caregivers in 2004. The numbers should have gone up by now. This is not a small number, as it represents around 10% of our resident workforce. In a national survey of informal caregiving of older adults aged 75 and above presented in 2013, only 55.6% of the caregivers reported that they were working full-time or part-time and the caregivers reported they spent an average of 38 hours a week in providing care.",16,312,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00312

This is only one of the many surveys and studies that have shown consistent results. I think it is time we recognise that caregiving is full-time work, which prevents caregivers from realising their employment potential and affecting their financial security.",18,314,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00314
2018-02-27-T-016,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member):,"How can we better support caregivers in this respect? Two years ago, during COS 2016, I asked the Government to consider giving means-tested refundable tax credits to caregivers, so that caregivers who do not work or work part-time would get some cash refund. This would lessen their financial burden and improve their retirement adequacy. Senior Minister of State Sim Ann then replied that the Government’s approach focused on direct subsidies of services to lessen the costs borne by caregivers, rather than providing cash allowances to people looking after family members. I am of the view that the two do not have to be mutually exclusive. Cash allowances to caregivers suffering from extreme negative financial impact would allow them to access the subsidised services.",19,315,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00315
2018-02-27-T-016,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member):,"If we recognise full-time caregiving of seniors as unpaid work, then it is not far-fetched to consider them as low-wage employees who need income supplement. We should rethink the orthodoxy and provide income support to caregivers. There is already one scheme that is suited for this purpose – the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme. WIS is means-tested and, with older workers receiving higher payments, it will ensure the benefit will go to needy caregivers. Also, since 40% of the payment is given out in cash and 60% in CPF contributions, this will help take care of the immediate financial needs and enhance the retirement needs of the eligible caregivers.",20,316,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00316
2018-02-27-T-016,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member):,"The second issue is the stress faced by caregivers of seniors, which, in the worst case, can lead to depression and anxiety. Studies of caregivers in Singapore have consistently shown high stress levels among caregivers. But, there are important differences. Caregivers of seniors with dementia experience higher stress. Female caregivers of seniors, namely wives and daughters, tend to experience a lot more stress than male caregivers. These female caregivers reported feeling rundown and exhausted and experienced restless sleepless nights. Many of them reported the desire to be involved in culturally relevant recreational activities, such as a game of mahjong, but they lack the social networks to get involved.",21,317,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00317
2018-02-27-T-016,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member):,"Our caregivers are a heroic bunch with strong Asian family values. Another study has shown that caregivers often report concerns about the caregiving and much less about the effect of caregiving on their own physical and mental well-being. What this means is that while they know and are driven to care for their loved ones, the caregivers do not know how to care for themselves and tended to neglect their own well-being.",22,318,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00318

I was glad to hear from Senior Minister of State Amy Khor that the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) has started a three-year pilot since September 2015 to embed caregiver support services in five SCCs, and that AIC had also started AICareLinks centres at five hospitals and its office at Maxwell Road for caregivers to receive advice on services and schemes.

I suspect the caregivers are not too forthcoming in seeking caregiver support services at the SCCs and AICareLinks centres.

But I hope this integration will not come at a cost to the cross-functional integration between MOH and MSF, and between AIC and the SSOs when it comes to needy seniors and vulnerable caregivers of seniors. In fact, with seniors ageing in place and in their communities, the delivery of services is most effectively achieved by leveraging the community networks of the SSOs and FSCs.",25,321,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00321

Back in 2008, HDB found that just over half of elderly residents living in HDB flats planned financially for retirement, with women much less likely to do so. Many elderly women, much more so than elderly men, are dependent on their spouses and children for financial support and many continued to work in low-paid jobs to supplement their meagre income.",28,324,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00324

Another study estimated that the relative poverty rate among the working elderly had jumped from 13% in 1995 to 41% in 2011. This means that among the working elderly, 41% had income from work, family members and state assistance amounting to less than 40% of the median income in the workforce. This suggests that many seniors are working past retirement age not just because they want to, but because they had to, and many in this category are women.",29,325,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00325

I would like to call on the Government to study this issue of the elderly working poor, especially involving women, more closely and adopt urgent measures to tackle the issue. One possible line of attack would be to look at how social service and community development agencies helping to place the elderly in jobs could also help the elderly draw up favourable contracts for service and provide advice and retraining opportunities to improve their income prospects.",30,326,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00326

In fact, from 2012 to 2017, the wages of those in the 20th percentile have shown the largest increase.

Second, we have a rapidly ageing population.

2018-02-27-T-016,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Let me first start with the need for safer workplaces. Earlier this month, the MOM reported that the number of workplace fatalities in 2017 had dropped to 42. This is the lowest figure in over a decade. This lowers our workplace fatality rate from 1.9 per 100,000 workers in 2014 to 1.2 in 2017.

We must, and we should, do more to ensure that our workplaces are safer. One area that we can do better moving forward is to encourage better near-miss reporting, so that we can reduce the occurrence of accidents. While workplace fatalities have decreased in 2017, MOM’s report also showed that the number of workplace injury cases remains high. There were close to 12,500 workplace injury cases in 2017, with 574 workers sustaining serious injuries. This can be a worrying sign. Does it mean that the dip in fatal accidents was simply down to luck? A structured and well-participated near-miss reporting regime would help to better identify dangerous work conditions, and early interventions can help bring down the accident rate.",6,538,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00538
2018-02-27-T-016,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"To make the next quantum leap in reducing workplace fatalities in the next decade, we will need bolder strategies to make Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) more pervasive in every workplace. During a recent Tripartite study visit to Finland, we learnt that Finland mandates that there must be one elected Occupational Safety and Health representative in workplaces where there are at least 10 employees working regularly. This has helped Finland achieve a workplace fatality rate of below 1.0 per 100,000 workers. Should Singapore, too, have a mandatory WSH officer in every company?",7,539,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00539
2018-02-27-T-016,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"For a start, perhaps a more practical approach would be to make it compulsory for companies to appoint a WSH representative as part of the certification for BizSAFE Level 3. There is, currently, no such provision for companies applying for BizSAFE Level 3. For now, companies must appoint a Risk Management Champion (RMC) for BizSAFE Level 2.

This is where we can do more to improve the Return-To-Work (RTW) Programme, which was recently started in November 2017. The RTW grant is currently restricted to Small and Medium Enterprises. To promote and deepen the RTW culture, the Government should consider extending the grant to large corporations, too. In the event an injured worker requires a change of employer and work scope due to a workplace accident, the current RTW grant does not cover vocational rehabilitation. The RTW grant should be extended to cover such cases.",9,541,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00541

As we continue in our war against diabetes, we must do more to help shape the eating habits of Singaporeans and lower the barriers to healthy eating. In many of my union visits, I have seen many staff canteens at the workplaces. A good place to start would be to encourage these staff canteens to sell healthier food. We check on what food and drinks are sold in school canteens to ensure that our children eat well in school. Perhaps it is time that we start a Healthy Canteen programme at our workplaces to ensure that there are healthier food options at our staff canteens.",13,545,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00545
2018-02-27-T-016,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"One common complaint is that healthy food is often more expensive. To address that, the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU), which operates 45 canteens islandwide, introduced brown rice at a subsidised rate. If you eat at our NTWU canteens, it is cheaper to buy brown rice than white rice. We also encourage our canteen operators to serve coffee and tea without sugar as the base drink. But if you want to add sugar, there is a sugar counter at the side. But of course, we also put up posters at the sugar counter to remind you of diabetes. So, please do not add too much sugar when you go to the sugar counter.",14,546,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00546
2018-02-27-T-016,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"For individuals, one of the biggest push factors for them to embark on a healthy lifestyle comes from knowing their own health status. This is why health screenings are important. In a joint project with the HPB and our public transport operators, the union organised a free health screening for 1,000 of our bus captains, testing them for their blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol. Sadly, but not unexpected, 80% of the bus captains tested failed at least one of the three health indicators. And surprisingly, 80% of these bus captains who had issues with their health, were doing a health screening for their first time. What is heartening to note is that after going through a period of health coaching, a third of these bus captains managed to achieve a pass in all three health indicators after six months. This shows the importance of early detection and early intervention. I, therefore, urge all employers to make free annual health screening a norm in their staff welfare benefits.",15,547,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00547

The stressors of everyday life can take a toll on even the most strong-willed individuals. Like physical health, we must focus our attention on the early detection and prevention of mental health issues. A study was recently launched by the Institute of Mental Health and the NUS School of Public Health to examine the association between physical health and mental health, with the results expected to be released in 2021. As we work on the major physical health pillars under the umbrella of occupational health, the benefits to mental health should also be examined in the coming years, as our workforce faces increasing stress, having to adapt constantly to the rapidly changing economy.",16,548,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00548

What we can do, however, is to strive towards equality in basic human experiences – a safe home, a good and meaningful job, a chance for our children to prosper and find their purpose in life; to value each and every one of our Singaporeans and ensure that, for generations to come, they are able to build better lives in this garden city we call home.",8,557,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00557

Of course, over time, the interest rate went up. Incidentally, I should add here that although I would consider Peter a savvy man about finance, it is well-known that the cognitive tax on the lower-income is higher.",13,562,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00562

We could, for example, allow a means-tested way to facilitate the shift of private loans back to HDB, especially when their interest rates are so high above HDB rates. To do so does not require us to incur more expenditure ─ it merely shifts the interest profits from the bank and puts half of this in Peter’s pocket and, the other half, in a sense, in the Government.",17,566,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00566

At the same time, we must see the need to allocate resources more urgently to men like Peter.

In this, we ought to be more generous to men like Peter and find ever more ways in the name of equality and justice to bring him and his family along with us and ensure his two boys fight for a land they believe in.

Those who never achieve because the odds are perpetually stacked against them?",9,654,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00654

2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Currently, the Government has adopted the ""many helping hands"" approach to plug the gaps where Government schemes are less able to deliver. That is to say, funding and activation of manpower are provided for self-help community groups to address these areas. Encouraging community engagement and volunteerism is important. But we need to provide care and support in a sustained and meaningful way. More importantly, how can we provide assistance without making those who need help feel that they have to prove that “they have worked hard but not achieved enough and hence, is worthy of support?”",17,662,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00662

Have we also then made those who have failed to achieve believe in the narrative that it was because of personal failing that one cannot do better and accept this narrative that it is not a dignified existence? How then do we tell those who do not succeed by society’s standards that they have not failed? How do we tell them there should be no shame in seeking help? Or do we look at them, and say, ""You are not working hard enough, so you do not deserve support""?",18,663,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00663

Maybe they grew up in a poor household, unable to afford books, educational toys and enrichment classes. Maybe they grew up in a broken home, with little parental supervision, so they spend their days and nights at the playground. By the time these people go to school, by the time they leave school, by the time they enter the workforce, I do not have to say it. We know what the outcome is. For every one person who says, ""I came from a poor upbringing but now I am a success"", there are many others who did not succeed.",19,664,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00664

I quote, ""The main obstacle is ourselves – our organisation and all our entrenched processes, bureaucracy and a culture of being afraid to fail because all these years we have succeeded.""",29,674,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00674
2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Indeed, our biggest stumbling blocks are ourselves. An innovative culture is one that does not shy away from asking difficult questions. Innovators often demonstrate different points of views from the conventional or the establishment. As a functioning democratic system, we need to safeguard spaces for such discourses, not only because we should respect differences, not only because it is politically expedient to do so, but because we can learn from differing views, widen our perspective and become stronger in the process.",30,675,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00675
2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Here, I would like to highlight the work of an important group of people, the NGOs and the activists on the ground. They have worked incredibly hard against all odds, over many years, to find means of addressing the plights of the less privileged or accepted groups of people amongst us – the poor, disabled, LGBT people, foreign workers, inmates facing the death penalty and so on. Some of them have been working at this for more than 30, 40 or 50 years. Sometimes, their work, while not in opposition to the Government, can confront the Government's position.",31,676,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00676
2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"So, why do they do it? Are they agitators who are just concerned about themselves? No. They do this because they have the same vision that Minister Heng had mentioned  to ""build a better home and provide for a better quality of life for our people"". They raise issues to highlight hidden problems, make the invisible visible. They are concerned about solving problems and eradicating prejudice and injustice.",32,677,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00677
2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Activists by and large do not want to incite trouble. They do not want to be at loggerheads with the state. In fact, they want to get the state on their side, so that policies can be changed. They ask questions because they are patriotic. At the core of their activism lies the deep belief in achieving happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation, through a system that is just and equal to all.",33,678,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00678
2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Sometimes, when activists feel that they are not heard, they appeal for support from the public, hoping that the public will hear them out. This is what a functioning democracy is all about. Democracy is not just about votes and electorates, but a system that allows different groups of people to pose their questions and opinions, to start a discourse, hoping more people will be more aware of our social problems, get involved and make a difference.",34,679,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00679
2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"This is patriotism. Patriotism is not always convenient or comfortable. Patriotism can sometimes come in the form of thorns in our sides. But patriotism comes from a good place and demands that we all do better – not only for ourselves, but for our fellowmen and, most importantly, for our country.",35,680,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00680
2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"So, what then is the role of the Government in this? How can the state encourage constructive questioning?",36,681,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00681
2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"This is where my experience as an artist comes in useful. Asking hard questions always begins with messiness. We first need to acknowledge the mess. Then, together, we wade through the messiness, sort things out and listen to different views. Soon, we will find and agree on one brilliant idea. But we need more than just one brilliant idea. We need many ideas, working together, serving as many people as possible.",37,682,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00682

There are many patriotic people like that in Singapore.",38,683,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00683
2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"But this country also needs patriotic people of a different kind.

Those who want to improve our system for one and all Singaporeans.",39,684,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00684
2018-02-27-T-016,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"And, lastly, I would like to appeal to this Government to participate in this dialogue; let yourself be a vulnerable observer, a vulnerable listener. Listen to the voices, to the stories and narratives by first acknowledging your vulnerability as a human being. Allow your values to be challenged, be confronted and to invest into the emotional truths of the activists and the underserved, before making judgement and proposing solutions. Only with vulnerable listening, then the policies formulated can be more humane, more just, more equal.",40,685,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00685
2018-02-27-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Mr Speaker, growth still matters because it creates opportunities for young Singaporeans to rise; the means to maintain our defence and infrastructure; resources for fiscal redistribution – for the poor, the lost, the least – to build a more inclusive society.",1,686,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00686
2018-02-27-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"And growth itself can shape inequality. As I shared two years ago in the Budget debate, ""When a society is low on opportunity, it is the rent-seekers and owners of old capital who extract profits.""",2,687,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00687
2018-02-27-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"But how we grow also shapes how equal a society we become. For example, economist César Hidalgo at MIT has found that countries with higher economic complexity tend to have lower inequality. Some of this is because complex industries need skilled workers and supporting enterprises – which means the workers and SMEs have more stake in a more equitable economic structure. This also contrasts with less complex economies, simpler economies where the income distribution may follow the controlling interests of resource ownership – who owns an oil well, who owns farmland, who owns production facilities.",3,688,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00688
2018-02-27-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Another finding from Hidalgo's team is that when you study economic structure, you can see how the pattern of exports evolves over time – usually along what they call adjacencies, which means it diversifies towards products which are similar to the existing exports.",4,689,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00689
2018-02-27-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"But what are the lessons for Singapore? Firstly, good quality growth can reduce income inequality. When you have a diverse economy, more paths for people to rise, more paths for workers and students to do well. Everyone building deep skills, everyone having a stake in the workplace, in industry and in the economy. Secondly, we can also see that, left to the market alone, the structure of an economy evolves bit by bit, stepwise along adjacencies – which means, to transform, there has to be bold efforts by industry and Government.",5,690,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00690

Not just digitising today's businesses, but creating new business models. For example, if you look at life sciences  data science is what turned DNA sequencing into genomics and is what drives personalised medicine, helping patients around the world. E-commerce and retail are more than just going cashless. It is about knowing your customers even better than they know themselves.

The development of human capital is imperative and should also be done in tandem with the development of digital skills.",11,734,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00734
2018-02-27-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The second area is to focus on the benefits for families in the area of education. As an educator, I strongly believe that education is an important leveller that enables social mobility. While the increase in Edusave contributions will benefit all students, it would also be ideal if we could provide targeted help in larger quantums to those in our community who need an additional leg-up. For example, can we consider an enhanced financial assistance scheme where there are different tiers of Edusave grants and top-ups, depending on family income?",12,735,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00735
2018-02-27-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),Other initiatives that we could consider would include making student care more accessible and affordable by giving higher levels of subsidies to lower-income families and prioritising student care services for children of single working-parents because these families typically do not have the same level of social support that dual-parent families have.,13,736,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00736
2018-02-27-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The final area I would like to focus on is that of the enhanced Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) designed to benefit families. I welcome the different enhancements that the Budget has made to the PHG. I believe that these enhancements will, in the long run, promote family ties and encourage family members to live near one another.",14,737,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00737
2018-02-27-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Having an extended family living close to one another will provide a much-needed social support network. This is especially important in Singapore’s ageing society where dual-income families are norms rather than exceptions. As such, grandparents are great sources of support for grandchildren when parents are out at work and the daily interaction between grandchildren and grandparents are wonderful ways to keep the elderly mentally and physically active and engaged.",15,738,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00738
2018-02-27-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Singles, too, can also play their part in an extended family network. One of the new initiatives in the PHG is the introduction of the $10,000 subsidy for singles who are buying resale flats to live near their parents. While this will no doubt encourage singles to live in proximity to their parents, the impact of the subsidy on actual purchases will be different, depending on the differing prices of the estate where the parents live.",16,739,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00739
2018-02-27-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"For example, someone whose parents live in a mature estate could expect to pay a lot more for a basic flat to live near their parents, as compared to someone who is buying an equivalent flat to live near their parents in a non-mature estate. The difference could be in the tens of thousands, which is quite substantial for a single individual.",17,740,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00740
2018-02-27-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Instead of a fixed amount, could the Government consider having a PHG that is based on the percentage of the selling price of the resale flat, subject to a minimum of the original base of $10,000 and a maximum ceiling? This would be helpful for those who have little choice but to buy flats in more mature estates because their parents happen to be living in those estates. Ideally, this principle can eventually be applied to other proximity-based housing grants as well in the future.",18,741,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00741
2018-02-27-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the unexpected Budget surplus that we have this year is exceptional and we must not assume that we will have a surplus of this quantum again. Indeed, the next decade will see Singapore undertake several major projects to upgrade our healthcare systems, transportation network, infrastructure and to beef up various aspects of our security.",19,742,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00742
2018-02-27-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I understand that the only way for us to ensure that we do not overly burden our future generation is to ensure that we have a fiscally sustainable and prudent Budget now. Having said that, it is important that the Government also remembers to temper any future tax increases with the appropriate measures and schemes to help those who need assistance and help when that day comes.",20,743,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00743
2018-02-27-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I conclude my speech in support of the Budget.",21,744,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00744
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Budget.",1,745,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00745
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"I would like to talk about shifting our youths' mindset towards ASEAN. But before that, I would like to make three brief points about the Budget.",2,746,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00746
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"One, we must be wary about dipping more into our reserve income. We can argue about the precise percentage of NIRC to use, but the important thing is we must continue to grow our reserves. If our reserves do not grow, it may not continue to anchor the stability of our growing economy. As a small city-state, Singapore has been described as a small boat in a large ocean. During the last big storm, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, our reserves served as an anchor, thereby providing us with much-needed stability.",3,747,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00747
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Recently, some have commented that our reserves have already gotten too much and we can afford to spend a little bit more of our reserve income. However, I feel that many commentators did not talk about the fact that Singapore's economy is still growing and we are actually a small ship that is continuing to grow in size.",4,748,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00748
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"With geographical uncertainty and the rolling back of financial regulations in US, the only certainty is that bigger and larger financial storms will eventually come to our shores. So, if our reserves fail to keep up with our growing economy, maybe not at the next crisis, but a few crises down the road, our reserves may not be of a sufficient size to anchor the bigger Singapore economy then. And if Singapore flounders, who will save us? The International Monetary Fund (IMF) or World Bank? Even if they do, at what cost, especially for the average Singaporean? Therefore, we must be wary of the serious implications of not growing our reserves.",5,749,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00749
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"My second point is that our Government must actively help our seniors to monetise their assets to pay for their retirement. Because retirees have no income, they are more impacted by the GST, compared to other Singaporeans. Some retirees, even those living in private estates, are asset-rich and cash-poor. To help them manage the cost of living, I hope our Government can help put some urgency in helping them monetise their assets. I have spoken about this issue in depth during the recent February Parliamentary Motion on ""Support for Senior Citizens"". Therefore, I hope the Government can continue to actively ensure that such options exist in Singapore, either through reverse mortgage of larger flats in private estates, or through specialised reverse mortgage funds like those done in France.",6,750,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00750
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Third, I hope we can all recognise that ITMs are a long-term economic transformation plan and not push for immediate results, especially in terms of economic output numbers. Recently, some commentators have spoken about the effectiveness of the ITMs. I would like to point out that any major economic transformation needs at least three to five years before it is fully illustrated and flows into the economic numbers, especially economic output numbers.",7,751,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00751
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Let me illustrate. For example, the Government can launch a new programme to encourage businesses to use Artificial Intelligence in, let us say, year one. Major businesses, with their budgetary process, will need up to a year to make major shifts to take advantage of that programme. The efforts of the business will also take time to impact the bottom line.",8,752,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00752
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"After the bottom line is made, it would still take many more months, even one to two years, before the improvements are reflected in any company’s audited accounts. And then, more time is needed before the numbers are finally submitted to ACRA and to our Department of Statistics. That is why we need three to five years before we can fully comment on the effectiveness of programmes, in terms of economic output numbers – whether it is GDP, Value Added per worker or productivity numbers.",9,753,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00753
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"In the meantime, I feel that our debate should focus on input indicators of economic transformation, by which I mean the quality and the accessibility of transformation programmes for our businesses and workers. And let us not get fixed on immediate economic output numbers.",10,754,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00754
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Let me now touch on my main point on the speech today, which is getting Singaporeans to ""think ASEAN"". I agree with Minister Heng that Singapore should be a Global-Asia Node of technology, innovation and enterprise. By and large, I think we are making good progress. However, I think we can do more to tap a rising ASEAN.",11,755,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00755
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"I am glad that our economic policies are keeping up with a rising ASEAN. Beyond the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), we are also setting up the Infrastructure Office, which is contributing to more infrastructure development within ASEAN. We are expanding our Global Innovative Alliance into ASEAN's Innovation Network and we are pushing for the creation of an ASEAN e-Commerce platform.",12,756,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00756
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Beyond the announced measures, I would like to further suggest, as ASEAN Chair this year, that Singapore encourage other major ASEAN economies to increase funding for the ASEAN Secretariat. A stronger secretariat will improve ASEAN's ability to track and execute various commitments, so as to unlock the full potential of agreed measures.",13,757,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00757
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"For example, a stronger secretariat will be able to help us better coordinate action in response to non-tariff protectionist measures within the AEC. I am also heartened to see the strengthening of talent development programmes. This includes Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for Southeast Asian Ready Talent, SkillsFuture ASEAN Leadership Programme, GOASEAN Award, Young Talent Programme, and Infrastructure Development Internship. I hope that should these programmes prove successful, the Government can quickly scale them up.",14,758,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00758
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"The creation of Enterprise Singapore, as well as the rollout of more programmes to support companies to internationalise, will strengthen our efforts. However, I feel that much more work is needed for Singaporeans to ""Think ASEAN"".",15,759,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00759
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Today, there is a dichotomy between the tremendous opportunities offered by ASEAN and the perception of ASEAN by everyday Singaporeans. Many Singaporeans I speak to, associate our neighbouring countries with affordable holiday destinations or places where we go abroad to do community service.",16,760,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00760
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"In fact, many Singaporeans assume that many parts of ASEAN are backward regions and will stay so for a long time. But many parts of ASEAN are growing quickly, and these assumptions are no longer true. As such, it is very important for us to change the mindset, especially among our youths. After all, while our Government and our companies are more involved in ASEAN, the full benefits can truly be realised if our Singaporeans are personally involved in the opportunities.",17,761,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00761
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"So, I would like to propose five ways we can encourage our people, especially our youths and PMETS, to see the possibilities in ASEAN.",18,762,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00762
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"One, we could shift the balance of tertiary education internships, study trips and exchange programmes towards developing countries, especially ASEAN. And when they go abroad, we should ensure that our youths see the bright spots and centre of innovations within ASEAN.",19,763,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00763
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Two, we can promote exchanges between student leaders. As a young Singaporean studying in the US many years ago, I was deeply involved in the largest student leader exchange between the US and China. That allowed me to understand that lifelong friendships can be forged over time, if the programme is executed well. There is scope to do such a programme, linking the future leaders of Singapore with those of our neighbouring ASEAN countries.",20,764,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00764
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Three, we should encourage more interactions between our students and officials from ASEAN countries who are currently studying in Singapore. Today, many ASEAN officials spend short training stints in Singapore and they are here because they are slated for greater things back in their home country. Therefore, there is scope for us to network our students with them, so that we can benefit from their in-depth insights that are not frequently covered publicly.",21,765,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00765
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Four, we should encourage the teaching of ASEAN-specific knowledge. By that, I mean getting our tertiary institutions to teach ASEAN languages, business cultures and political culture through both formal courses and guest speaker series.",22,766,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00766
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Singapore has deep expertise in the region through many excellent institutions, such as the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Asia Competitiveness Institute (ACI) and Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS). We also have multilateral institutes, such as World Bank, which has a deep presence in Singapore. Our leading bankers, lawyers and management consultants have tremendous experience working in ASEAN. Therefore, we can tap on these institutions and our experts to open up courses and talks to our students and young entrepreneurs.",23,767,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00767
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"My last recommendation is to create an annual Business ASEAN conference, much like the successful Business China Conference series, which put an annual spotlight on the exciting developments in ASEAN.",24,768,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00768
2018-02-27-T-016,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"The goal of all of these is to get our people to ""Think ASEAN"".

2018-02-27-T-016,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The GST was introduced in 1994 at the rate of 3%. It was increased nine years later in 2003 to 4% and, subsequently, in quick succession, to 5% the next year in 2004 and 7% another three years later in 2007. It will be over 10 years by the time it will be raised again. Under what circumstances can the Government use other combinations of income instruments to replace the tax contribution from the GST increase?",6,776,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00776
2018-02-27-T-016,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Also, what is the expected GDP contribution arising from the large-scale infrastructure projects, such as Changi Airport Terminal 5, Tuas mega port and the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR)? How would these go to reduce our reliance on future GST increases?",7,777,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00777
2018-02-27-T-016,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In addition, will the Government consider a cap on the proportion of GST contribution to total revenue, since there will be future returns on investments made with our current reserves and the infrastructure investments we are embarking on?",8,778,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00778
2018-02-27-T-016,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We also have to consider if we should set a ceiling on our GST rate in the future. For now, even after increasing it to 9%, our GST is at the low end of the spectrum, compared to many other developed countries. European countries’ GST or Value-Added Tax (VAT) is between 10% and 20%. The standard rates in Denmark and Sweden are 25%. While Denmark's VAT is set at one rate, other countries, such as Sweden, Germany and France, have reduced rates applied to essential goods, such as food. I agree with our Government’s decision to keep our GST at one flat rate to minimise administrative and compliance costs. However, going forward, should our GST continue to increase, we should review and examine other GST models with lower rates on essential goods and services to reduce the burden on the lower-income groups.",9,779,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00779
2018-02-27-T-016,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In planning for GST increases, we have to take into account both the pace of wage increases that can be attained and the projected inflation rate, so as to reduce the impact of the increase in the cost of living on our citizens.",10,780,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00780

Is it necessary to expand Budgets every year, as long as they are pegged to inflation rates? Is it not possible for each Ministry to continue its operations within the allocated Budget to strive for cost-effectiveness through work design improvements and taking advantage of technological innovations? Instead of pegging departments' budgets to GDP growth, it may be better to review and justify investments and expenditures annually, even in years when there is GDP growth.

I note that an Infrastructure Office will be established to bring together local and international firms from across the value chain. I would like to ask the Minister  who will this Office serve – Government-linked companies? Temasek-linked companies like Surbana Jurong? Or our private sector? How will local consultants and contractors benefit?",2,790,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00790
2018-02-27-T-016,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Next, even before the Budget, the Government has shared plans to transform industries through the development of Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). These are aimed at addressing issues within each industry and fostering deeper partnerships between the Government, firms, industries, trade associations and chambers. This is good in principle, but implementation would not be so straightforward, given that every industry, every business, every individual has different levels of expectations and commitment. Communication and engagement between the different bodies will always pose challenges. It is unrealistic to put together a plan on paper and expect everybody to go through with it and resolve the problems by themselves. Thus, I propose there should be a full-time secretariat for each industry's ITM, to visit the trade associations and speak with the ground, to help resolve differences and administrative issues and ensure that each partnership is as effective and efficient as possible.",3,791,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00791

Thus far, those who have utilised their SkillsFuture credits have found the scheme to be encouraging and, more importantly, they have gained useful skills that will help them in their careers, or even just to enrich their lives and learn something new. I hope the Government will consider investing more resources in SkillsFuture, such as giving more credits to those who have already used theirs.",4,792,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00792

First of all, housing, an integral part of our lives and an asset that supposedly gives us financial security in old age.

Some of these flats are now at least 30 years old and prone to defects and safety issues. Can the Minister share future plans for HIP for ageing flats?",5,793,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00793

This is becoming increasingly common in the older private estates, where the land lease is expiring and it is difficult to sell their house. There are also people who live in older HDB flats with a lease of less than 60 years and they find it very challenging to sell their flats. This is not about monetising the house but getting some money from the sales to cover the cost for the next house. As more housing estates start to age, this problem will become more rampant. While there is Silver Housing Scheme (SHS) for residents who are 55 years old and above, this scheme requires most of the proceeds to be topped up into the CPF and may not meet the needs of all elderly.

Old houses tend to have shorter leases and are difficult to fetch a good price, no matter whether it is a private property or an HDB flat.

As HIP is only applicable to units built before 1986, units built after 1987, although very old, they have not been renovated with low costs.

So, there is a chance that even though there is a move towards Asia, we may lose those opportunities because we are less competitive than other parts of Asia.

The nuts and bolts of being vibrant and innovative are the reality that you or your business could become irrelevant very soon because someone else has come up with an innovation that makes you irrelevant.,11,844,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00844
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"For countries and big economies that have invested heavily in one area, one sector, for example, the Scandinavian countries back in the days of Nokia and Ericsson, they have also paid a heavy price when those sectors subsequently pulled back when the iPhone, for example, came and took the mobile phone market away.",12,845,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00845
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The reality about the globalised economy is that no matter how hard you work, your rice bowl can be stolen at any time. So, even if we succeed, it is important for individuals and businesses to know that things may happen beyond your control that will change the playing field dynamically. While the Government can enable you to pick up new skills even in that situation, it is normal for this to happen and you have to be able to adapt to that.",13,846,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00846
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Related to this is the second important thing that I think Government can do, and this is part of the Budget – Being a Caring and Cohesive Society. There are two underlying threads in this.",14,847,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00847
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"On the one hand, of course, the Government is saying that we will try and be there as a safety net. For those who have low-income, there will be social transfers to help. Education is still of fundamental importance. Education is now being provided at an even earlier stage, even extending to the preschool sector. If we start enabling education at an earlier age, that will, hopefully, reduce the risk of inequalities, even at the time people enter Primary 1. All this is necessary.",15,848,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00848
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"If one studied the Greek wisdom, Plato's Republic is said to be the ideal republic, all children will be taken away from their parents and put into institutions, so that everyone has an equal footing. Of course, that is theoretical; it is unlikely to happen in practice. I do not think any parent would want their children taken away.",16,849,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00849
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"But the reality is the more you equalise the education playing field, the better you are to have at least equality at the starting point. This Budget is making important steps in that respect. Accessible Primary 1 education was the best way to do it 30, 40 years ago. Now, we have gone even further.",17,850,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00850
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"More than that, the second part that is important is also the sense of social responsibility. There are gentle nudges in this respect in terms of encouraging charitable and community work and participation.",18,851,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00851
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"It is important for people who succeed to also realise that their success is not just because of their own efforts or abilities, but also because of the environment they lived in and also because of luck. The dynamism in the modern economy, the line between success and failure is sometimes not easy to identify. Good people may fail, notwithstanding the best of efforts. People may succeed one year and fail the next.",19,852,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00852
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"It is important for people to realise when they succeed that that is a time to be generous and to give back. This sense of responsibility is something the successful have to understand and accept. That is probably going to be the key to being a truly caring society. When you succeed, you must understand that it was not you alone and ""It is time for me to give back"". And when that success disappears, maybe someone else will be kind to you at a time when you need it. This is the core of a caring and cohesive society. But we must realise that our success is not our own and our misery is not always someone else's fault. So, we must take responsibility for our success while, at the same time, be gracious when we succeed.",20,853,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00853
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Let me also address the final aspect of the Budget which I am heartened by and that is fiscal sustainability which is one of the things that many of us are worried about. With the ageing population, with a shrinking workforce, how were we going to actually fund the increasing social spending needs.",21,854,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00854
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),We have been blessed to have had a very generous amount in reserves and we have been able to use a fair bit of this through the Net Investment Returns Framework.,22,855,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00855
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The big question is  will this be sustainable and, if so, for how long? I am grateful the Finance Minister has put forward a plan – to me a fairly reasonable plan – to explain how this can be made sustainable.",23,856,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00856
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Many of us were anticipating a rise in taxes and it is good to know upfront that the anticipated rise is 2% in GST plus a few other taxes on cigarettes, carbon and other areas. It is good for us to understand that this is going to be the cost to be sustainable for, say, the next 10 years, at least up to 2025. These things are dynamic but it is good to know that this is what we have to prepare for.",24,857,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00857
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"A tax increase is never popular. It is never an easy thing to do. Of course, it is natural for there to be some push-back, for people to say, ""Why do we not look at some alternatives?"" The Workers' Party has suggested using land sale revenues upfront. I think my colleague Lim Biow Chuan has addressed this. I should add, I would not laugh this suggestion off because, previously, I had considered this myself at one point. But I agree fundamentally that it is wrong in principle to sell land and spend that capital upfront. Some other countries do it but I do not think that is a reason for us to follow suit. It is more responsible for us to put the revenue from land sales or anything we get into the reserves and use any income we have from that. Because, ultimately, land is an asset, and, I think as some speakers have said, it is our most finite asset. The best we can do is treat that as an asset even after it is sold, and if there is income, then we can use that as part of the NIR Framework.",25,858,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00858
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"So, in that sense, all this goes towards making sure that we have a financially sustainable Budget. All our expenses should be paid for with our annual operating revenues. If there are investments in long-term infrastructure, then, of course, for this, we can use hybrid models, including, perhaps, borrowing to be paid for with future income from that investment.",26,859,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00859
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"All these are financially sustainable ways and that is probably what the next generation will be most comforted by, that we will do our best to improve Singapore, to create opportunities in Singapore, to make it a place where they and their children will have opportunities.",27,860,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00860
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Even if we succeed, there will be people who will have difficulties and it is important for us to be generous in that respect, with both ourselves as well as the Government, and to make sure that these people have a chance to get back up again. That is the best we can do. We have had many analogies from different people on pushing the car, so that it runs on its own as well as a trampoline. But I think these are all important analogies to let our people know what the real message is, that, ultimately, it is for you to be self-sufficient and to sustain yourself, but there are people there to give you a hand when you are down. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will conclude with a few words in Tamil.",28,861,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00861
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"(In Tamil)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xx.] This is an important Budget because it plans not only for the next year, but for beyond the next decade. The world is changing rapidly and Singapore is changing, too. The rise of automation is going to change the nature of work and, if our businesses and workers do not adapt, the jobs and opportunities will go elsewhere. It is, therefore, important for both our businesses and workers to take advantage of the opportunities available to keep up and keep ahead of the times.",29,862,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00862
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Singapore, too, is changing, the biggest being the demographic change. As our population ages, we will have a much higher demand for healthcare needs at a time when our working population will fall. There will also be a much greater need for infrastructure spending, both to renew ageing infrastructure as well as to build new ones, so Singapore can continue to stay ahead of the curve. These are big financial demands.",30,863,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00863
2018-02-27-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"However, this Budget gives us hope for optimism because it shows the Government’s plan for dealing with these demographic changes. This includes rises in taxes, including GST, and looking for other new forms of income to pay for infrastructure. This Budget sets out a roadmap for dealing with our long-term challenges in the decade ahead and to help Singapore not only overcome these challenges, but to remain a special place. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this Budget.",31,864,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00864

Lives where seniors, with increasing years, can still enjoy active, healthy and fulfilling days, live in their own homes and environment within the community and have little or no dependence on institutional care. Many seniors prefer such independent living with their loved ones and friends in the community. This is achievable by advocating preventive healthcare.

So, daily meals and programmes are provided with this aim in mind. Balanced nutrition wards off diseases. Physical exercise keeps the bones and muscles strong to minimise falls and fractures and to facilitate good mobility and independence. Social and mental well-being prevents isolation and depression.

Those who adopted a regimen of good nutrition, physical activity and cognitive stimulation were less frail than those who did not. In mild cases, their frailty could even be reversed. Those who fulfilled only one factor, such as eating well but not exercising regularly, did not fare as well as those who managed all three.

One way to slow down this degeneration would be to consume enough protein.",11,913,2018-02-27-T-016-S-00913

Taking them to festive activities organised by grassroots organisations can bring cheer to many, especially those living alone. Visiting them, especially by familiar grassroots leaders or befrienders, at their homes when they fail to show up at the centres and giving them medical or social assistance quickly if they are ill are very useful.

Social help was arranged for his daily living and food was sent to him daily. A physiotherapist visited regularly for his rehabilitation. Within six months, from being immobile, he could slowly walk again. Today, 10 years later, after his stroke, he is attending his SAC and other events organised by the Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng grassroots. My appreciation to all my Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng grassroots volunteers here. Best of all, Mr Tan could continue to live independently by himself, albeit walking with a limp from the stroke episode.

2018-02-27-T-024,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,The remaining claims involved 139 employers. A hundred and thirty-three of these employers ceased operations or faced business failure due to financial difficulties.

2018-02-27-T-025,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The national Jobs Bank has been designed to reduce the likelihood of having job postings that are inaccurate or advertise for positions that do not exist. Employers have to be Singapore-registered companies and provide their Unique Entity Number (UEN) to post jobs on Jobs Bank for accountability. Similarly, jobseekers apply for jobs only after logging in via SingPass. This creates an environment where jobseekers and employers can search for matches confidently.",1,971,2018-02-27-T-025-S-00971

2018-02-27-T-025,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Jobseekers who choose to use other Internet-based job portals are advised to select reputable sites where job advertisements are more likely to be authentic and accurately described.

Between 2010 and 2016, the proportion of startup owners who are locals aged 35 and below rose from 20% to 23%1. Surveys of young people in Singapore also affirm their growing entrepreneurial aspirations. For example, an NUS survey among tertiary students in Singapore reported that between 2011 and 2014, the percentage of students from Singapore Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs)with strong entrepreneurial intent rose from 37.5% to 62.5%2.

2018-02-27-T-026,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Given Singapore's fairly recent entry into the startup scene, Singapore has fared well in international benchmarking studies of global startup ecosystems. For example, in Startup Genome's 2017 Global Startup Ecosystem Report6, Singapore is ranked 12th overall, just below cities like Seattle and Paris and above Stockholm and Vancouver. Silicon Valley and New York City are the top-ranked cities, with Tel Aviv ranking 6th.",4,978,2018-02-27-T-026-S-00978
