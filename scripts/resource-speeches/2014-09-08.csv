2014-09-08-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,I welcome the Nominated Members of Parliament and look forward to their participation in the proceedings of this House. Order. Questions for Oral Answer.,1,23,2014-09-08-T-002-S-00023
2014-09-08-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,asked	 the Minister for Health with regard to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the spread through flights from the region (a) what contingency plans does the Ministry have in place to deal with such virulent conditions coming into Singapore; and (b) how prepared is our healthcare system to deal with any potential outbreak of contagious diseases.,1,24,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00024
2014-09-08-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"asked	 the Minister for Health (a) whether there is a necessity to detect and keep vigilant for any early signs of an Ebola outbreak from incoming and outgoing passengers travelling by air, sea or land; and (b) what are the contingency plans for such an outbreak of the virulent disease.",1,25,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00025
2014-09-08-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked	 the Minister for Health (a) what preventive measures and precautions has the Ministry been taking to prevent an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Singapore given Singapore's position as a key aviation hub in the region; (b) what is the Ministry's response and treatment plan should a person who has contracted the Ebola virus enter Singapore; and (c) what medical assistance will be provided to the person who has contracted the Ebola virus.,1,26,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00026
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 1 to 3 together?",1,27,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00027
2014-09-08-T-003,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,28,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00028
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The ongoing Ebola outbreak is limited to the African region of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and most recently, in Senegal, where an isolated imported case has been reported. A separate Ebola outbreak has been confirmed in a remote region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is not related to the outbreak in West Africa. Our current assessment is that the risk of Ebola spreading to Singapore is low due to the limited travel connectivity between Singapore and Africa. Prior to the Ebola outbreak, the number of travellers from these countries arriving in Singapore is small, with an average of about 30 travellers a month collectively from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and between 200 and 300 travellers a month from Nigeria.",1,29,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00029
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Since WHO declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 8 August 2014, many airlines have stopped flying to Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, the three countries with widespread active community transmission. The numbers of travellers from these countries to Singapore are even fewer now. In addition, transmission of Ebola requires direct contact with the blood and/or fluids of an infected person. It does not spread through the air like influenza. Nevertheless, while the risk is low, we cannot rule out the possibility of an imported case to Singapore.",2,30,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00030
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Hence, we have put in place measures to reduce the risk of infection to Singaporeans who travel to or are residing in affected countries, ensure early detection of cases and prevent spread in the event that we have an imported case of Ebola in Singapore.",3,31,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00031
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"To minimise the risk of infection to Singaporeans travelling to or residing in affected countries, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has advised Singaporeans against non-essential travel to the affected countries in Africa. For those who need to travel there, we have advised them on the precautionary measures to take, such as frequent hand washing and avoiding direct contact with blood and secretions or other body fluids of dead persons or animals. This information is available on the MOH website. In addition, Health Advisory Posters are also displayed at our Changi Airport Departure Halls. We have also worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Enterprise Singapore to disseminate this information through their networks.",4,32,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00032
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"MOH has worked with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), Changi Airport Group (CAG), Maritime and Ports Authority (MPA) and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to display health advisory posters at all air, land and sea checkpoints, and to distribute Health Advisory Notices (HANs) at our immigration counters to inbound nationals and travellers from Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. These passengers are advised to seek medical attention early if they develop symptoms within 21 days of arrival and to inform their doctor of their travel history. Contingency plans are in place at Changi Airport to manage passengers with signs of EVD. Such passengers will be isolated and transferred using a Portable Medical Isolation Unit (PMIU) to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) for further management. MOH will also extend these measures to Senegal and the DRC to ensure early detection of suspect cases.",5,33,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00033
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Healthcare staff are a key line of defence. Medical clinics and hospitals have been alerted, through professional circulars, to exercise vigilance and ensure early detection of possible suspect Ebola cases. Laboratories have also been advised of the testing procedures for Ebola.",6,34,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00034
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Management of suspect Ebola cases will be centralised in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), at a dedicated facility at the Communicable Diseases Centre 2 (CDC 2). All suspect cases will be triaged at the emergency departments, and as a precaution, isolated from other patients to minimise any risk of transmission. A case that has been admitted in another hospital will continue to be managed there to minimise risk of infection during transfer. All hospitals have put in place procedures for strict infection control measures when managing a suspect or confirmed case of Ebola. In the event of a confirmed case of Ebola in Singapore, MOH will carry out contact tracing and all close contacts of the confirmed case will be quarantined for 21 days from the time of last exposure.",7,35,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00035
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As there are no proven anti-viral drug treatments or vaccines yet available, a patient with Ebola will be given intensive supportive treatment. Healthcare workers attending to the patient will use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in addition to the strict infection control measures that have been put in place.",8,36,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00036
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Our healthcare system will continue to remain alert and prepared to manage any potential outbreaks of infectious diseases in Singapore and our hospitals have dedicated response plans, which include plans to ramp-up resources and re-deploy staff to respond to disease outbreak situations. They have also carried out regular exercise to familiarise our healthcare workers with the contingency response plans.",9,37,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00037
2014-09-08-T-003,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,Mr Alex Yam.,1,38,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00038
2014-09-08-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. Two supplementary questions. First, on 14 August, there was a brief scare. We saw a Nigerian woman who was at Gleneagles Medical Centre, subsequently placed into isolation at the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC). The news release triggered some amount of public alarm. Can I ask what plans does the Ministry have in place to coordinate the media aspects of such a medical emergency so as to reduce and prevent undue public alarm? Secondly, it is with regard to the experimental drug ZMapp. I would like to ask if the Ministry does hold stock of such medication in case of an outbreak.",1,39,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00039
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. On the question about the premature reporting of a suspected case in Singapore, I think, MOH is concerned about it. We have also written to the media to clarify with them and to ensure that in future reporting, they do check with the Ministry to prevent such false alarms.",1,40,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00040
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"With the regards to the use of some of the unproven medications that have been reported in the media, one of which that has been widely reported in the media is the experimental drug ZMapp. It consists of three monoclonal antibodies produced in a plant, and it is developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical. It was first reported to be used in infected humans very recently in July 2014. It was administered to two American health workers who had been infected with Ebola, and both appeared to have positive results, and have recovered. However, ZMapp was also administered to a 75-year-old Spanish priest with Ebola, who died eventually, and three other Liberian health workers, who showed improvement, although one of them eventually succumbed to the disease.",2,41,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00041
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"We have been informed by the manufacturer that there is a shortage of ZMapp at this point in time. We want to let Singaporeans know that while we monitor the situation very closely, ZMapp is not the mainstay of treatment for any patient infected with Ebola. Intensive supportive treatment is still the mainstay. We will continue to monitor the research that has been going on in ZMapp and we will use it when appropriate.",3,42,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00042
2014-09-08-T-003,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,Mrs Lina Chiam.,1,43,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00043
2014-09-08-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister of State whether there are any volunteer healthcare worker from Singapore working in the Ebola-stricken areas such as Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone in West Africa, and if there are Singaporeans working there, what precautions would MOH take when they return to Singapore after their stint as volunteers and caregivers?",1,44,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00044
2014-09-08-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank the Member for that question. Currently, we do not have any volunteers that are working in the affected areas, but we do not also prohibit or discourage volunteers from taking part in relief efforts in these affected countries. As a precautionary measure, MOH will keep very close track of these volunteers. Volunteers who have direct contact with patients will be monitored and put on phone surveillance for at least 21 days upon their return.",1,45,2014-09-08-T-003-S-00045
2014-09-08-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,asked	 the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) how many Singaporeans are there living or working in countries currently affected by the Ebola virus; and (b) what steps are taken to ensure that they will be given support should they need to evacuate or leave the country they are in.,1,46,2014-09-08-T-004-S-00046
2014-09-08-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),,1,47,2014-09-08-T-004-S-00047
2014-09-08-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"On 8 August 2014, World Health Organization's (WHO) Emergency Committee regarding the EVD ascertained that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The WHO has since recommended that EVD-related health advisories and information be provided to the general public and to travellers to the affected and at-risk areas. States have also been advised to be prepared to detect, investigate and manage Ebola cases.",2,48,2014-09-08-T-004-S-00048
2014-09-08-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"The Ministry of Health (MOH) issued a health advisory on EVD on 31 July 2014. In line with MOH's advisory, MFA also issued a travel notice on 1 August 2014 concerning the Ebola situation and advised Singaporeans to postpone non-essential travel to the affected areas.",3,49,2014-09-08-T-004-S-00049
2014-09-08-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"On the hon Member's query, there are currently 12 Singaporeans in Nigeria and one Singaporean in Liberia. They are all registered with MFA. MFA is in regular contact with the Singaporeans residing in Nigeria and Liberia and has urged them to consider returning to Singapore, especially if they do not have essential matters to attend to, so that they minimise their risks of potential exposure.",4,50,2014-09-08-T-004-S-00050
2014-09-08-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),The WHO has not placed a general international travel ban on the affected countries but has advised that any person with an illness consistent with the EVD should not be allowed to travel unless it is part of a medical evacuation. This applies to both EVD cases and individuals who have been traced to have had physical contact with individuals infected with EVD.,5,51,2014-09-08-T-004-S-00051
2014-09-08-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Should there be an overseas Singaporean who has shown symptoms of EVD or is a confirmed EVD case, MFA will work with the local authorities, employer and next-of-kin of the Singaporean, as well as with our Ministry of Health to facilitate the repatriation. However, the Singaporean must be medically certified to be fit for travel before evacuation arrangements can be made.",6,52,2014-09-08-T-004-S-00052
2014-09-08-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Our High Commissioner in Pretoria and Consulate-General in Lagos are monitoring developments closely and remain in contact with the local authorities. MFA, together with its overseas missions, stand ready to assist any Singaporean who requires consular assistance.",7,53,2014-09-08-T-004-S-00053
2014-09-08-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked	 the Minister for Manpower with the current policy to encourage those reaching 62 years to be offered re-employment (a) what checks are in place to protect those nearing 62 years from being retrenched as some employers may not wish to continue retaining them; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider more incentives to encourage employers to hire and retain older workers.,1,54,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00054
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),,1,55,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00055
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Nevertheless, we also appreciate that there might be legitimate reasons where businesses need to restructure or are just not able to keep some of their older workers. The Tripartite Guidelines on Re-employment of Older Workers give employers some flexibility in re-employing their older workers. For example, employers can re-employ employees with some modifications on re-negotiated terms. Where employers are unable to offer re-employment to eligible employees, they should offer such employees a one-off Employment Assistance Payment. In the unfortunate event where retrenchments are necessary, employers should carry out retrenchment responsibly and in consultation with the union if the company is unionised.",2,56,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00056
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Over the years, the Government has introduced several incentives to encourage the hiring and retention of older workers. We provide generous funding under WorkPro to help employers redesign jobs and the work environment to adapt to the ageing workforce. We also have the Special Employment Credit and Workfare Income Supplement to support employers and employees respectively to raise the employability of older low-wage Singaporeans.",3,57,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00057
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"We have seen positive outcomes from our efforts. The employment rate of older residents aged 55 to 64 has increased significantly, from 47% in June 2004 to 65% in June 2013. Re-employment rates have been high, with 99% of private sector local employees who turned 62 in the year ending June 2013 offered re-employment.",4,58,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00058
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),The Government will continue to monitor the situation to consider if further incentives are needed.,5,59,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00059
2014-09-08-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have two supplementary questions. Recently, I have seen several cases of residents not offered re-employment when they reached 62. I saw that the reason given when I appealed, it is poor performance. I would like to ask  can such cases be referred to the Ministry and what will the Ministry do for such cases?",1,60,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00060
2014-09-08-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Next, in order to encourage employers to re-employ older workers, would there be more incentives like tax rebate for the companies?",2,61,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00061
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Under the Retirement and Re-employment Act, employers are required to offer re-employment to workers turning 62 up to 65, taking into consideration two criteria. The first criterion would be satisfactory work performance, and the second criterion is medical fitness for further employment.",1,62,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00062
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"There have been some cases, since we implemented the retirement and re-employment legislation in 2012, on re-employment disputes. Most of the re-employment disputes pertain to performance or dispute over re-employment terms. These cases would be referred; they can approach a union, if the company is unionised, or directly to the Ministry. We have about 34 cases so far since the re-employment legislation started [Please refer to ""Clarification by Senior Minister of State for Manpower"", Official Report, 9 March 2014, Vol 92, Issue No 13.] Most of these cases would have been resolved through conciliation. For the remaining cases, they are still undergoing conciliation.",2,63,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00063
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regards to further incentives, as I have said, since the implementation of the re-employment legislation, as at June 2013, 99% of private sector employees who have reached the age of 62 have been offered re-employment. In fact, 96% of those who have taken up the re-employment offers did not have their basic wage cut.",3,64,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00064
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, we think that the implementation of the re-employment legislation has been relatively smooth. In fact, because of the re-employment legislation, as well as the several incentives that we have already implemented in terms of the Special Employment Credit, Workfare Income Supplement, and generous funding to WorkPro, our employment rate for older workers has increased, as I have noted earlier, from 47% in 2004 to 65% as of June 2013. This 65% was the target that we set to achieve for the employment rate for older workers in 2015. So, we have actually achieved the target ahead of the timeframe that we have set ourselves.",4,65,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00065
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Now, that does not mean that we will rest on our laurels. I would like to inform Members that this employment rate of 65% for older workers is comparable or even better than in some countries like South Korea and the United States, and quite near to the employment rate of older workers for Japan, which was at 65.4% in 2012. It is still lower than that in Sweden but generally because the employment rate of our female workforce, the older women, is lower. It has improved over time but we need to catch up on that.",5,66,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00066
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, as I have said, we will continue to monitor and see if further incentives are needed.",6,67,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00067
2014-09-08-T-005,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Thank you, Madam. I just want to thank the Senior Minister of State for the fact that the participation of seniors has increased to 65%. I am more concerned as to what the Ministry is doing to reach out to the employers to ensure that there are fair re-employment contracts for these workers. And with an ageing population and more feeling fitter these days, will the re-employment age be moved in the near future?",1,68,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00068

2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"First, let me say that we have undertaken a very proactive tripartite promotional approach to engage employers to encourage them to adopt fair employment practices. Just this year in June, through the Tripartite Committee on the Employability of Older Workers, we have launched a promotional campaign entitled ""Tap on the Wealth of Experience"" to highlight and promote the invaluable experience of our older workers to the employers, and to encourage the employers to tap on the wealth of experience of older workers, to hire and retain them, through a series of publicity efforts which are still ongoing.",2,70,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00070
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regards to the extension of the re-employment age, I think we have said that the Tripartite Committee is in discussion to consider the extension of the re-employment age from 65 to 67. On when we will do it and how we will do it, we are working to wrap up discussions and we will announce the outcome of the discussions soon. In the meantime, I want to encourage employers to continue to offer employment to the older workers beyond the age of 65, as long as they are able and willing to continue to work.",3,71,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00071

I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State this  while numbers are important and while we have achieved our target of 65% employment rate, but what is the quality of the employment? Are we doing any studies or looking in terms of the quality of the employment provided to the senior citizens, as well as whether are they happy with it, and what else can we do to improve that?",1,72,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00072

We will continue to look at how we can encourage employers to retain, as well as hire older workers.",1,73,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00073
2014-09-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Given the tight labour market situation, you would find that many employers are coming forward to say that they are willing to employ older workers as long as they are able and willing to work. Through WorkPro, for instance, we are helping the employers to re-design their jobs as well as work environment to adapt to the ageing workforce.",2,74,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00074

We want to make sure that Singaporeans will have access to good quality and good-paying jobs, and that is why our focus has been on lifelong learning and we invest heavily on Continuing Education and Training (CET), so that our workers can continue to upgrade their skills and remain relevant and employable. In fact, Workfare Training Support Scheme is one avenue through which we provide incentives to the low-wage older workers to upgrade their skills, so that they can enhance their employability, as well as get better jobs and better pay, and we will continue to see what we can do.",3,75,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00075

I think one of the key ones would be the progressive wage model that NTUC is working on for various sectors. For instance, we have identified the cleaning sector and the idea really is to upgrade the skills of the workers so that they would be paid higher pay based on productivity and ability. We have actually legislated that for the cleaning sector. We are now looking into the security industry and we will also be looking into the landscape industry.",1,79,2014-09-08-T-005-S-00079

2014-09-08-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I have one supplementary question. Does the Government have any plans to review the regulatory framework that governs short-term rentals for both the public and private property market, in view of the rise of sharing economies service firms like Airbnb, for example?",1,85,2014-09-08-T-006-S-00085
2014-09-08-T-006,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan :,"Portals like Airbnb and many others promoting sharing of resources in an open economy is an emerging trend, and many of these websites or portals do have disclaimers which state that for people who are either offering their services or booking their services, they have to comply with the local laws and regulations. I think in this context of renting out properties for less than six months, clearly they are in infringement of our Planning Act. So, the necessary action will be taken. But going further in the long term, we have to study the implications of promoting or sharing of such resources in an economy, which is in itself positive, but then again it is at the expense of existing regulations that tend to protect both consumers and service providers. Because we also do not want to see a situation where people sign up, and are promised certain services or products, but, in the end, services are not delivered to them. So I think we have to look at both the interest of the larger public as well as the appeal or attraction of such form of resource sharing.",1,86,2014-09-08-T-006-S-00086

2014-09-08-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Mdm Speaker, starting from the 2014 Primary 1 (P1) Registration Exercise, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has reserved 40 places in every school for registrants in Phases 2B and 2C. This is to ensure that our schools, especially the popular ones, remain open to children with no prior connections to the school. As a result of this change, five schools balloted in Phase 2A2 this year, but without the reservation of places in Phases 2B and 2C, there would have been fewer than 40 places in each of these five schools that are open to students without prior connections to the school.

2014-09-08-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Home-school distance is already one key consideration during the allocation of P1 places, with priority for those who live within one kilometre of the school, followed by those who live between one kilometre and two kilometres from the school. As the number of children seeking admission in a particular year and the population in the area changes, we seek parents' understanding that even as we attempt to plan the location of schools and the number of vacancies carefully, it is not always possible to meet the changing number of students who will register within a particular school in a particular year. In addition, there needs to be a critical mass of students in an area before it is feasible for us to start a new school. But there will be sufficient places in schools that are within a reasonable distance of their homes. Our assessment is that the current criteria have met the needs of most parents well, and making further changes at this point would not be meaningful.",2,89,2014-09-08-T-007-S-00089

This is part of our commitment to make every school a good school, so that we can meet the educational needs of all children in Singapore.",3,90,2014-09-08-T-007-S-00090
2014-09-08-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Our ground feedback has been that the recent changes in our Primary 1 registration framework and our outreach to parents on the programmes of schools in their neighbourhood have been met with good response from parents. We are pleased to see more parents taking the time to visit schools during open houses and to understand the programmes of the schools. They take the effort to see for themselves the quality of education provided in these schools. So, let us continue our efforts in this direction.",4,91,2014-09-08-T-007-S-00091
2014-09-08-T-007,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, every year, I have about 10 to 15 children all living within one kilometre of a school which are balloted out and they complain and say, ""Well, look, I live near a school and I believe that that school is a good school. But yet I can't get into the nearest school to my home. In contrast, they have parents who live further away, driving their children all the way to the school, also believing that that school is a good school."" So, may I ask the Minister  what is MOE's stand to encourage children to study at a school near their home? Secondly, would MOE consider a policy to require parents to send their children to a school within, say, 3 kilometres to 5 kilometres of their home, so that their children do not have to travel very long distance, and that would give them adequate rest and sleep, and cut down on their travelling journey? Perhaps the Minister can clarify.",1,92,2014-09-08-T-007-S-00092
2014-09-08-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I thank Mr Lim for his supplementary question. Indeed, we do encourage parents to try and send their children to a school near their homes. And the planning is done in such a way that allows us to do so, within a reasonable distance. But the current framework of Primary 1 registration has evolved over many years and taking into account many different needs of various parents. I think it has evolved in the right direction. As to his question as to whether we will encourage parents to send their children to a school within 3 kilometres to 5 kilometres of their home, so that the children do not have to travel a long distance, indeed, we hope that parents will do so, but I think we have to encourage parents to see the value of the schools in their neighbourhood, and this is exactly what we have been trying to do. To see the value of the schools in their neighbourhood – I am very encouraged that many more parents are doing so, taking the time and trouble to see for themselves what are the programmes that are being offered.",1,93,2014-09-08-T-007-S-00093

So, I think a careful balance needs to be struck. As I have said, the system has evolved – and I think we are evolving in the right direction – let us do what matters most, rather than to try to think about how do we cut the lines further and how do we make further demarcations. Let us focus on the essential, and the essential is to make every school a good school, and to encourage parents to see for themselves what kind of school can best meet the needs of the children.

2014-09-08-T-008,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"The key reason for the delay of the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital was due to a delay in the building's exterior works. Let me explain. The building's exterior works, or referred to as the façade, comprise the functional elements such as windows, glass panels, air vents and cladding. These functional elements need to be installed so that the building is protected from the wind and the rain to allow internal building works and installation of critical equipment to proceed without the risk of damage by weather.",2,98,2014-09-08-T-008-S-00098
2014-09-08-T-008,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"MOH and Jurong Health Services, who is overseeing the project, have been monitoring its progress since construction of the hospital started in 2012. Earlier this year, they detected that the progress of the exterior works had fallen behind schedule. The façade subcontractor had experienced problems with the production of façade components in its factory in Thailand. Jurong Health Services initiated discussions with the subcontractor to address these problems. Unfortunately, the curfews imposed in Thailand in June this year, did not help. This has created further disruption to the production and installation of the façade.",3,99,2014-09-08-T-008-S-00099

In other collaborations, we also tap on the manpower resources of the private hospitals.

2014-09-08-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,The correct number should be four. My apologies. Thank you.,2,122,2014-09-08-T-009-S-00122
2014-09-08-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked	 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the Police's plan to reduce online scams; and (b) how is the Police cooperating with IDA to spread the awareness of online scams.,1,123,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00123
2014-09-08-T-010,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"asked	 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) how can the Ministry encourage victims of online credit card fraud, unauthorised access to email accounts, phishing scams and identity thefts to report such crimes; (b) whether the Ministry will set up a national fraud reporting and Internet crime reporting centre; and (c) whether efforts can be stepped up to raise the awareness on how individuals and businesses can protect themselves against cybercrime.",1,124,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00124
2014-09-08-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Mdm Speaker, with your permission, may I take the questions from Mr Ang Wei Neng and Ms Irene Ng together?",1,125,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00125
2014-09-08-T-010,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,126,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00126
2014-09-08-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thank you. For the six-month period between January and June 2014, there were 787 reported online cheating and cyber extortion cases. In the same period in 2013, there were 187 such cases. The rise in the number of police reports could be partly due to greater public awareness and willingness to report such crimes.",1,127,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00127
2014-09-08-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"A key strategy to reduce the number of online crimes is to raise public awareness and vigilance. To this end, the Police have worked with the community and key stakeholders to increase public education of online crimes through mainstream and social media. For example, Police have highlighted cases of online purchase and identity theft scams in the upcoming episodes of CrimeWatch this year. The Police and the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) have jointly developed public education collaterals pertaining to online crimes for display on bus stop panels, at MRT stations and over the Internet, including online forums and shopping sites. Police are also working with major financial institutions to feature crime prevention advisories on their Internet banking websites by end-2014.",2,128,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00128
2014-09-08-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Members of the public are encouraged to contact the Police immediately should they become victims of any crime, be it online or otherwise. This can be done through existing crime reporting channels, such as the Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs) and Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs), as well as Police's online reporting portal.",3,129,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00129
2014-09-08-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive reply. With more people using the Internet, including the vulnerable elderly, it is quite understandable that more online crime could be expected. At times, online crimes call for a different computer skill-set to trace the culprit and collect online evidence, and some of the current investigating officers may not have the skill-set. So, what kind of training plans do the Police have to equip Police officers with such cyber skills to crack cyber crimes? Is there a plan to set up a dedicated cyber crime unit in the Police Force? For cyber criminals who are based overseas or use overseas websites, how is the Police enlisting the help of Interpol to crack such cross-border cyber crimes?",1,130,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00130
2014-09-08-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. Firstly, certainly, this is a very new phenomenon in our society, where because of the ""ubiquitousness"" of the Internet, multimedia devices are all over the place, sometimes even at our dinner table, this is now a means and access for criminals to perpetrate their crimes. Therefore, our own forces in the Police have had to upgrade themselves to understand the nature of these crimes and how they are perpetrated, including working with their foreign counterparts. As the Member rightly pointed out, this is not a crime just perpetrated within Singapore. Indeed, most of them have been perpetrated overseas. Therefore, we have to work regionally as well as internationally, including with Interpol, who have just set up their Interpol Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI) recently in Singapore. With Interpol and all these regional counterparts, we hope to address these issues together.",1,131,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00131
2014-09-08-T-010,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Thank you, Madam. On a regular basis, many Internet users face phishing attacks from cyber criminals who seek to steal personal credit and banking information, and some fall prey to the scams. Not all victims report it because of the perception that our law enforcement agencies can do little, especially if the phishing attacks seem to come from overseas accounts. I have three supplementary questions.",1,132,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00132
2014-09-08-T-010,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"First, are our existing laws and our investigative processes evolving fast enough to deal with cyber crimes that cross national boundaries, and is the Police actively gathering data and transforming them into actionable intelligence that can lead to the capture of cyber criminals?",2,133,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00133
2014-09-08-T-010,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Second, can the Ministry encourage victims to report cyber crime not only through the regular channels as now but also by providing a central point of contact for information on Internet fraud where they can go to, to report on any attacks that they may have on the Internet, and to also provide updates on the latest phishing websites and scams so as to warn online users?",3,134,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00134
2014-09-08-T-010,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Finally, is the Police enlisting the help of Internet security experts to tackle this threat of cyber crime and to work with institutions that are often targeted, such as the banks, online trading platforms and the various organisations, to better protect themselves against cyber attacks?",4,135,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00135
2014-09-08-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The first question on whether existing laws are adequate, yes, they are. We do though need to continue monitoring and updating them, as these kinds of crimes do evolve over time. In the past, there was no such crime of extorting people through the Internet. But now, there are such crimes. And the victims may be in Singapore but the perpetrators may be overseas. Certainly, the best approach is prevention. The victims themselves are the people who are using all these media. They must be always aware that they can be victims of cyber crime.",1,136,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00136
2014-09-08-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Are there efforts to collect data and transform them into actionable plans, yes, there are. This is continual, as I have mentioned before. We work together with international organisations like Interpol to make sure that we have a bigger global view of the issue, and not just what is happening in Singapore.",2,137,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00137
2014-09-08-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Should we have other channels to allow people to make reports? Well, we are mindful that we do not want to create more channels even though it may be particularly for online scams or Internet cyber crime. There are already existing ones through our Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC), through our Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP); even online reporting that our citizens and our visitors can assess.",3,138,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00138
2014-09-08-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Do we work with experts? Yes, we do. In fact they regularly come to advise us, we also invite them to run workshops with our regular police forces, as well as to involve other police forces in other countries to ensure that we are working together and on the same page and also heighten our awareness of the vulnerability of our citizens to this new crime.",4,139,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00139
2014-09-08-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"And then, there is a cyber security awareness alliance which comprises 21 representatives from the Government and private enterprises, including even trade associations and non-profit organisations. What they are doing is they are trying to promote and enhance awareness to adopt essential Infocomm Security practices so that it is not just being done at the individual basis but also in companies, in any other setups that involve the use of IT. Currently, this is co-chaired by the Deputy Chief Executive and Director-General (Telecoms & Post) of IDA and the Vice-Chairman of Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation. The Police is part of this initiative.",5,140,2014-09-08-T-010-S-00140
2014-09-08-T-011,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked	 the Minister for National Development what is the basis by which HDB determines the value of the lease under the Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme when it purchases the lease back from flat owners.,1,141,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00141
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Madam, the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) proceeds is the market value of the flat with its full remaining lease, less the value of the first ""X"" years of lease retained by the household and any outstanding housing loan. So, there are two components. First, what is the market value of the flat with its full remaining lease; and then secondly, how many years of lease that the owner would like to retain and what is the value of that portion of the retained lease?",1,142,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00142
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"First, a professional valuer from HDB's Panel of Private Valuers will assess the market value of the flat with its full remaining lease after a physical inspection of the flat and then reference to recent comparable market transactions.",2,143,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00143
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Second, the value of the lease to be retained by the owners is, in turn, determined from the market value of the flat based on established industry-accepted standards and valuation practice. Adjustments are also made to reflect the restrictions placed on the LBS flat, namely no subletting of whole flat and no resale.",3,144,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00144
2014-09-08-T-011,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"I would like to first thank the Minister for the very comprehensive enhancement to LBS to make it accessible for more elderly households and also making the scheme more flexible. I have two sets of supplementary questions for the Minister, specifically to how you calculate the value of the lease sold back to HDB.",1,145,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00145
2014-09-08-T-011,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"First, even when the duration of the lease sold to HDB is equal to the duration of the lease retained by the owners, why are the sales proceeds to owners lower? How does HDB calculate the depreciation in determining the value of the lease that they purchased? Would they vary the depreciation rate depending on the years of lease retained? So, how is the calculation done?",2,146,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00146
2014-09-08-T-011,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Second question relates to the market value which Minister just spoke about. LBS proceeds are calculated based on market value. So, how can HDB mitigate against the volatility of property prices so that flat owners will not need to worry about short-term property cycles when exercising the option of using LBS to monetise their long-term asset?",3,147,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00147
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, first of all, assessing property value is a professional piece of work. As for how property values vary across the lifespan of a property, there are established ways of doing that kind of computation. It is certainly not a straight line. Using the example that the Member quoted, it does not mean that the value of the first ""X"" years of a lease to be retained will equal to that of the tail end of the lease that the owner is selling to HDB. It is not a straight line. In fact, it tends to be an inverted ""C"". There are two reasons for it. One is time value for money. A thousand dollars today is worth more than $1,000 in 35 years' time. Secondly, properties with very short outstanding lease tend to depreciate faster than properties with still very long lease.",1,148,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00148
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"So, the end result is, if I may use the example the Member gave, the valuers are likely to value the first part of the lease which will be retained by the owner at about 60%. So, instead of a 50-50 split of the full value of the lease, it will be roughly a 60-40 split. In other words, the lease that they are selling is probably worth about 40% of the market value of the entire lease today.",2,149,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00149
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"How do we handle volatility? We have yet to find a way to eliminate volatility in property prices. At my age, I have lived through several property ups and downs. And I can guarantee you over the next 30 years, there will still be many property up-and-down cycles. At whichever time of the property cycle, it will affect all the monetisation options, whether it is lease buyback or right-sizing or sell your property to move to a Studio Apartment, all will be impacted.",3,150,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00150
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The key is to make sure that there is proper counselling so that the owner or the potential participant in the Lease Buyback Scheme, or any other monetisation options, is fully aware of the various options and, specifically, how it would impact him or her so that he or she can then make a very informed, careful decision. He should not rush into deciding on whether right-sizing is the right option or the Lease Buyback Scheme is the right option. Think it carefully, discuss with your financial planner or your Member of Parliament, and seek proper expert advice and then make a careful decision because this is a long-term decision, whether you decide to opt for 30 years or 35 years. Not as long as marriage but same thing too when you decide on your mate, think carefully, otherwise you may regret halfway through the process.",4,151,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00151
2014-09-08-T-011,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"I would like to ask Minister if someone decides to go on the LBS, does it mean that to maximise the LBS value, it would probably be better for him to sign up at a high end of the property cycle rather than a lower end? Does the timing affect the value of the lease and hence the payout?",1,152,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00152
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I should not overplay my role. I am not a financial planner. Let us say we are at the high end of the property cycle, as I have said, it impacts all the various monetisation options. If you sell today to right size, and because you are at the height of the property cycle, you can sell high. It also means that when you buy your Studio Apartment, it will also be priced high.",1,153,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00153
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"So, likewise, for LBS, if it is at the height of the property cycle, then the lease that you will be retaining will also be priced high. Likewise, the tail end of the lease. So, 60-40 share of ""X"" which will be large as compared to ""Y"", let us say, when it is at the low end of the property market. So, it will be a 60-40 share of ""X"" versus a 60-40 share of ""Y"".",2,154,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00154
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"It is very hard to play the market, to be able to judge the timing when ""Yes, you find the exact sweet spot to make a decision"". When you consider all the various options, think it carefully. The best outcome, as I have said before, is you do not have to monetise it through Lease Buyback. The best outcome that we prefer is your children are good and they ask you to stay with them so that you can rent out your flat which you continue to own, and every month collect a monthly rental. That I think is the best outcome for the family, for the children, for the parents and for society at large.",3,155,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00155
2014-09-08-T-011,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"I would like to ask Minister why is there a requirement that the minimum lease to be sold to HDB must be 20 years. Does it mean that for those who want to sell a lease of 18 years or 19 years, they would have to make an appeal?",1,156,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00156
2014-09-08-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"That is a fine print, a technical requirement in the scheme. In fact, it has no practical value at this point in time because all properties can meet this requirement because there is still substantial outstanding lease. But it is an important technical requirement of the scheme because we also want to make sure that the LBS proceeds would be of some significant value. As we have just discussed, if the outstanding lease is too short, the value is so little that when you convert into annuity or into upfront cash proceeds, it may not be too meaningful for the owner.",1,157,2014-09-08-T-011-S-00157
2014-09-08-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,asked	 the Minister for National Development with regard to the HDB Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) (a) what options does the flat owner have if he outlives the 30-year lease; (b) how can HDB provide greater assurance that these options will be honoured 30 years later; (c) what will happen if a flat under LBS gets selected for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme; and (d) whether the flat owner will receive the full proceeds in a lump sum should the flat owner 's CPF Retirement Account meet the Minimum Sum.,1,158,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00158
2014-09-08-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Under the current Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS), owners retain a 30-year lease. Those who outlive the lease will not be left homeless. HDB will look into the circumstances of each case to work out an appropriate housing arrangement, taking into account the elderly's health condition, financial status and the availability of family support. From April next year, we will enhance the LBS to offer a 35-year lease option. So, this will practically bring the age limit to about 100.Those who are concerned about outliving their lease can take up this longer lease option. Any unconsumed lease will be refunded to the estate.",1,159,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00159
2014-09-08-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LBS flat owners whose flats are selected for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) will receive compensation based on the balance lease of their flat at the time of the SERS announcement. They will also receive SERS re-housing benefits, which include an option to buy a new replacement flat with the same balance lease as their LBS flat, or a fresh 99-year lease, at a subsidised price.",2,160,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00160
2014-09-08-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Owners can retain LBS proceeds of up to $100,000 in lump-sum cash, after they have topped up their CPF Retirement Accounts. Currently, all owners top up to the age-adjusted prevailing CPF Minimum Sum (MS). From April next year, we are relaxing the CPF top-up requirement for households with two or more owners to require each owner to only top up to half the age-adjusted prevailing MS. They can then retain any remaining proceeds in lump-sum cash.",3,161,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00161

2014-09-08-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Minister this  no one really knows exactly how long we will live. The case-by-case consideration that the Minister had mentioned may not really be assuring enough for people, when they are planning for their own accommodation to last until the end of their lives. The option of staying with families or at nursing homes may not be something that we want to think through at length at the age of 90s. I would like to ask whether HDB could, at the onset when the flat-owners sign up for LBS, determine the value of lease extension, perhaps on an annual basis, based on the lease value calculated by HDB when it buys over the balance of the lease, at this point in time. And it is written down on the contract, so that at least, the flat-owner knows, ""If I need to extend by a year when I outlive the lease, this is the amount I have to pay."" That gives a very clear option that flat-owners can consider.",1,163,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00163
2014-09-08-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"The next question I would like to clarify is for those flat-owners on LBS affected by SERS, is the Minister saying that the new replacement flat could be offered to the flat-owner with a shorter lease based on the lease that they have remaining on their old flat, and therefore, they pay a lower value to get the replacement flat?",2,164,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00164
2014-09-08-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"On the second question, on SERS re-housing benefits, yes, it will be taken into account in the offered re-housing flat. And depending on the length of the lease, it will be valued as such. At MND and HDB, we are not only a compassionate organisation, we are also a very fair organisation. Our commitment is that nobody will be left homeless. If somebody is now 100 years old, I am quite sure the whole society and the Government will try very hard to ensure that this 100-year-old or 101-year-old elderly Singaporean will be well taken care of. The case-by-case situation crops up because what is unpredictable or uncertain is the health status of the person. At that point in time, if he or she is not independent, let us say, bed-ridden, then his or her need may not be a flat. His or her need is a place in a nursing home, in which case, therefore, the Government, as represented by HDB, will work very closely with MOH to make sure that this elderly Singaporean will be well placed. The option then depends on whether the children are available, and are they able to look after the now-no-longer independent senior. That is why the HDB commitment is worded that way.",1,165,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00165
2014-09-08-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Member's suggestion of whether we can commit to a specific value to the lease – in this case, to be applied in 35 years' or 30 years' time – it is very difficult. We are committing ourselves to something that is so uncertain. I cannot even tell next year what exactly would be the state of the property market. I have some idea, I have some goal to work towards, but it may not be what I project or plan for it to be. What we can commit as a Government is that nobody will be left homeless. For those who are very concerned about this, we now have this enhancement of an additional five years lease extension, so that instead of 30 years, you can opt for 35 years, which, as I have said, will cover up to age 100.",2,166,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00166
2014-09-08-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"There is another possibility which we are studying which is insurance. There are market solutions to such things. You can buy an insurance policy, so that if you outlive the committed lease, the insurer will take over to make sure that you will continue to be able to stay there, and pay for your additional lease. But insurance cuts both ways. If you pass on before the committed lease, then you also lose the benefits. Whereas right now, under our Lease Buyback Scheme, whatever is not consumed will be refunded to the estate. So, the insurance scheme is not so straightforward. The upside is clear for a very small minority of the beneficiaries of the scheme, but the downside can be very negative for the majority, and they may not like it.",3,167,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00167

I would like the Minister to clarify this  is the option to extend the lease already an option that the owner can consider, apart from relocating to a nursing home and so on? Regarding the SERS compensation, given that the Minister has said that the front end of a new lease is probably more valuable than the tail end of a lease, can the Minister assure that the compensation for the SERS flat will be enough for the flat-owner to purchase the new flat, same flat type in the offered precinct? So, that means the compensation is enough for them to pay for whatever lease duration that the replacement flat is being offered to the flat-owner.",1,169,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00169
2014-09-08-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"There can be lease extension. It is something that we can take the cue from the Studio Apartment scheme. Studio Apartments are placed on a 30-year lease. HDB made a commitment for such an extension, if you outlive the 30-year lease. This is possible because many Studio Apartment buyers come in at younger ages, at 55 years. HDB commits to a 10-year extension at market value.

Let us say, you are now on LBS, and you have committed to 30 years. You have lived 10 years in it, and another 20 years left to go, and suddenly, there is a SERS announcement. As I have said, the HDB will assess. We will compensate you fairly. If you are in a sold flat, we will assess what is the market value of your flat at the time of the SERS announcement, and we will compensate you and also offer you some re-housing benefits. That is for sold flats. Likewise, if you happen to be on the LBS, we will also assess what is the market value of your LBS flat at that point in time, and then, we will compensate you accordingly. In fact, because you are already on LBS, and your retained lease has already been assessed a few years before when you joined LBS, HDB's arrangement is that should the remaining value of your lease be less than the market value of your property at the time of the SERS announcement, we will offer an ex gratia topping it up. We are a very fair organisation.",2,171,2014-09-08-T-012-S-00171

2014-09-08-T-013,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I brought up this question because someone said, ""If I sell my lease of x number of years to HDB, and then, the remaining part of the lease should belong still, to the owner. Why is HDB putting a lien on the remaining part of the lease?"" All sales for HDB flats will go through HDB, so you will know. Someone cannot just offload the flat somewhere else. So, why can I not have a say over the remaining part of the lease, like whether I want to sell or I want to sublet the whole unit? Is there a particular reason why there is a restriction?",1,174,2014-09-08-T-013-S-00174
2014-09-08-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, when I answered the Member Ms Foo Mee Har's question just now, I simplified the explanation because it is highly technical. I try not to go into these technicalities, but I may have to do so now. The earlier example mentioned by Ms Foo Mee Har is that your property today still has 70 years of lease, but you decide to take half – 35 years – and so, you sell the tail end 35 years. If it is a straight-line depreciation, it would be a 50-50 split. But I said no, because time-value-for-money and so on, it is actually about 60-40. It is not actually 60-40. If it is straight computation, it is 75-25. The tail half of your lease is a lot less than the front end of the lease which you are retaining. If you work on that basis, the cash proceeds under LBS will be much less than what we are offering today.",1,175,2014-09-08-T-013-S-00175
2014-09-08-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"That is why HDB, quite rightly, introduced some conditions which are also practical conditions – you cannot sell, you cannot wholly sublet although you can sublet some rooms if you want to. And because of those restrictions, when valuers value the front end of the lease to be retained, they take that into account and discount it. That is why instead of a 75-25 split, it ends up with a 60-40 split. So, 25 to 40 is a very significant improvement in the value which is now being sold back to HDB. That enables the LBS to be a lot more attractive and to be a lot more meaningful to the owners.",2,176,2014-09-08-T-013-S-00176

Nonetheless, accidents on our roads can and should be prevented. We introduced the Safer Roads Singapore (SRS) action plan in 2013 with the three-pronged approach of education, engagement and enforcement. The SRS is a continuation of Traffic Police's (TP) long-standing efforts to inculcate responsible road use for all road users. I am glad to see our partners, such as the Singapore Road Safety Council, actively supporting the SRS objective of engendering a culture of safe road use in Singapore.",2,200,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00200

The number of violations for this offence has risen by almost 25% over the last five years from 2,867 violations in 2009 to 3,572 violations in 2013. In recent years, with technological advancements, smart phones can, among other things, be used to surf the Internet, check email and play games and not just make phone calls. There has also been a proliferation in the types of communication devices, such as tablet computers, that can be just as distracting to the driver.",5,203,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00203

Today, foreigners are allowed to drive in Singapore using their foreign licences for up to 12 months from their date of last entry into Singapore. They need to obtain a local driving licence to continue driving thereafter. To do so, foreign drivers have the option to convert their foreign licences to local ones, after passing the requisite tests. Today, TP allows a person to convert to motorcycle and Class 3 or 3A, which are lighter models of motorcars and other motor vehicles, licences by passing the Basic Theory Test.",8,206,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00206
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"We will make two changes to this licensing regime. First, we will repeal and re-enact section 38 of the RTA to require work pass holders who drive as part of their job to obtain a local driving licence within six months from the date of issue of their work passes for all licence classes. We have provided for the six-month period after studying the practices of other jurisdictions and taking into account the views of industry stakeholders. These changes will come into effect on 1 January 2016 to give the industry sufficient time for adjustment. However, I encourage all employers to start sending their foreign drivers to obtain local licences prior to that. Fleet operators also have a responsibility to keep our roads safe and, in fact, they should send their foreign drivers to obtain local licences before they are deployed on our roads. I understand that fleet operators do this, like Bok Seng Logistics. I encourage all employers to do the same.",9,207,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00207

The Class 3 licence category allows holders to drive motorcars, light goods vehicles and small buses. They will now be required to pass the Practical Driving Test in addition to the Basic Theory Test to convert to a local Class 3 licence. At the same time, we will amend the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Driving Licences) Rules to introduce a new Class 3C licence category from June 2015. This licence class will allow the holder to drive all Class 3 vehicles except light goods vehicles and small buses.

To facilitate this transition, existing Work Permit and S-pass holders who hold converted Class 3 licences will, upon application, be issued with Class 3C licences upon the expiry of their current licences. Those who drive light goods vehicles and small buses will be required to take the Practical Driving Test when renewing their licences, and they will be given sufficient time to do so. They will then be issued with a full Class 3 licence. These changes will better ensure that these drivers are competent and familiar with driving on our roads.",11,209,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00209

Let me illustrate these changes with an example. A Work Permit holder is hired to drive a light goods vehicle. Prior to the policy changes, he would have been able to drive with his foreign licence for up to 12 months upon entering Singapore and then take the Basic Theory Test to convert his foreign licence to a local Class 3 licence. Following the policy changes, he will now have to pass both the Basic Theory Test and Practical Driving Test within six months of obtaining his Work Pass to convert to a local Class 3 licence.",12,210,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00210

TP will introduce a voluntary Safe Driving Course (SDC) in the second half of 2015. The SDC will be offered to eligible drivers who have accumulated half or more of their maximum allowable demerit points. However, the SDC will not be offered to probationary drivers who have just obtained their driving licences as we expect new drivers to be more careful on the roads. The SDC also allows for earlier intervention so that we can correct unsafe road habits. To encourage motorists to take this course, those who pass the course will have three demerit points deducted from their record. Clauses 4 and 9 amend sections 35A and 45 respectively to provide the Minister with the power to make rules regulating the disregarding or cancellation of demerit points.

For example, if a vehicle is caught speeding by a speed camera and the owner does not provide the driver's particulars, TP will be empowered to take action against the vehicle owner for the speeding offence. However, the owner can also rebut the presumption by proving that he was not the driver at the time of the offence, such as by showing proof that he was overseas.",15,213,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00213

He is then required to provide his particulars if requested to do so by other persons at the scene of the accident. The amendments retain the requirement for the driver to stop following an accident. However, they add an obligation on the driver to take reasonable steps to provide his particulars to the owner even when no one is around to request for such information. For example, if a driver hits a car in a carpark, the driver should leave a note on the damaged car with his particulars.

2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"Mdm Speaker, I rise to support the Bill. I shall focus my speech on the old section 65B dealing with the use of mobile communication devices.",1,223,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00223
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"There has been much debate around the world on how best to regulate the use of mobile and other electronic devices while driving. Different countries have different solutions. Some jurisdictions, like the UK, have banned the use of all hand-held mobile devices. Others, like Ontario, Canada, have extended their legislation to include not just wireless communication devices, but electronic entertainment devices as well. Yet others, like the US state of California, have different rules depending on the experience of the driver.",2,224,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00224
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"Here in Singapore, there is a need to step up our game against irresponsible and unsafe driving habits. A review of section 65 is certainly timely because a recent survey commissioned by Samsung showed that a whopping 83% of Singaporeans surveyed admitted to using their mobile phones while driving. I think I can safely venture that most of us in this House, if not all, have all seen people using their phones while driving.",3,225,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00225
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"Everyone knows that using phones while driving is not safe. So, we comfort ourselves by saying that we can use hands-free devices. But there are many studies which claim that using hands-free devices is equally dangerous as using hand-held devices. This is because the real distraction is the phone conversation, and it matters less that you have both hands on the wheel. Therefore, the real message we should send is that people should not use their mobile devices at all while driving.",4,226,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00226
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"But such a blanket restriction is not feasible, and it will be a rule more honoured in breach. The Bill therefore reflects a compromise. While we cannot make driving while using mobile devices 100% safe, we can and should impose laws to make our roads safer for everyone.",5,227,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00227
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"Let me now move on to the specifics of the Bill. The proposed section 65B expands the scope of the offence of using a mobile device while driving. The offence can be broken down into three elements. First, use of the device. Second, the device must be a ""mobile communication device"". And third, this use must take place while the motor vehicle is in motion. I will comment on each of these elements in turn.",6,228,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00228
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"First, section 65B(3) states that the ""use"" in relation to a mobile communication device means ""to hold it in at least one hand while operating any of its functions"". It appears that the intention behind this definition is to get drivers to either place their devices in holders or to use hands-free tools. If this is the case, why not just say so in the provision? The offence can easily be drafted as a ban against the use of mobile communication devices, subject to the two aforementioned exceptions. The present drafting is problematic, I think, as it potentially allows drivers to place the device on their laps or on the dashboard. A further problem that arises is that the definition permits the use of devices placed in holders. A literal reading of the provision allows drivers to watch videos and read text messages and emails if such device is placed in a holder. It even allows drivers to play a game, text or surf the Internet by tapping on the screen of a device placed in a holder. Could the Senior Minister of State clarify whether such cases are meant to fall outside the scope of the offence?",7,229,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00229
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"Second element – a mobile communication device refers to a mobile telephone and any other hand-held device with a ""communicative function"", which is defined in section 65B(3). My concern is that the range of devices contemplated by the provision is too narrow. What about iPods or MP3s or DVD players? Or hand-held game consoles like the Nintendo 3DS? Using these devices while driving is clearly dangerous, but they appear to fall outside the scope of the offence. One solution could be to adopt the position taken in Ontario, Canada, where the restriction includes both hand-held wireless communication devices as well as hand-held electronic entertainment devices. However, this still leaves open the problem I mentioned earlier, of drivers being distracted by the mounted screens of these devices, such as watching a video or reading an email. Ontario's legislators have dealt with this problem by banning display screens of televisions, computers or other devices visible to the driver that are unrelated to the driving task. And I think we should consider adopting a similar approach.",8,230,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00230
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"The third element involves using the device when the car is ""in motion"". On this, I seek a clarification. The express wording of section 65B implies that it is not an offence for a driver to use a mobile communication device when the motor vehicle has stopped at a traffic light or where he is in a traffic jam. May I ask if this is the intended effect of the provision? If so, then it is not a satisfactory situation in my view. The restriction should apply to the entire driving process. Drivers should remain alert to road conditions and any other road users until the car is safely parked. This is a better approach that many other jurisdictions, such as the UK, have adopted.",9,231,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00231
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"I would like to raise another general clarification. There appears to be no exceptions to section 65B in the Bill. So, what happens when a driver's violation of section 65B is arguably reasonable or defensible? Let us say the driver needs to make an emergency call to the police, fire department or an ambulance, but it might not be practicable or safe for him to pull over or stop the vehicle. How will such cases be dealt with? Will it be entirely a matter of prosecutorial discretion?",10,232,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00232
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"Mdm Speaker, as this Bill deals with responsible driving, I have a personal appeal to the Traffic Police. Driving while distracted by mobile communication devices is the mischief one provision of this Bill addresses. But there are other irresponsible habits that we need to crack down on. One of my bugbears is seeing children without seatbelts on or not in their safety seats. This contravenes the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Wearing of Seat Belts) Rules, but it happens all the time. The sight of parents cradling their babies while seated in the front passenger seat or of children jumping around in the back is far too common. I am sure many of us have seen that as well. People forget that children who are not strapped in become projectiles in a sudden stop. And we really need to do more to educate the public about this.",11,233,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00233
2014-09-08-T-022,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"While the road traffic situation may have improved in Singapore in recent years with fewer fatal accidents, there is still much more I think that the Ministry can do to deter errant drivers and cultivate safer and more responsible road use. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.",12,234,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00234

This has increased to 367,496 violations in 2013. This means that over the past two years, the number of traffic violations have gone up by more than 51,000 violations. This should be an area of grave concern as it suggests that motorists are disregarding safety whilst on the roads.",3,237,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00237
2014-09-08-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"One constant feedback which I receive from residents is the lack of Traffic Police presence on the roads. Many of my residents frequently complain about drivers of sports cars driving at reckless speed along two-lane roads in residential areas like Tanjong Rhu Road and Meyer Road. They say that despite many complaints to the Traffic Police about cars speeding along the roads on weekends, the speeding and the resultant noise continues unabated as if there is no enforcement.",4,238,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00238
2014-09-08-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thus, whenever Police presence is not felt, drivers tend to speed or drive recklessly thinking that they can get away with it. My experience as a driver is that if one drives along roads with speed cameras or where there is a Traffic Police patrol car, you tend to see more road discipline amongst the drivers. Take, for example, the traffic along Nicoll Highway. If there is no Traffic Police on patrols, then you will see cyclists riding dangerously in the middle of the road, or you have motorists who try to cut across double white lines or motorists who refuse to observe lane discipline and then they try to cut into other driver's lane dangerously.",5,239,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00239

2014-09-08-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"First, rely on more technology to deter drivers who speed. Install more traffic speed cameras; in that way, traffic officers stationed along pedestrian overhead bridges can then be re-deployed;",7,241,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00241

In other words, do not wait until the driver is due to be suspended before asking the driver to attend safety course. Catch hold of the driver and counsel him early before he commits more traffic violations. We should do more to educate all road users on the importance of being socially responsible for road safety.",12,246,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00246
2014-09-08-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Turning to the proposed Bill, I support the provisions contained in the Bill. I do have some queries for the Senior Minister of State.",13,247,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00247
2014-09-08-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Firstly, let me thank the Senior Minister of State for elaborating on the intent of clause 4(a), which is the Safe Driving Course (SDC). But may I ask the Senior Minister of State, what is the intended signal for Traffic Police? Would it not be better to make it legally compulsory to attend safety classes without offering any incentives? What if the offender had accumulated demerit points after an accident involving injuries to pedestrians? Would the Traffic Police still be minded to give a discount of the demerit points despite the injury even though the traffic violator had attended a Safe Driving Course?",14,248,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00248
2014-09-08-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Next, may I ask the Minister to clarify clause 8 – whether a holder of a foreign driving licence who is in Singapore but not working as a driver; is he allowed to occasionally drive a pickup ferrying workers if he does not do so for hire or reward? Under this clause, it seems that such a driver with foreign driving licence is allowed to ferry passengers or goods if he does not do so for hire or reward. If so, would it not circumvent the intent of the law to ensure that drivers who take on the tasks of ferrying passengers or goods are properly licensed to drive safely on Singapore roads?",15,249,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00249
2014-09-08-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Clause 14 – I support the intent to make it an offence for drivers not to concentrate on the roads whilst driving. Drivers have no business trying to speak on the phone or sending SMS or emails whilst they are driving. These acts are inconsiderate and put other road users at risk. However, I would like to ask why the Ministry wishes to restrict the offence to using communication device with communicative functions. What if a reckless driver feels that he can play games on his tablet whilst driving, or he decides to read a book on his Kindle which he had downloaded earlier and which is not a communicative device?",16,250,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00250
2014-09-08-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"What about a driver who decides to send an SMS or email whilst the phone is not in his hand but fixed to a phone stand? He is not using the mobile communication device because he is not holding it in one hand. Nevertheless, he will be distracted from his primary task of concentrating on the roads. Could the Senior Minister of State clarify?",17,251,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00251
2014-09-08-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Finally, on clause 20, I have received feedback that sometimes Traffic Police takes several weeks to issue Notice of offence to owners of vehicles and this has made it difficult for the owners to recall who the driver of the vehicle was at the time of violation, especially if the vehicle is shared by several users.",18,252,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00252
2014-09-08-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Could the Minister indicate what would be a reasonable time for Traffic Police to issue such notices of traffic violation? Otherwise, if such deadlines are passed, how would the owners of vehicles be expected to recall the driver at that time of the traffic violation?

2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill, which I support. Nonetheless, I seek clarifications from the Senior Minister of State on clause 14 in particular.",1,254,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00254
2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Clause 14 of the Bill re-enacts section 65B to cover all handheld devices which are designed or capable of being used for a communicative function. This extends an offence to the use of a device's non-communicative functions such as surfing on the Internet, visiting social media platforms and downloading videos. The new laws are envisaged to apply to devices such as tablets computers and any communicative device, not only mobile phones. The proposed law does not explicitly ban the use of such devices if they are mounted on the dashboard or windscreens of vehicles or if they are used at traffic junctions. Some motorists have remarked this would mean it would not be illegal to type out an email on a device which has been mounted on the vehicle's dashboard while driving along a busy road.",2,255,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00255
2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"As far as the Bill stands, a driver could conceivably type out an email while driving as long as the device is mounted and he would not fall foul of section 65B. I am not sure whether this is necessarily a better way to reduce the number of distractions a driver can fall victim to, especially if Members consider the fast pace of life in Singapore and our increasingly crowded roads. To this end, a part-time taxi driver was quoted in The Straits Times, musing, ""What is the difference between holding the phone and mounting it in a holder? I have a holder and when I touch the phone on the holder, I am not concentrating. It is not an offence but it is still a distraction.""",3,256,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00256
2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"While the taxi driver's concerns are valid, a motorist could nonetheless fall foul of another section, namely, section 65 of the Act which metes out an offence of driving without due care and attention and without reasonable consideration. However, for an enforcement officer, in view of the broad ""catch-all"" ambit of section 65 of the Road Traffic Act, it would appear that it would take an egregious violator to result in a successful prosecution.",4,257,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00257
2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To this end, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State  how many motorists have been summoned under the ""catch-all"" section 65 last year and the in first half of this year, with specific references to being distracted by mobile devices including tablets, for example?",5,258,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00258
2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Secondly, according to the National Safety Council in the United States, 23% of all crashes each year involve handphone use. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State if the Ministry keeps similar statistics on the local situation and if he could share them with the House.",6,259,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00259
2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, while I welcome the clarity and updating of section 65B, this clause could have been more emphatic about the dangers of being distracted by communicative devices of any nature while driving a vehicle. Numerous local media reports since the Bill was first read in the House have noted that Singaporeans regularly use mobile phones and devices while driving, especially when waiting for the lights to change at traffic junctions. The President of the Automobile Association of Singapore, citing a 2013 American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety and the University of Utah report, was quoted in The Straits Times noting that the use of mobile devices could distract drivers in two ways  firstly, through inattention blindness, where drivers fail to visually process or remember what their eyes see; and secondly, through tunnel vision where drivers gaze centrally ahead instead of scanning their surroundings.",7,260,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00260
2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Foreign jurisdictions, in view of the danger surrounding the use of mobile devices while driving, host clearer laws with less ambiguity. It makes enforcement less subjective and more straightforward as well. For example, in the United Kingdom, it is illegal to drive using a handheld phone or similar device even if one has stopped at the traffic lights or is queuing in traffic. A driver can, nonetheless, use a hands-free kit, two-way radio or a satellite navigation device, but is nonetheless liable to be stopped and penalised if the Police think the driver is distracted and not in control of the vehicle. The laws are broadly similar in Australia. More fundamentally, under the re-enacted section 65B, an offence is only meted out if the motor vehicle is in motion akin to current legislation under the same section.",8,261,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00261
2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),It would appear that this section's re-enactment could have afforded the Ministry a better opportunity to send a stronger signal to the public on the dangers with regard to the use of communicative devices on the road per se.,9,262,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00262
2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To this end, I would like to enquire from the Senior Minister of State what deliberations took place in the Ministry when determining the amendments to section 65B on this point, especially when compared to the laws in foreign jurisdictions. What differences are present in foreign jurisdictions as compared to the local situation which merits our laws allowing the use of mobile devices and communicative devices now at traffic stops and junctions? Does this not encourage the continued use of the device should the signal change, perhaps just to type out the final line of an SMS or an email on a tablet mounted on the dashboard or, worse, send out an email while driving? If so, how effective is the law really in changing the behaviour of motorists on the road?",10,263,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00263
2014-09-08-T-022,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In conclusion, I certainly hope the amended section 65B arrests the prospect of errant drivers and, as a consequence, reduces the number of summons Singaporeans receive under section 65B. However, an approach targeted at behavioural change may well be more useful in getting motorists to improve their driving habits with the view to better road safety and separately, more straightforward enforcement as well. I hope the Ministry considers this going forward.",11,264,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00264

2014-09-08-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Since 2002, our national mobile phone penetration rate has doubled from about 77.8% to 156% in 2013. This implies that about one out of two persons in Singapore possesses two or more mobile phones. With the rapid advancement in technology, mobile phones have evolved from the once nostalgic simple device with a monochromatic display into a highly advanced multi-functional pocket computer that allows its user to check emails, update social media, take a selfie perhaps, and make online purchases on the move. As a result, the use of mobile phone has deeply integrated into our daily living and activities. I believe that many of us would have at least once felt ""withdrawal symptoms"" when we forgot to bring or lost our mobile phones. So, in tandem with the exponential growth in mobile device ownership, the use of mobile devices by motorists has also become increasingly rampant.",2,266,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00266
2014-09-08-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"In 1999, this House passed the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, introducing the prohibition of the usage of mobile phone while driving. However, we still observe motorists egregiously using their mobile devices while driving at the same time.

2014-09-08-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"One top reason for this behaviour is because they feel complacent about their driving abilities. It has been reported that for the whole of last year, the Traffic Police issued a total of 3,572 summonses for the offence, compared to 2,938 the year before.",4,268,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00268
2014-09-08-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Although I have not, and I do not want to, come across a fatal accident occurring in Singapore due to mobile phone usage, we should not treat this lightly. Reacting after an accident will be too late. Recently, in the United Kingdom, two toddlers were killed at a pedestrian crossing, because the driver was talking on her mobile phone while driving. Similarly, in Sydney, a young woman died when she lost control of her car that crashed into a tree. The reason for the loss of control was that she was distracted as she was trying to answer a call on her mobile phone. The two examples highlighted the potential danger that brief moments of inattention or distraction could bring while driving.",5,269,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00269
2014-09-08-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Hence, this Bill provides a timely update in keeping pace with our society's proliferative use of mobile devices. The broadening of the existing scope makes it an offence to operate any function of a mobile communication device while holding onto the device and driving. I support the amendments in the Bill, and I would also like to suggest enhancing the penalties of using mobile phone while driving, potentially matching the penalties for drink-driving especially in near-accident instances. Driving while being engrossed or distracted by his/her mobile devices is as dangerous as driving under the influence of alcohol. In a 2009 study by Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, it showed that five seconds is the minimal time period for the motorist's attention to be diverted from the road to result in a traffic accident. Text messaging, for example, makes a crash up to 23 times more likely to happen.",6,270,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00270
2014-09-08-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"At this point, I would like to add one more point on bus fleet operators especially for the private bus fleet operators. I hope that the Ministry would work closely with the operators and the Association to look at the compensation framework that is being used by the operators today. I think for any compensation that is linked to, say, the number of trips that a bus driver can make within a certain time period, can drive very dangerous behaviours.",7,271,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00271
2014-09-08-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"A bus, given its larger mass, would mean that it has higher inertia. And given its mass, any impact that it makes on a pedestrian or anyone on the road can cause very serious damages and injuries to the person involved. And given its capacity, any accident that it is involved in, the passengers that it is ferrying, the number of them would definitely increase and, therefore, potentially multiplying the tragedies that can happen on the road.",8,272,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00272
2014-09-08-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"On this note, I would like to urge the Ministry to work closely with the bus operators. It is not something that is unfamiliar to us; we hear about bus drivers feeling pressured on the road because they are trying to make more money and therefore trying to pack more bus trips within a short time span. And because of this pressure, it can definitely drive dangerous driving behaviours on the road.",9,273,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00273
2014-09-08-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"I believe that each life is precious and we all know that we only live life once. One can always try again after losing the driving licence, one can always try again or try something else after losing a driving job even if that can be really, really tough. There is no doubt about that. But one can never recover a life lost once it is lost. A life is lost is lost forever, no amount of fines or remorse can console the anguish of the family who survived the victim. We need to deter errant driving behaviours in a proactive manner and not wait for a tragedy to happen before we react to it.",10,274,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00274
2014-09-08-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Hence, legislation and enforcement are necessary. Apart from enhancing penalties, I believe proactive education is also critical to cultivating safe driving behaviours. On this, I wish to commend the introduction of the voluntary Safe Driving Course. This is a useful and critical complement to the enhancement of penalties, enabling repentant motorists to reflect, refresh and relearn safe driving behaviours. Besides the voluntary Safe Driving Course, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State to also share with the House what other preventive measures are being put in place to educate motorists and our population at large about road safety.

The lines between phones, tablets and laptops have blurred and merged. Hence, we must close the loophole in our current Act which only targets calls and texts on handphones, and send a strong, clear message to all motorists that inattentive driving will not be tolerated. This is not because we want to be overly restrictive but because we value lives and limbs. Fatalities and casualties due to such careless behaviour are unnecessary and unacceptable. To do any less would be utterly irresponsible and show a heartless disregard for the safety and lives of other road users.",2,314,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00314
2014-09-08-T-022,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The number of drivers caught using their mobile phones have been increasing from about 2,800 in 2011 to over 3,500 last year. These figures support our observation that many motorists are ignorant or choose to ignore the danger of constantly attending to every Tweet, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, email and SMS while operating a machine weighing a few tonnes, moving between 40 to 90 kilometres or more per hour. Researchers around the world have found that drivers tend to be overconfident in their driving skills and underestimate the risks of inattentive driving, particularly while using mobile devices, whether the devices are being held or mounted in holders.",3,315,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00315
2014-09-08-T-022,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Even worse, we all know that these figures form only the tip of the iceberg and are part of the bigger problem of distracted driving. Distracted driving includes attending to mobile devices, setting or changing GPS systems, watching videos, eating or drinking, smoking, reading maps, speaking on the phone or to passengers, looking after unsecured children or pets, personal grooming, adjusting a radio, CD player, or MP3 player, and so on and so forth. For example, setting or changing a GPS system or touching the screen of a mobile device mounted in a holder requires the motorist to take his eyes off the road for a few seconds, and we all know that in those few seconds, we are, in effect, driving blind, which, needless to say, is extremely dangerous and potentially fatal. Distracted driving is deemed to be such a serious problem that the US government has a dedicated website to raise awareness and campaign against it.",4,316,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00316
2014-09-08-T-022,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Hence, I would like to urge the Ministry to amend the Act to include a more comprehensive framework to penalise distracted driving as well. I would be the first to admit that enforcement is a challenge but we must do this to protect our motorists, passengers and other road users. Additional legislative support will provide our law enforcement officers with the tools to ensure that our drivers pay attention to the most important task at hand – arriving at their destinations safely. Some of us may feel that this is unnecessary and onerous. How are our taxi drivers, for example, going to check on taxi bookings? What about mounted navigation systems? Can I not just pick up a call on my hands-free set from my Mom and tell her I will be home in 10 minutes' time? Why are drivers held solely responsible? Should we not also penalise pedestrians whose eyes are on their mobile devices as they cross the roads?",5,317,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00317
2014-09-08-T-022,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Let us all examine these problems as people become increasingly tied to their mobiles. Let us have robust discussions and debates, within the Ministry, through public forums and dialogue sessions, and formulate a new consensus on how to tackle distracted driving holistically. The new framework should include long term public education and, very importantly, legislative teeth. Our law enforcement staff should be able to assess evidence easily and quickly, with minimum red tape, to penalise dangerous drivers and keep them off our roads. For example, the Traffic Police should be able to obtain information from a driver's telco provider to verify his activity online at the time of the offence in order to prove beyond doubt that the driver has used the mobile device while driving.",6,318,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00318

2014-09-08-T-022,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I believe that behaviours and mindsets, both positive and negative, are consistent and contagious. There are psychology research materials to prove this as well. Focused drivers are less likely to engage in irresponsible driving habits. I believe that once we establish a safety conscious culture among our motorists, our roads will be among the safest in the world. This is one area where I would dearly like to see Singapore take the lead. Incidentally, Minister, may I take this opportunity to ask how is Singapore's ranking for road safety in recent global findings?",8,320,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00320
2014-09-08-T-022,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Lastly, I would like to voice support for the amendments to sections 84(1) and (2) which impose a duty on a driver whose motor vehicle was involved in an accident to take reasonable steps to inform and provide his particulars to the owner of the damaged vehicle or structure or injured animal, even if the owner was not present at the scene of the accident, and to make a police report within 24 hours unless he was contacted by the owner.

2014-09-08-T-022,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I would like to suggest that the Minister consider including further amendments to provide greater clarity regarding emergency treatment for an injured animal which is narrowly defined as a horse, sheep, pig, goat or dog, etc. If the owner can be contacted, arrangements for treatment would naturally be made. But what if the owner could not be reached? Should there be a legal obligation for the driver, after failed attempts to contact the owner or establish the identity of the owner, if any, to contact a relevant agency to treat the injured animal, most probably a dog? And which agency should it be? I am aware that quite a number of drivers had sent injured animals to private vet clinics and hospitals or engage vet ambulances. However, should this be a legal obligation? It should be as it is the humane thing to do and is also a moral and ethical obligation. With that, I support the Bill.",10,322,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00322

They spent more time on the road and cover more mileage than most drivers and, therefore, have a higher probability of encountering incidents on the road. We are not condoning drivers with bad habits, but while addressing the needs of these drivers to stay on the roads and to make a living, we are also making efforts to ensure that our roads are safer. This particular programme represents an innovative way to motivate them.",3,325,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00325
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Upon cultivating good driving habits, the incidence of accidents arising from bad habits will be reduced and the livelihood of these vocational drivers safeguarded as well.",4,326,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00326
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Content development of the SDC should therefore incorporate inputs from behavioural experts on what shapes drivers' driving habits and how to correct bad habits. This will help curriculum planners and driving instructors design better and run more effective courses. We should not end up with drivers going through the motion of attending the safety driving course but, rather, ensure that it will result in effectively instilling better and more responsible driving habits. It is important that those who attend the safety course understand and realise the importance of driving safely. Perhaps the course can also consider showing videos of accidents or close shaves arising from unsafe driving.",5,327,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00327
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"To this end, I sincerely hope the Traffic Police will enlist and consult extensively with behavioural experts to make sure that the course meets its intended objective. Nonetheless, this policy reflects a readiness by the authorities to take decisive actions early on to help errant driving behaviour, while at the same time benefitting other road users.",6,328,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00328
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"On enforcement, currently, drivers who use their hands to call or text using a mobile phone while driving are committing an offence. The use of any mobile communication device while driving is an extension of the current laws. The Bill is a move in the right direction; it encourages responsible driving before such a phenomenon becomes more pervasive and results in more injuries or loss of lives. Just like how alcohol impairs judgment, putting an intoxicated driver behind the steering wheel puts other drivers and pedestrians on the roads at a higher risk. Similarly, a driver, whose eyes are glued to his mobile phone or his hands are operating the phone or other devices while the vehicle is in motion, will be distracted as well.",7,329,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00329
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Some have shared in this House and elsewhere that they have seen motorists engage in activities such as having a dog on the lap, applying make-up or smoking while driving. They felt that these should be covered under these amendments as well. In fact, any activities or actions that may distract the driver from driving in a safe manner, or result in driving in an erratic or dangerous manner that may endanger the lives of others, is already an offence.",8,330,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00330
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"However, laws alone will not be enough. We need to educate the public and drive home the point of being responsible road users to both drivers and pedestrians. As such, I also would like to urge pedestrians and cyclists to be more aware of their surroundings when they are on the roads to check and look out for on-coming traffic from all directions. And for pedestrians, not to have earphones plugged to their ears, eyes fixed onto their mobile phones or devices while crossing the roads and ignoring traffic that comes from different directions.",9,331,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00331
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Other examples shared with me include those faced by taxi drivers who shared that commuters also can play a part. Some commuters have attempted to show the drivers the map to their destination while the driver is on the road and driving, or to pass their phone to the driver while he is driving, so that their friend on the other side of line can provide directions to the destination. These efforts are dangerous. Do plan your routes beforehand and discuss with the driver before he sets off.",10,332,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00332
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Education and enforcement, Madam, need to work in tandem because everyone plays an equally important part to ensure that our roads are safe. To this end, I hope that more resources can be channelled to help our Singapore Road Safety Council mount publicity and educational programmes to meet this goal.",11,333,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00333
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"On the third area of engineering, specifically on road designs, how roads are designed can also affect the safety of road users for both pedestrians and drivers. We need to identify potential danger spots early and make safety enhancements. For example, simple tasks like pruning tree foliage to avoid blocking of street lights or traffic lights, reviewing road designs at accident-prone areas, installing road calming designs in housing areas are some examples. It is heartened to note that the Land Transport Authority is already installing new road safety features at selected locations from August 2014.",12,334,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00334
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"The Silver Zone pilot programme's objective is to make our roads safer for senior pedestrians. Improvements include special road signs and markings to demarcate the Silver Zones, ramp-downs for barrier-free access, road humps to reduce vehicle speeds and reducing the speed limit on these roads. I look forward to seeing more estates join the programme.",13,335,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00335
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Another area where there have been enhancements to road safety is for roads located outside schools. Currently, those outside Primary schools are identified with ""School Zone"" signs and the roads are painted with red markings to alert drivers that they are travelling within a school zone. Vehicles are required to slow down while driving along the roads fronting the schools.",14,336,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00336
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"In fact, Madam, incorporating better road designs and engineering considerations that promote road safety should be a planning norm as we plan for new schools, new estates and elderly homes.",15,337,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00337
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"The fourth area is on enabling technology. Today, some high-end vehicles are fitted with safety devices such as auto-brake functions that slow down vehicles if they sense a pedestrian or a car in the path of their travel; adaptive cruise control or use of sensors such as radar and cameras to monitor the distance of the vehicle to a lead vehicle, and the system will automatically slow the vehicle down to maintain a safe distance; adaptive headlights which switch on automatically round a bend or when the surrounding lighting is dim; side-view assist sensors which can detect a car in the blind spot and emit an alert with a light in side mirror; backup camera to see what is behind the vehicle; reverse backup sensors which beep when the vehicle is about to hit an object.",16,338,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00338
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"These devices serve as safety aids to help drivers navigate in a safer manner on the roads. With lower costs, such devices are gradually being introduced to more vehicles, both vocational vehicles and household cars. To this end, I would like to commend ComfortDelGro and SBS Transit for piloting a new smart camera which gives visual and audio warnings on traffic risks while the bus or taxi is in motion. SMRT has also installed a telematic device on their buses to monitor drivers' driving behaviour in real-time and alert them when they have exceeded the speed limit, accelerate or brake too abruptly or negotiate a turn too sharply. It is certainly of great help to drivers if they are alerted when the vehicle is travelling too close to another car or pedestrian. This will aid them in taking appropriate steps to avert an impending collision.",17,339,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00339
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"To further raise the level of safety on the roads, perhaps the Traffic Police and LTA can work together to consider issuing rebates to car dealers to install safety enabling technology in their vehicles. It may speed up such adoption. A case in point is the Carbon Emissions-Based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS). The scheme takes into consideration a car's carbon emissions and fuel efficiency to encourage importers and consumers to shift to low emission models. More cars now come with low carbon emissions and the environment has become a lot cleaner.",18,340,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00340
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Car manufacturers all around the world are constantly developing newer ways and devices that enable drivers to receive real-time alerts of road hazards; systems that can analyse camera data and alert drivers of potential safety threats, such as impending collisions and unexpected obstacles.",19,341,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00341
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),I hope that the agencies can consider an approach similar to the CEVS for enabling technologies to be installed for new vehicles. These will make our roads a whole lot safer.,20,342,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00342
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),Enabling technology need not be expensive; it can be low in costs as well. Drivers need to note the importance of eye health and go for regular check-ups to assess their vision and eye health. Better vision on the roads can be as simple as wearing a pair of spectacles or sunglasses so that the glare from the sun or inadequate eye care due to fatigue may not affect our ability to see properly when driving.,21,343,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00343
2014-09-08-T-022,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, with the proposed amendments, I believe we can work towards cultivating more responsible road use by drivers and road users. In particular, the Safety Driving Course is an innovative policy to encourage a change in behaviour. Some may argue that it is the responsibility of all drivers to drive safely and there should not be any incentive. In fact, it is my opinion that the reduction of demerit points to make that outcome a reality is more of a motivation than incentive. I believe, at the heart of this policy lies the desire of the authorities to provide a reason, a strong motivation for drivers to adopt better and safer driving behaviour. Surely, it is a path worth exploring to arrive at safer roads for all. With that, Madam, I support the Bill.",22,344,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00344
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Madam, I would like to thank Members who have expressed support for the Bill and their recognition of Traffic Police's (TP's) efforts in keeping our roads safe. At the same time, Members have raised good and pertinent points which can be grouped into four main themes  first, our overall strategy for road safety; second, the enforcement of traffic offences, in particular, the handphone driving offence; third, public education and driver competency; and, finally, responsible road use. Let me address each of these four main issues before I speak on other specific issues Members have raised.",1,345,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00345
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Madam, allow me to begin by reiterating some of the key tenets of our strategy on enhancing road safety. At its core, all road users must exercise individual responsibility to cultivate and practise safe and courteous road use. Laws alone are not enough. Other stakeholders, including Government and employers, also have a part to play. The Safer Roads Singapore (SRS) initiative, which I mentioned, was launched in 2013 with its three-pronged approach of enforcement, education and engagement so as to engender a culture of safe and courteous road use.",2,346,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00346
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Our proposed amendments to the Road Traffic Act (RTA) take reference from the SRS roadmap and give some of these initiatives that were previously announced. The implementation of SRS has been progressing well. We have stepped up our tempo of enforcement.,3,347,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00347
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Zainal Sapari spoke about the importance of effective enforcement. Traffic Police (TP) has deployed an additional 70 Traffic Police officers as well as Auxiliary Police Officers on our roads since 2013. Indeed, Mr Lim's pointing out of increase in violation is in no small part a result of violations alone but also the result of increased enforcement.",4,348,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00348
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Anecdotally, I have been told that motorists have felt this increased presence on the roads and feel safer and more reassured because of this. Mr Lim also mentioned certain hotspots. TP does take into account feedback from the community in the deployment of its enforcement resources. I will also inform TP about the specific areas of concern that the Member has mentioned. Apart from more officers on the roads, TP has also been installing digital red-light and speed cameras – 60 digital red-light cameras have been installed since March 2014. These initiatives will augment TP's enforcement capabilities and allow them to effectively enforce the amendments being discussed today.",5,349,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00349
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On education, TP has implemented several initiatives, such as requiring all learner motorcycle riders to take the Expressway Familiarisation Ride course, as well as revising the retraining course for motorists facing their first or second suspensions, to have a more comprehensive curriculum and more stringent passing standards. On the engagement fronts, TP has worked with the Singapore Road Safety Council to launch the Singapore Road Safety Award to recognise fleet owners that are committed to improving road safety.",6,350,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00350
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I also chair the Safer Roads Industry Taskforce (SRIT) together with Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. SRIT is a platform for us to engage key stakeholders, including the private bus operators that Ms Tin Pei Ling spoke about, on road safety initiatives for vocational drivers.",7,351,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00351
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our overall strategy for road safety has served us well. Between 2003 and 2013, our road traffic fatality rate fell by over 40% to 2.9 fatalities per 100,000 persons. In response to Mr Gan Thiam Poh's query on how we fair in global rankings on road safety, it is, unfortunately, not meaningful to rely on international rankings for road safety as various jurisdictions adopt different definitions in measuring accident statistics. Instead, it is more important that we keep a close watch over our own accident trends over time and continually review them – review our policies, enforcement and education measures so that we can continue to improve road safety.",8,352,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00352
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Madam, I will now move on to address specific questions and comments from Members on enforcement. In particular, many Members have spoken on the expansion of the handphone driving offence and I would like to thank Members for their support. Indeed, many Members have said that we have not gone far enough. But let me clarify that the expanded offence will cover the use of any function of a mobile communicative device. The examples raised by Mr Lim and Mr Gerald Giam – of playing games, reading e-books on a mobile communication device, or reading downloaded emails and documents – will indeed be captured under the new offence if the driver holds the device in one hand while the vehicle is in motion.",9,353,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00353
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Several Members, such as Mr Zainal, Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Gan, Mr Giam, Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Lim, have asked whether we should have broadened the scope of the handphone driving offence beyond what has been proposed.",10,354,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00354
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As a principle, drivers should be focused on driving and not be distracted at any time. Like Mr Gan, we are just as concerned about distracted driving. Madam, the proliferation in the use of mobile devices such as handphones and their expanded range of functions – trends which Ms Tin Pei Ling had also highlighted – explains why we proposed broadening the scope of the handphone driving offence.",11,355,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00355
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"However, we also recognise that it is neither possible nor practical for the law to specify all the actions and even devices that could potentially distract the driver. Our proposed approach for the handphone driving offence is consistent with that taken in other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong which do not permit the use of mobile communication devices while the vehicle is in motion but generally allow the use of hands-free sets and operation of mounted or in-built devices.",12,356,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00356
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As Mr Zainal and Mr Kumar have pointed out, other jurisdictions, such as the UK and some Australian states, go a step further to prohibit the use of handphones in stationary vehicles. Mr Zainal had also asked whether we should prohibit driving instructors from using their mobile devices while conducting classes for learner drivers. The driving schools have been advised by TP that their instructors should refrain from doing so when conducting driving classes. This has, indeed, been a long-standing practice.",13,357,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00357
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To sum up, our approach with respect to defining the scope of the handphone driving offence, we have deliberately decided to take a measured approach in tightening the rules on handphone driving. But we will continue to monitor this situation after the new changes come into effect and study the practices of other jurisdictions as they evolve to deal with other types of smart devices that are being developed.",14,358,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00358
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Nonetheless, I would like to emphasise that regardless of the scope of this offence, it is the individual responsibility of every motorist to display a duty of care on our roads. Mr Zainal and Mr Kumar have asked whether exemptions could be granted, for instance, to allow the use of handphones in emergency situations. As far as possible, motorists, even in emergency situations, should find a place to stop before making the call. Within the Home Team, Police officers who drive or ride alone are required to pull over to the side of the road if they need to use a handphone, even in emergency situations. That said, each case is assessed based on its individual circumstances, no different from how other traffic offences are enforced.",15,359,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00359
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Gan have suggested raising the penalties for the offence, especially for handphone driving. Our assessment is that the current penalties provided within the RTA are sufficient. A motorist who commits this offence will be fined $200 and given 12 demerit points. If he is charged in court, he can face a maximum penalty of $1,000 fine and up to six months' imprisonment as a first-time offender. The maximum penalties for repeat offenders are double that for first-time offenders. These penalties should be seen within the context of the overall increase in TP enforcement which, taken together, serve to deter such behaviour.",16,360,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00360
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On the broader issue of distracted driving, TP may take action against motorists for the offence of inconsiderate driving under section 65 of the RTA, as mentioned by Mr Pritam Singh, if they display irresponsible road use behaviour. The offence carries a penalty of up to $1,000 fine and up to six months' imprisonment for first-time offenders convicted in court, who may also face disqualification. In response to Mr Pritam Singh's question, there were 6,527 and 3,220 cases of inconsiderate driving in 2013 and the first half of 2014 respectively. However, TP does not track which cases can be specifically attributed to distracted driving as there may be several factors that can contribute to inconsiderate driving.",17,361,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00361
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Madam, a third theme running across several Members' speeches relates to public education and driver competency. Allow me to address these points in turn.",18,362,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00362
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Ang and Ms Tin said that education and enforcement need to work in tandem. I agree. They are parts of the mutually reinforcing thrusts under the SRS roadmap. Mr Ang also asked the Government to provide greater support to the Singapore Road Safety Council on its education initiatives. In practice, TP works very closely with the Council and supports many of its outreach efforts, such as annual road safety campaigns. And in addition to funding provided by MHA, the Singapore Road Safety Council has also been very active in raising funds from the community and its key stakeholders in support of its efforts. This is encouraging and also reflects the principle of shared responsibility for road safety.",19,363,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00363
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Lim asked if we could emphasise road safety education for the vulnerable road users, including students and the elderly. In fact, TP already conducts targeted outreach to educate these vulnerable groups about road safety. In 2013, TP had conducted talks for over 90,000 young and elderly persons, and also organised 70 exhibitions for these groups. We will do more. I would also like to inform Mr Kumar that during the engagements with young children, TP also emphasises the importance of wearing seatbelts for child seats. This forms part of TP's overall preventive education efforts that Ms Tin and Mr Kumar asked about.",20,364,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00364
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Specifically on public education on the dangers of handphone driving, I think it is important to put this in context. There are many other types of behaviour that contribute to distracted driving, which several Members have alluded to. Mr Ang and Mr Gan will be happy to know that the dangers of handphone driving are already an essential part of TP's general road safety education efforts on distracted driving. Learner motorists are also taught, from the onset, the dangers of distracted driving as part of their basic theory education.",21,365,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00365
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Madam, education also plays a key part in ensuring driver competency. I am glad that Mr Ang and Ms Tin support the introduction of the Safe Driving Course (SDC). Mr Ang has suggested that the SDC curriculum should incorporate inputs from behavioural experts and also show videos of road accidents. The SDC was developed by TP's testers, in close collaboration with the driving schools, to focus on correcting bad driving habits. Students will undergo lessons on basic driving theory, including defensive driving, as well as practical driving, before taking the theory and practical tests. They will also view videos on traffic accidents to discuss common mistakes made by motorists and to identify learning points.",22,366,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00366
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Lim has asked about the intents of the amendment to section 35A. The amendments to sections 35A and 45 will allow the Minister to prescribe situations where TP will be allowed to cancel demerit points. The intent is to allow TP to recognise good behaviour. The application of these amendments will be confined to situations, such as passing of the SDC, that the Ministry specifically prescribes. It will not apply to appeals for individual cases. The SDC allows for early intervention and retraining of motorists and will equip motorists with the relevant defensive driving skills. We have made the SDC voluntary rather than mandatory as it is the individual responsibility of each motorist to be proactive in improving his own driving habits.",23,367,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00367
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Giam and Mr Lim raised some questions about the licensing requirements for foreign drivers. Singapore is a signatory to international treaties on the recognition of driving licences, which allow Singaporeans holding Singapore-issued licences to drive in other countries. In return, we accord the same privileges to foreigners who are temporarily in Singapore holding driving licences issued by signatory countries. We have also studied the practices of other jurisdictions. Many allow non-tourist foreigners to drive with their foreign licences for a designated period. This can range from a month to 12 months. We have decided on six months, which is consistent with countries like Germany. In enforcing this provision, TP may require an extract of the driving licence records from the overseas licensing authority, for instance, when TP has reason to believe that the licence had been forged or tampered with.",24,368,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00368
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Lim commented on the tightened licensing requirements for foreign vocational drivers. Vocational drivers spend long hours on the road and owe a greater duty of care as they may ferry passengers or goods. The policy intent behind our requirement for foreign vocational drivers to obtain a local driving licence is to ensure that they are competent and understand our traffic laws when they drive on our roads. This is also why, in response to Mr Lim's comments, the law will apply to all work pass holders, whether they drive full-time or are asked to ferry passengers or goods on an ad hoc basis as part of their work. For example, a warehouse assistant who may have to deliver goods at times as part of his job would still be required to obtain a local licence.",25,369,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00369
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Madam, I will now move on to the fourth theme. This pertains to responsible road use.",26,370,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00370
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will introduce the rebuttable presumption regime, which allows TP to presume that a vehicle owner was responsible for the commission of a traffic offence if he does not provide the driver's particulars. I would like to assure Mr Lim that TP endeavours to inform vehicle owners promptly after a traffic offence is detected. TP is also on track in installing almost 260 additional digital red light and speed cameras by the first half of 2015. This will further speed up TP's processing time for these traffic offences. I must emphasise, however, that it is still ultimately the duty of vehicle owners to ensure responsible use of their vehicles, keep track of those who use their vehicles and assist with the administration of justice.

He asked particularly if there should be a legal obligation for a driver to contact a relevant agency to treat an animal injured in an accident. The objective of this provision in the RTA is to ensure restitution for victims of accidents – in this case, the owner of the animal. Drivers should also first ensure that it is safe to stop before contacting any other party for assistance or when they want to assist the animals. Nevertheless, we thank Mr Gan for his question and would encourage drivers who hit animals to contact the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).",28,372,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00372
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Before I conclude, let me address some of the other issues that Mr Ang has raised. I agree with him about the importance of road design in keeping our roads safe. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) regularly reviews and audits the design of Singapore's roads. For example, LTA's Black Spot Programme tracks locations with a high incidence of traffic accidents, and introduces customised road engineering treatments to reduce the number and severity of accidents.",29,373,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00373
2014-09-08-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Ang has also cited examples of fleet owners that have proactively installed road safety vehicular technologies. These are indeed worthy efforts. Such technologies not only improve road safety, but also raise productivity by reducing accidents, downtime, as well as repair, maintenance and insurance costs. The Government has helped to encourage companies adopt such devices. For example, the Singapore Transport Association and SPRING Singapore recently collaborated to launch the Mobileye advanced driver awareness system to about 100 transportation and logistics companies. SPRING provided funding through its Capability Development Grant to help SMEs defray the costs of adopting Mobileye. I hope that more companies will recognise the broader benefits of adopting such vehicular technology.",30,374,2014-09-08-T-022-S-00374

We have also consulted the Singapore Road Safety Council and Automobile Association of Singapore. Every road user has a part to play. I have also highlighted the importance of education and enforcement under the broader SRS roadmap. I am thus heartened that Members support the proposed amendments.

First, that the fulfilment of Singaporeans’ aspirations is closely tied to Singapore having strong economic growth. Second, it means that we need to ensure that there is a strong alignment between our people's knowledge and skills -- the supply side -- and the jobs and skills that are needed -- the demand side.

Education focused on equipping Singaporeans with deeper technical expertise to meet this environment. The late 1990s to 2000s saw a knowledge-based economy, so education geared for critical thinking, creativity and innovation. Now, 2014 onwards, we are once again on the cusp.

I have actually heard that since the National Day Rally (NDR) and the ASPIRE report, some children have been telling their parents that since it is now about skills, they do not have to study anymore. If only! There is a misapprehension that skills means only doing things with your hands, or some manual form of work. “Skills” means much more than that.",12,391,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00391
2014-09-08-T-023,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"What does it mean? First, and this is not term of art or a technical definition, but I think broadly, skills means knowledge plus application plus experience. The knowledge part, necessarily, includes, but is not limited to, academic content and theory. So, for example, it is not possible to do construction work, which involves measurement and dimensions, without maths, otherwise you might have a very crooked house. You cannot do product design without learning about materials and understanding manufacturing processes. Hence, our primary and secondary schools have an academic syllabus to provide a strong foundation for our students, whether they later choose an academic route or a more applied route such as the Polytechnics and ITE.",13,392,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00392

It is what you can do with what you know.” And this is where applied learning comes in. It allows students to learn through practice and application. And the workplace is one of the best places for applied learning. Experience is, of course, the fruit of constant practice and application. That is the first thing.",14,393,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00393
2014-09-08-T-023,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The second thing about skills is that when we refer to skills, we are also referring to hard skills and soft skills. Hard skills are the technical know-how. Here, let me emphasise, it is not limited to skills in the technical sectors such as precision engineering. It also includes skills in the service sector, for example, hospitality as well as skills in the professions like nursing and accountancy. It covers the entire spectrum of work. Then, there are “soft skills”. These are things like attitude, leadership, communication skills, teamwork, the ability to work across cultures, the ability to deal with people, the ability to solve problems.",15,394,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00394

2014-09-08-T-023,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Jobs are becoming more complex. For example, in the past, if you were a car mechanic doing maintenance and repair, all you needed was mechanical knowledge. Today, car functions are increasingly computerised. If something goes wrong, it is not just a matter of a mechanical repair. There is also a need to run computer diagnostics on the car to find out what is wrong. In future, we will have driverless cars. The car mechanic will have to acquire even more skill sets. In fact, he may be replaced by a maintenance robot. To stay relevant, he will need skills that enable him to direct and control the robot -- a higher order of skills.",19,398,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00398

2014-09-08-T-023,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),The second way of progressing through skills is building on skills. We want people to be able to progress by building upon a solid preceding layer of skills at each stage.

We want people to progress not only by building on skills but by widening their scope. For example, you could have a technician or an engineer on the shop floor, and this person may, after sometime, show leadership or organisational potential. To help that person fulfil potential, we need to broaden his/her skills, for example, by sending him or her to a course in project management and human resource management.

On skills upgrading, we should come up with more options for workers to upgrade. ITEs and Polytechnics can offer more CET courses to help more workers to upgrade and update their skills. At the same time, we should also leverage on the capability and capacity of companies' inhouse training programmes, as well as those offered by industry-based training providers both locally and globally. We should bring the best training to Singapore through whatever channels that is appropriate. In short, as we improve and expand the role and effectiveness of ITEs and Polytechnics in CET for the working adults, we should also improve and expand on the capacity and capability of CET in the industry. This is to make sure that the CET channel in itself does not end up being the bottleneck.",4,482,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00482
2014-09-08-T-023,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan (Nominated Member),"On career development and advancement, we should strengthen the link between skills upgrading and job performance, career opportunities and wage improvement. No point upgrading the workers with new skills and then ask him to continue doing the same job in the same old way. As we help every worker to upgrade to be a better worker, we should also improve his current job into a more productive job, help him move into a higher level job to enable him to earn a higher salary and have a brighter career prospect.",5,483,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00483
2014-09-08-T-023,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan (Nominated Member),"In the Labour Movement, we call this the 4-in-1 ladder of Progressive Wage Model (PWM). The four ladders are  skills, productivity, job and wages. You would notice that we did not include academic qualification as one of our ladders in our PWM. Not because it is not important; rather, I believe that academic qualification should be a means to an end, not the end and the objective. A person should be employed because he or she can do the current job and be promoted because he or she can do the next job well. It is not about qualification. It is about skill, competency, and the pride and commitment to always give his or her best to the team, to the organisation.",6,484,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00484
2014-09-08-T-023,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan (Nominated Member),"Sir, looking ahead, we can and will do well if we are able to bring the best out of our workers, regardless of whether they are degree holders or non-degree holders.

2014-09-08-T-023,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan (Nominated Member),"(In Tamil)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, companies should take efforts to develop their workers into skilful workers. Whether the workers possess a degree or a Polytechnic diploma, they should either provide training within their premises or send them to appropriate places for training. Workers should not miss the opportunities given to them. They should always be prepared. The Government should take a lead in these efforts. On seeing the efforts of the Government, companies should move forward and follow it. In this regard, I hope that the Government will set an example. Now may I switch to English?",8,486,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00486
2014-09-08-T-023,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan (Nominated Member),"(In English)  Sir, I commend the good efforts of the ASPIRE Committee. Our challenge now is to work together as tripartite partners to change the mindset on the ground. I am encouraged that the public sector will lead by example. The rest of us should not wait. We all can play our part. Let us all change together, make every job a better job, every worker a better worker, regardless of academic qualification, on our unending journey towards better jobs for all. Sir, I support the motion.",9,487,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00487
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this important motion. To quote a recent editorial in The Business Times last week  the ASPIRE “proposals are not just another tweak to the educational system but possibly the missing piece in the restructuring jigsaw puzzle that the Government has set out to complete”. The premise the article made for this statement is that a dual vocational training model for ITE and Polytechnic students, as recommended by the ASPIRE Committee, will help to better train and match a skilled workforce here with industry demand, thus keeping the economy competitive.",1,488,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00488
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Through this one example, we can agree that ASPIRE does have its benefits and this vocational training model has worked in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, to show desirable results.",2,489,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00489
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"There are several considerations for these proposals to be effective within Singapore’s economic and social context, given the way our pathways and definitions of success have been ingrained and set for many years since our Independence.",3,490,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00490
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"A few days after the ASPIRE recommendations were announced, I visited ITE College East with its Board of Governors and management team, and had the opportunity to meet some of the students. In one of the classes, we did a quick straw poll using a show of hands. We asked, “How many would like to take a diploma once they have completed their ITE course?” Almost everyone had their hands up. “How many were open to work to continue their vocation right after ITE?” Only about one in 20. “How many had heard of the ASPIRE recommendations?” About half.",4,491,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00491
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I spoke to some of them who had put their hands up on pursuing their diploma after ITE, and asked if they were doing it because of parental pressure. They said, partly. But mostly, it was because they believed it was their pathway to success.",5,492,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00492
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"For the one student who did put his hand up to go straight to work after ITE. He said he had heard of the ASPIRE programme, and he thinks it is a “win-win”; those were his own words. Earn some money while he worked, and if he does well, he could gain his diploma through the potential employer. He thinks it will work for him.",6,493,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00493
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Given that this is a new, unproven concept in Singapore, the first practical concern is our value system, of how we define success. This is important because it will also determine how students view their pathways of success and the mindsets of parents. I see this culture shift to be the biggest hurdle. Over time, with better communication and career guidance provided, I believe it is possible that more students and more parents can be convinced.",7,494,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00494
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"There are other practical concerns that students may face with some of these recommendations and let me share some of them. Just by embarking on a vocational training model alone, a Polytechnic student for example who has to blend his academic time with practical experience may take longer to graduate.",8,495,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00495
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"So, not only is he going to enter the workforce later, he will also be doing so at lesser qualifications in current view and thus lower pay, because previously he could have spent that extra time on a degree and enter the workforce at a higher pay. We have to ensure that they do not lose out on salary differentials because they take longer to graduate. I understand the Senior Minister of State also spoke earlier in terms of deepening skills and mastery of crafts. I understand the ideals. But the practical concerns of many parents would be whether the ASPIRE programme will ensure that my kids or kids from ITEs and Polytechnics will enjoy the same quality of life that graduates today enjoy? We have to address the issue that salaries and quality of life will play an important role in signalling and how we get employers to play along, I think that is the key thing.",9,496,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00496
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Recently, I also attended a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) commissioning parade, and noted that SCDF was recently accredited by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency as an in-house Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) Approved Training Organisation. This means SCDF and WDA can provide SCDF NS personnel with industry-recognised certifications, thus better preparing our servicemen when they make the transition from NS to the workforce. I understand that SCDF is among the first units from the Home Team that is undertaking this. I would like to suggest that if we can expand this concept, relevant NS units can look into expanding certifiable vocation training while our men from ITEs and Polytechnics are also serving National Service. This ensures that the two years in NS can help build their vocational training with relevant skill credits, so that momentum is not lost on our Polytechnic and ITE graduates, after they graduate and go to work.",10,497,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00497
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Some Polytechnic students I spoke to said that while they do not mind exploring a greater vocational or work experience component with their diploma curriculum, they, however, voiced some concerns that while Singapore may value the diploma and added work exposure more, this may not be the case when they are seeking work opportunities with overseas firms – where the traditional value of a degree would still outweigh the Polytechnic diploma and the ITE certificate. Thus, the ASPIRE programme must work towards both national and international recognition among foreign employers and governments.",11,498,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00498
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Sir, this is a practical concern as they will also be competing for job opportunities and at work with foreign employees coming to Singapore with degree or higher qualifications. How do we ensure that our diploma and ITE certificate holders who are pursing master craftsmanship will not be disadvantaged or will be able to compete against foreign degree holders, some of whom may be more experienced and with lower salary expectations? We must also address this practical concern on how we help level this playing field over time.",12,499,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00499
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Sir, moving on to the impact of the ASPIRE recommendations on employers. For starters, employers will need to make room to hire more ITE and Polytechnic students under the place-and-train programme. This does not just include the cost of hiring additional headcount, but to make the experience more meaningful, companies will have to dedicate extra resources, including existing staff, to oversee, train and guide the students.",13,500,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00500
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Many employers are concerned with staff retention after investing in vocational training and upgrading of qualifications. Often, once a staff has attained his or her degree, there will be expectations of a higher salary. Also, following vocational training and a degree or a diploma, there are also more opportunities for the staff to look around for better paying jobs – which is only natural.",14,501,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00501
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"This means employers have to find more senior positions or more responsibilities for such staff in order to retain them in order to justify for the higher salaries, the higher responsibilities and expectations of higher productivity. This may be a challenge for the SMEs, which also hire the bulk of our workforce.",15,502,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00502
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"For this scheme to be effective, employers must come on board and participate effectively. In asking this commitment from our employers, I would like to suggest that the Government consider giving them some additional subsidies or incentives. Our companies, which have been firm partners in the country’s restructuring efforts even as they bear with the higher costs of doing so, will undoubtedly appreciate this assistance.",16,503,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00503
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Beyond incentives, one way companies may find the vocational training approach more attractive and value-added is to have more industry standards certifications provided as part of the curriculum or programme. Using the IT sector as an example, for computer science, engineering or related courses, we should enable the students in ITEs and Polytechnics to undertake their CCNA, CCIE, MCSE or related IT certifications during their vocational training. This will incentivise employers to hire them as they already come in ready with industry-related certification. Today, many of these industry certifications are taken on a part-time basis while under employment.",17,504,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00504
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"While more technical sectors will welcome such a shift in the human resource landscape here as they have more access to more skilled labour, other industries may have to alter their business models just to adjust to a changing labour market. But at the same time we should not also underestimate the value that generalist graduates bring to some industries as these carry their own skills sets, which some employers may find useful.",18,505,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00505
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Sir, since the announcement, many questions have been raised which have created confusion among some employers and members of the community. The teaching profession, for example, has committed for sometime to new teachers being degree holders. In recent years, an early childhood diploma for pre-school teachers is now the norm. Online, questions have also been raised on whether Ministers, Members of Parliament, or even the Administrative Service should be open to Polytechnic graduates too. Most have been answered in the respective forums. This is a new concept – a work in progress.",19,506,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00506
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We are in transition but we do need to close the loop on these contradictions or perceptions of contradictions. There are more examples I am sure, but we must persevere to get the communications and messaging right on what we mean by alternative pathways, differences in what is presently practised and how we address some of these practical concerns.",20,507,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00507
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Otherwise, it is also not fair to prospective students, employers and parents if they get the wrong interpretation. Some have also began to question, whether the Government is also saying that the degrees are overrated and are no longer required?",21,508,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00508
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"But I think this is where the Public Service has to take the lead, and employers in the private sector will nonetheless be looking this way to take the cue. The model example of how Singapore needs to effect this change in culture, mindset, employment pathways and graduate recruitment, will have to come from none other than the Public Service.",22,509,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00509
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Thus, I propose that one of the first steps by the Government in accepting this recommendation is to initiate a Public Service-wide review by the Public Service Division (PSD) into the impact of the recommendations made by the ASPIRE team on the Civil Service and Public Service, and what are the areas that transformations and changes would be required. The model and pace of transformation in Government will have an impact and likely set the benchmarks for the private sector to adopt.",23,510,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00510
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),There are some principles which I would like to highlight for consideration for a review.,24,511,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00511
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Public sector roles should be based on how well a person can do on the job and not whether he is a degree holder or not. Areas such as salary structures may have to change. The questions like should differences in salary scales of degree holders and those without degrees continue, or should remuneration, promotions and bonuses not be moved towards job responsibility and be productivity-focused?",25,512,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00512
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Today, Civil Service pay structures for fresh graduates still distinguish if the degree holder has a degree or not, and to the extent of which class of honours the graduate has. I think we should remove this and settle on a range, taking into consideration one’s overall value-add in experience – internships, external exposures such as CCA or industry associations for experienced hires, soft-skills, potential responsibilities and so forth.",26,513,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00513
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Questions will also be raised as to whether fast-track schemes for scholars should still exist. At present, many Government scholars are on fast-track career schemes, which provide them more opportunities and quicker upward mobility. I think this should be reviewed to create a more level playing field between graduates and non-graduates with job performance and achievements being the key indicators of who should advance in the organisation and at what pace.",27,514,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00514
2014-09-08-T-023,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The signalling is important, and this scheme has created a culture of divide and perception of inequality between diploma holders, graduates, local scholars and overseas scholars. If we want to move to a value of skills and experience, then, we should remove these perceptions of fast-tracking as well as glass ceilings in the Administrative Service. Enable all civil servants to compete and perform based on ability and experience, and provide promotions, salary increments based fully on performance. I also hope that our Government-linked companies will perform similar reviews and showcase models to benchmark against and the transformational models in the respective industries.

2014-09-08-T-023,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Sir, a friend and former mentor who used to head the human resources of a large organisation told me that he would look for three “Qs” when assessing candidates for senior positions. First one is, of course, IQ – a measure of a person’s intelligence, EQ – a measure of a person’s emotional intelligence or the ability to relate to people, and AQ, or adversity quotient which is a measure of a person’s resilience in the face of adversity. He shared with me a few success stories of individuals who were non-degree holders whom he had helped groom, to rise through rank and file, to become senior managers and leaders of large organisations. Conversely, he also related about a first-class degree holder who could write excellent reports, but could not get along well with fellow colleagues and performed mediocre at best with regard to the quality of his work. Sir, many of us have come across similar persons in our lives. We know that academic qualification alone is not a determinant of success. There are other qualities such as resourcefulness, resilience, integrity, self-belief, which are equally important, if not more important for one to be successful.",2,534,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00534
2014-09-08-T-023,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Sir, this obsession with academic qualification, which our society has, is, unfortunately, our own creation. We have, perhaps, given too much emphasis on paper chase. So much so that parents are prepared to borrow well beyond their means to send their children overseas, sometimes even to universities that lack good credentials, in the belief that any degree will secure a better future for their children. Our system must take some of the blame because we have given too much recognition to academic qualifications, even to the extent that it is counter-productive. For example, we pay higher starting salaries to degree holders, for an entry level job that can be done by diploma holders. Same job, same responsibilities, but paid differently due to differences in academic qualifications. We also impose glass ceiling on capable workers who are non-degree holders, thereby curtailing their true potential. These are unfair practices which discriminate between degree holders and non-degree holders. Eliminating this discrimination will be an important step for us to achieve the objectives of the ASPIRE paper.",3,535,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00535

I believe it will provide the first steps for our youths to be more confident in taking alternative paths rather than the degree route. Getting a degree is still relevant, but there are now alternative paths. In the long term, hopefully not a too distant future, I believe it will raise income levels for the majority of Singaporeans and maybe, finally, reduce the stubborn income gap that has plagued us in recent years.

2014-09-08-T-023,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"First, we need to address the perception that ITE students are inferior to Polytechnic students and Polytechnic students are inferior to Junior College students. We need to educate that there are other strengths in a student, apart from academic excellence, that should be valued. This will not be easy, as we have firmly entrenched this belief in the minds of our students, parents and teachers, but perhaps with more brainstorming this can be done to find some solutions.",5,537,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00537
2014-09-08-T-023,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Second, we need to get buy-in from all employers to reduce or even eliminate recruitment practices and career development policies that unjustly favour degree holders over non-degree holders, as I have described earlier. Employers play a very critical role in making this work. We should push this agenda across all sectors, not just the industry sectors currently served by ITE and Polytechnic and make this a norm rather than an exception. Again, this will be challenging. We will need to persuade both public and private sector companies and organisations to invest time, money and effort to analyse and right-size job levels, job types, job scopes and job responsibilities that are appropriate for entry-level ITE graduates, Polytechnic graduates and degree holders.",6,538,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00538
2014-09-08-T-023,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"They would also need to map out integrated career paths that will show ITE graduates, Polytechnic graduates and degree holders how they could progress in their careers and what other qualifications, if any, are required to move up the career ladder. More importantly, jobs that were exclusive to degree holders in the past should now be made available to non-degree holders as this would level the playing field and compel both the non-degree and degree holders to work harder. Ultimately, it should create a win-win situation for both employer and employee.",7,539,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00539
2014-09-08-T-023,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Sir, allow me to speak in Bahasa Melayu. (In Malay)  [Please refer to Vernacular Speeches.]  In the 2012 Convention Report, one of strategies proposed by the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP) is that the Malay/ Muslim community must maximise the potential of youths who are not highly educated. It is estimated that 45% of the Malay Primary 1 cohort, are likely to continue their education until the ITE. The potential of the ITE and Poly graduates must be maximised since many of these graduates may form the middle class in the future. From the information received, industries with low salaries are mostly represented by the Malay/Muslim community.",8,540,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00540
2014-09-08-T-023,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),Hence it is timely that the government has now come forward with the ASPIRE report with the objective of providing better job opportunities for ITE and Polytechnic graduates.,9,541,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00541
2014-09-08-T-023,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"This does not mean that students should not make the effort to obtain degrees. A degree is a measurement of academic excellence and the community should take the opportunity to use available resources like bursaries and scholarships being offered, in order to improve themselves. The community must also be aware that academic qualifications by itself are not a factor that determines one’s success. Positive qualities or attributes like intelligence, resilience, integrity and self-confidence are more important to achieve success. More importantly, I believe that we must avoid sending our children overseas to further their studies especially if this affects our financial situation. Overseas education requires a large expenditure and it also does not guarantee that the graduates will be employed once they return home to Singapore. One suitable alternative will be to get a job in a good organisation that recognises good performance and provides training and opportunities to staff to improve their skills, qualifications and be able to take on higher job responsibilities.",10,542,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00542
2014-09-08-T-023,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"The Government has now taken steps to enhance job opportunities for workers without degrees and this is beneficial to the community. One the recommendations made is the assistance provided to ITE/Polytechnic students and parents, to make better decisions in choosing industries with better potential.",11,543,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00543
2014-09-08-T-023,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Now, there are success stories of members of the community who are ITE or Polytechnic graduates. One of them, Mr Abu Bakar bin Mohd Nor, is a Singapore Polytechnic graduate who has become a Chief Executive Officer for Nakilat-Keppel Offshore and Marine. We need more role models like him to inspire the community. The world has changed and it is uncertain whether one will be successful even with degree. We must give the confidence to our young people who are ITE and Polytechnic graduates, that they have the change to achieve a bright future.",12,544,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00544

I can see much benefit for Singaporeans if the recommendations are implemented. I would urge, however, for the Government to make this movement across all sectors, and not restrict it to only some sectors. Creating more opportunities and broadening the options available to students, young workers and middle-aged workers will raise worker productivity for our companies, raise the income level of a larger proportion of Singaporeans, and reduce income inequality in Singapore.

2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Following the recommendations of ASPIRE, I must say that I have experienced a lot of discussions on the ground on whether a degree is needed or not. This may miss the point of ASPIRE. At the core of the recommendations, ASPIRE still emphasises the need for deep skills and knowledge to enable one to be impactful in any role. The essence is that there will be many pathways to grow one’s skills and career, and over one’s career and lifetime. Hence, what is important is that we create opportunities for lifelong learning and skills advancement throughout one’s career to enable Singaporeans to thrive.",3,549,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00549

2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"(1) The partnership with businesses, industry and employers to strengthen the opportunities for ITE and Polytechnic graduates to get quality jobs and providing the environment and support to continue to build their skills while in these jobs and to progress in their career;",5,551,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00551
2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),(2) The recommendations to strengthen the training in Polytechnic and ITE to enable success in career and continual learning; and,6,552,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00552
2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),(3) To empower individuals to make well-informed education and career choices.,7,553,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00553
2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"In partnership with businesses, industry and employers, I agree with ASPIRE that this is important, and that it is critical to achieve the objectives set out. Providing the right opportunities are key. But, more importantly, there must also be a focus by businesses who provide these opportunities to support not only the on-boarding of individuals but also the programme and coaching to succeed. While providing on-the-job training, it is also important to provide support to the ITE and Polytechnic graduates when they are in role. Because unless they succeed would they have the confidence to continue to pursue upgrading and mastery. This would also give employers the confidence to stay committed to the programme.",8,554,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00554
2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"In my commercial role in the info-comm industry, I have seen the difference what industry support and coaching can have on the development of Polytechnic and even university undergraduates. Many times in our industry, we conduct regional and global competitions for tertiary students and we provide internship programmes. What I have witnessed is that over even a short sustained period of time, whether it is a few weeks or months, students who have access to and coaching by industry experts, develop and are more effective in role. I have also witnessed how young raw talent grow over the few months in preparation during their internship or competition, resulting in more confident individuals able to share ideas and having positive impact.",9,555,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00555
2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So, while we have place-and-train programmes for the ITE and Polytechnic graduates, I must stress that we must also have ways for employers to assess their competencies and capabilities. This will enable employers to place them in the right roles to start their career journey right. We must recognise that although it may not always be ideal, organisations use academic qualifications as the proxy for evidence of capability and competency. So, moving forward, if we do want to make this shift and drive this change, we need to have a set of criteria to recognise the competencies or the track record of these students to enable employers to assess the capacity and capability of individuals based on evidence of competencies or track record and, hence, make available the right roles.",10,556,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00556
2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I would like now to just quickly touch on the need to also strengthen the training in the Polytechnics and the ITEs to help the young talents not only just acquire technical skills for the roles but also soft skills. Because beyond equipping our students with skills and knowledge, equally important are skills like the ability to communicate, collaborate, have critical thinking, problem solving, curiosity to learn, adaptability to “learn and unlearn” and technology fluency. These are critical and instrumental for our students to do well in their work and in organisations. So, apart from looking for role competencies and skills, many organisations, when they hire for leadership roles, they look for these skills. And these are very critical for individuals to succeed and be impactful in the organisations that they operate in.",11,557,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00557
2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),I would like to touch on the last point about helping individuals make well-informed education and career choices.,12,558,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00558
2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Decisions on educational choices are not trivial and affect both the individual and their families. I have, through the appeal cases from our MPS sessions, seen many families and youths taking decisions to pursue university degrees even when it is costly or not fully aligned to their interest or course of study. They do this with the belief that a degree is the passport to a good job and better career prospects. I had and am seeing an increasing number of people in such situations, and this not only places a financial strain on their families but, more importantly, it also creates disappointment when these individuals are unable to get the jobs after graduation due to the applicability of the course of study to market needs or that it is not really in areas of their strength or interest.",13,559,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00559
2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The recommendations of ASPIRE to empower individuals to make better-informed education or career choices based on their strengths, interests and opportunities will be very important to helping them make the right education and career decisions for themselves that are aligned to market opportunities. This will set them up for success as they will be in a better position to get a job that they have a good chance to do well in and, more importantly, to progress.",14,560,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00560
2014-09-08-T-023,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I would like to conclude by stressing that it is important that we see early success and progression for individuals on the ASPIRE programme. This will build confidence that we can achieve the objective of ASPIRE to provide opportunities for all to progress regardless of their starting point. More importantly, it will help the start of the critical shifts in mindset required for the success of the objectives outlined in ASPIRE. The Government, as one of the largest employers in Singapore, can and must take steps to show the way in implementing the recommendations of ASPIRE, in partnership with ITE and the Polytechnics. This will help set the pace for the shift that is required if we are serious about ASPIRE, and it would also support the aspirations of Singaporeans moving forward.",15,561,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00561

2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Like the hon Members who have spoken before me, I am heartened by and fully support the move to strengthen our Polytechnic and ITE education through closer collaboration among the educational institutions, potential employers, employees and the Government, bearing testament to the often heard saying, “it takes a village to raise a child”.",2,564,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00564
2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"While I agree with the broad directions of the ASPIRE report, there are two areas in which I think that we, as a society, still need to work on.",3,565,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00565
2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"First and foremost, the Government has a crucial role to play in setting the right tone and expectations. The ASPIRE report fundamentally sends the message that employers should look beyond paper qualifications alone. While paper or academic qualifications may be an indicator of a person’s capability, there are those who are examination smart and are able to excel in tests and examinations, while there are those who are late bloomers and will realise their true potential only much later after they have left school.",4,566,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00566
2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"There are other qualities that employers should look at – performance, values, experience and skills – before deciding to hire or promote. It does not necessarily mean that when one does well academically, they will work well with others, be able to lead, or do well in their careers. The converse is also true.",5,567,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00567
2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Hence, it is heartening to note that there will be changes to the civil service hiring policies and salary scales that will give greater recognition to non-university graduates who have performed well and have the relevant experience and skills. I hope this will be emulated by the private sector as well.",6,568,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00568
2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"However, while we give greater recognition to experience, skills and progress above and beyond paper qualifications, there are valid concerns brewing among our youth with regard to foreign talents.",7,569,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00569
2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Some have expressed concern that should they decide to take the less academic path, they will lose out to their foreign counterparts who come armed with university degrees and other postgraduate qualifications.

2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"As it is, some of my younger residents have shared how in the companies that they work in, their employers get around the foreign employee dependency ratio by hiring as many foreigners as possible as their Professional, Management and Executive (PMEs) staff, and making up the local employee quota by hiring all Singaporeans as the support staff. For instance, one of my residents who works as a lawyer in a foreign law firm based here, out of 10 lawyers in the firm, she is the only Singaporean, she says. The firm fulfils the requirements of the dependency ratio ceiling by employing all Singaporeans as the support staff or as non-lawyers.",9,571,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00571
2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"So, may I propose that the Government re-look the foreign employee dependency ratio or Dependency Ratio Ceiling, to require that a certain percentage of local employees is to be met for the PME and E-Pass holder category, and a separate quota to be met for the Technician, support staff and S-Pass holder category. Let us make it a more level playing field for our tertiary graduates to be hired as PMEs in the workplace, especially where these are foreign companies based locally.",10,572,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00572
2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Other than the Government and employers, parents and the community at large also play a vital role, particularly in helping to change mindsets and in shaping the values of our future generation.",11,573,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00573
2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"There are many ways to attain success. Nevertheless, I have met parents who still feel that the only way they deem their children to have attained success in life is when they become a university graduate. Once a university graduate, these parents believe their children will have good jobs that will provide for them for life. Well, life is not always so predictable.",12,574,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00574
2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"A resident I met recently has a university degree in Computer Science from one of our local universities. He landed a cushy IT job with a multinational company that deals with computers. After about 15 years of working with the MNC, his department closed down because of changing global demands, and he found himself out of a job. For about a decade thereafter, he was between jobs working as a housing agent at times and a sales promoter at other times, and never got back into the same IT profession.",13,575,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00575

2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Beyond the tangible, parents and the community at large have an important role to play in changing mindsets. For a start, we have to emphasise to our young that there must be respect for every person and the job that they do. Those who do well should not act as if they are superior to others or that others owe them a living. In fact, I am sure many of us here in this House know of successful people who are anything but arrogant or self-centred. Instead, many of them are kind, humble and generous, and give back to society in many different ways.",16,578,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00578

2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),It is never binary – that those who are wealthy or drive big cars are pompous or those who lead simple lives are always victims of circumstances.

2014-09-08-T-023,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"At the heart of it all, there must always be respect – for self and for others – and there must be humility. If I may quote the late Nelson Mandela  “If you are humble, you are no threat to anybody. Some behave in a way that dominates others. That is a mistake. If you want the cooperation of humans around you, you must make them feel they are important – and you do that by being genuine and humble.

2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Further, the Ministry has also shared of its plans to develop rich learning programmes in our schools that will cater to the diverse talents and interests of our students, like the proposed Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Learning for Life Programme (LLP). These programmes will enable students to apply what they have learnt in the classroom in practical ways and will also teach them important life skills that will benefit them in the long term.",5,593,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00593
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Further, in 2012, the Government formed the Committee on University Education Pathways Beyond 2015 (CUEP), which submitted several key recommendations on how to develop new applied degree pathways that will provide more opportunities and choices for students in a diverse university landscape. One of the important recommendations that was highlighted was the need to develop a university model that offered degrees programmes in niche disciplines that were not being offered by the existing universities, as well as areas that required more skilled manpower.",6,594,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00594
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As a result of this, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) was set up and it focused on establishing and pioneering new educational pathways for students in our Polytechnics to expand the upgrading opportunities available to them and to enable them to attain industry-relevant degrees in their chosen disciplines.",7,595,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00595
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This demonstrates MOE’s continued commitment to regularly augment and enhance our education system to meet the changing needs of each individual student, and to anticipate future educational landscapes.",8,596,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00596
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, I rise in support of this motion today as I believe that the recommendations set out in the ASPIRE Committee report are timely, as it will help to initiate the next phase of the transformation of our education system, particularly with respect to the Polytechnics and ITEs, as the recommendations seek to address how best to strengthen the existing applied education pathways in our Polytechnics and ITEs, and to provide adequate support and assistance to students that hail from diverse backgrounds, interests and abilities.",9,597,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00597
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One aspect of the ASPIRE Committee report that I would like to highlight is its recommendation for the development of new education programmes that will integrate work and study, such as place-and-train programmes. It is envisaged that under these place-and-train programmes, Polytechnic and ITE graduates will be matched to employers committed to supporting on-the-job learning and further upgrading. These employers will provide opportunities for graduates to put their skills into practice while concurrently allowing them to upgrade themselves through learning on-the-job and at the workplace.",10,598,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00598
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I believe that such programmes are important, as they will equip Polytechnic and ITE graduates with a strong theoretical foundation in their chosen discipline, as well as a keen understanding of its real-life application in the relevant industry. Further, such programmes will inject diversity and dynamism into existing Polytechnic and ITE programmes, and will demonstrate the importance and value of learning beyond the classroom.",11,599,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00599
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"It is my hope that by developing a unique blend of teaching-focused, industry-linked and practice-based programmes, Polytechnic and ITE graduates will be given the opportunity to push the boundaries of the existing education system and develop themselves more holistically.",12,600,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00600
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Another aspect of the report that I wish to highlight is its recommendation to take into consideration the skills and prior training of full-time National Servicemen in their deployment during NS. I believe that this initiative should be welcomed as it will enable Polytechnic and ITE graduates to maintain their specialised skills during NS, and might also offer opportunities for them to obtain industry-recognized accreditation for the related vocational specializations. Further, it will facilitate a closer link between a student’s education and career, while allowing the SAF and the Home Team to harness existing skills of these graduates to meet its operational needs.",13,601,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00601
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Lastly, another aspect of the report that bears noting is the Committee’s recommendation to leverage the latest technological advances to expand opportunities for learning online. It is clear that the Internet, mobile computing and education technology offer a powerful combination that may be useful to augment the traditional academic teaching and learning methods.",14,602,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00602
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"By expanding the quantum and types of online learning opportunities that are made available, it will now be easier for students to learn nearly anywhere and at any time. This is particularly beneficial for Polytechnic and ITE students who may be on internships or who may be enrolled in the proposed place-and-train programmes, as it will allow them to have their academic materials easily accessible and would likely reduce the amount of travel time spent going to and from school.",15,603,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00603
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"However, a careful balance must be struck between the essential need for practical hands-on learning and practice, and the ease and potential benefits of expanding online learning opportunities at the Polytechnic and ITE.",16,604,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00604
2014-09-08-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Overall, I firmly support the recommendations that have been proposed by the ASPIRE Committee as I believe that they have identified key aspects of our education system where more can and should be done to allow young Singaporeans in our Polytechnics and ITEs to realise their full potential.",17,605,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00605

Ridzwan began his tertiary education in ITE Central, where he completed his NITEC and Higher NITEC courses before he was accepted to the Electronics, Computer and Communication course at Nanyang Polytechnic.

Similar to Ridzwan, Nigel began his tertiary education at ITE West, where he studied hospitality. Although Nigel was unable to further his studies in hospitality due to the keen competition, Nigel refused to be deterred and decided to pursue a diploma in information technology instead. Most would have given up, but Nigel was committed to pursuing his studies courageously. Further, Nigel affirmed that his ability to make the step from ITE to Polytechnic was only made possible because of the help and support that was rendered to him from the teachers and staff at ITE West.",21,609,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00609

Measures include narrowing the starting salary difference between graduates and non-graduates, and providing more career progression opportunities for non-graduates. These are the best motivators for people to perform well and improve themselves. We may also be able to discover hidden talents who have the same passion, skills and experience but lack academic qualifications.",2,615,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00615

To draw a line based on academic qualifications at the workplace is not conducive for the overall environment. The response from my residents is mixed.

They have the various professional skills; although they do not have a degree, their skills are more practical at the workplace.",3,616,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00616

2014-09-08-T-023,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"With regards to education, the ASPIRE report has specifically mentioned teachers. According to my knowledge, MOE announced in 2008 that they would only hire degree holders from 2015 onwards. Is this policy going to be changed? In addition, we all know that we are facing a shortage of qualified kindergarten and childcare teachers.

Citizens need to realise that this is not about nullifying the abilities of degree holders, or discouraging Singaporeans from furthering their studies. It is about creating additional options and better opportunities for those who do not possess paper qualifications but shine in other ways. Perhaps such scepticism and disapproval also stems from the deeply ingrained belief that academic achievements in school are the only proven and sure means to success in life.",10,623,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00623

Occasionally, we are inspired by the likes of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs who found immense success despite not attending university, but ultimately, parents still find greater security and solace in having their children stick to the apparently longproven route to success – attending renowned educational institutions from the very moment they begin their academic life. It is courageous of the Government, and a longawaited measure, to take a stride away from this belief, but it will take a long time for Singaporeans to cease being cynical about it.",11,624,2014-09-08-T-023-S-00624

2014-09-08-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,MediShield Life will be introduced in end 2015 to provide better protection against large hospital bills for all Singaporeans for life.,1,656,2014-09-08-T-030-S-00656
2014-09-08-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,The Government will provide significant help for Singaporeans to keep MediShield Life premiums affordable in four ways,2,657,2014-09-08-T-030-S-00657
2014-09-08-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,(i) Premium subsidies of up to 50% for the lower- and middle-income;,3,658,2014-09-08-T-030-S-00658
2014-09-08-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,(ii) Special premium subsidies of up to 60% and Medisave top-ups of up to $800 for the Pioneer Generation;,4,659,2014-09-08-T-030-S-00659
2014-09-08-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"(iii) Transitional subsidies for all Singaporeans, to help ease the shift to MediShield Life over four years; and",5,660,2014-09-08-T-030-S-00660
2014-09-08-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,(iv) Additional Premium Support for needy Singaporeans.,6,661,2014-09-08-T-030-S-00661
2014-09-08-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As I explained during the debate on MediShield Life, the premium subsidies for the lower- to middle-income Singaporeans, Pioneer Generation and the Additional Premium Support for the needy are permanent features of MediShield Life. This means that a significant proportion of Singaporeans will continue to enjoy MediShield Life subsidies for life, even after the transitional subsidies have ended in 2019.",7,662,2014-09-08-T-030-S-00662
2014-09-08-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Member asked how inactive CPF members with no or little Medisave savings would pay for their premiums. Currently, about 9 in 10 of adult inactive CPF members have sufficient Medisave balances to pay for at least three years of their MediShield Life premium payable or are currently having their MediShield premiums paid for by family members. The Government also provides regular Medisave top-ups through schemes, such as the GST-Voucher, which can be used to help to pay the premiums.",8,663,2014-09-08-T-030-S-00663
2014-09-08-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"With substantial Government support, most families will be able to fully cover MediShield Life premiums from their Medisave. For example, consider a lower-income family of five where the father supports two elderly parents, his wife and a child, and has a monthly income of $2,000. As their monthly income per household member is $400, the family will qualify for the highest tier of MediShield Life premium subsidies. The permanent subsidies will keep the MediShield Life premium for the whole family affordable at $128 per month, as the father’s monthly Medisave contribution of $180 is more than sufficient to cover the entire family’s premiums.",9,664,2014-09-08-T-030-S-00664
2014-09-08-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For those with genuine financial need, Additional Premium Support can help with their remaining premiums in addition to the various Government subsidies, top-ups and family support. No Singaporean will fall out of MediShield Life due to inability to afford premiums.",10,665,2014-09-08-T-030-S-00665
2014-09-08-T-031,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry tracks what proportion of the Jobs Bank posts are eventually secured by Singaporeans; (b) if not, whether there are plans to measure and publish such data by requiring employers to disclose the outcome of their job postings; and (c) whether such data can be cross-referenced with data from Employment Pass and S-Pass application processes to yield patterns and causes for PMET jobs not going to Singaporeans.",1,666,2014-09-08-T-031-S-00666
2014-09-08-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To date, more than 31,000 Singaporeans have signed up with the Jobs Bank and more than 10,000 employers have come on board and are actively posting job vacancies. There are over 65,000 jobs available on the Jobs Bank today. The feedback from both employers and job seekers has also been positive. It is an encouraging start, and we hope more employers and Singaporean job seekers would use it over time.",1,667,2014-09-08-T-031-S-00667
2014-09-08-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,The Jobs Bank was intended to facilitate a fair hiring process and greater awareness of job vacancies available for Singaporean job seekers. Singaporean job seekers are now able to make job applications directly through the Jobs Bank for a comprehensive list of job openings.,2,668,2014-09-08-T-031-S-00668
2014-09-08-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Jobs Bank and the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) was not, however, set up to guarantee local job seekers that they will always get the job. This will continue to be determined on the basis of merit, and to the best applicant for the job. There can be various reasons why an employer may not end up hiring the Singaporean candidate after considering applications fairly. For example, in the IT sector, there could be jobs that require technical skills or domain knowledge of legacy programming languages, which IT firms use in supporting legacy IT systems of many companies that our local workforce may not possess in sufficient numbers. Likewise, Singaporean job seekers have their reasons for not accepting job offers, for example, if employers are unable to meet their expectations in terms of job scope and other personal considerations.",3,669,2014-09-08-T-031-S-00669
2014-09-08-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Singaporeans may also get placed in jobs through means other than the Jobs Bank. For example, Singaporeans may be hired directly by the firm or through head-hunters or private job portals and other job advertisements. Even when Singaporeans apply for a job that they see on the Jobs Bank, we cannot directly track this. For example, job seekers may apply through firms’ in-house HR portals. Therefore, data on the number of Singaporeans who were placed in a job vacancy which was advertised on the Jobs Bank would not be a representative or accurate indicator of how well Singaporeans are doing in the labour market in general.",4,670,2014-09-08-T-031-S-00670
2014-09-08-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Rather, what is important to us is whether the overall labour market ecosystem benefits Singaporean job seekers. This goes beyond the Jobs Bank and involves broader factors, such as the number and types of jobs being created, and whether our people have the skills and passion for the job. We track and report indicators of citizen employment outcomes regularly, and the situation is healthy. The seasonally adjusted citizen unemployment rate is 3.0%1 and remains much lower than those of many other countries, while Singaporean workers have enjoyed positive real wage growth over the last five years2.",5,671,2014-09-08-T-031-S-00671
2014-09-08-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We are, at the same time, keeping a close watch on firms’ hiring patterns. If a firm has a disproportionately low percentage of PMEs who are Singaporeans compared to their industry peers, we will initiate closer scrutiny of the firm to find out more details about the hiring practices and plans to develop Singaporeans for more senior positions. MOM will assess if HR practices are fair in these firms. If they are not, we will ask the firm to work out a plan to make improvements. Should a firm remain uncooperative, or not adhere to the plan, it may have its work pass privileges curtailed.",6,672,2014-09-08-T-031-S-00672
2014-09-08-T-032,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether businesses have the right to limit the number of coins a customer can use in a transaction; and (b) whether banks should be charging a deposit or administrative fee for coin deposits by businesses, especially SMEs.",1,673,2014-09-08-T-032-S-00673

As specified in the Act, the legal tender limit for coins of denomination below 50-cents is $2. This means that a vendor is obliged to accept any number of coins of denomination below 50-cents for payment up to $2. For 50-cent coins, the limit is $10. There are no limits for payment by $1 coins.",1,674,2014-09-08-T-032-S-00674
2014-09-08-T-032,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),"Under the Act, if a vendor wishes to set a lower limit on the quantity of coins he will accept in a transaction, he must provide a written notice of this to his customers. This may, for example, be by way of displaying a written notice. Otherwise, all denominations of the coins tendered by a customer as payment up to the legal limits must be accepted.",2,675,2014-09-08-T-032-S-00675
2014-09-08-T-032,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),"Banks typically charge a deposit or administrative fee for coin deposits because they incur costs in handling coins. This includes sorting, authenticating, packing and ensuring secure transportation of the coins. The setting of fees and charges for banking services are commercial decisions by the banks. But MAS expects banks to disclose the fees for their services so that consumers can make informed decisions.",3,676,2014-09-08-T-032-S-00676
2014-09-08-T-033,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) if telecommunication service providers are currently still obliged to provide quality services for analogue telephone service users; and (b) if he will provide an update on how the Ministry is working with service providers to prepare the population to adopt digital services while analogue ones are phased out.,1,677,2014-09-08-T-033-S-00677

2014-09-08-T-034,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what measures are in place to ensure that ticket prices for events involving Singapore athletes and teams held at the Singapore Sports Hub are affordable to Singaporeans.",1,684,2014-09-08-T-034-S-00684
2014-09-08-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The Singapore Sports Hub is managed by Sports Hub Pte Ltd (SHPL) under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). Various parties are involved in organising events at the Sports Hub. Many events are organised by private promoters working in partnership with our National Sports Associations (NSAs) and SHPL. Some are organised wholly by private promoters.,1,685,2014-09-08-T-034-S-00685
2014-09-08-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To stage a major sporting event in Singapore, the event promoter has to cover all set-up costs including bringing in the team(s), venue rental, marketing the event, logistics, manpower deployment and activating the operations at the Sports Hub. It is a large undertaking, especially where the 55,000 seat National Stadium is concerned, and so the tickets are priced to factor in these fixed components. At the same time, the event promoter has to price tickets appropriately to sell. As they bear market risk, it is also in their interest to ensure good ticket sales and the success of the event.",2,686,2014-09-08-T-034-S-00686
2014-09-08-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Notwithstanding this, we keep a close watch on the affordability of events which our Team Singapore athletes participate in, as we want all Singaporeans to have the chance to see our athletes in action, and to be able to cheer them on. For events where SportSG is not the main organiser, it will do its best to work with the relevant parties, including the specific NSAs, to ensure that the events are accessible to Singaporeans. Where SportSG is the main organiser for such events, as is the case for the SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games next year, I would like to assure Members that it will set ticket prices that are affordable to Singaporeans.",3,687,2014-09-08-T-034-S-00687

2014-09-08-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been monitoring healthcare charges in the private sector. Between 2007 and 2013, based on a sample of 10 common procedures, the increases in the median Surgeon Fees at the major private hospitals ranged from 3.2% per annum (for Hip Replacement Surgery) to 9.7% per annum (for Heart Bypass Surgery). Similar increases were seen at the 75th percentile level. The overall healthcare inflation rate was 3.4% per annum over the same period.",1,693,2014-09-08-T-036-S-00693
2014-09-08-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Our samples do however show more variation in the rates of increase for charges above the 75th percentile level. This wider variation may reflect underlying differences in case complexity, individual patient conditions, or different charging practices among doctors. It is therefore difficult to determine the direct impact of the GOF on fees.",2,694,2014-09-08-T-036-S-00694

2014-09-08-T-037,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Several measures are in place to encourage and facilitate patients with non-emergency conditions to visit primary care clinics instead of the Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments of public hospitals. For example, Health Promotion Board (HPB) holds regular campaigns to help Singaporeans differentiate between emergencies and non-emergencies, and to encourage Singaporeans to use primary care services if their condition is not an emergency.",1,698,2014-09-08-T-037-S-00698
2014-09-08-T-037,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,HPB is also working with the College of Family Physicians Singapore (CFPS) on media campaigns to encourage more Singaporeans to have a regular family doctor. There will be greater familiarity and trust between the patients and their regular family doctor. This often allows medical conditions to be preemptively managed before they turn into emergencies.,2,699,2014-09-08-T-037-S-00699

These arrangements are extended well beyond office hours, although the peak attendances at the A&E usually occur between 10.00 am and 12.00 noon. ""GPFirst"" is one example where Changi General Hospital works closely with partnering GP clinics to encourage and empower patients to see their GPs first for mild to moderate medical conditions. This way, GPs can manage the non-emergencies and refer only the emergencies to A&E, thereby better utilising our A&E resources.",3,700,2014-09-08-T-037-S-00700

2014-09-08-T-039,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"MSF, AGC, State Courts and MHA work closely together to ensure that juvenile offenders are placed on the most appropriate rehabilitation programme, based on a holistic assessment of each individual’s background, circumstances and risk of re-offending. The programmes encourage offenders to take responsibility for their actions and equip them with the resources and life skills to embark on constructive lifestyles, instead of resorting to crime.",4,711,2014-09-08-T-039-S-00711
2014-09-08-T-039,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"First-time, low-risk offenders are usually placed on diversionary programmes, such as the Guidance Programme or the Streetwise Programme, which have a strong focus on counselling and rehabilitation. The juvenile will be allowed to continue with his or her education while families are actively involved in supporting and helping their children stay crime-free. Higher-risk or repeat offenders are typically placed on probation or in juvenile homes so that they can benefit from more supervision and structure.",5,712,2014-09-08-T-039-S-00712
2014-09-08-T-039,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"As juvenile offending is a complex issue, the Government has set up the National Committee on Youth Guidance and Rehabilitation (NYGR) to coordinate a whole-of-Government response to the issue. I chair the Committee and it has representatives from MSF, MOE, MHA, MOH, AGC and State Courts. In recent years, we have focused our efforts on upstream measures. For instance, in 2013, the Central Youth Guidance Office (CYGO) in MSF started a Parent Outreach and Support project (POSt) in secondary schools to reach out to parents of juveniles who were displaying early signs of risk. Through such dialogues, parents are able to understand how they can play their part to steer their children away from a life of crime. CYGO has also been conducting YouthGO!, a street-outreach programme where youth workers support at-risk juveniles so they will be meaningfully occupied in their studies or work and be resilient when tempted by crime. Since inception in 2011, this programme has seen almost 8,300 interactions between workers and juveniles or youths.",6,713,2014-09-08-T-039-S-00713
2014-09-08-T-039,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"One of the areas we are concerned about is the attitude of the young towards drugs. Many of them may wrongly perceive drugs such as methamphetamine, cannabis or New Psychoactive Substances (NPS), which are chemically modified substances mimicking the effect of controlled drugs, to be less addictive or less dangerous. This is not true. These drugs are known to have long-term physical, social and psychological effects on abusers. Hence, the CNB works closely with schools to coordinate and implement preventive drug education to inform the young about the danger and consequences of drug abuse.",7,714,2014-09-08-T-039-S-00714
2014-09-08-T-039,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The Government will do its part to educate and engage our juveniles and youths. However, the support of families and the community is critical. We all have a part to play in shaping the future of our next generation.",8,715,2014-09-08-T-039-S-00715

2014-09-08-T-040,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Foreign interns are usually brought in under the Training Employment Pass (TEP). We have tightened the scheme in recent years to prevent firms from relying on ""interns"" on a permanent or ongoing basis and to expand internship opportunities for Singaporeans. This has brought down the TEP intern numbers significantly, from a peak of 4,100 in 2010 to 1,200 in 2013.",2,718,2014-09-08-T-040-S-00718

2014-09-08-T-041,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what percentage of taxi passengers use NETS for their taxi fare transactions; (b) what is the average turnaround time for NETS and the taxi companies to credit the taxi drivers the amount earned for the day; (c) whether there were any delays in the crediting process over the last year; and (d) whether there can be a shorter turnaround time for the transfers to be done so that taxi drivers do not have to wait to receive their day's earnings.,1,720,2014-09-08-T-041-S-00720
2014-09-08-T-041,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Several taxi companies already offer a variety of payment options, including new cashless payment options, such as mobile payment and Near Field Communications payment.

2014-09-08-T-041,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Currently, cashless transactions, such as NETS, form about 10% of all taxi fare transactions. Taxi companies take one to three working days to credit the amount earned through NETS into their drivers’ bank accounts.

2014-09-08-T-042,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The Civil Service hires officers based on merit so that the most suitable candidate is selected for the job.

2014-09-08-T-042,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The Civil Service has announced that it intends to merge more of what used to be separate graduate and non-graduate schemes of service into integrated schemes. In these schemes, officers might start at different entry points but, thereafter, they will progress according to their demonstrated performance and the ability to take on larger responsibilities, regardless of their starting point or education qualifications. All officers are given training to acquire the right competencies and knowledge to do their jobs well. The People’s Association, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Home Affairs already have such integrated schemes of service which are open to both graduate and non-graduate officers.",2,725,2014-09-08-T-042-S-00725

Most non-graduates join the Civil Service under the Management Support Scheme. The Management Support Officers can already progress to take on similar jobs as graduates, and be paid comparable salaries.

Most graduates join the Civil Service under the Management Executive Scheme. A merged career scheme will allow non-graduates and graduates to enter at different points of the scheme, and progress in the same scheme based on their performance and readiness to take on larger roles. Naturally, officers need time to gain the relevant skills, knowledge and experience before progressing to larger roles, and the time taken varies across individual officers.",6,729,2014-09-08-T-042-S-00729

2014-09-08-T-043,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs with respect to traffic and parking summonses issued by the Traffic Police and the Land Transport Authority; (a) how many appeals are received on average per month; (b) what percentage of appeals are successful; and (c) what resources are used handling appeals.,1,732,2014-09-08-T-043-S-00732
2014-09-08-T-043,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"In 2013, the Traffic Police received about 2,600 appeals for traffic-related offences per month, while the Land Transport Authority (LTA) received about 7,900 appeals for illegal parking offences per month.",1,733,2014-09-08-T-043-S-00733
2014-09-08-T-043,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Both agencies adopt a firm but fair enforcement stance, which seeks to reinforce the message that motorists are required to comply with traffic rules to avoid, causing danger to other road users or impeding the smooth flow of traffic. We want to deter errant road behaviour and promote good road use habits to keep our roads safe for all users. In line with this, both the Traffic Police and LTA adopt a firm stance when reviewing appeals for summonses to be cancelled or waived. Each appeal is considered carefully on its merits and this does require considerable resources. As a policy, the two agencies will not accede to appeals unless there are very strong extenuating factors. In particular, as summonses from the Traffic Police usually relate to moving offences, which can pose serious danger to other road users, very few appeals to cancel or waive such summonses are acceded to.",2,734,2014-09-08-T-043-S-00734

2014-09-08-T-044,David Ong,Mr David Ong,asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will consider allowing a commercial goods vehicle owner to extend the vehicle's Certificate of Entitlement on an annual basis rather than on a block of five or 10 years especially for vehicles with a usage life that is shorter than the minimum five-year extension.,1,736,2014-09-08-T-044-S-00736
2014-09-08-T-044,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Since February 2013, owners of Category C vehicles (goods vehicles and private buses) are allowed repeated 5-year renewals of their Certificates of Entitlement (COE). Should they deregister their vehicles before the end of the COE period, they will receive a pro-rated refund of the premium paid. Therefore, owners are paying only for the COE that they have used.",1,737,2014-09-08-T-044-S-00737
2014-09-08-T-044,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Allowing goods vehicle owners to renew COEs on an annual basis, as suggested by Mr Ong, may lead to greater variability in deregistrations, as owners decide on deregistration or renewal from year to year depending on the prevailing COE premium, amongst other considerations. This may cause the Category C COE supply to become more volatile and less predictable, leading to more uncertainty for businesses.",2,738,2014-09-08-T-044-S-00738
2014-09-08-T-045,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA reviews the data from telematics devices used by public transport operators and, if so, how does LTA use the data to review bus services; (b) from the data collected, how many bus services in Yew Tee, Chua Chu Kang and Keat Hong are running below established service reliability standards; and (c) how LTA plans to further improve such services.",1,739,2014-09-08-T-045-S-00739

2014-09-08-T-045,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Nevertheless, we believe there is room for improvement. Hence, under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme, we had added three services and 35 buses to serve these three areas. Two services, 188 and 302, are also in the Bus Service Reliability Framework trial launched in February. Over time, this should improve the regularity of the services.",3,742,2014-09-08-T-045-S-00742

Generally, the APS is activated from 7.00 am to 9.00 pm daily so that the audio signals do not adversely affect residents living nearby. In some cases, for example, at junctions near the SAVH premises, LTA has acceded to their request for the APS to commence earlier at 6.00 am and end later at 11.00 pm.",2,745,2014-09-08-T-046-S-00745

2014-09-08-T-048,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Since 1 April 2005, all new Singapore passports are issued with a validity period of five years, instead of the previous 10-year validity period. The shorter 5-year validity period enables the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to incorporate changes to security technology and features in a timely manner. This ensures the security and integrity of the Singapore passport and makes it robust and less susceptible to forgery and tampering. High confidence in the integrity of Singapore passports protects Singaporeans and minimises any inconvenience when they travel.",1,750,2014-09-08-T-048-S-00750

The older Pioneers did not benefit as much from major enhancements in CPF and healthcare policies, such as Medisave (implemented in 1984), MediShield (1990) and the extra interest paid on lower CPF balances (2008). Hence, older Pioneers typically have less Medisave savings compared to younger cohorts. Secondly, while younger Pioneers receive lower Pioneer Generation Medisave top-ups, they are also likely to receive the top-ups over a longer period of time.",2,764,2014-09-08-T-051-S-00764

2014-09-08-T-052,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"City Gas is Singapore’s town gas manufacturer and retailer.

2014-09-08-T-052,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Applications for connection to the town gas network are made through City Gas, which manages the connection process on behalf of PowerGas. The charges that PowerGas levies on consumers to connect their premises to the town gas network are based on charging guidelines approved by EMA. The connection cost for a consumer depends on the size and length of the gas pipes required to connect the consumer’s premise to the gas network. The underlying principle is that the consumer(s) requesting such connections should bear the full costs of connection.",2,769,2014-09-08-T-052-S-00769

2014-09-08-T-053,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"The Department of Statistics (DOS) compiles the quarterly household sector balance sheet using aggregate data at the economy-wide level, and not data at the household level. This is because data on assets and liabilities for individuals and households are not available. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the household sector balance sheet data by deciles.",1,772,2014-09-08-T-053-S-00772
2014-09-08-T-053,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"DOS currently does not compile data on household wealth, as data on many components of household wealth, such as life insurance and bank deposits, are not readily available for statistical compilation. In particular, it is challenging to collect household wealth data through surveys, as personal wealth is a sensitive topic. In fact, the experience of other countries that have collected wealth data through surveys is that individuals tend to under-report their wealth.",2,773,2014-09-08-T-053-S-00773

A significant number of these employees are migrant workers on Work Permit, most of whom are new to Singapore and may be less familiar with the purpose of the MBMF. Other reasons for opting out include donors’ preference for making direct donations to mosques. MUIS does not actively track the number of reinstated donors each year.",2,777,2014-09-08-T-054-S-00777

2014-09-08-T-057,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can install awnings to existing HDB flats as heavy rains and winds have resulted in water splashing into the units and front passageways of these flats in Nee Soon East.,1,785,2014-09-08-T-057-S-00785
2014-09-08-T-057,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In designing new flats, HDB takes into account the need for weather protection, and has provided canopies above windows and along corridors to reduce the impact of rainwater splashing. Typically, flats will also be provided with top-hung windows which can be opened during rain to allow for natural ventilation. In doing so, HDB balances between shielding the rain off completely and achieving good natural ventilation/lighting.",1,786,2014-09-08-T-057-S-00786
2014-09-08-T-057,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In tropical Singapore, it is inevitable that some rainwater may splash into the semi-open areas such as the common corridors, especially during a heavy downpour. To assist residents, HDB provides rain screens along common areas on a case-by-case basis if splashing is severe. HDB also works with residents to install a simple weather strip underneath their entrance doors to prevent rainwater from seeping into the flat and/or to fix a panel onto the gate to minimise splashing onto the main door.",2,787,2014-09-08-T-057-S-00787

The monthly payout depends on various factors, such as when they joined the LBS, share of proceeds, and the starting balance in their CPF Retirement Account.",2,802,2014-09-08-T-060-S-00802
2014-09-08-T-061,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the basis for increasing the legal requisition fee for drainage interpretation plans by 95% from $18 to $35 considering that no plans are actually supplied by NEA unless there are specific drainage works affecting the property concerned; and (b) what is the breakdown of the costs involved for providing replies for the legal requisitions.,1,803,2014-09-08-T-061-S-00803
2014-09-08-T-061,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"A legal requisition for drainage interpretation plans is usually made by lawyers acting for clients who are buying a property. Its purpose is to check whether a property is affected by drainage reserves safeguarded by the Government for public purposes. As there are potentially major financial implications for the client, NEA will need to verify the relevant drainage plans based on comprehensive authoritative records. If the property is affected by drainage reserves, NEA will provide a copy of the relevant drainage plan. If the property is not affected by any drainage reserves, NEA will issue a categorical statement to that effect.",1,804,2014-09-08-T-061-S-00804
2014-09-08-T-061,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"To provide this service, NEA needs to maintain an updated database with accurate and comprehensive drainage information for the whole of Singapore. The fee charged is based on the resources required to process the requisitions and maintain the database. This fee has not been increased for more than 10 years, and has not kept pace with the costs of providing the service.

They also enjoy lower effective road tax and are exempted from diesel fuel taxes. Second, businesses are allowed repeated 5-year renewals of their COE. This facilitates their cash flow management. Third, under the Early Turnover Scheme, businesses can transfer any unused COE life to a new vehicle and enjoy discounts if they replace their more pollutive Pre-Euro/Euro I diesel commercial vehicles.

2014-09-08-T-068,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"asked the Minister for Education in each of the last three years, what is the breakdown of school and tuition fees collected from students in primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges and pre-universities, polytechnics, and universities, according to Singapore citizens, permanent residents and foreigners respectively.",1,830,2014-09-08-T-068-S-00830
2014-09-08-T-068,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,Fees are reviewed regularly and are differentiated by nationality to reflect the privileges of citizenship. The total fees collected in any given year would depend on the prevailing fees and the student enrolment in that year.,1,831,2014-09-08-T-068-S-00831
2014-09-08-T-068,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In general education, the school and miscellaneous fees collected from students in Government and Government-aided schools (GGAS) are set out in Table 1 below.",2,832,2014-09-08-T-068-S-00832

2014-09-08-T-068,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Overall, total fees collected from Singaporean students have gone up mainly because of a larger number of Singaporeans enrolled in post-secondary institutions, and some fee increases. For PR and international students, the increase in fee collection is primarily due to fee increases, as PR and international students face higher fee increases than locals.",6,836,2014-09-08-T-068-S-00836
2014-09-08-T-069,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian,"asked the Minister for Education (a) what are the criteria and weightage of each criterion in the consideration of schools to be merged or to be relocated; (b) whether the Ministry is looking into conserving ""pioneer"" Government schools that are set up before our independence in 1965; (c) how the discontinuation of established schools (with long histories and niche programmes) support the Ministry's stand that every school is a good school; and (d) how does the Ministry decide whether a school has a ""critical mass of students"".",1,837,2014-09-08-T-069-S-00837
2014-09-08-T-069,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"To provide a quality education, support students’ holistic development, and provide them with a rich learning experience, there needs to be an adequate number of students for meaningful class organisation and interactions as well as the provision of a rich array of learning programmes, both curricular and co-curricular.",1,838,2014-09-08-T-069-S-00838
2014-09-08-T-069,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Given the significance of schools to students and alumni, and the emotional attachment between students, alumni and their schools, as far as possible we would not want to merge schools. However, in some mature estates, the population of school going children has declined, and enrolment in some schools are too low for them to offer a good range of educational programmes and co-curricular activities. The merger of schools will allow their students to benefit from the range of educational programmes that can cater to the all-round development of students. This is in fact one way that we provide better programmes to bring out the best in every child, and make every school a good school. Moreover, by deploying our teachers and other resources in an optimal manner, including to schools in new towns with higher population densities, we raise the quality of schools across the board.",2,839,2014-09-08-T-069-S-00839
2014-09-08-T-069,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Schools are identified for mergers based on several factors such as the size of enrolment, the nature of existing programmes, the suitability of merger partners and infrastructure capacity. These factors are considered qualitatively before a decision is taken. In some cases in the past, MOE had relocated schools when there was low demand for school places in a particular estate, or when it was not feasible to upgrade the existing school facilities due to land and building constraints.",3,840,2014-09-08-T-069-S-00840
2014-09-08-T-069,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"MOE seeks to preserve the history and heritage of the schools which are merged by documenting the history of each school. In many schools, these are displayed at a heritage space in the merged school building. This serves to inform and educate the new student cohorts of the school’s history and legacy. For example, Queenstown Primary School which was set up before Singapore’s independence had previously merged with Birkhall Road School in 1984 and with Mei Chin Primary and Tanglin Primary in 2002. The school has a Heritage Corner to reflect its rich legacy by documenting the history of the other three schools.",4,841,2014-09-08-T-069-S-00841
2014-09-08-T-070,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry can consider extending the land lease of St John's Home in Sennett Estate at Potong Pasir beyond the current offer of only three years when the lease expires in December 2015.,1,842,2014-09-08-T-070-S-00842
2014-09-08-T-070,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,St John’s home is on a 30-year lease expiring on 31 December 2015. We understand the Home would like to continue operating at the same location. The Government is supportive of a 3+3 years tenancy for St John’s Home upon lease expiry. This would provide continuity for the elderly residents.,1,843,2014-09-08-T-070-S-00843
2014-09-08-T-071,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what is the rationale for requiring Flag Day applicants to maintain average gross proceeds of at least $50,000 over the last three Flag Days.",1,844,2014-09-08-T-071-S-00844
2014-09-08-T-071,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) allocates dates for flag days and issues fundraising permits to its Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) members. Every year, there are more applicants than the number of available flag days, and open balloting is used to allocate the slots. To encourage VWOs to make full use of each flag day and permit, NCSS has a requirement for applicants to achieve an average of $50,000 over three flag days. In practice, NCSS has exercised flexibility and granted waivers to many applicants that did not meet the requirement so that they could continue to ballot for available flag day slots.",1,845,2014-09-08-T-071-S-00845
2014-09-08-T-072,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many stay-at home mothers are there currently in Singapore and of these, how many live in three-room HDB flats and below; (b) as of 2014, how much CPF savings on average does each of them have in their CPF accounts at the age of 65 years; (c) of all women aged 65 years and older, what percentage of them are widows and among them, what is the percentage living in poverty; and (d) what is the comparable rate of poverty for men aged 65 years and older.",1,846,2014-09-08-T-072-S-00846
2014-09-08-T-072,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"There were approximately 690,000 economically inactive women in 2013. About 45% (312,000) of them were inactive because of family responsibilities (housework, childcare or care-giving to families/relatives). Data on the corresponding flat types for this group is unavailable. Amongst the approximately 193,000 women aged 65 and older in 2010, latest available census data indicates that about half were widows.",1,847,2014-09-08-T-072-S-00847
2014-09-08-T-072,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Based on CPFB’s data, the average CPF balance of all female members who turned 65 in 2013 is $56,000. Balances are generally lower for older cohorts because (i) wages were lower in the past, (ii) fewer women worked, (iii) withdrawal rules were more liberal, and (iv) older CPF members had fewer years to benefit from recent improvements to the CPF, such as Workfare and the Extra Interest of 1%.",2,848,2014-09-08-T-072-S-00848
2014-09-08-T-072,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Looking at data on CPF balances alone will not give us a complete picture for assessing how vulnerable an elderly person is.

2014-09-08-T-072,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Over time we expect the CPF balances of women to rise with increasing female labour force participation.

2014-09-08-T-072,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For the vulnerable elderly with no income or family support, there are various government assistance schemes to help them including the ComCare Long Term Assistance scheme (also known as Public Assistance).

While it is not compulsory for them to contribute to the Ordinary and Special Accounts, they are encouraged to make voluntary contributions to save for retirement. Such contributions can qualify for tax relief, subject to a cap.",2,854,2014-09-08-T-073-S-00854
2014-09-08-T-073,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Government encourages self-employed persons to contribute to their CPF accounts to cater to their retirement needs. We raise awareness through various channels such as annual mailers, media stories, outreach events and e-newsletters. We also provide support through measures such as the Workfare Income Supplement and Medisave top-ups. Industry associations and companies also play an important role in encouraging their self-employed persons to contribute to their Medisave. One example is the Drive-and-Save scheme implemented in 2011 where taxi companies make co-contributions towards taxi drivers’ Medisave accounts. We encourage more to do the same.",3,855,2014-09-08-T-073-S-00855

There are over 65,000 jobs available on the Jobs Bank today. The feedback from both employers and job seekers has also been positive. It’s an encouraging start, and we hope more employers and Singaporean job seekers would use it over time.",1,857,2014-09-08-T-074-S-00857
2014-09-08-T-074,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,The Jobs Bank was intended to facilitate a fair hiring process and greater awareness of job vacancies available for Singaporean job seekers.

2014-09-08-T-074,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Jobs Bank and the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) was not, however, set up to guarantee local job seekers that they will always get the job. This will continue to be determined on the basis of merit, and to the best applicant for the job. There can be various reasons why an employer may not end up hiring the Singaporean candidate after considering applications fairly. For example, in the IT sector, there could be jobs that require technical skills or domain knowledge of legacy programming languages, which IT firms use in supporting legacy IT systems of many companies that our local workforce may not possess in sufficient numbers. Likewise, Singaporean job seekers have their reasons for not accepting job offers – for example – if employers are unable to meet their expectations in terms of job scope and other personal considerations.",3,859,2014-09-08-T-074-S-00859
2014-09-08-T-074,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Singaporeans may also get placed in jobs through means other than the Jobs Bank. For example, Singaporeans may be hired directly by the firm or through head-hunters or private job portals and other job ads. Even when Singaporeans apply for a job that they see on the Jobs Bank, we cannot directly track this. For example, job seekers may apply through firms’ in-house HR portals. Therefore, data on the number of Singaporeans who were placed in a job vacancy which was advertised on the Jobs Bank would not be a representative or accurate indicator of how well Singaporeans are doing in the labour market in general.",4,860,2014-09-08-T-074-S-00860
2014-09-08-T-074,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Rather, what is important to us is whether the overall labour market ecosystem benefits Singaporean job seekers. This goes beyond the Jobs Bank and involves broader factors such as the number and types of jobs being created, and whether our people have the skills and passion for the job. We track and report indicators of citizen employment outcomes regularly, and the situation is healthy. The seasonally adjusted citizen unemployment rate is 3.0%6 and remains much lower than those of many other countries, while Singaporean workers have enjoyed positive real wage growth over the last five years7.",5,861,2014-09-08-T-074-S-00861

If a firm has a disproportionately low percentage of PMEs who are Singaporeans compared to their industry peers, we will initiate closer scrutiny of the firm, to find out more details about the hiring practices and plans to develop Singaporeans for more senior positions. MOM will assess if HR practices are fair in these firms. If they are not, we will ask the firm to work out a plan to make improvements. Should a firm remain uncooperative, or not adhere to the plan, it may have its work pass privileges curtailed.",6,862,2014-09-08-T-074-S-00862
