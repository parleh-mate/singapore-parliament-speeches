2020-02-27-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Transport whether taxi drivers aged 65 and above who have taken their medical assessments for their personal driving licence may be exempted from retaking the same tests for their vocational licence within the same year.,1,6,2020-02-27-T-002-S-00006
2020-02-27-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Speaker, Traffic Police require all drivers aged 65 and above to pass a medical examination to certify their fitness to drive a private car once every three years, in order to retain their Class 3 personal driving licences. Among these older drivers who wish to drive a taxi, LTA requires them to also pass a medical examination with additional occupation-related health checks to certify their fitness to renew their Taxi Driver Vocational Licences (TDVL). We subject taxi drivers to more stringent medical assessment as they clock a much higher mileage than other motorists. This is to protect the commuting public.",1,7,2020-02-27-T-002-S-00007
2020-02-27-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Transport),"LTA is working with the Traffic Police to align the two medical assessment processes.

2020-02-27-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State. I am very happy to hear that these will be aligned. It will definitely cost less to our residents. I have two supplementary questions.",1,10,2020-02-27-T-002-S-00010
2020-02-27-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"According to my resident, for Class 4 and 5, Traffic Police's enhanced Heavy Vehicle Proficiency Test fee is about $450. LTA's enhanced Taxi Driver's Vocational Licence test is $136. Both require separate medical examinations for both licence-holders aged 69 to 74 years. Residents feel that this is very expensive, very heavy on them. I welcome the alignment and I would also like to urge that the test fee can be further reduced. Four hundred fifty dollars is very high to many of them.",2,11,2020-02-27-T-002-S-00011
2020-02-27-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The second question is, at this difficult period of the COVID-19 crisis, would the Ministry work with taxi companies to work on rental reduction? Many of them have given feedback that their incomes have been reduced by as much as 50%.",3,12,2020-02-27-T-002-S-00012
2020-02-27-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, for the test fees, we are continually looking at the process of how we do these medical assessments. We will take the test fees into consideration. I thank the Member for her suggestion. We will have a look at this.",1,13,2020-02-27-T-002-S-00013
2020-02-27-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"In terms of the broader issue of the taxi operators, we have announced some measures to help the taxi industry – some are directed at the drivers and some are directed at the operators. We will continue to work closely with the association, in line with the tripartite model, to look and see what is the effectiveness of the interventions we put in place and to see whether or not further interventions are necessary.",2,14,2020-02-27-T-002-S-00014
2020-02-27-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past year, how many people have been penalised for jaywalking; (b) how does the Ministry monitor areas where jaywalking is prevalent; (c) how many fatal traffic accidents were caused by jaywalking in the past three years; (d) whether the Ministry plans to implement additional measures to reduce the danger of fatal traffic accidents to the elderly who jaywalk; and (e) whether there is a need to review the current penalties to deter jaywalking.",1,15,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00015
2020-02-27-T-003,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"In 2019, Traffic Police (TP) detected about 2,500 jaywalking violations. From 2017 to 2019, there were 59 fatal traffic accidents involving jaywalkers. Elderly jaywalkers were involved in about 68% of them.",1,16,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00016
2020-02-27-T-003,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"In recent years, TP have stepped up its engagement of elderly pedestrians. In 2019, TP organised the Road Safety Carnival themed ""Be Seen, Be Safe"" for more than 1,000 senior citizens, to raise awareness on the importance of using designated pedestrian crossings and how to cross roads safely. This year, TP will be working with the Lion Befrienders Service Association and NTUC Health Co-operative Limited to train staff and volunteers to become Road Safety Champions to engage senior citizens on road safety.",2,17,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00017
2020-02-27-T-003,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"To further improve safety for elderly pedestrians, LTA has implemented Silver Zones at locations with a high proportion of senior residents, and where there have been accidents involving seniors. Silver Zones have senior-friendly road safety features, such as rest points for pedestrians along road dividers and signs to alert motorists of the presence of elderly pedestrians. LTA plans to increase the number of Silver Zones from 17 in 2019 to 50 by 2023.",3,18,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00018
2020-02-27-T-003,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"TP regularly conducts enforcement operations at accident-prone locations and jaywalking hot-spots. Under the Road Traffic Act, it is an offence for pedestrians to fail to cross at a pedestrian crossing. The composition sum for this offence was raised from $20 to $50 on 1 April 2019. We will monitor the situation and consider further measures if necessary.",4,19,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00019
2020-02-27-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I do not have five supplementary questions, but I have two. When I first came to Singapore, many of my cousins told me, ""Don't jaywalk. You have to cross by following traffic rules. Otherwise, Police will catch you and will fine you."" And therefore, I am very law-abiding. But today, I cannot say the same thing to the visitors to Singapore because you can see jaywalkers everywhere. It is so common. To many of us, we feel that there is no enforcement or very little enforcement. Will Ministry step up enforcement and whether it will use technology, for example, CCTV, facial recognition, especially at those locations that have had fatal accidents? The Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned just now 59 fatal accidents involving jaywalkers. That is very many.",1,20,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00020
2020-02-27-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The second question is, I also have residents who give feedback that increasingly, that when pedestrians cross the roads, their eyes are glued to the phone. Currently, we know that this is not enforceable. I would like to ask whether this is dangerous and if there is any action to be taken.",2,21,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00021
2020-02-27-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for her follow-up questions. As I had mentioned in my earlier reply, definitely, more education, more outreach will be conducted by TP. I have spoken about the ""Be Seen, Be Safe"" campaign. We will also be working with more community outreach organisations such as Lion Befrienders and NTUC Health Co-operative. The Member mentioned that, anecdotally, she sees on the roads is that there are more and more jaywalkers. We are aligned in wanting to deter pedestrians from jaywalking because it definitely causes a danger to themselves. So, we have to find effective ways of reaching out to them to tell them that this is dangerous for them. They can cause harm to themselves; they can also cause harm to motorists, who might have to suddenly swerve to avoid them and they might get into accidents. So, definitely, we are aligned in that we need to conduct more education and outreach efforts.",1,22,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00022
2020-02-27-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"On enforcement, I hear what the Member has said about increasing enforcement. When there is feedback about jaywalking hot-spots, TP would intensify their operations as and when they hear feedback from the ground regarding this. On the use of CCTV and technological means, for these to be effective, as the Member mentioned, there needs to be the use of facial recognition technology. There is some feedback from the ground that the use of such technology can be quite invasive. So, while we are definitely considering it, I think we also have to be mindful that too much use of such technology may cause discomfort on the ground as well. Dr Yaacob in his Budget debate speech also talked about whether or not there needs to be a community conversation around the use of technology in public spaces.",2,23,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00023
2020-02-27-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,We will bear in mind what the Member has mentioned and continuously look at better ways to conduct enforcement as well as education outreach efforts.,3,24,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00024
2020-02-27-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,The Member's second question was —,4,25,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00025
2020-02-27-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,Pedestrians crossing the road and their eyes are glued to their mobile phones.,1,26,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00026
2020-02-27-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Yes. So, that would be part and parcel of our education outreach efforts. It is not just about using your mobile phone when crossing the road. Even using your mobile phone while going up an escalator can be dangerous. When we reach out to pedestrians, especially when they are on the roads, and in this case, we are talking about elderly pedestrians, then, all the more, they need to be mindful of their surroundings. Having their eyes glued to the mobile phone is definitely a dangerous thing to do when they are crossing the road.",1,27,2020-02-27-T-003-S-00027
2020-02-27-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider increasing the period during which Government-Paid Paternity Leave may be consumed from within 12 months of childbirth to within 24 months of childbirth.,1,28,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00028
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Speaker, fathers play an important role in their children's care and development. For this reason, we have progressively increased parental leave provisions to support fathers in caring for their children. Today, fathers can tap on up to eight weeks of leave in the year after their child's birth, including two weeks of paternity leave and four weeks of shared parental leave.",1,29,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00029
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Prime Minister),"Similar to maternity leave, paternity leave should be consumed within 12 months of childbirth, as it is meant to support working fathers in caring for their infants when they are younger and in need of more care. For this reason, we have no plans to extend it to 24 months of childbirth. This is also in line with international practice where parents are typically required to consume maternity and paternity leave within a few months or up to a year after the child's birth. This is the practice in many countries such as Denmark, United Kingdom and South Korea.",2,30,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00030
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Prime Minister),"After the child turns one, parents can continue to tap on other forms of leave support. This includes six days of unpaid infant care leave per parent per year until the child turns two, on top of six days of paid childcare leave, which each parent can take annually until the child turns seven. Together with tripartite partners, we also encourage employers to provide up to four weeks of unpaid leave per year if their employees have children below two years old who need more care, for example, due to medical conditions. This is a provision under the Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, which I must thank the Member Mr Louis Ng for helping to bring about.",3,31,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00031
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Prime Minister),"Beyond leave provisions, the Government will continue to work with employers to better support parents in managing their work and family responsibilities. This includes promoting the adoption of flexible work arrangements and encouraging more family-friendly practices at workplaces.",4,32,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00032
2020-02-27-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.,1,33,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00033
2020-02-27-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister for the reply. I think what was shocking for me was that in 2018, 65% of fathers in Singapore did not even take one day of paternity leave. I am just wondering whether the Ministry is looking into this further, whether we are looking at Denmark, UK and South Korea – the three countries that the Minister mentioned – what is the take-up rates of paternity leave there and what are they doing that can help increase our take-up of paternity leave.",1,34,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00034
2020-02-27-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The second clarification is a suggestion, actually. I understand the default arrangement now is that the fathers have to take their paternity leave within 16 weeks of child birth and he has to take it in a two-week continuous block. For any other arrangement, they would need the employers' consent. I am just wondering whether we can make the default arrangement that the fathers can take it anytime within the 12 months of child birth and they do not need to take it in a continuous block. Maybe then, there will be an increase in the number of fathers taking up the paternity leave.",2,35,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00035
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The figure of 65%, if I recall correctly, is within a certain period of reporting. What happens is that you need the employers to have submitted the claims in order for the true picture to emerge. So, usually, fathers have one year after the child's birth to take leave and employers have three months after the fathers take leave to submit the claims. So, I would take that 65% in context.",1,36,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00036
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Member asked about the experience in other countries. It is actually very interesting. I still recall visiting Denmark, one of the Nordic countries that is very well-known for its family-friendly policies as well as, overall, very strong support for parenthood. If my memory serves me right, I was myself, quite surprised that their paternity leave utilisation was just about 70%, not higher than that. So, I asked my counterpart to explain to me why this was so. I recall quite distinctly being told that even in a country like Denmark, there are certain sectors, where it is just not considered at the workplace to be very acceptable for the man to go on paternity leave. That is the reason why, even for them, the paternity leave is not closer to 100%.",2,37,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00037
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"It is quite the case for also a country like South Korea. Paternity leave utilisation is around 3%, very low.",3,38,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00038
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"What these countries experiences suggest to us is that workplace norms, how accepting the co-workers are and also the employers are, for paternity leave utilisation, that is still something that is being worked on.",4,39,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00039
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In the Singapore context, actually we have been making very good progress. Today, the paternity leave utilisation is about 53%, that is not too bad. Within the public sector, the utilisation rate is even higher, about 84%. So, within the public sector, the utilisation already surpasses some of the Nordic countries.",5,40,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00040
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"What can we do? I think a change of norms, which is something I see happening to a very large extent. You see very many more fathers are involved in the raising of their children. Can we encourage employers to be even more supportive? I think the answer is yes.",6,41,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00041
2020-02-27-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"If I may just make an observation. This is, I think the fifth time you have asked the question about paternity leave in as many months. So, we are happy to answer your slightly different questions. I hope that you are equally happy with our slightly different answers. During the COS, where we get a chance to deal with marriage and parenthood in a more comprehensive manner, I think we can have a fuller exchange. So, I seek the Member's indulgence for us to take the rest of your questions together in the COS.",7,42,2020-02-27-T-004-S-00042

I dedicate my speech today to two important issues close to my heart, care-giving and ending sexual violence. It is my hope in 2020 that we dedicate more attention to addressing these critical issues and make greater strides towards a more inclusive society and a safer society for all.",1,47,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00047
2020-02-27-T-005,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"Today, my parents are 65. They lead active lives, but ten years down the road, their lives could possibly be very different as they enter their golden years. As a child to my ageing parents, the prospect of assuming some care-giving responsibilities sometime in the near future weighs on my mind. I am hardly alone in this. Around me, peers of my age share similar concerns. The old age dependency ratio in Singapore has been declining over the decades. In 1990, it was 10.5 younger person to an elderly person. In 2019, the ratio has halved to 4.5. As our loved ones grow older, there are fewer of us to share the labour and responsibilities of care-giving with.",2,48,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00048
2020-02-27-T-005,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),How will we continue to lead the lives we have when we potentially also have to be care-givers?

What other options are there for our parents to age with dignity?,3,49,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00049
2020-02-27-T-005,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"For women, the pressures are felt even more acutely as societal norms continue to promote care-giving as women's responsibility. A 2011 national survey on care-giving for elderly individuals, those above 75 years old, requiring help with at least one activity of daily living found that 97.9% of all informal care-givers in Singapore are immediate family members, with more of them being female and between 45 and 59 years old. The female care-givers are also usually wives or adult daughters of the care recipient.",4,50,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00050
2020-02-27-T-005,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"The pressure on women to be care-givers has a great impact on their ability to engage in paid work. In 2018, over 280,000 women were outside the labour force primarily because of care-giving to relatives or family members apart from children. In comparison, just over 15,000 men cited the same reason for being outside the labour force. The compromises that women make to their work lives negatively impacts their financial security. According to CPF statistics, about four in 10 active CPF members who turned 55 in 2017 did not meet the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) of $83,000 in their Retirement Accounts.",5,51,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00051
2020-02-27-T-005,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"Among them, women have more difficulty meeting the BRS. Similarly, a recent study shows that female family care-givers to older persons experienced a change in work situation because of care-giving, suffering a 63% loss in income on average which translated into an average annual loss of more than $50,000.",6,52,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00052

You could find yourself waking up several times throughout the night to attend to your loved ones' needs, or having to spend hours persuading them to take their medication, or even straining your back trying to physically move them. For the hundreds of thousands of care-givers out there, stress, burnout and feelings of resentment may not be uncommon. Not only do they have to contend with the physical stress of care-giving, they are also struggling to balance the demands of paid work and dealing with care-related expenses which they are also now responsible for.",7,53,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00053

Can we consider legislating the right for employees to request for Flexible Work Arrangements (FWA)? Such legislation has already been successfully introduced in the UK, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.",13,59,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00059
2020-02-27-T-005,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"Research shows that current utilisation of flexible work arrangements is low due to bias by middle management and requirements for ""facetime"" at the office for performance appraisal, bias against part-timers and reluctance to change the status quo. Without equal mandated access, those most in need, like care-givers, are likely to be denied access to FWA and will have no choice but to exit the workforce.",14,60,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00060
2020-02-27-T-005,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"Second, childcare leave should be converted to family care leave so that all workers have the option to utilise it for their dependents. Those with children and other older dependents should be given a longer quantum of leave. Unpaid care-giving leave is not sufficient for care-givers as they must use up their own personal and medical leave, leading to care-giver burnout and health problems. Currently, family leave that allows for care-giving of relatives is voluntary, unlike childcare leave that is mandated at six days paid per parent for Singapore Citizens.",15,61,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00061
2020-02-27-T-005,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"In 2018, only 20% of companies offered some type of paid family care leave. Finally, we need to continue expanding care options. Whether it is through hiring a professional homecare nurse, going to a daycare centre or living in a retirement home. We need to make these options affordable for families. According to a local study, they found that lower, middle-income households would spend between 23% and 59% of their household income on long-term care services after subsidies. The figures are 24% to 63% for upper middle income households. I hope the Government can review the subsidies system to ensure that the cost of these services are not prohibitively high to families, including middle income ones.",16,62,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00062

However, there is a crucial need to address social norms and attitudes which enable sexual violence. The prevalence of sexual violence, committed overwhelmingly by men against women, reveals an ugly truth about the way society views women  that women are not human. Sexual violence is fundamentally rooted in the idea that women are objects, devoid of agency, rights and feelings, that women exist for men's pleasure, that women are not equal to men.",18,64,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00064

News headlines have recently been dominated by sexual offences committed within education institutions. From the Academic Year 2015/2016 to 2017/2018, 56 cases of sexual misconduct were reported to Autonomous Universities in Singapore and 37 of these cases were reported to the Police. Given the stigma around sexual violence, it is reasonable to assume that many more of such cases go unreported.",22,68,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00068

There is an uneven level of protection across institutions, with differing definitions of what constitutes harassment, and varying complaint, investigation and disciplinary processes. This means that whether students get their case investigated, how it will be investigated and what the outcome may be, and what support they receive as victims would differ, depending on where they go to school. This should not be the case. Violence is violence, and should be dealt with in the same way, regardless of institution setting.",24,70,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00070

This code should set out the duties of the schools to ensure zero tolerance of sexual harassment, provide adequate victim-care support and set out standards and principles for investigating and managing complaints.",25,71,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00071
2020-02-27-T-005,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"Another worrying trend is the rise of sexual violence involving the use of technology, such as social media, spy-cameras and mobile recording devices. According to AWARE, the number of technology-facilitated sexual violence cases they have seen had increased threefold in the last three years. In 2018, they saw 124 cases, more than half of which involved sexual images of the survivors that were non-consensually shared, obtained or created.",26,72,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00072

Having one’s privacy being invaded and intimate images of themselves shared publicly without consent renders a distressing sense of helplessness. Even with the successful conviction of the perpetrator, the traumatic effects of having one’s intimate images and recordings still circulating in the public domain will still be felt by survivors. I hope that survivors of such offences can be better protected.",27,73,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00073
2020-02-27-T-005,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"Perhaps mechanisms could be set up for the swift removal of non-consensually shared intimate materials, even before conviction. In Australia, complaints about one’s intimate recording being shared non-consensually can be made to the eSafety Commissioner online.

2020-02-27-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"But it has been more than a decade since childcare leave provisions were increased and it is time to review this again. Are the current six days sufficient? We already know that the vast majority of childcare centres have six days of annual closure. This means that, for most parents, the entire six days of childcare leave could be used just for these annual closures. Let us not forget about the additional three half-day closures on the eve of any of the five stipulated public holidays.

2020-02-27-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, my first suggestion is that we have specific childcare sick leave. Applications for such leave must be supported by a medical certificate. This is much needed as parents should be there to look after their children when they are sick. Out of all the illnesses, including chicken pox, influenza, stomach flu and the list goes on, let me focus on the Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) as an example of why we need more childcare leave.",7,82,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00082

This is something almost all parents face and we should help them. We must help. It is extremely difficult for parents to find help to look after their children as the infection can last for up to two weeks. It is also hard to find someone to look after your child as the care-giver has a good chance of being infected. I was infected by my children when they had HFMD.",8,83,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00083
2020-02-27-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"From the employers' standpoint, do they really want their employee who may also be infected to come to the office and possibly spread the disease or any other illness to other employees, resulting in everyone going on medical leave? Also, do we honestly think that the employee can concentrate at work and be productive? Would they not be worrying about their child who is sick? How is this beneficial to the company? Having childcare sick leave will help the children, the parents and, ultimately, the employers.",9,84,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00084
2020-02-27-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, my second suggestion is that we provide this childcare sick leave on a per-child basis. Our current childcare leave does not make sense. Surely, we can all agree here that if you need six days of childcare leave for one child, you cannot also only need six days of childcare leave for two, three or four children. It may make sense if you can make sure all your children fall sick at the same time, which is not quite possible.",10,85,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00085
2020-02-27-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, having childcare sick leave and having it on a per-child basis is not something foreign to this Government. The Public Service, one of the largest employers in Singapore, already gives some officers childcare sick leave and it is on a per-child basis. For example, officers with two children, one of whom is below age seven is eligible for four days of childcare leave per year with MC. An officer with three or more children, has nine days of childcare leave per year with MC. This is on top of the six days of childcare leave per year.",11,86,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00086

Will the money be invested in the best science so that better projections of sea level rise can be made for Singapore? Will investments be made in the best social science, so that the prioritisation of coastal land uses can be better assessed? Will soft-engineering, nature-based approaches such as the restoration of intertidal eco-systems, which have the potential to protect our coastlines be considered for use under this fund, or will only hard-engineering approaches such as polders and land reclamation be chosen?

Should we even be contented with this ratio? Besides intelligent charging solutions, should the Government also consider the alternative of battery swap stations which have the advantage of speed, ensuring load on our power grid can be managed well, as well as providing a ready infrastructure for battery recycling?

2020-02-27-T-005,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"The first is fiscal prudence. Achieving fiscal prudence starts with having a balanced budget during every term of Government. Unlike in many other countries, Singapore has been building up its reserves, instead of running deficits. How we achieve this is to ensure that recurrent revenue – those that are built into our system and are not one-off in nature – equals to or exceeds recurrent expenditures – those that we expect to incur year after year after year and not one-off in nature.

In fact, NIRC is expected to be S$17 billion in our 2020 Budget, but lower than the S$19 billion in FY2019. Going forward, it will be increasingly challenging to achieve similarly high NIRC due to the very low interest rate environment all around the world.

And I applaud the Deputy Prime Minister and the Finance Minister for looking into this.",28,169,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00169
2020-02-27-T-005,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Although we do expect an overall Budget deficit of $10.9 billion for 2020, there is still a S$7.7 billion surplus for this term of Government commencing from 2015. Therefore, all the capital and operating expenditures as well as the government transfers including transfers into the Merdeka Generation (MG) package are all earned by the respective terms of government. And this is no mean feat. In fact, the total recurring cost of the Merdeka Generation package as well as the Pioneer Generation package are all paid for upfront and all earned by the respective terms of government.",29,170,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00170

2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not an exaggeration to say that we are living in somewhat unstable, uncertain times. The magnitude of global events have increased and the impact of these events are far-reaching. For example, just as the world saw a potential improvement in the global economic landscape last year with the inking of Phase 1 trade agreement between the United States and China, along came the COVID-19 virus to make an unforgettable impact on the international stage.",1,173,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00173
2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The true impact of COVID-19 on countries and economies is hard to estimate, and it is likely that the long-tail impact of the outbreak could be significant. I am thus heartened to know that the Singapore Government has put forth an expansionary Budget to cushion the impact of COVID-19 and help Singapore-based companies and our citizens emerge stronger from this episode.",2,174,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00174
2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The Government has come up with the Stability and Support Package to help key sectors of the economy – Tourism, Aviation, Retail, Food and Beverage, and Point-to-Point transport services – that are hit hardest by COVID-19. I am encouraged that the Budget will cater for tax and rental rebates to defray the cost of businesses, as well as wage-support schemes and training incentives to up-skill Singaporeans and keep Singaporeans employed during these difficult times.",3,175,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00175
2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Based on current medical knowledge, COVID-19 is more infectious than SARS and current epidemiology models seem to predict that the outbreak is likely to last longer than SARS. But even when the worst is over, it will take many more months before it is ""business as usual"". Would the Government cater more funds to support businesses and Singaporeans if the downturn period turns out to last longer than expected? Also, will the Government consider extending help to other industries besides the five already mentioned in the Budget, if the economic fallout spreads to other industries?",4,176,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00176
2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Moving on to the topic of supporting families, Mr Speaker, Sir, building on the momentum of the past few Budgets, the current Budget continues the trend of investing in our children and youth by enhancing the level of support for the pre-school and early childhood sector. In 2018, the Government committed $1 billion to the early childhood sector and I understand that it will invest almost twice this amount per year for the next few years to further support this sector.",5,177,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00177
2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),Part of this investment will be used to enhance grants to ensure that quality pre-school remains accessible and affordable for young parents and that every young Singaporean child will be able to have a good head start in education to maximise their potential and human capital gains regardless of their family's socio-economic situation.,6,178,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00178
2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"While we have raised the income eligibility for additional subsidiaries for the Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) to $12,000 a month to benefit a larger number of families, would the Government consider putting in place more support and subsidy for after-school student care once the child graduates from pre-school and enters Primary school? I believe this will help support families especially by providing working parents alternative care arrangements for children while they are at work",7,179,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00179
2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"It was announced in the Budget that over the next 10 years, the Government will also set up a Community Capability Trust of up to $350 million to support our Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to strengthen their organisational capabilities and enhance their levels of service provision. This is part of the overall effort to transform the social services sector so that the SSAs can better meet the complex needs of our evolving society, especially when Singapore is experiencing a rapidly ageing population. I believe that this is a step in the right direction towards building a more caring society.",8,180,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00180
2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),We also need to constantly encourage and incentivise our companies to employ people who are differently-abled. An example of one such company is Foreword Coffee that employs people with special needs as their baristas and cashiers or fast food restaurants that hire differently-abled individuals as wait staff and service staff.,9,181,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00181
2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"As announced in the Budget, the Enabling Employment Credit (EEC) will replace existing schemes to support the employment of differently-abled individuals by providing wage offsets for employers. Can we further incentivise companies to employ differently-abled individuals by providing more direct incentives to these companies, perhaps in the form of tax rebates? I believe these direct incentives will provide a strong impetus for companies to offer fair and equal employment opportunities to everyone.",10,182,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00182
2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the theme of a caring society is a significant and powerful one.

2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Some have left masks and sanitisers at lift landings for their fellow residents. Others have come forward to organise food delivery and even social programmes for those who are under quarantine or those who have to stay at home. Many Singaporeans have also extended similar courtesies not only to their fellow countrymen, but also to the foreigners in our midst. NGOs have come forward to distribute masks and sanitisers to migrant workers, to educate them on proper hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the migrant communities and some have even raised funds for those who need it.",12,184,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00184

2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, in many ways, this is a Budget for everyone and every segment of the society.

2020-02-27-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),The current Budget demonstrates the decisiveness of the Government and its commitment to Singapore and Singaporeans as it has acted quickly and decisively to come up with a budget to deal with the many challenges that have arisen due to COVID-19.

2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Budget reflects the Government's priorities and directions for the country. It has to be visionary to prepare our economy and our people for the future, but yet also address immediate needs. To me, the Budget is also an opportunity to nudge behaviours and shape norms. The Government's schemes and policies send an important signal on key issues and should encourage efforts that make Singapore better as a nation.",1,189,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00189
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"For example, the support given to firms to train and redesign jobs for workers would hopefully translate to businesses and a workforce that is more productive and future-ready. Incentives for energy-efficient appliances or cleaner energy products should encourage better adoption of such products and in the long run create a greener Singapore. Support for employers to hire Singaporean persons with disabilities (PwDs) should encourage more to be inclusive and allow more space for PwDs to participate and contribute to the economy.",2,190,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00190
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I am always keen to see the initiatives in the Budget that will help shape our values as a people. I am happy to note that the Government is building on the efforts from previous years to build a caring and inclusive society. This year, the Government introduced the Enabling Employment Credit (EEC) to provide stronger support for employers of PwDs. The intent is to provide help for PwDs to find employment and remain in the workforce. To me, this is important as it is a signal to be inclusive and normalise PwDs' participation in our society.",3,191,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00191
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In recent years, I have had the great privilege of engaging with family members and care-givers of people with different abilities. There is a whole range of disabilities, including intellectual and physical disabilities, and PwDs come from a broad spectrum of age groups, from infants to the elderly. In my speech in 2018 on the Motion in support of inclusive education, I shared some of the challenges faced by parents of children with disabilities and called for more support for these families. Last year, as part of the PAP Women's Wing paper on supporting parenthood and families, my colleagues and I engaged many parents to hear their views on the support needed. Dr Intan Azura, Miss Cheryl Chan and I had carried out an online survey to get a sensing of the needs of these families and we also held a dialogue to hear their stories. We had to summarise much of the information we received to fit the paper, but we shared our insights with the relevant Ministries after the paper was finalised.",4,192,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00192
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Through this experience, we have found that  firstly, there is still a lack of awareness of the different types of support available for families with children with different needs. Secondly, there are specific circumstances in each family and thus the support extended needs to be more customised to be more meaningful. Some families, for example, may have more than one child with special needs and may need more support. Thirdly, the infrastructure and services available need to be more pervasive and accessible to families. Facilities, like playgrounds, should ideally be equipped for children with different abilities. We may have a few of such inclusive playgrounds but only in certain parts of Singapore. We also have a hub at Enabling Village in Bukit Merah where parents and care-givers could get assistance with some services. There is also a Care-givers' Pod in the village meant for the care-givers' use. However, those living in the east or north of Singapore may find it to be too far from them and are not able to benefit from the support and facilities available.",5,193,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00193
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Much have been done in the sector, through the Enabling Masterplans, various policies and schemes as well as through the formation of workgroups to review the support to address different aspects of disabilities. However, there is still some way to go in closing the gaps to better support PwDs and their families. More significantly, one theme that repeatedly comes up from the feedback from parents and family members is the need to build a culture of care and compassion towards PwDs. Parents especially, worry about the world they would be leaving their differently-abled children in when they pass away. Could their children be meaningfully integrated within the community and be given opportunities like others? Will the society be kind, patient and understanding of their child's needs? Will they be taken advantage of? Will someone stand up for their rights?",6,194,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00194
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"There is, therefore, a fervent hope that the Government continues to make effort to create awareness, build infrastructure and implement policies that would normalise inclusiveness and allow for people with different needs and abilities to be truly embraced as part of the community. This may sound like a lofty ideal to some, but not one which we should shy away from. We need to constantly and relentlessly participate in such efforts and seek partners from amongst the community.",7,195,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00195
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In seeking for partners for causes that matter to humanity, I have found hope in the youths. I feel that the youth of today are very accepting of differences and have a strong sense of social fairness. Over the years, I have continued to be involved in the youth sector efforts especially through my engagements under M3, the collaboration between MESRA, MENDAKI and MUIS, and as a council member of National Youth Council. In my dialogues and discussions with young people, many of them have shown much desire for a more inclusive, more compassionate society. I am very heartened by their passion and I feel that it is so important to continue to engage them and seek their views as we build this nation.",8,196,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00196
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In this regard, I laud the Government's efforts through MCCY and the National Youth Council, to meaningfully engage our young people. Now more than ever, young people are given opportunities and are empowered to make the change they want to see. There are many support mechanisms, for example, through, the National Youth Fund, the SG Youth Action Plan and NYC's Young Changemakers Programme, which not only provide monetary grants but connect youths with mentors and like-minded peers to help implement ground-up projects.",9,197,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00197
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Aside from providing support to youths for their causes and to carry out their projects, it is also important to support them to achieve their aspirations. I note the provision in the Budget to ready our youths for various opportunities by providing more overseas exposure. This is very welcomed. I am hoping that many youths from different backgrounds can take up this opportunity. We should also continue to build on the efforts to support youth through empowerment and mentoring programmes.",10,198,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00198
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I oversee the youth engagement efforts under M3 and one of the key initiatives is to create a culture of mentoring within the community so that the Malay/Muslim youths have somewhere to turn to for guidance as they navigate through challenges and choices in life. There are also resources like the MENDAKI Future-Ready Toolkit and the M3 Resource Directory which are available online for youths to refer to for information on various matters. Mr Speaker, at this juncture, allow me to continue my speech in Malay.",11,199,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00199

We must empower them and help them achieve their aspirations. I oversee the third workgroup under M3 related to youth matters, and one of the focus areas in our current projects is the development of a culture of mentoring within our community, so that our young can receive guidance and knowledge from those who are more experienced.",12,200,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00200
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"This will hopefully help our youths grow their confidence and seize any available opportunity so that they can continue to progress. At the same time, we also encourage our youths to get involved and give back to society, regardless of race, religion or background. I hope that our community will continue supporting this effort and we can achieve our objective to develop youths who are highly competent, competitive, confident and show concern towards the people around them.",13,201,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00201
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"(In English)  Indeed, the efforts to empower, mentor and engage youths should continue. We should involve young people in discussion of key issues and policies and find opportunities to work with them to create positive social norms within the community. There should, therefore, be an appropriate budget allocated for these efforts as well as provision of the necessary platforms for them to implement their ideas and work with people from different ages and backgrounds. I believe that if we work together, we can harness our diverse strengths and bring Singapore to greater heights.",14,202,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00202
2020-02-27-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"It is akin to what we see here in Parliament. The Budget season is one of the more exciting periods for the House. The House is abuzz with anecdotes, findings and information about a myriad of issues. Members of this House pour our hearts and souls to the issues we champion because they matter to us, to the people we represent. I have seen the views that we raise in Parliament make their way to the formation of policies and I trust this will continue to be how the Singapore Government improves and builds on its framework for the future.",15,203,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00203

2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mr Speaker, I support the Budget statement by Finance Minister. The past year has been a challenging year for many Singaporeans.

They worry whether their business will be able to sustain in the long term.",1,205,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00205

2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"As stated by many in the media, the Budget was generous and provided for several measures to help affected Singaporeans and businesses cope with the economic slowdown.

2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Individually, many Singaporeans are happy with the Care and Support Package of $1.6 billion because it puts money directly into their pockets.

2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I am also glad that the cash component of the Care and Support scheme is pegged to their income and not tied to the property type of the Singaporean. Last year, I had called on the Government to do away with distribution of Budget benefits based on home type alone. I believe this will benefit many retirees or seniors who are living in private properties but without any income. So, my appeal to the Government is to consider extending other benefits like the U-save vouchers and GST vouchers to retirees or seniors without income but staying in private properties. Again here I wish to stress to Minister – these retirees would not have income. The fact that they stay in private property does not in any way mean that they are rich or are able to sustain themselves. What they are looking for is also whether the Government can do more to recognise them for their contribution to nation building when they were younger.",6,210,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00210
2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, I also support the measures to help keep our workers employed. For many Singaporeans whom I meet, their main concern is whether they can get a good job which pays them commensurate with their skills and experience. Most workers prefer not to be on any form of welfare. Hence, the Jobs Support Scheme, the Wage Credit Scheme, the corporate tax rebate and the rental waivers for some of the tenants would help businesses to survive the economic slowdown and allow them to retain their staff.",7,211,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00211
2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),I am also pleased that the Finance Minister had remembered the hawkers in the food centres and markets. The majority of such stall licensees are small businesses and the rental waiver for them would go a long way to helping them sustain their small businesses during such trying times when the food centres are quieter and business has dropped drastically for them,8,212,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00212
2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"However, in the long term, what is important is not just cash handouts to affected Singaporeans or tax rebates to help businesses tide over difficult times. These payments cannot be permanent and moneys will eventually run out some day.

2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I support the provision of Enhanced Housing Grant (EHG) to first-time flat buyers. The purpose of the Enhanced Housing Grant is to allow Singaporeans to own their own home and this is important for nation building. However, the quantum of EHG given is currently based on the monthly income of the flat buyer. If the applicant’s income is higher, the EHG will be lower. This means there is less incentive to buy a resale flat because you will get a lower EHG if your income is higher. This may result in Singaporeans with higher income always applying for a BTO flat where the subsidy will not change based on their income level.",12,216,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00216
2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I urge the Government to review the tagging of the amount of EHG based on the income of the applicant.

2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Nobody likes a tax hike, but Singaporeans must understand that increased spending on healthcare must come from somewhere.

2020-02-27-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Overall, I am of the view that this is a good Budget to take care of affected Singaporeans and to prepare the country for the future. It shows that the Government deeply cares for its citizens and the deferment of the GST increase is a clear signal that the Government is responsive to feedback from the citizens. Mr Speaker, I affirm my support for the Budget and wish to thank the Finance Minister for an excellent Budget that seeks to bring Singaporeans together.",19,223,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00223

This is a big, bold Budget which comes at the price of a $10.9 billion deficit, responding to the need for help by Singaporean households and businesses. This crisis has shown the importance and relevance of our Government's tradition of prudence. With an accumulated surplus of $18.7 billion over this current term of office, there remains a war chest of $7.8 billion, which is very reassuring.",1,224,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00224

2020-02-27-T-005,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I would first like to touch on support measures. The Government's Care and Support Package will go some way to provide relief to individuals who have experienced income disruptions due to the impact of COVID-19 on businesses.

Has the Ministry also set for itself some indicators internally to decide on when further assistance be rendered should the outbreak crisis deepen? In such a scenario, the cost of certain essential goods may increase as disruptions in supply chains may create shortages in supply. Singaporeans may then suffer the double whammy of lower or even loss of income, and a higher cost of living.",8,231,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00231

What about businesses that started operating this year which are also affected by COVID-19? Would the Government consider helping them as well? In addition, may I request for the grants to be given out earlier, especially for smaller businesses which operate on tight cashflows and are already severely impacted?",9,232,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00232

With the decline in sales, operators will immediately look at cost cutting. Operating hours will be shortened, the number of part-timers hired will be reduced, full-time staff will be placed on part-time shifts and asked to clear their leave or take no-pay leave. In the event of a prolonged crisis, what can be done to support businesses so that job losses are kept to a minimum?",10,233,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00233

It is good for the Government to elaborate on the working assumption of the time frame for these rebates. If the rebates are meant to cover serious business earnings loss for February to April, one or half month rental rebates put in this context does seem reasonable. However, businesses seek the assurance that more help would be available if the situation prolongs or deteriorates further.",11,234,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00234

With the current cost structure and labour situation, it is inevitable that e-commerce would become the norm and form an essential part of any business.",12,235,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00235
2020-02-27-T-005,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next, I would like to touch on positioning for the longer term. This Budget, like previous Budgets, have schemes to support the transformation of our local enterprises. Many of these incentives have a pre-set time period, for example, three years, or are subject to renewals or extensions. Companies change and transform at different paces, depending on the maturity of the industry and support available, especially for smaller ones. To encourage companies to plan ahead and remain continuously invested in the future, would the Government consider setting longer term horizons for selected incentives? For example, when Pioneer Tax Incentives were first introduced, longer durations, up to 15 years, were given.",13,236,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00236
2020-02-27-T-005,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"As we continue on the digital transformation of our economy, more support would be needed to help smaller companies adopt new technology, not only with respect to the technical aspects but also with the costs. Perhaps tax incentives for the telecommunications or selected sectors can be provided so that they can lower the fees for the eco-system to promote adoption and switch-overs.",14,237,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00237

The course materials, modes of instruction, quality of instructors, just to name a few, should be constantly reviewed and audited to ensure that they are up to par.

2020-02-27-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mr Speaker, this is is a responsive, responsible and remarkable Budget. Responsive because it addresses an immediate crisis. Responsible because it remains fiscally sound. Remarkable because it took all of a few weeks to prepare. This is a Budget for extraordinary times. That we are facing potential global financial instability is moot.

I was somewhat apprehensive because I knew how crowded Marina Square can be at the weekends. Yet, I entered a carpark that was sparse. From the carpark to the shop, I consciously counted a total of only 38 shoppers. At one of the empty children's playgrounds in the shopping centre, I saw the counter staff staring blankly into space because there was never one shadow of a child within the space. At Jewel, outlets famous for their long queues were momentarily famous for non-existent queues. Although the crowds and confidence has returned in the last week, the damage has been done. Heartland malls have fared better a little bit better but still report lower numbers than usual. People are taking precautions. Food and grocery delivery services perhaps have benefited most from this crisis, But tourism and service sectors hit directly will take time to recover. This is also no longer a regional problem. It is not a regional illness anymore. It has global reach.",2,241,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00241

There are not many governments that can do this. We only need to look around us and observe how things can go wrong. Getting our politics right is key. Looking north in the last few days, we are lucky to be spared the intrigue and drama in our system. Perhaps we should be thankful to the late Tengku Abdul Rahman that we are no longer party to this.

I heard feedback from SkillsFuture WSQ course providers of the challenges they face in claims, especially when participants do not complete or fail their course. Many end up not being able to pay and providers cannot claim. Some providers have also been told that if a trainee does not complete, they should factor the trainees as part of attrition or bad debts to be written off. We are all in this together. Honest course providers commit resources to develop and maintain these courses, and hope to be reimbursed in a timely manner.

We started off wanting to bake cookies and progressed to preparing care packs for the staff of Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. Within hours of putting the word out, the Girl Guides responded donating their famous biscuit tins, Hock Hua Tonic responded offering their herbal tea at cost, the Singapore Kindness Movement responded providing encouragement decals, Gain City came on board offering the use of their show kitchens, residents, Singaporeans responded. By the morning we had so much that we needed bigger bags to pack the care bags. A total of 136 residents came together and we baked close to 11,000 cookies that day. The feeling was moving. One of our baking coordinators Pey Yng was interviewed for a video. She had moved out of our constituency a few years earlier but responded immediately when we asked for help.

Another example, LTA awarded contract N112 tender to a foreign contractor though our local contractor submitted the lowest tender. The lowest tenderer is an established home-grown contractor. Why pay $6 million more to a foreign contractor? I know there is such thing as PQM (Price Quality Method) scoring. But if there is a gap in the capabilities of our local contractors, then we should handhold them and nurture them.

So, the implication is besides the noise nuisance, they also create health issues and a cost to society. There are technologies used in other countries. The UK use Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) tech to dish out fines to drivers over excessive noise. Calgary, a city in Canada, is using Sound Camera and fine motorists with excessively loud vehicles. Similarly, Abu Dhabi Police have invented a noise-measuring camera, which will help officers take action against abnormally loud cars.

I am also heartened that many of the bigger landlords have also taken the cue and have confirmed they will be passing on these rebates on to their tenants. The Wage Support Scheme helps to cushion employers from wage costs, and I hope they take the message to try and keep their employees as long as possible.

While in the early days, we were getting more and more news of people infected and some in critical condition, now we get more news of people being discharged.

Of the 33 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving although seven remain in critical condition and in intensive care.",14,333,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00333

As it is, the drop in business from China has hurt our economy and many others in the world as China is the world’s second largest economy. If other countries start closing borders or restricting business activities in response, there could be serious economic repercussions. If large numbers of businesses fail or close during this period, the implications on growth could be significant and Singapore will not be cushioned.",16,335,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00335

For workers who may lose their job during this period, please understand it is a difficult economy, but please make use of the wide range of measures available, including the SkillsFuture top-ups to retrain and try and pick up new skills.

Over the current term of Government, this House has accumulated a Budget surplus of over $17.4 billion. In the preceding years, many Singaporeans have expressed concerns over the size of this surplus. They have always wondered whether we could invest more in our people. Sir, Budget 2020, partly influenced by COVID-19, provides a timely answer to this perennial question.",1,338,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00338

2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"Sir, I begin by speaking about our nation's ability to quickly respond to crisis. As Members are aware, COVID-19 spread like a wildfire. Without doubt, COVID-19 is one of the biggest crises Singapore has faced in over a decade. As the impact of COVID-19 continues to unfold, Budget 2020 addresses several of our immediate macro-economic concerns and with such a forward-looking budget, I am confident that together we will overcome this crisis and emerge stronger.",3,340,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00340

2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"While I understand that we cannot put off the increase indefinitely, can the Minister give an indication of when the eventual hike will be implemented?

As the COVID-19 crisis shows us, Mr Speaker, our nation's success is not something which occurred in a vacuum. We are successful because we have continually planned ahead.

2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"First, what success did previous programmes aiming to encourage the production of local produce have?

2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"And third, does the Government intend to support and encourage deeper integration of research and development processes between business and our tertiary education institutions in this regard? If so, what funds are being allocated to this in order to catalyse the process?",21,358,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00358
2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"Sir, the point of these questions is simple. As we continue to invest in creating a food resilient Singapore, simply setting money aside is insufficient. We must create an innovative eco-system with positive feedback loops. It is my vision for future generations of Singaporeans to be able to consume local produce daily.",22,359,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00359
2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"Looking closer to our immediate future, Sir, I speak about our transition to electric vehicles.

Are there any proportionate investments being made in transforming our energy mix?",25,362,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00362
2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"Second, it is not disputed that public transport is more efficient and less polluting as compared to personal vehicles. A perennial problem preventing greater utilisation of public transport is ""first mile and last mile"" connectivity issues. In this regard, does the Government intend to accelerate our investment in our park connector networks to ensure greater access to public transport hubs and to encourage alternative modes of transport via cycling?",26,363,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00363
2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"Lastly, as we even transition toward electric vehicles, how can we ensure that even less pollutive technology such as hydrogen fuel cells, are not locked out of the market?",27,364,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00364
2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"Ultimately, I submit that simply transitioning to electric vehicles is not enough.

2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"Firstly, I propose creating a framework for a Structured Apprenticeship Programme as implemented in the UK and Germany.

2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"Sir, I wonder if the adoption of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), or similar e-learning technologies, may be a potential solution to this issue. Over the last two years, our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have seamlessly transitioned to e-learning following the COVID-19 situation.",41,378,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00378
2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"Thus far, many lessons and tutorials have gone online.

2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"At the end of the day, Sir, I hope that SkillsFuture will be made more accessible for our fellow Singaporeans. We should enable them to upskill, no matter the circumstance.",44,381,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00381
2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"My last point on investing in our fellow Singaporeans, Mr Speaker, can be summarised with this phrase ""Locally Trained and Globally Framed"". Since our separation from Malaysia, we have always recognised that Singapore cannot be insular in our economic approach. We have invested heavily in ensuring that we are an attractive place to do business.",45,382,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00382

2020-02-27-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"This is where the phrase ""Locally Trained and Globally Framed"" comes in. We need to ensure that our Students acquire the cross-cultural skills and deep international understanding which would enable them to compete with the best in the world. I am heartened that Budget 2020 sets a target for 70-70 exposure in our IHL students. In this regard, the New Colombo Plan initiative by the Australian Government is a model worth studying.",47,384,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00384

Decades ago, Singapore's GDP growth was consistently among the highest in the region and the world. In recent years, it has been more modest but still better than or the same as other developed countries in this region.

2020-02-27-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The next broad point I will speak on is livability. A blind chase for vibrancy of an economy is no full guarantee of the well-being of its citizens. Putting effort into livability, therefore, is one of the most crucial challenges facing Singapore.

2020-02-27-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The approach to managing the cost of living is a case in point. Why not develop an approach to policy-making that commits the state to adjust for future conditions by building the adjustment mechanism into policy design, rather than leaving it to future acts of Executive discretion, which may or may not happen? Right now, this is done in some cases like permanent GST Vouchers but not in others.",16,404,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00404

Parliament can still vote against inflation-based increases should fiscal resources be insufficient. So, the mechanism can still contain an element of evaluation. But the fact that the design of the policy has a built-in mechanism to recommend changes and adjust based on inflation at certain defined time intervals create some assurance that, yes, society will not leave me stranded in the future one day. This is not just a benefit for today leaving me uncertain about tomorrow.",17,405,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00405

And this may reduce risk adversity and the focus on short-term income rather than long-term income. This in turn may promote a culture of being more willing to take risks to re-skill, to start a business and possibly even to have children because one is more confident about the future.",18,406,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00406

Vibrancy and livability already difficult challenges in themselves but we must ensure that policies aimed to address these challenges are sustainable and are responsible. To be sure, it is a good thing that we have large reserves that yield net investment returns or NIR, the largest state revenue stream today and that can be drawn down in emergencies. Many countries do not have this and have high levels of fiscal debt relative to GDP.",21,409,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00409

2020-02-27-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I am not suggesting drawing down on the reserves at this point.

Should our reserves always go up and up at the same rate? Can we not have reasonable conversations about how to vary the slope of reserves growth while agreeing that the principal should only be drawn down in an emergency? And how, in doing that, we can invest in our people and our companies so as to help them become the most creative, the most resilient, the most innovative, and the most entrepreneurial that they can possibly be so that they can deal with any challenges the world can throw at us with confidence?",26,414,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00414

This was how the Japanese built up their world-beating giant firms – the Japanese and Koreans I should say.

I understand his counter argument that we do not want to go too far down the path of picking winners. There is a grain of truth there. But some of our existing efforts like state-backed co-investment, for example, could be seen as picking winners anyway. And why not let the winners pick themselves?",30,418,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00418

Can we not do more to tap on our fiscal resources to channel substantial R&D investment into creating IP that is then seated to local companies in a very substantial and systematic way, but with the IP owned by the state and licensed to the firm's so that the state can nudge these firms to grow in ways that benefit the domestic economy and locals?",33,421,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00421

I know that there are limits to how much we can do under WTO rules and other treaty obligations, but surely there are ways to navigate these obstacles to some degree. And, as I referred to earlier, A*STAR has licensed IP to SMES, but the question I am raising here is how to upscale this to enhance the commercial impact and provide enablers to ambitious local firms to become world-beating.",34,422,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00422

Twenty-six percent of Autonomous University graduates go into the public service as their first job, according to a Parliamentary answer given in 2018. Can we create a programme that mentors and coaches civil servants in their 30s, 40s or 50s, who wish to leave the service to become entrepreneurs? Such a programme could help them develop skill sets relating to fund-raising, employee recruitment and retention, marketing and so on. Not so much training, but coaching and pointing them in the right direction as well as connecting them with funding sources including state back ones.

Perhaps an incentive scheme could be deployed to attract local workers into Industry 4.0 sectors, like renewable energy, drones, AI and deep tech, especially those sectors where the Singaporean Core is weak. Having a pool of workers with such training could also help attract both foreign and domestic investment in these high growth sectors. Of course, any such move has to be done in tandem with the growth of investment in these sectors to ensure the jobs and career paths are available to those who join such industries.",36,424,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00424

Beyond just hard skills and cognitive intelligence, it is these capacities that we need to nurture in the long term. It is these capacities that will be our surest defence against whatever economic and technology evolutions bring; and tracking them in the SPOR report is a nod to the fact that our policies do play some role, not the main role, or the only role to be sure, but some role, in nurturing these capabilities and capacities among our people.",37,425,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00425

As a start, we must recognise the presence of people with special needs and their ability as an individual. Pre-schools and formal schools can do more to educate the children in embracing differences and welcoming them from within the school community. As individuals, all of us, too, can be more gracious, accepting and forgiving to families who have children of special needs. They deserve a place in our community, from the neighbourhood playgrounds to public transport and common dining places. There is no need for cold stares, harsh words or social media commentaries for any special needs individuals. They are individuals with their own rights and well-deserved to be treated with dignity like any other person. We should have campaigns that counter such negativity and give more room for families with special needs to be out in our community, to share our common spaces and feel at ease that they are one of us.",18,445,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00445

For special needs individuals, some may have disabilities or are cognitively challenged to handle legal matters on their own when their legal guardians are no longer around with them. Be it the Will, having an acting Attorney-in-fact or managing other legal matters that involve their daily lives, they are more likely to need better access and support at affordable cost on a regular basis.

In one Asian economy, hundreds rallied for days to protest against plans to turn some buildings into quarantine centres. In one European economy, hundreds in a town protested having their fellow countrymen who were COVID-19 evacuees from China from being quarantined in their town, despite assurances by the government that none had symptoms of infections. They put up roadblocks, burned tyres and hurled stones at buses, resulting in several injuries. Out of desperation, the health minister declared she would spend the next two weeks locked up in quarantine with the returnees. In other places, government attempts to refute false rumours, although backed by medical experts, were ignored at best and stoked fear at worst. People hoarded critical supplies and deprived them from people in high-risk environments who needed them the most. In a public health crisis, it is heartbreaking to see such anti-social behaviours.

In Singapore, we see some of the ugly behaviours, too, but there is a lot more of the good acts that we have observed. Where we saw frontline workers being discriminated or denied service by some individuals, we see an even stronger response from many Singaporeans who wrote messages and prepared gifts to express their support. We also see ground-up initiatives by groups of volunteers who engaged seniors and the more vulnerable within our communities to give out practical items, such as hand sanitisers. Of course, another example is when the silent majority seemingly came to life during the recent ""Twitter Parliament"", suggesting that hoarding and, therefore, depriving others of essentials should not be encouraged.",3,451,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00451

In the midst of our battle against the coronavirus, we have this Budget debate. I am glad that in his Budget, the Deputy Prime Minister addressed the impact of COVID-19 on our economy as well as the long-term needs of Singaporeans. Budget 2020 is a responsive Budget that prepares Singaporeans for the challenges ahead. The $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package helps companies to stay liquid, thus preserving the jobs of Singaporeans.

Jobs are important to Singaporeans' livelihood, important to keeping families financially buoyant and important to social cohesion. Various studies, including one by the World Bank in 2013, have shown that job access has a direct impact on a society's trust and civic engagement. The same 2013 World Bank report also stated that jobs and the types of jobs influence people's aspirations, social beliefs and their sense of belonging to the country.

From application to disbursement, the process is as fast as 48 hours. I was told that the responses from SMEs have been overwhelmingly positive.

In Singapore, we have made persistent efforts to boost social mobility with significant injections of social spending, especially within the past decade. Budget 2020 is no exception, especially with its Care and Nurture and Stabilise and Support Packages. I welcome the various measures including grocery and GST Vouchers, kindergarten, transport and school meal subsidies that will certainly help lower income families ease their financial burdens. We cannot underestimate the impact of such subsidies. I recall that when I volunteered at the charity Food from the Heart, children from poor families who received monthly food goodie bags saw improved grades. Why so? Once their parents stopped bickering over where the next meal would come from, and there was money left over for transport, the children started to attend school more regularly and this translated tangibly into improved academic performance.",2,489,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00489

Clearly, in our well-connected society where we are bound together by the internet of people and also the internet of things, a promising path for us to explore is the one illuminated by big data. The application of data analytics in virtually all aspects of life, including finance, business, urban planning, healthcare and education, can generate powerful insights for enhancing resource optimisation, service delivery and efficiency gains.

The social compact between people and corporations which are collecting data about us is riddled with inequity. Indeed, the ‘compact’ is one of distinct asymmetry between the big technology companies and consumers. Hitherto, technology companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba have selfishly hoarded their data, from which they distill critical insights to create market dominating products and services. If we continue to let these Goliaths have exclusive rights to exploit the data that they harvest essentially for free from all their users, what chance is there for the scrappy start-ups of the world to innovate for the greater good? We must leave the door wide open for start-ups to compete against the incumbents. Oxford University professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, coauthor of Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data, suggests adopting a “progressive data-sharing mandate” that forces companies above a certain size to share some of their data with smaller competitors.

We all converged around several sobering points. That while our workers need to constantly upskill, they do not find the necessary motivation to do so. This arises from a combination of work-life pressures, inertia and resistance to change, and a sense of defeatism that the new skills they acquire will not translate into concrete improvements in their salaries or job prospects. Separately, when employers are dismissive of their employees’ needs or interest to upskill, their motivation is further undermined.

Instead, students become Machiavellian and grade-oriented, while instructors then teach to the test to meet KPIs.

In other words, taxi drivers will enjoy up to $36.50 in rental rebates per day. Even though taxi companies will be running at a loss by doing so, for the sake of taxi drivers and the taxi industry, taxi companies still decided to go ahead with the rental rebates.

Some taxi companies, including ComfortDelGro Taxi, is providing additional rental rebate of up to $26.50 over and above the SRF. That is, cabbies are getting a total rental rebate of up to $36.50 per day until the end of March 2020. With these additional rebates, the taxi companies will go into red over the next few months. Even then, the cabbies are still suffering a significant drop in their net income. Thus, I call on Government to do more for cabbies.

Inequality would not rise to the same level until the 1700s. The cause was not productivity improvements or up-skilling. Unfortunately, the cause was the Black Death, also called the plague, which killed by some estimates more than one-third of the population in Europe. The demand for labour went up and land was redistributed amongst the survivors. The plague is a zoonotic disease. The bacterium is endemic to rodents and carried by the fleas that infest rats. The plague originated in China, was carried west along the Silk Road by traders and spread thence to Europe, most famously, by Italian traders fleeing the Mongol siege of Caffa by ship.",1,542,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00542
2020-02-27-T-005,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The Plague destroyed not only populations, but also the existing social and economic order throughout Europe. Governments of the day responded with novel and extreme measures. In England, the Statute of Labourers 1351 made it illegal for workers to demand pay greater than those wages prevailing before the Plague. While there is little evidence it was effective, it appears to have contributed to a major English peasant revolt in 1381. Governments also realised, perhaps belatedly, that inequality itself weakened society's ability to resist the plague. The poor could not afford treatment, but they could pose a risk to all if they contracted it. As a result, towns hired plague doctors to treat rich and poor alike without payment. Necessity is the mother of public health.",2,543,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00543

To understand this, we need to deconstruct the ideology or the myth of market forces. In crude terms, the myth is the idea that the price and distribution of goods and services, determined by competitive market processes, must be efficient and socially appropriate. This model of market forces underlies our policy thinking about economic restructuring because for the most part it works well. It is impossible to protect all jobs or industries in economic restructuring, because doing so would cripple the efficiency of the economy and harm ourselves in the long run.

Security officers put themselves at risk serving quarantine notices and screening for sick persons at our institutions. One such officer did, in fact, contract COVID-19. Our emergency medical responders and nurses put themselves at risk every day as their work puts them in direct physical contact with the sick. And our general practitioners (GPs) are working under very difficult circumstances to screen and treat the sick, to make the judgement call if a patient is a suspect COVID-19 case. Yet, the rewards for GPs have never been very high compared to that for specialists and surgeons, to say nothing of the pay for nurses and first responders.

Medical institutions worldwide do not keep significant reserve stocks because the supply chain is usually swift and reliable. In normal times, yes, the globalised system of production is superbly efficient. We would, in fact, question normally whether it is good value for money if MOH were to start subsidising the costly production of surgical masks in Singapore, or the creation of a stockpile that far exceeds that of projected clinical use. The COVID-19 outbreak, however, demonstrates the limitations of efficiency as the sole judgement criterion.",13,554,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00554

Usually, they get about 40,000 medical tourists a month. But now, many have cancelled their appointments. Now, normally, it is a good thing to have a thriving private medical sector in Singapore. It gives patients choice; it makes Singapore a medical hub. But it is likely if the COVID-19 outbreak worsens, that our GPs and public hospitals will continue to be severely stretched with a high caseload while the private specialist sector may well be short of work. This is neither resilient nor efficient. And yet, it is the market outcome, because there is market demand to pay for excess capacity in the private sector.

To keep public healthcare prices low, we schedule appointments for subsidised healthcare as tightly as possible, to extract the most out of our manpower and equipment. This comes at a hidden cost to the resilience and morale of our healthcare workers. In a crisis, these effects become more salient. Any lack of slack means that in a crisis, we risk having insufficient spare capacity to deal with unexpected surges in demand.

The occasional paper on ""Income Growth, Inequality and Mobility Trends in Singapore"" published by MOF in 2015, documents that from 2004 to 2009, cumulative, per-member household income growth was only 4% for the the lowest quintile as opposed to 19.5% for the top quintile.",18,559,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00559

We have seen a strong reversal of formerly stagnant wage growth for low-income Singaporeans. As reported in the latest Key Household Income Trends 2019, cumulative real growth in per-household member income was 29.5% and 31.8%, for the first and second deciles, from 2009 to 2019.

We cannot depend just on charity for filling in the gaps, especially since charitable activity may also be hurt by an economic or social crisis. In particular, our resilience today to major shocks such as COVID-19 depends very much on the government of the day enacting strong and tailored measures, because we do not have many automatic risk sharing measures in place.

The Stabilisation and Support Package will help small enterprises but it is really too small for medium enterprises. There is a ""sandwich"" class of companies where it is too big for such small help to matter but too small to survive for long periods of negative cash flows. The Corporate Income Tax rebate of 25% of tax payable is a welcome measure, but it is capped at $15,000. This is a small drop in the ocean for such companies. Even a $600,000 loan guarantee by the Government may not be enough for a medium enterprise whose revenue may be up to in the region of $50 million to $100 million a year.

Many businesses are already running down on their reserves and they cannot depend on their suppliers to extend credit because their supplies are similarly impacted. Cash flow is the lifeline of every business. From what I heard from the banks, it will take until mid-March to approve new loans and these loans will not be disbursed until mid-April. For some, this will be too late. So, I would like to ask the Government what more can we do to open the spigot to make sure that these companies do not go down because of the virus in the short term.",6,602,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00602
2020-02-27-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The third point relates to what we must do to prevent short-term pain becoming chronic, in the form of long-term unemployment among mature PMETs. If companies go under because of COVID-19, many jobs will disappear and may never come back. Even if they come back, they might on to a different, younger crowd. Employment for mature PMETs exhibits a ratchet effect. It only goes one direction. It is much easier for a mature PMET to lose a job than to be hired back into one.",7,603,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00603
2020-02-27-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"So, therefore the emphasis on SkillsFuture 2, SkillsFuture Entreprise Credit and the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package in this year’s Budget is therefore much welcomed. I am also gratified to learn from the Deputy Prime Minister Budget speech that in the last three years, productivity has risen by 2.6% per year and real median income has risen by 3.6% per year. These are positive developments for the Singaporean worker. But I would also like to ask how we can get Singaporeans to do the relevant training, instead of spending their SkillsFuture money on new skills and interests that might not help them to stay employed.",8,604,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00604
2020-02-27-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I totally agree with the Deputy Prime Minister when he said that enterprises know best what are the skills needed for their businesses to transform. But, under the Enhanced Training Support for SMEs, the Government already pays for 90% of the course fee and 80% of worker’s salary while employees are undergoing training. Minister Josephine Teo also said in her speech that funding is not the constraint or the impediment that is preventing workers from getting training. But I know that SMEs are not willing or are unwilling to send their workers because it is just too difficult for them to take their workers away from day-to-day work. Therefore, the new SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit that is capped at $10,000 per year, I feel might see a very low take-up rate.",9,605,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00605
2020-02-27-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),I would like to suggest for the Government to intensify efforts to help businesses to find replacement manpower to cover their employees when they are undergoing training. And this might even include having to pay the salary of such temporary replacement. I think this would encourage upskill their workers while not compromising their day-to-day activities.,10,606,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00606
2020-02-27-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Residents have also given feedback that it is difficult to get placement into the Professional Conversion Programmes which operate on a ""place and train"" basis. Place and train means that you have to get placed in a job first before you can undergo training. But it creates a catch-22 situation for mature PMETs. They need the training to get a job, but need to get the job to get the training. So, they are stuck. I would urge the Government to provide more than the hiring incentive of 20% salary, capped at six months that is announced in the Budget, in order to further incentivise companies to make the first move.",11,607,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00607
2020-02-27-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The fourth point is what do we do for the longer term, how do we increase the resilience of our economy and our workforce? A key lesson learnt from the COVID-19 virus is that even when you have money, you cannot buy a mask. Similarly, in the area of manpower, we need to build up our self-sufficiency. We need to reconsider outsourcing.",12,608,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00608
2020-02-27-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I would encourage the Government to identify areas of critical need or essential services, and to build up a core of local talent. The speed and ability of GovTech to swing into action and update from ""gov.sg"" or ""maskgowhere"" is testament that in-house ability matters in times of crisis. Another example would be the need for experienced engineering tech talent, experienced engineering staff during the SMRT crisis in 2015.",13,609,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00609

Germany has its famous Mittelstand – the heart of German industry. The unifying mindset is a focus on social, inter-generational and community responsibility. Mittelstand companies contribute to the local economic and social welfare.

2020-02-27-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Perhaps, in this moment of the COVID-19 outbreak, we should also take the opportunity to try to remove the hierarchical way that some in our society view jobs and professions, with certain professions viewed as more prestigious while others jobs viewed as less dignified. In my view, such stratification is not the way it should be. This was also a point raised by Prof Yaacob and Mr Alex Yam, and I agree with them. If anything, the COVID-19 crisis is proof to all of us that everyone is important – everyone has a role to play – everyone is needed.",15,658,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00658
2020-02-27-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Allow me to explain. In order to stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus, office buildings carry out temperature taking. Those manning the temperature booths, often security guards, are important as they provide a first line of defence. But the guards are putting themselves at risk. Other measures that have been taken are the increased cleaning and disinfecting of places, such as playgrounds and high touch points, such as lifts and hotel rooms. Our housekeeping staff, uncles and aunties in the hotel industries, frontline staff, cleaners – they all play such an important role in the prevention of the spread of the virus. Many have had to work overtime due to the crisis to meet the increased rate of cleaning common areas. And yes, these diligent and determined workers also put themselves at risk.",16,659,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00659

I quote from the article, ""Few Singaporeans are interested in working in the cleaning industry, but Madam Tay hopes that through the work they do – especially during this outbreak – people will learn to respect the job.

2020-02-27-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"All workers on the frontline should be appreciated. None of us asked for this to happen. None of us want this to happen. But since it has happened, we need all hands on deck. There should be an appreciation that everyone, even those who play less visible roles, are important to our society. We should be less focused on hierarchy and more focused on appreciating each member of our society, especially as we battle COVID-19 in a singular and united determination. And I hope that we will also retain this experience, that everyone in our society is important, even after we overcome this crisis, as we forge our collective future.",19,662,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00662
2020-02-27-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, even as we are in a ship together, we need to ensure that the Budget has in place measures that are of practical help to our people. This is especially important to the hotel, tourism and food and beverage industry. According to a snap survey done by Restaurant Association Singapore, close to 60% of restaurants in Singapore stated that they are not prepared and equipped enough to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 on their operations. For those who rely heavily on tourists, the estimated loss could go up to 80%.",20,663,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00663
2020-02-27-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"To help the food and services sector during this period, the Adapt and Grow initiative was expanded. In relation to rental costs, for food and beverage and retailers, it is good that there are full month rental waivers for some hawkers and half a month of rental waivers for commercial tenants of Government agencies. However, for those on private property, it is the landlords of those retailers on private properties who are given property tax rebates and encouraged to pass on to the retailers. Instead of relying on the goodwill of landlords to pass on savings to their lessees, is there no other more direct way we can alleviate the challenges that those in the food and beverage industry are facing? For example, will the Ministry consider requiring landlords to declare whether they have passed on the rebate to their lessees? And if so, how much has been passed down in dollar terms? Already, it has been reported by the Restaurant Association Singapore that 200,000 employees have been affected since the outbreak.",21,664,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00664

Businesses have	been	given	incentive	measures	to	take	this opportunity to re-skill and re-train workers to increase future productivity. We also need, however, to instill measures that make learning something that is embedded in the way things are done in Singapore, long term. This is crucial as we are facing an economy characterised by disruptive technology. Change will come. Just like COVID-19 presented itself to us as a disruption, or another phrase by Deputy Prime Minister Heng, as ""a spur and a test"" that COVID-19 has presented to us, we cannot run away from such a change, disruption, spur or test.",27,670,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00670
2020-02-27-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We need to change the way we think about learning. Year after year, we cite the Chinese saying, live until old, learn until old, that is, lifelong learning. We learn that in Primary schools too. But, do we really live it? Do we see learning as a chore rather than a joy? Do we see learning as a burden rather than a privilege? I would like to suggest that we think about the way we can build lifelong learning into the curriculum of students. It is not just a good attitude to have in life but necessary in the kind of economy Singaporeans will face in the future.",28,671,2020-02-27-T-005-S-00671

Internships are integrated with the other pillars, with a work-study scheme available so students can take up longer internships and earn credits at the same time.

Historical data measuring average sea levels of the Singapore Strait from four research-quality data points at Tanjong Pagar, Raffles Lighthouse, Sultan Shoal and Sembawang, indicate that there was a 2.9 mm yearly increase of our sea levels from 1984 to 2011.
