2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the President be agreed to  'We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to the President for the Speech which he delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening of the Second Session of this Parliament.'.""",1,3,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00003
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Thank you for the privilege to begin the proceedings in this important Sitting, that marks the second-half of our term in Parliament. President Tony Tan set the tone for the rest of this term in his opening speech last week. He offered a vision for the future – a Singapore for all, and a Singapore that will be better for our people. Allow me to speak now in Malay, Madam.",2,4,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00004
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The President's Address provides a comprehensive plan on the Government's focus to further improve the lives of all Singaporeans, in addition to ensuring that our nation stays resilient in facing rapid developments. Singaporeans, in general, aspire to continually improve themselves. Those who are left behind also have opportunities to better their lives, through the system of meritocracy and various Government policies that are focused on helping them.",3,5,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00005
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),The Malay/Muslim community in Singapore have also ascended and progressed from generation to generation. This aspiration was able to be fulfilled through various programmes as well as the spirit of self-reliance and the strength of gotong royong that forms part of the lives of Malays in Singapore. It is true that more needs to be done.,4,6,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00006
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"However, the one thing that is exceptional and gives us pride is the awareness among the Malay/Muslims about the importance of investing in education, which is a pillar of success. Just like other communities, the Malays also face many kinds of challenges and concerns, including day-to-day issues like cost of living and social issues. However, one of the long-term solutions is to use every opportunity to upgrade ourselves, in order to take advantage of the potential available globally, through our education and economic systems.",5,7,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00007
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The same goes for professionals and entrepreneurs who need to reinvent themselves with new abilities and capabilities that are relevant to global developments and requirements. I also welcome the efforts by Malay/Muslim SMEs that continuously undertake initiatives to provide focus, in order to overcome all obstacles and challenges to be more competitive, in addition to using assistance programmes provided by the Government. The forum organised by the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry is an important platform to find ways to overcome present challenges.",6,8,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00008
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The Malay/Muslim community can and should make use of Government programmes to take full advantage of regional opportunities. In this aspect, perhaps the Government can play a role to facilitate these businessmen and women in making use of the available network and build ties among organisations from different industries so that the Malay/Muslim business community can have collaborations and learn from them.",7,9,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00009
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As a community that possesses a strong gotong royong spirit, we are also proud to see the successful ones, comprising more professionals and entrepreneurs, who are willing to step forward and serve the community and country. One example is Ms Rahayu Mohamad, a mother of six, who is an educational consultant and a professional. Although she is busy with her duties as a mother and a professional, she still finds time to do community work. She serves, amongst other things, in the Singapore Muslim Women Association (PPIS) and the Kampong Siglap Mosque.",8,10,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00010
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Another example is the Chief Executive Officer of Cathay Organisations, Mr Suhaimi Rafdi, who wants to do something for the community after climbing the career ladder. He, amongst other things, serves in the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA), Tampines Secondary School and is also a youth mentor. He does grassroots work in Tampines as well.",9,11,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00011
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Their contributions are very meaningful, which shows that our community does not forget those who are in need.",10,12,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00012
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In conclusion, I am confident that for the Malay/Muslim community, there is much potential for us to become successful citizens of Singapore. We must continue to become citizens who make contributions to the nation and community.",11,13,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00013
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),(In English)  I remember that at the beginning of this term in Parliament we faced the challenge to address a number of hot button issues. Members of this House have debated over many of these issues in this Chamber. To the credit of the Government – that has always stood for active and effective action – we have seen a number of improvements today through the various changes in policies implemented.,12,14,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00014
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We have seen improvements in housing with measures to boost supply, cooling measures to stabilise prices. The past year has also seen greater social support for the low-income to help them own their homes, support their children through school and childcare as well as greater support given to low-wage workers through the introduction of the Progressive Wage model (PWM).",13,15,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00015
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"For our seniors, whom in the past, had serious concerns on whether they are adequately covered for their health expenses, they are now better covered through programmes such as the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP).",14,16,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00016
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In my constituency, I have also seen the effects of our policy on the cases that we have at the Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS). We hardly see any appeals from first-time HDB applicants today, including those from low-income families, because our housing policies have made first-time home ownership more affordable and new flats are in better supply.",15,17,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00017
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As Town Council Chairman, it is also heartening that all our cleaners have benefited from PWM and seen their wages improve today for them to bring home more income for their families.",16,18,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00018
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),The setting up of Social Service Offices (SSO) in the heartlands has also made a difference. They have made social assistance schemes and job matching more accessible to my residents.,17,19,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00019
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"To this end, I have residents such as Ms Yap, a single mother, who was forced to work as a cleaner after her husband passed away. Her salary was initially low, but it has gone up in the past two years as a result of PWM. Today, she is able to support her children who have progressed well in school and one is studying in polytechnic. She is helped by Government social assistance and, just as important, support from the community.",18,20,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00020
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Be it in housing, education, healthcare, transport or cost of living, the Government has adapted its policies to suit the changing needs of Singapore and Singaporeans. And this, the Government did by listening closely to the ground, through channels like Our Singapore Conversation (OSC), constituency dialogues and various public consultation exercises. By listening to and understanding the diverse concerns of Singaporeans, the Government gets a better feel for the issues that need to be prioritised – and how to fine-tune the policies.",19,21,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00021
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),But our job is not done even though the situation and public sentiment has improved on many of our national issues. There is more that we need to do and there are people who still need our help.,20,22,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00022
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I support the President's speech to chart our way forward, laying out an agenda that is far-sighted to safeguard and build our future for a better Singapore. I would like to see more ""heart"" in how the Government will implement the mission laid out by the President, particularly in the following areas.",21,23,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00023
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We should strengthen our safety nets to help the vulnerable and elderly – in a way that one will not feel they lose their self-worth while asking for help and, at the same time, inculcate a sense of compassion in our people to be proactive in helping those who are less fortunate.",22,24,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00024
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We need to give our people greater assurance and peace of mind that they can retire comfortably here in their old age – while continuing to provide our seniors active economic opportunities to be self-reliant, in a dignified manner and not worry about being a burden to the family.",23,25,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00025
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We need to ensure our social fabric – families and communities – remains cohesive for generations to come, respecting our multiracial, multi-religious norms that we have painstakingly built over the years.",24,26,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00026
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We need to provide a safe and secure, high quality of living that is affordable for Singaporeans to enjoy a better quality of life and, yet, citizens must also feel that basic public services, including housing, food, basic goods and transport options, remain affordable.",25,27,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00027
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We should protect our social mobility and be prepared to give second chances at success, in terms of working opportunities, entrepreneurship or education pathways. Give Singaporeans hope and security that they can achieve their aspirations through fulfilling jobs or entrepreneurial opportunities here in Singapore, or beyond our shores through Singapore.",26,28,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00028
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As our President noted in his Address, ""Our Best Years Lie Ahead"" and ""we are determined to… build a better, brighter Singapore."" A better, brighter Singapore for each and every Singaporean is what we can expect, if we work together to fulfil the vision that has been laid out in his speech.",27,29,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00029
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) announced recently has helped our Pioneer Generation and families deal with future healthcare costs. My immediate concern is the segment that comes after, especially the middle-aged, middle and lower middle income groups, sometimes also known as the ""sandwich"" class.",28,30,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00030
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"It is timely for the Government to address the issue of retirement adequacy and review our CPF policies by enhancing CPF Savings and CPF LIFE annuity scheme. The Government has announced its intention to keep healthcare more affordable through subsidies, Medisave and MediShield Life and I look forward to the positive outcomes that these would bring.",29,31,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00031
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Residents I speak to are often concerned about whether they can retire comfortably in Singapore. Most are also concerned, whether their CPF savings can meet the Minimum Sum, pay for their home, afford their children's education or support the medical fees, if they have a family member that needs constant medical care. Our cost of living is, indeed, high by international standards, but given our standard of living and quality of healthcare, one major illness can set back one's savings by a lot.",30,32,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00032
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"For many in the middle class, they often only see 2Ms – Medisave and MediShield – and not the 3Ms. They face the barrier of being means-tested across the family, having to draw down their savings and those from their family members in the household, before being given access to Medifund. To many, while Medifund is there, it seems inaccessible and so, the feeling of insecurity sets in.",31,33,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00033
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The best thing we can do for Singaporeans is to provide them with stronger safety nets and portable health insurance to protect them and their families, and a CPF savings scheme that will provide assurance for their retirement, healthcare and eldercare needs.",32,34,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00034
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The CPF system has served us well. Singaporeans have come to expect that the CPF savings will be their foundation for a comfortable retirement. We need to assure Singaporeans that when they retire, they can retire comfortably.",33,35,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00035
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The CPF savings is a function of the salary one earns and the cost of living that is expected when they retire. Thus, the Government needs to ensure that Singaporeans can maximise their income and retirement savings during their prime years of employment.",34,36,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00036
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Holistically, to help more low-income workers, we should explore other areas to expand the PWM and enhance WIS to cover jobs and industries that have seen lagging salary increases or depressed salaries due to heavy reliance on cheaper foreign manpower.",35,37,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00037
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Overall, workers must also see their real wages increase as they support and pursue the Government's wider push on productivity, automation and retraining in CET. If I do get complaints on CET, it is because workers do not necessarily see an upgrade path in terms of employment after undertaking the courses and certifications. So, we must safeguard against under-employment in the workforce. It is not easy to guarantee employment, but we need to finetune the supply chain from training to upward mobility in real income or enhanced career progression.",36,38,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00038
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We should also find ways to reduce citizen's unhappiness with the changing ""goalposts"" of the Minimum Sum amount. Only half of Singaporeans today are able to meet their Minimum Sum. Thus, I can certainly understand the anxiety and fear, given the barriers. Much of the frustration I encounter with the Minimum Sum or the Retirement Account after a certain age, is due to the inflexibility when residents fall into difficulty in the use of funds to pay for mortgage or change in property, especially if they have lost their jobs or are required to take a lower pay, or have drawn down their CPF fully in their senior years.",37,39,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00039
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I do not have the answers today, but hope that a comprehensive review can provide a more positive outcome for the CPF to provide better retirement adequacy.",38,40,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00040
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"However, I would also recommend that the Government find new ways of improving returns on one's CPF savings so that it is not too difficult to achieve the Minimum Sum condition. I have met many residents who have asked the Government to provide an alternative to the CPF-approved investment funds which are currently managed by the private sector.",39,41,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00041
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Perhaps, the CPF can consider a Government-backed investment plan that tracks inflation, above the existing Ordinary Account and Special Account interest rates. The existing CPF-approved investment funds are pretty much left to the market which often has certain financial risks beyond the understanding of the ordinary CPF contributor. A Government-led plan may come somewhere in between, in that it is a trusted plan, with standard terms and the objective of tracking inflation to protect one's savings for the long term.",40,42,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00042
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, the Singaporean dream of a better life must remain an attainable one for every citizen. We must give Singaporeans enough to dream about and aspire towards. So that when they look at someone higher up the ladder, it is not one of resentment but one of inspiration to aspire and climb to achieve those levels.",41,43,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00043
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),We must uphold a fair and just work environment that our local workers do not feel disadvantaged while working amongst a global workforce. We must encourage an environment where our workers can see themselves having an equal opportunity to rise to the top based on merit and not be limited by an employer's preference for a certain nationality or profile.,42,44,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00044
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As a start, I hope that the implementation of the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) will help Singaporeans to access better jobs, while better Union representation and strengthening of TAFEP will facilitate employers to adopt progressive employment practices.",43,45,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00045
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We must continue to encourage companies to invest and train our local talents to groom them to achieve their potential. I am glad that in the Addenda, there is concerted effort by agencies, such as MAS, for the financial sector to develop a strong core of Singaporean financial specialists and leaders. I hope to see more sectors working towards the same objectives. But, at the same time, we must also engage workers to recognise and bridge expectations. As we focus on growing incomes of Singaporean workers, our workers must also be mindful that we are operating in an increasingly globally competitive environment – and that salary costs also contribute to increased costs towards services and goods.",44,46,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00046
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"On the employer front, employers need to be reassured that our policies will not inadvertently create a negative environment for businesses. We have to be mindful that there are markets around us that are cheaper, more open to talent and provide a larger market base than Singapore.",45,47,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00047
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"If we do not manage this well, the consequences that we see today – sentiments against foreigners or foreign workers – can send the wrong signals to employers and foreign investors. Some may think that we can afford to let these companies go. But if companies start leaving Singapore, we risk losing jobs, leaving ourselves in a far worse position.",46,48,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00048
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, moving on to communications. Our demographics and citizen expectations have evolved. People trust that our Government can come up with good policies that will benefit Singaporeans. But the people's expectations now are whether the Government can show that it cares and has compassion for citizens in the way it runs and operates.",47,49,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00049
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Today, there is an increasing expectation for the Government to engage and to communicate to show that it has Singaporeans at the heart of any policy that it formulates.",48,50,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00050
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) was a wonderful policy announced recently. So, I expected it to reach the ground easily, given its popular response every time we explain the programme to our seniors and their families. But I learnt that even for such a popular and meaningful policy that was covered extensively in the media, a recent report found that 40% of Singaporeans were not aware of the benefit from the PGP.",49,51,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00051
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"What this means is that we need to put in a lot more effort to explain policy benefits and issues on the ground. We need to put in even more, for policies where citizens will only see benefits in the long term and those that require more convincing.",50,52,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00052
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Today, this is the gap where you find destructive politics at play – especially the politics of envy, pitting the haves and the have-nots, and the politics of self-interest, where one group's self-interest is championed above others and above the common good. Misinformation and conspiracy theories travel much faster through the social media and coffee shop talk because these make for more sensational stories and they tell people what they want to hear.",51,53,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00053
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"So, the Government needs to invest more resources to respond quicker and drive our communication channels more effectively to reach hearts and minds out there. Otherwise, the Government will always find itself on the back foot and these divisive messages become like a festered wound that refuses to heal.",52,54,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00054
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, in conclusion, in thanking the President for his Address, regardless of political affiliation in this House, the long-term interests of Singapore and Singaporeans should always be our first priority.

2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As a citizen, we affirm our pledge of loyalty and love for our country on each National Day. In this globalised economy where we have many options, why do we choose to be Singaporean? It is about belonging here as one people and as one community, knowing that as a citizen, this is where we call home where I am safe and protected, that my livelihood and future are assured. If I need help, my Government will always look after my interests and it is whom I turn to in times of need.",54,56,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00056
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"This is where our Government needs to go beyond delivering on good policies and logic, win hearts to make Singaporeans feel they belong here and continue to sink their roots here for generations to come.",55,57,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00057
2014-05-26-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Singaporeans have placed their trust in us and elected us to represent them in this House.

2014-05-26-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit,"In my last eight years as a Member of this House, what has been most gratifying for me is to see the implementation and enhancement of various social policies and schemes that have improved the lives of lower-income Singaporeans – schemes, such as Workfare, which was introduced in 2007, the additional grants to help Singaporeans to own their homes, the various increases in education and healthcare subsidies, and the introduction of ComCare, just to name a few. These policy changes, many of which were introduced even before this term of Parliament, have made a real difference to the lives of many Singaporeans that I met. In many cases, without the help and support from the Government and the community, the individuals would not be able to cope with the daily challenges of making ends meet.",2,62,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00062

A better Singapore must mean that we all feel a greater sense of responsibility to one another. When there are families still struggling, the rest of us should feel duty-bound to lend a helping hand, whether at the individual level, through community, grassroots resources or through the Government's various social assistance schemes, to lift these families up.

As we seek to expand our social agenda in the years to come, the need for a thriving economy does not become smaller – it becomes greater. The economy has to stay vibrant to generate the revenue that will fund a wider array of social programmes. The economy also has to continue to create what Singaporeans still want first and foremost  a constant and reliable stream of meaningfully paid jobs, both for those leaving school and entering the marketplace for the first time, as well as those seeking re-employment opportunities.",4,64,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00064

It is true, as some have pointed out, that the benefits do not always trickle down fully to the lower income. But the solution is not to slow down growth, which some have been suggesting. The implications on our system as a whole can be very serious if we grow our economy below our economic potential. The far better solution is targeted help for the lower-income group through a slew of measures that includes raising their wages, improving safety nets and keeping the other foot on the pedal of growth all the time, which will help us fund these measures.",5,65,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00065

Companies these days are mobile and operate on a regional basis. They will move the jobs to locations where the labour force offers them most value and where the business environment is accretive to their businesses. China alone produces seven million graduates each year. They are all intelligent, well-trained, hungry for jobs and are prepared to work for much less. Graduate unemployment now stands at 16% in China because the supply exceeded demand and the glut looks likely to worsen in the years to come.",7,67,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00067

We have never stopped upgrading ourselves, building a better and more educated workforce and creating more productive companies. We have never stopped rethinking our broad economic strategies while examining specific sectors and sweating the small stuff, such as improving regulations and cutting red tape. We must not stop now. At this stage in our transition, it would be a sensible strategy for us to now seek quality growth, restructure and reduce our dependence on foreign labour.

The jobs created may make greater demands of employees – their skills, their creativity, their intellect and their tenacity. But they should also offer employees more enablement, more flexibility and, ultimately, a greater sense of fulfilment and social contribution. To create these jobs, the Government should not hesitate, if the need arises, to encourage the growth of certain sectors in the economy, by way of specific incentives and infrastructure building. The Government should also not hesitate to move the levers that will raise wages as a proportion of GDP to reflect fairly the increased contribution of employees over time. Quality growth also means greater inclusiveness. We seek the type of economic growth that leads to higher wage increases for the low to middle income and not those growths that only disproportionally result in higher asset inflation.",10,70,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00070

With more flexibility, for example, there is greater scope for each individual to carve out a work-life balance that better suits one's needs and that of his family. Taking time off work to learn at various junctures would be enjoyable and beneficial, even necessary. For the system, as a whole, we must move towards a greater emphasis on social well-being. We can achieve quality growth only if we also make progress in areas, such as affordable healthcare, social mobility, education, as well as ensuring a secure retirement for all.

Take the CPF as an example. The compulsory savings scheme forms a major pillar of our system, ensuring retirement adequacy while making funds available in important areas, such as home ownership, healthcare and education, for citizens and their children. I cannot imagine how our social and economic well-being for our citizens would be like without the CPF system. Some of our fellow citizens may not have saved enough for their retirement. We would have much lower home ownership, and each hospitalisation expense would result in more cash outlays without Medisave savings, not to mention that there may not be enough savings for their children's education.",19,79,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00079

But because we have the CPF system in place, and Singaporeans have seen that it has worked, we have the flexibility today of reforming the system one way or another, to better meet the needs of this generation as well as that of the ageing population. And that, as the President has mentioned in his Address, is what the Government is doing, and I fully support further improving the CPF savings and the CPF LIFE annuity schemes, as well as developing alongside more options for Singaporeans to unlock the value of their homes.",20,80,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00080

It is an example of how a local SME has future-proofed and transformed itself into the SME of tomorrow. From its humble beginnings as a mixed vegetable rice stall in a Toa Payoh coffee shop, Chang Cheng Group today operates approximately 250 outlets, employing more than 1,500 staff. Their current success can be attributed to three factors – namely, astute identification of challenges and opportunities, developing centralised processing facilities and latest food processing technologies, exploring new operating models and caring for their employees.",5,86,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00086

While a number of his peers tried to increase their profit margin either by reducing their serving portion or compromising on the quality of food, Mr Koh saw an opportunity to radically change the way hawkers conduct their business and sought to create a modern F&B chain. He understood that the best way to reduce operating cost was through automation and redesigning the workflow and to utilise the principles of economies of scale through centralised processing.",6,87,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00087
2014-05-26-T-002,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Currently, all food ingredients and sauces are processed in two facilities. With centralised processing, work is split between the centralised kitchen and frontline in the ratio of 60 40.

To ensure that there is consistency in food quality across all its outlets, Chang Cheng Group exploited the advantages of new food processing technologies. With processing facilities equipped with meat cutters, automatic tenderisers, potato peelers and vegetable processers, Chang Cheng Group is able process more than three tonnes of poultry, meat, seafood and sauces daily. That is not all. Chang Cheng Group is currently in the process of developing an integrated HQ that combines warehousing, food processing and cooking. With the new integrated HQ, all food processing and cooking will be done at a single location, quick frozen and sent to the outlets for reprocessing using induction cookers and convection ovens.",8,89,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00089

His company plans to tap on the assistance from e2i and various Ministries, to develop and adopt more new food processing technologies, so that 80% of the work processes can be completed in the integrated HQ and make work ""Easier, Smarter and Safer"" for all their workers.

This will make the dishwashing process simpler and safer. Kim San Leng Coffee Shop plans to outsource the dishwashing process. With the current practice, one worker can only wash two pieces of cutlery manually every minute, while a partially automated dishwashing machine can wash four. If the dishwashing process is outsourced, an off-site machine can wash more than 10 pieces of cutlery in a minute.

Their baking ingredients are stored systematically in standardised format and their equipment are arranged in such a way that those that are commonly used are within easy reach. Though these arrangements may seem easy to implement, bakery owner Wei Chan says the challenge is in ensuring that they stay that way, as it is easy to lapse into old work processes and habits due to familiarity. Our SME owners must resist temptations to maintain the status quo and persist in their efforts to remodel their business.

I know of two persons who choose to be self-reliant, to hold their heads up high and even seek to pass on this spirit to the next generation.",2,109,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00109

He shows them the ropes, urges them to be professional and respect their own vocation. He also listens to grievances shared by them and seeks to help them overcome the difficulties they face. Many other taxi drivers shared with me that they look up to Mr Lee as their senior, as their mentor.",5,112,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00112
2014-05-26-T-002,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"The other experience is with Mdm Chew who had a different life journey from many other people. Some years back, she experienced a difficult divorce. Though she had custody of her child, her ex-husband did not provide regular maintenance support. There were housing loans to pay, living expenses and educational fees to pay for the child. Not only that, there was also some degree of social stigma for both mother and child to deal with. She worked hard, brought up her child and even sent her to the University. Today, Mdm Chew has not completely overcome all her difficulties, but she is resolved, to persevere, to stay on the race to offer a better life for the two of them.",6,113,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00113

For example, the child is holding part-time jobs in order to pay for her own tuition fees. There are similar examples elsewhere. As a society, we should offer everyone opportunities to succeed. It is heartening to note that the President's Address touched on creating more opportunities for every Singaporean.",7,114,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00114
2014-05-26-T-002,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I shared these with the grassroots leaders, social workers, teachers and young parents in my constituency and they gave me some inputs. They felt that it is imperative that the help extended is founded on the right values. The groups they met included those who feel that they deserve more help from the Government. They want to be given and have their requests acceded to every time. They have also met other groups who were embarrassed. Although they needed help, they were afraid to openly request for assistance. And finally, another group where they can do with some help but they prefer to tough it out on their own.",8,115,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00115

However, it is up to each individual to take ownership of their lives, to improve and better their lives and those of their families. Among the dialogue that we shared, there was also a very interesting subject, especially shared by young families and pre-school teachers in my constituency.",9,116,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00116

Connecting with our neighbours goes beyond watering plants when you are away on vacation. Such a relationship and sense of belonging takes time to cultivate. Our Government has created more of the right kind of environment for people and families to bond.",11,118,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00118

The Cheonggyecheon River is located in downtown Seoul had been covered up with a highway built over it. In 2003, the Korean government initiated a restoration project to inject new life and removed the highway. Today, the river has walking paths on both sides of its banks decorated with artworks. Now, families and friends, as well as tourists, spend time there. It was then a very bold move; the amount of time and money invested, and the inconveniences caused during the restoration works.",12,119,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00119

There are increasingly more people using the park for recreation; people exercising, cycling, walking their dogs and even dining. Families have their outings there and couples take wedding photos. The transformation of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park was made possible through efforts to create accessible community spaces for all to enjoy. I am extremely glad that we have such projects where agencies tried to inject new vibrancy to the place and the facilities that we have.",13,120,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00120

In fact, I would like to suggest that tenders for such sites can also add elements of community projects as key considerations. This will ensure that our parks and rivers can further strengthen their roles as community integrators. To this end, I note that the HDB has just announced that it will pilot new projects to create more space for community bonding. I am particularly excited by the focus on neighbourhood linkways. The sheltered linkway today is indeed very well-utilised, especially during the morning and evening peaks.",15,122,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00122
2014-05-26-T-002,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Many residents often bump into one another along such linkways and strike up brief conversations. I am keen to be involved in HDB's plans to pilot an idea to re-create our linkway space as venues for deeper interactions. Hence, my only request for MND is for the agency to also pilot such plans in older estates, like Ang Mo Kio. Making available more seats and exhibits are a good start. What we need is a built environment that can generate space which can connect people.",16,123,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00123
2014-05-26-T-002,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"To this end, I also hope that LTA can consider the vacant space below elevated MRT tracks. Of course, within safety consideration, we can do more to create community and recreational space. For example, our football cages under expressways are already well received. We can explore more of what we can do with such spaces. For example, the agencies can invite communities and the public to submit ideas on how they want to create more social integration using such space.",17,124,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00124

On the ground, we see many different examples of good values upheld by newer generations of Singaporeans. These values are manifested in different ways. For example, neighbourliness and residents bonding together through community activities, communicating and engaging one another through apps, group chats and Facebook pages. At the workplace, we have moved from being a low-cost production hub, to a cosmopolitan city. Many are wowed by new industries that we have, such as those in the biosciences, aerospace, data analytics, animations.",18,125,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00125

Indeed, at the workplace, the live space and the play space, we must continue to offer breakthrough ideas. We need more ""integrators"" which can connect our businesses, professionals, communities and our families.

There are two examples showing why building institutions that the public trust is important. Nearer to home, we have an ASEAN member – Thailand – that is in political gridlock today. I believe the political gridlock could have been avoided if the Thai King decided to play an active role to defuse the crisis, as he had done in the past. He is a constitutional monarch with largely ceremonial and symbolic powers, but he embodies the spirit and values of Thai society. Most importantly, his past behaviour of acting in the interest of the nation has been consistent over a long period of time, and has won the respect and trust of the Thai people.",15,142,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00142

The US was in political gridlock for weeks until the Supreme Court of the US made a ruling declaring George W Bush as the winner. Although the ruling was not without controversy and not all were happy with it, the US was able to move on from the political crisis without damage.

I am of the view that bitter and negative experiences of citizens participating in politics, such as being detained without trial and becoming bankrupt, hamper us from moving towards constructive politics. We should also bear in mind that making personal attacks during political engagement does not help us to ""come together again"".

Whilst I appreciate the need for TDSR to avoid over-commitment, the combined burden of a maximum loan value at only 50% and ABSD of 7% upfront cash, will usually put upgrade out of reach. We should keep in mind that TDSR has already raised the bar for many by including total debt obligations capped at 60%.",11,162,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00162

And if the upgrader sells the first flat within a specified period, he should not need to pay ABSD at all.

Unfortunately, one unintended consequence of this relentless drive for achievement is a diminished tolerance for failure – for which Singapore has often been labelled the ""kiasu"" capital of the world.

It is with great hope and fervour that I look forward to this direction and action plan mapped out for us.

I am particularly heartened that the President in his Address mentioned that, if I may quote, ""We will focus not only on the low-income workers but the middle-income Singaporeans and PMEs, too."" Today, we see that the Government has made major policy shifts and good progress in various aspects concerning PMEs in the last three years alone. The list is an extensive one. From the recent Employment Act (EA) amendments to the impending changes to the Industrial Relations Act; the introduction of the Fair Consideration Framework and National Jobs Bank; the upcoming formation of a Small Claims Employment Tribunal (SCET); the expansion of the Tripartite Mediation Framework (TMF); the introduction of the Protection from Harassment Bill and many other manpower policy shifts for the benefit of PMEs. Many of these PMEs belong to the middle class or otherwise known as the ""sandwich"" class and these legislative changes are, in my view, bold, resolute and watershed in some cases. The Labour Movement lobbied for many of these and warmly welcomes these pro-active changes to prepare our people and country for the impending changes to our workforce profile and demographics.",2,182,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00182

The resulting diaspora from the unemployed, seeking a livelihood, has resulted in social issues  families displaced and lower bargaining rights of workers. There are many PMEs in the Euro zone who are compelled to take on lower value jobs to make ends meet and a significant proportion of youth unemployment in Spain and Greece. This is surely not a scenario that we would like to see befall our PMEs in Singapore.",6,186,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00186
2014-05-26-T-002,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"In terms of progression, it remains imperative that we support our PMEs to equip them and deepen their competencies for their career development. The establishment of the Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability and the WDA's Lifelong Learning Institute in Paya Lebar by the Government is an important step in this direction. Nonetheless, no amount of hardware and infrastructure will replace the individual human desire and determination to improve one's lot in life. Mental fortitude, right believing and emotional resilience are qualities needed to help our people succeed, given their busy lifestyles, multitude of commitments and hectic schedules. We need to go beyond employability skills in defining what our workers need and give them the competitive edge. Although there are those who do, there are also companies setting up base in Singapore still preferring to harness the best from their own countries and avoid employing Singaporeans in senior or mid-level positions. The often-cited reason is that we do not have the experience or world-view expertise to be able to perform on the job. I hope our local PMEs can be given a chance to prove themselves. I would like to repeat my call for employers to develop and strengthen the Singaporean Core; coupled with a speedy up-skilling process for our local PMEs to close the gaps, if any. My advice to local PMEs is to take the bold step to embrace this if the opportunity is given.",7,187,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00187
2014-05-26-T-002,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"A three-pronged approach is needed to build up the competencies and profile of the Singaporean PME workforce. First, our PMEs must be prepared to make a mental model shift in spending time – not just company-supported time – to cultivate a second skill or what I first mooted during this year's Budget debate speech as a Pi-shaped skill, to ensure lifelong employability or fulfil their aspirations. What WDA and Caliberlink have done in initiating a trial version of an Individual Learning Portfolio for PMEs is encouraging. I would like to call for it to move on from a trial basis and apply it across all our PMEs and their employers to achieve maximum results. I cannot emphasise more the need for attitudinal changes to focus less on paper qualifications and greater mapping and development of each individual's abilities, skills and aptitudes according to the various industries and attainable levels they are in. Let us remove the different glass ceilings and allow each individual PME to reach for the skies regardless of the job they are in, as long as they are prepared to put in the hard work required and have the right positive attitude and mindset, come what may.",8,188,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00188

Perhaps, it could be renamed as ""Workforce Skills and Knowledge Certification"" (WSKC) to reflect the knowledge economy that we are in and how employers would need their employees to multi-task and be adaptive to changes in work processes, automation and products. We must be able to implement multiple pathways for PMEs to embark on career progression – from a junior executive to a mid-level one and to become a senior leader in both public institutions and private corporations. All employers, regardless of public or private sector, should take the lead in this.",10,190,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00190

This could be related to the policy of a SDF Levy on employers. There should be greater accessibility to the lifelong learning fund by individual PMEs, assisted or guided by a career coach from a CET Centre. If all great athletes have great coaches and mentors, why should we not extend this to our PMEs with a ready menu of training programmes to sign up for and mentors and coaches to help them navigate and negotiate the challenges? In addition to accessibility, I would like to urge for a review of the current absentee payroll which is pegged at the same rate as rank-and-file. It is implausible for employers to release their PME staff for training as the salary portion to be recovered may be insufficient. Besides, our current offerings are confined to different industry verticals and may well lack sufficient choices to inspire our PMEs.",11,191,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00191

This may sound ridiculous to some employers. However, there is a reason why companies like 3M, Ideo and Google have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. By implementing a work regimen and routine, it stifles creativity and innovation. Employees should be allowed to tap into the lifelong learning fund set up by the Government for training and development in a CET Centre with the support of the employer. There should be quality programmes aimed at strengthening the attitude and aptitude of employees provided by the CET Centre. Employees should be permitted to request from their employers individual-initiated training and learning leave capped at a certain number of days, per month or per year.

Employers should understand that further increases in productivity, with a tightened foreign manpower supply, is only possible when their local employees are upgraded in their skills and abilities. On the other hand, a common lament by PMEs is that the skills and knowledge they have acquired through training do not lead to a corresponding increase in their income.",13,193,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00193

Over the past three years, I have met and chatted with many mature PMEs. Notwithstanding, some of the legislative changes and policy shifts fleshed out are going to benefit them.

This is the highest redundancy figure for Q1 since 2010. In particular, PMEs with tertiary qualifications were less likely to be unemployed than non-PMEs. However, PMEs, especially the mature ones, typically stay unemployed longer. While there is nothing we can do to circumvent the decisions of companies to uproot and shift their operations to another country, we should look into developing supporting measures to help the vulnerable group, who may have heavy financial commitments. Many of our mature Singaporean PMEs are understandably worried about being laid off in their jobs since they have to cater for elderly parents, young children and sustain the high costs of living.",18,198,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00198

We have to accept that not all skills, knowledge and experience are transferable in different industries. Hence, many PMEs may take easily half a year to one year or even longer to find or land themselves in another job, usually at less pay.

For example, in the financial industry, foreign banks tend to lay off employees in global restructuring exercises on an ongoing basis. Will such industries consider including a more comprehensive suite of employment assistance for their employees? This may come in the form of subsidies and payments to recognise their years of service and where possible, it can be negotiated with the unions in the unionised environment and, at the same time, help them upgrade or reskill for their next job.

If a PME is laid off through no fault of his or her own, employers, indeed, have a moral responsibility to see through the career transition for them. Retrenched employees also have to bear an unwanted social stigma and we should design a support programme to lift them out of their situation.

The pursuit of paper qualifications hinges on the belief that this would help them land their dream job. The market reality could be very different as the complexity and pace of work may not be what they have imagined it to be.

Second, to operate in a tightening labour market, employers should pay even more attention to productivity enhancement and try to maximise their human resources to cope with the labour crunch situation. Employees should also be willing to accept continuous learning and training. I hope local PMEs can plan for the future, learn a second deep skill and develop a mindset of lifelong learning. Third, for mature PMEs, I am concerned about their employment prospects.

The major thrust of his message is a call to all Singaporeans to renew our commitment ""to address the concerns and aspirations of our people to build a better future"". President Tan's Address also outlined the Government's strategies to continue to build a more inclusive society, a nation of opportunity for all Singaporeans to succeed, regardless of his or her starting point.",1,210,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00210

Whether we are talking about job opportunities, the quality of bus services, a cleaner, greener, safer or smart nation, affordable housing and home ownership, healthcare, strengthening of our social safety nets, changes to our education system or even our political discourse and debates – what is important is not only how efficient and effective these strategies are but what they do and mean for the people they are meant to serve.",2,211,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00211
2014-05-26-T-002,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I think it is timely that President Tan reminded us of constructive politics and I take it to mean Singaporeans first. And here, I think it is important for us to point out that when a policy is good, regardless of party, we should say it is good so that we can continue that. But when a policy is not landing so well, we need to listen to the ground, we need to hear our people, we need to have dialogues, we need to have conversations. They matter and we need to hear that and from that, refine the policies. I think that is what constructive politics is.",3,212,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00212

I would like to use an example to talk about how we ensure that no single point in our education will wholly determine our future. I would like to use the example of Jane, not her real name, a resident who came to see me to seek help some years ago. She had gotten into trouble with the law and she was appealing for leniency. As I spoke to both Jane and her parents, I realised that Jane had dropped out of Secondary school the year before. This prompted me to ask her what she enjoyed doing and what she thought she was good at and she said, ""Hey, I enjoy language and I think I am good at writing."" Then I asked her, ""Do you want to go back to school?"" And she said, ""Yes, but I am embarrassed because I will be older than my classmates if I go back. This is a year later and people will know that I have got into trouble."" Well, I said, ""It's okay."" Her parents also were surprised because they told me that, with her track record, she was not going to stay in school. But I said, ""Let's try"", since she was the one who asked for it. And with the help of MOE, I would say that I am glad that we were able to get her back to her Secondary school. And, at least I thought, things were settled.",4,213,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00213
2014-05-26-T-002,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Then, recently, while doing my house-to-house visits, I chanced upon Jane's family. I did not recognise her father who was smiling at me. I knew I had met him before but was not quite sure where. And he said to me, ""Don't you remember me? Jane is doing quite well; she has completed Secondary school and she is now in an institution of higher learning."" And I saw Jane herself and I was very pleased because she spoke to me. She is a very confident young lady, smiling, saying to me, ""I am glad I went back to school, and guess what? I am now in an institution of higher learning doing a course I enjoy, and I think I am going to be able to find a job that I enjoy.""",5,214,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00214
2014-05-26-T-002,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The point I am making with this example is that we have to ensure that regardless of what happens, that one point, that one failure in our system does not determine our future.

And he did a study, not in Singapore but in America, and found that on both ends of the socio spectrum, when children were deprived of adversity, or not given support, institutions of adversity, what happens is that they do not hone those very important skills to build character.",8,217,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00217

Like many developed societies, income inequality in Singapore has widened and social mobility has slowed down with development.

So, in tandem with economic growth – and I think Mr Liang Eng Hwa stressed this point – economic growth is still necessary because we have to then create jobs to help more PMETs to get jobs.

Yes, we have labour constraints; yes, there are challenges in getting foreign workers that you want. But there is a workforce, the Singapore workforce.

As many of us are aware, early this year we experienced a month of very hot and dry weather. Despite this, I do not know whether Singaporeans realise the importance of this. We did not have to do water rationing like some other countries. And the reason was not just because we were lucky. The reason was we had invested in desalination and NEWater plants which now provide 55% of our country's demands. This has reduced our reliance on imported water and rainfall, giving us a safety measure that did not exist 10 years ago. So, this is an area – and I think in many other policy areas – I will just use this as an example that I think we have to realise we have made quite a bit of progress.",20,229,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00229

2014-05-26-T-002,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"For my speech today, I want to talk about preparing Singaporeans for the future. Firstly, with the silver tsunami upon us, are Singaporeans ready for retirement? Secondly, with the digital age changing the nature of jobs, are working age Singaporeans prepared and flexible enough to adapt to these changes? Also, with the rapid trend of urbanisation in Asia, and the growth of new urban cities elsewhere, is Singapore equipped to remain competitive as other cities compete for talent, resources and capital? Thirdly, are our environment and our education system equipping our youth for a good and sustainable future here?",5,251,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00251
2014-05-26-T-002,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Firstly, on the specific topic of retirement, there is good news and there is bad news. The good news is, according to an Oliver Wyman study in July last year, the average Singaporean working in full-time employment can expect an income replacement ratio of around 68%. This is well within the OECD recommended range. But the bad news is Singaporeans have some way to go in terms of knowledge and readiness for retirement planning and many do not seem to meet the Minimum Sum. Just looking at the huge amount of online media surrounding CPF now, some of them are very negative, it is clear we need to do more to educate CPF members. According to the MAS financial literacy report, less than one in three Singaporeans are aware of how much CPF they have. Many are also unaware of the need for some financial planning or asset allocation choices needed to beat the rate of inflation. According to another survey which is done by HSBC, 41% of their respondents said they could not save for retirement due to cost of day-to-day living.",6,252,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00252
2014-05-26-T-002,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"So, can we do better with what we have in our savings or in our CPF balances? According to the same Oliver Wyman report, the average asset allocation of CPF balances is heavily skewed towards deposits on the one hand and property on the other. As of third quarter 2012, 51% of CPF balances, or $196 billion, are in fixed deposits; 41% or $156 billion are withdrawn for property purchases. Seventy percent of the balances that are eligible for investment remains allocated to deposits, earning the default interest rate.",7,253,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00253
2014-05-26-T-002,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"In the Addendum to the President's speech, it was announced that CPF members will continue to enjoy a risk-free rate of 2.5% in their Ordinary Account (OA) savings. An extra 1% per annum will also be paid on the first $60,000 in combined balances. In light of the current low global rates, this is not ungenerous. But the inflation rate in Singapore has averaged 4.1% over the last three years since our economic restructuring started. This is double the historic average inflation rate of about 2% and will erode the value of our CPF savings.",8,254,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00254
2014-05-26-T-002,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Hence, in calculating retirement adequacy, we may have to factor in a higher rate of inflation and it will be useful if the Government could give us a medium-term projection of our inflation rate. Since MAS has chosen to maintain a strong, stable Singapore dollar, we can surmise that most of our inflation cost may come from domestic cost pressures. So, being able to project the growth rate of our cost of living expenses will help us make the right choices outside of parking our surplus funds in cash deposits.",9,255,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00255
2014-05-26-T-002,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"I had previously mooted the idea of Government-issued inflation-linked bonds to be purchased by lower income Singaporeans. Since we cannot seem to do this, then perhaps more and cheaper access to a diversified pool of higher interest bearing instruments should be made available to the public. This can be made available in the form of regular savings plans with listed bond ETFs or fixed income unit trusts that pay a regular dividend. Actually, some of these instruments are already available but due to the lack of knowledge, many Singaporeans have not availed themselves of these savings instruments. Even the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) represents less than 1% of CPF balances and 35% of that is still in cash.",10,256,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00256

It shows that the four essential guarantees of social protection can be tiered to provide different levels of assistance necessary to help people climb up and achieve social mobility and better social protection. This helps to preserve our work ethic and the independence and dignity of families in being able to provide for themselves.

In many of their countries, the best countries, they had youth unemployment rates of about 20%. In some of the worst, it hit north of 80%.

For example, in this year's President Address, we see emphasis on the infocomm sector. We had previous developments in the biotech sector.

It is very easy, when we talk about opportunities, we talk about high achievers and people who are doing well and for them to think the world is their oyster.",6,308,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00308
2014-05-26-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"What is special about Singapore is that we create opportunities at all levels. One of the schools in my area is the Sports Singapore. Recently, I went for their 10th Anniversary celebrations. Speaking to many of the athletes there, one thing that struck me because they were all very grateful for being in the Sports School mainly because they had a flexible curriculum that allowed them to priortise their interests in sport and train during the day but, at the same time, keep up with their lessons in the evening. This flexible approach, I think required considerable investment and has allowed a group of Singaporeans who may not want to focus so much on academics still do so without losing out, and at the same time maintain their passion and interest in sport.",7,309,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00309
2014-05-26-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Another school that I visited recently, Christ Church Secondary whose charming Principal, Mrs Yeo Chin Nam always shares success stories. But her idea of success stories is very different from what we might normally think. She has many students who come from families with difficult backgrounds, sometimes struggling academically, sometimes dealing with lots of other issues. She makes it a point at every gathering, at every Speech Day, to share stories of how the school helped these students to overcome these adversities. Sometimes, she helps to build their confidence by introducing to them extra-curricular activities such as their Choir which is an award-winning one, and in many ways, finding ways to build their confidence. Again, one of the things that struck me was the sense of optimism coming out of this school, coming out of the students that I meet, even though many of them may have had tough backgrounds going in there.",8,310,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00310

It was one of the first schools that was started purely for Normal (Technical) students. I recently met the Principal, Mr Krishnan Aravinthan, and it was his first year in the school. While I was walking through the school, one of the things that struck me was how he managed to call out the students by name. I was quite impressed, and I asked, ""You are the Principal; how do you know all the students by name?"" He said, ""Well, some of these students, they may have had more learning difficulties, so you need to spend more time, more attention on them."" But he had people and teachers who had the ability to deal with that. The investment was significant as well. When I went to some of the classrooms, they had some classrooms that were set up like hotel rooms so that people can pick up the necessary skills. Other classrooms were set up like supermarkets and another one set up like an industrial kitchen. In many ways, there is a lot of effort being put into training people at a very young age.",9,311,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00311

Income security for children – there are many different schemes to help children. Access to essential healthcare – as far as I know this is accessible to all Singaporeans.

Although we have the same party ruling for many, many years, the Members of Parliament keep changing. And one of the things that strike me when I speak to most of the other Members of Parliament is we all feel a bit like custodians, we are quite happy to do our job, to solve the problems at hand, and when the time comes to hand over, we are quite happy to do that as well. So, in that sense, we do not have this idea of being obsessed with staying in power or anything like that at our individual level because we all are just passing on the baton to the next generation.

Do you think it actually helps your country?"" and so on. And his was a country that was suffering economically, in quite a bad form. By the end of the conversation, he more or less agreed that it would be better for his country if it had opened up.

I finally said to him, ""These problems sound very difficult. How are you going to solve them?"" He gave me a smile and said, ""I would not solve them. I am going to lose in two weeks, and it is not my problem. I take my pension."" So, in a sense, he was joking, but at the same time, it was also eye-opening. In a sense, none of them had a long-term perspective. They were living from election to election. From his point of view, he said, ""Okay, I am financially secure. I have got my two terms done. I cannot solve these problems, so let someone else do it"". He did lose his seat two weeks after that and the new government is also having some trouble.",26,328,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00328

He was sort of joking when he said, ""In my country, those are the last people you would speak to because they will be out for you."" Again, it was quite eye-opening.

So, it is not just a simple matter of providing more or providing something that seems to be more advanced because it is proposed by an international organisation. We can have our own solution, which we have already established. The kueh lapis in itself is not just about presenting a beautiful kueh that is sweet. If it is too sweet, it is also not good for the health. It is more than just about presenting what we are offering to the people in a better way.

However, with the financial resources provided and relevant school programmes, he was given the opportunity to experience a holistic education and to pursue his passion for music.

This is particularly important for low-wage workers who are often in lower skilled jobs. The skills and knowledge that they require to stay relevant in the job market will evolve with external factors such as technology developments and economic restructuring. They need to be able to adapt to such changes in order to remain employable.,22,352,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00352

We will mandate tripartite-negotiated PWMs in specific sectors that suffer from prevalent cheap-sourcing coupled with limited bargaining power on the part of the workers. We have done so for the cleaning sector this year and plan to do the same in the security sector when the PWM for this sector is ready.

Last year, two thirds of Singaporeans who were retrenched or laid off were able to find new employment within 12 months, of which about 70% found jobs in a different industry.

I am encouraged to note that between July 2013, when the WTS was revised, and December 2013, 35,000 Singaporeans benefited from the WTS scheme. This includes training which were supported by employers, and training which employees undertook on their own. I hope that more Singaporeans will proactively take on the training opportunities available to them, and that employers of low-wage Singaporeans will send their employees for training.

As a representative of the business community, the subject of my speech today is ""Jointly transforming Singapore into an even more competitive economy"". My speech will have two key points  firstly, to reflect people's sentiments from an impartial and objective viewpoint, always putting our nation first and foremost, to help the Government formulate and promote pro-business policies; and secondly, bringing an open and inclusive attitude to encourage SMEs and workers to upgrade, accept foreigners and new immigrants, and pursue a good life for all.",3,384,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00384
2014-05-26-T-002,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"Firstly, let me talk about my first point on having an impartial and objective viewpoint. I have already served as a Nominated Member of Parliament for five years. For the role of a Nominated Member of Parliament, being an observer and a practitioner is certainly very different. Previously, when I listened to others speak, it was quite natural to be critical, or to hope to listen to more controversial topics; however, when I became a Nominated Member of Parliament and participated in Parliament debates, I became fully aware of the responsibility and importance of this position. My standpoint has always been impartial and objective, steering clear of political disputes and reflecting the feedback from the society at large, in particular that of the business community, to provide a more holistic and diverse perspective on the Government's policies. The objective of doing this is to hope that every member of our society could work hard together to transform Singapore into an even more competitive economy and to pursue a better and brighter life.",4,385,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00385
2014-05-26-T-002,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"""Nominated Member of Parliament"" – these four words do not represent a single individual, but a group of specific background. The responsibility of the Nominated Member of Parliament is to provide constructive feedback in a practical, effective and professional way. In order to perform this role well, I have used different channels, including the SCCCI, to gather feedback and requests from companies. Some companies have also approached me directly for assistance. While we are preoccupied with contacting companies for feedback, we also proactively engage and communicate with relevant Government agencies to facilitate improved cooperation between the Government and the business community. Singapore is undergoing the process of economic restructuring, and many enterprises are facing the pressures of restructuring. In the past five years, most of the problems raised by companies have revolved around escalating rental costs, manpower shortage, challenges in productivity upgrading, effectiveness of policy implementation, which all demonstrate the different pressures incurred by changes in the business environment.",5,386,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00386
2014-05-26-T-002,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"Actually, these problems are not only faced by our local enterprises. The global economic environment is in a state of constant change. On the one hand, because of the continued emergence of new technology, traditional business models will feel the brunt; on the other hand, new opportunities, new concepts and new industries have also arisen. We appreciate the Government's support in rolling out all kinds of assistance schemes to help local enterprises face up to the challenges of economic restructuring. With the support of the Government, many SMEs have the ability to buy new equipment, improve their productivity and make adjustments to their work flow. However, some SMEs, especially the micro-enterprises, have very limited resources and capability and require a longer time to adjust to the new environment.",6,387,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00387
2014-05-26-T-002,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"Next, my second point is on being inclusive and upgrading. I totally agree with this part of President Tony Tan's Address  ""Singapore must remain a nation of opportunities for all. Those who do not succeed at first should have a second chance, indeed, must always have the chance to try again."" Some SMEs, especially the micro-enterprises and traditional businesses, have to restructure due to the changes in the environment. They are also aware of the need to restructure and are trying hard to do so. Thus, I hope that when the Government draws up its business policies, it should take greater consideration into the needs of SMEs, micro-enterprises and traditional businesses, giving them sufficient space, allowing them the opportunity to try again and again. I hope these SMEs, micro-enterprises and traditional businesses would not give up too easily, and I hope the Government would also not give up on them too easily!",7,388,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00388

Currently, many industries are facing manpower shortage and many bosses have told us that, at this time, it is really difficult to send workers for training when they do not have enough workers. Having been in business for many years, I am deeply aware of the importance of worker training. Even if companies have limited manpower resources, they should still engage in worker training. Workers who upgrade themselves can then become a more valued human resource. Switching to different industries or restructuring is not that formidable. It is even more alarming to have a mindset that is resistant to change.",8,389,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00389

Commuters even watch drama serials on their mobile devices in the MRT. If workers could apply the same level of energy to personal upgrading and companies could use more Internet technology in their training applications, this could perhaps alleviate the pressures brought about by the labour crunch. Certainly, this method may not succeed and it depends very much on the aspiration of workers to upgrade. The larger the aspiration, the better the outcome. I look forward to the Government's efforts to build a ""Smart Nation"", enabling enterprises in the areas of worker training.",9,390,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00390

If the foundation could be instilled at a young age, the productivity concept and quality would be fully manifested later in the working world. We have a suggestion for the Committee to Strengthen National Service. Every young man has to serve National Service and these two years are the most significant years before they enter the workforce or enter institutions of higher learning. It is also the crucial formative period where they develop physical strength, EQ and teamwork. In recent years, Singapore's birth rate has been extremely low and the SAF also needs to change its management model, using more effective training methods to defend Singapore. There is also a need to increase productivity in the army, and we hope that the Committee, as they look into strengthening its systems, could also consider how to instil the notion of productivity into the army training curriculum, including planning, design, process flow control and so on. All along, these notions could be well understood by army officers, but going forward, we hope that these notions could be understood by every full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) and could also be personally experienced by them. The period of National Service is the ideal time to conduct intensive training and these well-trained young men, after completing their National Service, would be integrated into every trade and industry in the workforce and be a driving force behind the productivity of the entire workforce.",10,391,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00391

My company happens to be one which employs workers of many different backgrounds, and thus I would like to discuss my sentiments here. My company's business operations have a worldwide presence; foreign talent can help the company to expand and manage its overseas operations effectively and a diversified workforce has always been our strength. In our Singapore HQ, we use work performance to justify worker's value.

Compared to 50 years ago, our business environment is more complex and is constantly changing. The expectations of Singaporeans are also comparatively higher. The Government must understand the needs of the business community, promote pro-business policies, let every trade and industry flourish, with workers and bosses working hard together to create more wealth; only in this way can the Government be equipped with the capability to look after the more vulnerable in our society and preserve social cohesion.",14,395,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00395

Ultimately, every Singaporean wants to lead a better life and have hope for a better future. In an inclusive society, people must have the peace of mind knowing, that they can earn a decent living through an honest day's work. NTUC has worked very closely with the Government to help low-wage workers have the capacity to earn better wages and a better life. Measures taken, such as mandating the Progressive Wage Model in the cleaning, security and maybe landscape sectors where cheap sourcing is prevalent and investing in workers' training through the two newly established institutes, are steps in the right direction to help the workers earn better wages as they improve their skills, career and productivity. NTUC is confident that the mandatory Progressive Wage Model in these sectors will impact on the wages of the other low-wage workers in the other service sectors, such as logistics, F&B and many others.",3,400,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00400
2014-05-26-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, there are some other areas we can work on to help low-wage workers feel that they belong to this inclusive society. Studies have shown that workers of the future want their work to be exciting, respectable and relevant. While earning better pay is important, it is also equally important to professionalise as many jobs as possible to make them more respectable and exciting. A comprehensive review must be made to all the WSQ courses aimed at helping low-wage workers to ensure skills being taught continue to be relevant and effectively applied by them to improve their work through productivity. Courses must be made available for workers to continuously upgrade their skill levels. Ideally, these workers must be recognised as professionals in their own rights with the necessary competency to do a better job than an untrained person. Such a push for workers to be trained will come at a cost to customers but, if it can help these workers earn better wages, workers' training must be made mandatory for companies to provide such services.",4,401,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00401
2014-05-26-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, besides fair pay and respectable jobs, many low-wage workers also want job security. As a business model, outsourcing the non-core businesses of a company is a logical and rational choice to improve the company's profit but, it has come at the expense of the job security of thousands of workers providing the outsourced services, especially among the low-wage service workers. Not only do these workers have less benefits compared to the direct employees who enjoy better bonuses, medical benefits or other company perks, they are also at risk of losing their jobs when contracts are not renewed or having their wages reset when they have to work under a different employer even though they are still working in the same premises. These workers are also at the losing end to recoup any unpaid salaries should their companies go bust because they do not have the financial means to pursue the matter.",5,402,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00402
2014-05-26-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"These are problems that are not easy to resolve but I would like to call upon the Government to work with NTUC to find headway in helping workers have a sense of job security. The Progressive Wage Model can act as a safety net to prevent wages from falling beyond a certain level but, more must be done. This may involve legislative change or simply providing the support network to ensure no low-wage workers are left behind. At this juncture, I would like to thank the Government for its financial support in helping NTUC set up a low-wage worker centre called U Care Centre aimed at providing this support network to our low-wage workers. Let us not rest on our laurels and find more ways to give low-wage workers a better sense of job security.",6,403,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00403
2014-05-26-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, an inclusive society would also promote workplaces that cater to the physical and emotional well-being of workers, regardless of their job. As a society, we should not turn a blind eye to vocations that deprive workers of having a chance at work-life balance. As an example, in the security sector, long working hours are very common. To circumvent large overtime pay, many security agencies resort to paying their officers low basic salaries, leading to a vicious cycle of the security workers having to work overtime to earn enough to support their family. As a society, we should gradually move away from allowing companies to have overtime exemptions. This may lead to pressure for salaries to increase but, in the long run, it will force companies to think creatively of security solutions, yet at the same time, it will allow workers to work within a decently reasonable number of hours.",7,404,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00404
2014-05-26-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, while it is laudable that we have a workplace safety and health framework, many low-wage workers are working in an environment which is hazardous to their health and safety without the proper gear and equipment to minimise the health risk. While MOH is actively pursuing health advisory specific to the job vocation and MOM has workplace safety guidelines, I would like to call for more to be done. The onus must be put on these companies to provide the appropriate gear to their workers. It must go beyond ensuring safety to the life of the workers, to also include minimising any long-term health risk. I hope to see a future where more of our low-wage workers donning proper gear and equipment as they ensure Singapore continue to be clean, green and safe.",8,405,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00405
2014-05-26-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, helping the vulnerable workers goes beyond the call for skills upgrading, better pay or even financial assistance, to give them the recognition, pride and dignity that they are playing an important role. Workers of today, even low-wage workers, want beyond sustenance but also the satisfaction and identity that define them as a worker contributing actively to our nation building.",9,406,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00406
2014-05-26-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"As a society, we need to give greater recognition to the role played by workers who are keeping Singapore clean, green and safe. These workers spend hours of their lives toiling away at their jobs trying to get a decent living and support their families. These workers are sometimes called ""unsung heroes"" but it does not have to be that way. A simple pat on the back and a little courtesy towards them by each one of us can go a long way in motivating them to go that extra mile or to carry on performing to the best of their ability. The small actions and intents can go a long way in making someone's day, and whether it translates to higher productivity may be uncertain – but it would certainly make our society a brighter and, more importantly, an inclusive one to be in.",10,407,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00407

I believe that these are the very challenges we face when we strive to create an inclusive society. The problems I mentioned, if left unchecked, will continue to create fault lines within our society. As the Government, the onus falls on us to seal up these fault lines. Jobs and wages may not define a society, but it certainly plays a very large role in determining the satisfaction of the average Singaporean with the status quo.",13,410,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00410

For every percent of economic growth that Singapore enjoys, let us give every worker a reason to smile and rejoice – for they are very people that have made it possible, regardless of their job vocation.

For the long-term economic growth, the Government limited the number of foreign workers to a third of Singapore's labour force.

For Malay/Muslim youths who have completed their studies in the ITEs and Polytechnics, it is imperative that they look for jobs that are suitable with the training that they received. Malay/Muslim workers can compete competitively with foreign workers because the Government will impose the workers' levy and qualifying salaries on the entrance of foreign workers and that will give local workers an advantage.",26,423,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00423

For the worker – by reporting it to TAFEP and MOM. The same goes, if there are questions on specific issues about the opportunities.

It seems that it is a challenge that is becoming very difficult to solve and so the Government may really need to step up the game and perhaps try a new approach, with a more out-of-the-box strategy. To maintain our social compact, our birth rates are going to play an important role as we entrench the Singapore Core in our population here.",16,450,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00450
2014-05-26-T-002,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Along with that core comes economic resilience within our society as the Government needs to make sure that Singaporeans get good quality jobs and good incomes to enjoy a certain standard of living. We cannot argue that economic resilience is a central thread in this social fabric and if we take that away, the entire fabric could come undone. Here is where the Government needs to make sure that it takes care of our SMEs. Even as we restructure and look at the wider macro picture, we cannot underestimate the importance of our SMEs to the economy as they provide jobs to nearly 70% of our workforce. So, SMEs play a crucial role in building economic resilience here and we must ensure that we maintain them as the significant core in our economy or we risk having a demoralised society due to unemployment. With a strong Singapore Core that is economically resilient, we will build a strong and cohesive Singapore body.",17,451,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00451

Singapore has done well, but if we are to continue to do well in the next stage, we will have to carefully chart the journey ahead and press on together.

We are investing in R&D, helping firms to raise their productivity and acquire new capabilities, encouraging new start-ups and innovation. We are working hard to keep business costs manageable, building new industrial spaces and ensuring that energy is competitively priced. We are also continuing to expand our network of free trade and investment guarantee agreements to help businesses export and invest overseas. This is critical because Singapore is small and many of our businesses need to serve the international market to grow and thrive.",6,460,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00460

2014-05-26-T-002,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"One important way is to educate them and help them build capabilities through technology.

We will push ahead with the efforts to implement technologies into their businesses and processes.",9,463,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00463
2014-05-26-T-002,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"For example, through technology matching, Manja Delights Kitchen, a family business in Taman Jurong, implemented Snap2Tell, an image recognition technology developed by A*STAR. By scanning Manja Delights Kitchen's logo and name card, potential customers are able to access their menu as well as place orders of kuehs online. This reduces the number of phone calls from customers, hence increasing the owner's capacity to do what they do best – making kuehs. So they focused on their core competency, and outsourced the rest of it. Technology helps them to streamline the processes.",10,464,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00464

We will ensure that we have programmes, measures and policies to consider how to encourage collaboration between SMEs and big companies. We want to help SMEs and large organisations to come together so that SMEs can gain experience, improve their quality of goods and services, and develop a track record. Since 2013, SPRING has helped 193 SMEs partner with large organisations through 51 projects. We continue to provide strong support for such collaborations and projects so that SMEs can upgrade their capabilities through these various initiatives.",11,465,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00465

2014-05-26-T-002,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"SMEs, therefore, need to adapt and push for higher productivity. They can bring about sustainable and quality growth if they have higher productivity. Many companies have been successful in doing that. An example is Dian Xiao Er, a Chinese restaurant famous for its herbal roast duck dishes. It has raised productivity through several methods, including outsourcing of some food preparation like cutting and marinating of meat to its food manufacturer, using biometric readers to record staff attendance and training staff to improve on their service delivery. These are the SMEs who changed their mindsets, believed in efficiency, improved their productivity and strengthened their positioning in the marketplace.",13,467,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00467

In the coming years, MTI will partner MOM, MOE and the industry to prepare Singaporeans for the specialist, managerial and leadership roles in the economy. We want Singaporeans to have meaningful careers and good jobs that will help them to realise their dreams and aspirations. As the Member Mr Dhinakaran has mentioned, our SMEs employ 70% of our workforce and also play a major part in contributing to the economy. They are the backbone of our economy. SMEs need well-trained talents in their companies too. They need motivated Singaporean workers who can find meaning in their work and will also help the SMEs and take them to the next level.",16,470,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00470

But we have 21 FTAs that will help the businesses. Ongoing negotiations of the regional FTAs, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) as well as with individual countries, such as Turkey, will further enhance our trade positions and help our businesses.",23,477,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00477

There is a signalling effect, but it may not be a dominating effect. But we believe that there is a need to provide more information for the tenants and for the landlords as well to make more informed decisions. We will continue to explore ways to make sure this information is available and, within this year, we will make sure that such information is more accessible for decisions to be made.

We have not shied away from making difficult decisions. We will maintain strong economic fundamentals, such as an open and business-friendly environment, good governance, sound infrastructure, a highly educated workforce, but, most importantly, a stable political climate and position in Singapore.

It is not about being populist and winning more support. Sometimes, it is about making very difficult decisions. And that is a fundamental of all stable political systems.

In second order of importance of influence, are career platforms, such as exhibitions, talks, career fairs and the media.

What we should aim for, therefore, is a multiplicity of pathways that are viable options in and of themselves.

So, for example, if you know that 70% of Singaporean jobs depend on SMEs, then one should not suggest a complete freeze on foreign workers, because that will seriously impact our Singaporean jobs, even though it may sound popular, and even though it may sound good.

We will also continue put out our alternative solutions and policy proposals to move Singapore further, both with the Opposition and the ruling Party.",26,564,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00564
2014-05-26-T-002,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"As Singapore approaches a new chapter with its 50th anniversary next year, the Opposition's role and responsibility is becoming a more integral part of the governance of our nation. In fact, the whole nation must be responsible for that. We all have a role to play.",27,565,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00565
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion of thanks to the President for his speech.",1,566,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00566
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I am heartened by the Government's commitment to help our local Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) become more productive. The $300 million MTI has committed to SMEs over the next three years is over and above the $1 billion committed from the $2 billion National Productivity Fund. I am sure many SMEs will find this fund injection useful.,2,567,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00567
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I feel strongly that we must support and grow our local enterprises further. Aside from the reasons of national pride and patriotism, local businesses create and add significant value to our economy.",3,568,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00568
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Unfortunately, the idea of starting a business is daunting to most Singaporeans, especially our young ones, who are well-educated and have many attractive and stable jobs to choose from. Those who manage to save up or secure additional funds would rather become landlords instead of starting businesses. There is much less headache and backache involved. Increasing productivity only tackles one aspect; we should really tackle the number one hurdle faced by our SMEs  rental.",4,569,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00569
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Our current mode, to a certain extent, relies on the free market mechanism for the commercial and industrial property market. However, due to our scarcity of land, especially near choice locations, there is a limitation to the realisation of the full benefit of the free market mechanism, that is, through increasing supply of land.",5,570,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00570
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Increasing the supply of land for open tender by private developers, which is profit-driven, may not necessarily help rein in the cost of business. The increasing sale of commercial and industrial properties to REITs also pushes up rental cost and thus raises the cost to consumers, which in turn drives up the cost of living. There is a need for both HDB and JTC to remain as major property owners to keep the control over the rental and thus the cost of living.",6,571,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00571
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"It may be good for HDB to retain control over the rental of commercial properties in town centres and neighbourhoods, alongside with private malls to cushion costs. Likewise, the same applies to JTC.",7,572,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00572
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),We should review our current ratio of privately and Government-owned commercial and industrial properties. I would like to ask what is the current ratio and if there are plans to review and change the ratio to ensure the sustainability and growth of our SMEs while keeping a control on the rental costs.,8,573,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00573
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Next, for housing, I want to express my appreciation for the bold and decisive move by HDB to delink the prices of BTO flats from the market prices with household income as the base for flat prices. This policy has stabilised property prices and calmed the market. The earlier pent-up demand and property chase had caused much anxiety. I hope we continue to maintain adequate supply every year and it would be also good to keep aside a certain percentage of housing in stock.",9,574,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00574
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"As suggested before, it would also be desirable to complement the current system with a registration system for better planning. A registration system will enable HDB to have better real time information and indication of the prevailing demand for flats by location and type of flats required by both first timers and upgraders. It will help to minimise the gap between expectations and aspirations and also optimise the resources allocation.",10,575,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00575
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I would also like to request that we extend the Lease Buyback Scheme beyond 3-room flats as elderly residents would like to age in place. We should also promote the use of reverse mortgage to help residents who are asset-rich to unlock and monetise these assets for retirement. To reduce uncertainty due to residents outliving leases, whether in Studio Apartments (SAs) or flats pledged to the Lease Buyback Scheme, HDB should commit to lease extensions.",11,576,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00576
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),We also need to help residents aged 55 and above who face problems buying their flats using CPF savings. They are affected by the Minimum Sum requirement. CPF should allow half of the Minimum Sum to be set aside for the flat purchase if the buyers are still working and have income to service their mortgages. This will also be in line with our support for residents who want to continue to work.,12,577,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00577
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"There is also a need to expedite reviews of current CPF Housing Withdrawal Limit and Valuation Limit, as the valuation of flat at the point of purchase may not be realistic, coupled with safety net provided through HDB Lease Buyback Scheme.",13,578,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00578
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I would also like to suggest that we increase the percentage of larger BTO flat allocations to second-timer families with more than one child to encourage procreation. In addition, we should consider allowing divorced Singaporeans with custody of children to apply for BTO flats even though they could have bought a flat or enjoyed the grant more than twice, as they could be forced and compelled to sell their flats without benefits due to their failed marriage.",14,579,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00579
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The existing policies should not penalise Singaporeans who are married to divorcees and who are first-timers to apply for HDB flats. May I suggest to HDB to allow them to apply for flats, perhaps without grants? Those divorcees could be ineligible having enjoyed more than once the grant and subject to repayment of resale levy, while first-timer spouse may be considered for half of the usual grant given to the first-time couples.",15,580,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00580
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Next, on education. I would like to say that I support MOE's moves to remove the emphasis on critical examinations which decide a child's future. In fact, this focus on examinations, academic performance and top schools contributes to our lower fertility rate as well as rising costs of living. In many homes today, the two major expenditures are mortgages and tuition fees. Perhaps, the Ministry should commission a study to find out the impact of private tuition on school results.",16,581,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00581
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"There is a suggestion to extend the school hours so that the students finish their homework in school before they go back. However, I do come across parents who asked for school transfers for the same reason that the schools did not have homework for their students. In fact, the principal has tried with the good intention to ensure that the students can finish homework in school so that they can get to enjoy family bonding at home. But this may not be appreciated and accepted by parents. Parents still feel the need to arrange tuition and other enrichment classes for their children after school.",17,582,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00582
2014-05-26-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Government for accepting and implementing my various suggestions over the past three years. These include",18,583,2014-05-26-T-002-S-00583
