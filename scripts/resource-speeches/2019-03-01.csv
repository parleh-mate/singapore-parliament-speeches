2019-03-01-T-001-S-00001,2019-03-01-T-001,1,Chia Shi-Lu,–
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00002,2019-03-01-T-001,2,Walter Theseira,asked the Minister for Health in light of the IT error in the provision of CHAS subsidies (a) how frequently are checks for accuracy and reliability performed on such IT systems and how are these checks performed; (b) to what extent will the costs of incorrectly providing higher subsidy tiers be recoverable from the system vendor; (c) what are the principles determining which healthcare IT systems are outsourced; and (d) whether the outsourcing of means-testing IT systems will be reviewed so as to build key competencies within Government.
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00003,2019-03-01-T-001,3,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked the Minister for Health concerning the computer system error resulting in inaccurate CHAS subsidies being given to 7,700 recipients (a) whether there was feedback by the recipients about the errors; (b) if so, how was the feedback responded to; (c) how was the computer system error discovered; and (d) what was the cost of the error to the Ministry."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00004,2019-03-01-T-001,4,Alex Yam,"Question No 1, Sir."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00005,2019-03-01-T-001,5,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, may I take the first three questions together?"
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00006,2019-03-01-T-001,6,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00007,2019-03-01-T-001,7,Edwin Tong,"Thank you.  Sir, the error occurred in the computerised means-test system that calculates the healthcare subsidy tiers which individuals are eligible for, based on their income information. This central system is owned by MOH and managed by our vendor NCS Pte Ltd."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00008,2019-03-01-T-001,8,Edwin Tong,"On 16 September 2018, the system was migrated to a new Government data centre, due to the Government’s planned decommissioning of the old data centre where the system was originally located. One of the files uploaded by NCS to one of the servers during the migration was of a wrong version. As a result, healthcare subsidy tiers of some individuals were computed without the corresponding full income information of these individuals."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00009,2019-03-01-T-001,9,Edwin Tong,"The first run of CHAS means-tests after the system migration took place on 18 September. The first discrepancy in means-test results was identified by the CHAS processing team on 24 September, and NCS was immediately alerted. The team then subsequently identified five more cases between 9 October and 2 November, and alerted NCS on each occasion. Three of the six cases were applications that required some manual verification from the CHAS processing team, who detected the discrepancies. The other three cases were appeals from CHAS applicants. Two were assessed to be legitimate appeals for higher subsidies and were approved."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00010,2019-03-01-T-001,10,Edwin Tong,"The majority of the affected individuals received higher subsidies and they do not need to return the subsidies disbursed. We estimate the amount to be about $2 million, and we are in discussions with NCS to recover the amount from them. Those who received lower subsidies will have the shortfall reimbursed, and their subsidies set to the correct levels going forward."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00011,2019-03-01-T-001,11,Edwin Tong,Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked about the checks and audits on the system and means-test results.
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00012,2019-03-01-T-001,12,Edwin Tong,"To ensure the means-test status and healthcare subsidy levels are updated, a refresh of an individual’s data is automatically triggered every two years, or sooner should an individual requests for an updated means-test or makes an appeal. We agree with Dr Chia Shi-Lu that it is useful to inform CHAS beneficiaries of their subsidies at each deduction so that they can also verify their subsidy levels and balances are accurate and updated. We plan to look into this during future rounds of system enhancements."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00013,2019-03-01-T-001,13,Edwin Tong,"As for the means-test system, the regime of checks and audits are in line with overall Government IT Policies. These cover areas including software development, test management, systems resiliency and cybersecurity. Audits are conducted regularly. Recent audits on the means-test system include one by GovTech on IT management process compliance from Jul to Oct 2018, and another initiated by MOH on cybersecurity in Aug 2018."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00014,2019-03-01-T-001,14,Edwin Tong,"Where changes or enhancements are made to the system, MOH adheres to the quality assurance process stipulated for Government agencies. This would include requirements on software component testing, end-to-end system integration testing, user acceptance testing, performance test, security test and production environment shakedown tests. For some systems, a set of transactions may also be performed at launch or migration to verify accuracy before going “live”. Additional monitoring may be undertaken during the initial period of time after going “live”."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00015,2019-03-01-T-001,15,Edwin Tong,"The extent of testing in each case would depend on the assessed risk. The means-test system concerned is a mature system that has been running since 2012. Based on the scope of this migration, the tests and validations were scoped and performed accordingly. Thereafter, the means-test system was migrated to the new data center. Unfortunately, NCS deployed a wrong version of a software file to one of the servers in the new data centre. In other words, the scope of test and post production validation was appropriate and in accordance to the project’s assessed risk but the wrong version of the file was thereafter used, instead of the one that had been tested. And that applied to one of the servers."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00016,2019-03-01-T-001,16,Edwin Tong,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Assoc Prof Walter Theseira also raised questions on outsourcing against in-house development. To deliver digital solutions and deploy IT systems effectively, the Government adopts a mix of IT development approaches, including outsourcing, co-sourcing and also in-sourcing. If the solution is commercially mature, Government agencies are more likely to outsource, so as to better manage cost and leverage on the capacity, competency and also the scale available in the market. Increasingly, the Government is also co-sourcing the development of critical systems with key vendors to ensure high systems quality and reliability, as well as inter-operability across Government. Finally, full in-house development is done to develop capability which would enable us to develop software to better respond to our evolving policies and requirements."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00017,2019-03-01-T-001,17,Edwin Tong,"In public healthcare, we take a similar approach. This allows us to move at the pace needed to support the volume of IT system requirements across the healthcare system, while ensuring that core capabilities continue to be developed internally."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00018,2019-03-01-T-001,18,Edwin Tong,"As we tap on technological solutions to raise productivity and improve the provision of healthcare services and support to Singaporeans, we are keenly aware that system vulnerabilities and risks exist and they do have to be carefully managed. Where IT systems are outsourced to vendors, we also have to closely supervise their work, monitor their performance and manage vendor risks."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00019,2019-03-01-T-001,19,Edwin Tong,"We constantly seek to improve our quality assurance frameworks and review IT processes and outsourcing. Following this incident, MOH has started a review of our testing and deployment processes to identify areas that can be further strengthened. For example, we will be implementing an independent Quality Assurance review for every major system change henceforth. We will also look into automating some parts of our testing and deployment processes, including the detection of anomalous transaction outcomes. We will continue to learn from our experiences to build a stronger and more robust system."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00020,2019-03-01-T-001,20,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"I thank the Senior Minister of State. Two questions. The first has to do with the scale of the error and the cost because the error did not just happen for CHAS but also affected outpatient subsidies, MediShield Life premium subsidies, subsidies for intermediate and long-term care and the disability assistance schemes. So, what is the scale of the error beyond CHAS and what is the cost."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00021,2019-03-01-T-001,21,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"The second question is if it affected these other subsidy schemes too, does it mean that the means-testing data is so integrated that one error in one part would affect all the other parts with regards to a particular individual, for example, who is receiving subsidies across all these different schemes."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00022,2019-03-01-T-001,22,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In terms of the scale of the error and the remediation efforts that are taken, and the cost that it will take, the $2 million that I estimated would approximate all the costs that would be involved in correcting this error. In terms of the information that is affected, income information for a particular individual would remain similar. So, yes, if one aspect of the information is compromised, then it may affect the way in which that individual's subsidy tiers are calculated. The way in which we design the system is for convenience so there is a similar back end to all of these subsidy tiers, and each time a request is being made, one goes back to the base information for the particular individual."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00023,2019-03-01-T-001,23,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, to that extent, yes, Assoc Prof Goh is right. But ultimately, the integrity of the system depends on the various cross checks and the verifications that are done before the information is then put out. In this case, there was one particular file that affected the base information, which is why when computing subsidy levels, the information was incomplete and therefore, some subsidy levels were wrongly assigned."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00024,2019-03-01-T-001,24,Walter Theseira,"I thank the Senior Minister of State. I have three clarifying questions. The first is that it appears from the timeline there was about a one-and-half months' lapse between discovery of the first discrepancy and the conclusion that it was a systemic error. So, is it the case that the vendor did not conclude there was a need to check for whether there was a systemic error upon being notified of the very first discrepancy?"
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00025,2019-03-01-T-001,25,Walter Theseira,"The second question is, is it possible for the Ministry to clarify today the extent of recoverability of costs from the vendor?"
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00026,2019-03-01-T-001,26,Walter Theseira,"And the last question is, will the decision to outsource this particular type of system which is means-testing, will that be reviewed in light of this case?"
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00027,2019-03-01-T-001,27,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The timeline I gave earlier takes into account the amount of time for the CHAS team to pick up the error, flag it to NCS and within about three weeks or so, the error was fixed. What the vendor did not realise at that point in time was the fixing of that error meant that all cases moving forward would be correct, but it did not account for the fact that those that had been processed up to that point in time still had mismatched subsidy information. The error itself was fixed a few weeks later. So, from that time onwards, no other errors would occur. Between that time and when this was then announced, steps were taken to identify the scope of the persons who were involved, how each of them were affected – whether up or down – and the extent to which remediation would take place. And once that was determined, this was announced back in February, earlier this month."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00028,2019-03-01-T-001,28,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As far as the extent of recovery is concerned, as I had mentioned, the $2 million would cover an estimate of what it would cost to remediate this problem. As Assoc Prof Theseira appreciates, if we keep the subsidy level and honour the subsidy level despite it being erroneous, there will continue to be a degree to which further subsidies that were higher than what they were supposed to be, might be granted. And so, we are looking at all of this with the vendor and working out the sum that would approximate all of this and come to an arrangement with the vendor."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00029,2019-03-01-T-001,29,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the last question by Assoc Prof Theseira, this system still remains the most convenient because it allows there to be one avenue where the information is contained and one source at which all of these would be determined when an applicant comes and makes an application for subsidy, whether it is CHAS, long-term care or for some other subsidy schemes. So, it remains the most efficient. And the best way in which this can be fixed and to ensure that this problem does not arise again, is to really strengthen and make more resilient the way in which testing is done, either at the time migration takes place or at some stage thereafter, to continue to monitor even after it goes ""live"", as I had mentioned earlier."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00030,2019-03-01-T-001,30,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Fixing the problem at its root requires these levels of resiliency to be improved, not so much to change the system architecture altogether."
2019-03-01-T-001-S-00031,2019-03-01-T-001,31,Speaker,Order. End of Question Time. The Clerk will now proceed to read the orders of day.

2019-03-01-T-002-S-00033,2019-03-01-T-002,33,,"Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, contained in Paper Cmd 20 of 2019."
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00034,2019-03-01-T-002,34,,"I shall deal first with the Head of Expenditure in respect of which an amendment stands on the Order Paper Supplement. Head K, Ministry of Education. Assoc Prof Walter Theseira."
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00035,2019-03-01-T-002,35,,Head K –
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00036,2019-03-01-T-002,36,Walter Theseira,"Chairman, I beg to move, ""That the total sum to be allocated for Head K be reduced by $100 in respect of Code 3000.”"
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00037,2019-03-01-T-002,37,Walter Theseira,"Mr Chairman, I declare my interest as a faculty member in an Autonomous University. The Supplementary Estimates provide $300 million to the Ministry mainly to meet higher than expected endowment matching grants to the Autonomous Universities."
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00038,2019-03-01-T-002,38,Walter Theseira,"I commend the generosity of Singaporeans in donating to our Autonomous Universities. And I thank the Ministry for providing a 1.5 times matching grant for the three older Universities, and a three times matching grant for the three newer Universities."
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00039,2019-03-01-T-002,39,Walter Theseira,"However, I am concerned about how the Ministry budgets for these matching grants. While our Universities receive many donations from alumni and the public, donations are typically small. The gift of a major donor is several orders of magnitude larger than the average donation."
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00040,2019-03-01-T-002,40,Walter Theseira,"For example, in 2011 the Lee Foundation gave $150 million to fund the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine at Nanyang Technological University. The Government match was $250 million. In contrast, from 2015 to 2018, NTU’s average donations were only about $35 million a year. So, one big donation can be many times the value of total annual donations in a typical year."
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00041,2019-03-01-T-002,41,Walter Theseira,"Sir, donations can also fluctuate significantly year to year, even if there are no landmark donations. For the four years from 2015 to 2018, NTU’s donations ranged from $16 million to $53 million each year. For NUS, the range was $156 million to $276 million. So, the required matching grants from Government will also range widely."
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00042,2019-03-01-T-002,42,Walter Theseira,I am glad that the Minister for Finance discussed when closing the Budget debate how the Government works hard to ensure forecasts of revenue and expenditures are accurate.
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00043,2019-03-01-T-002,43,Walter Theseira,"First, could MOE outline how it budgets for the typical year-to-year variation in donation receipts by our AUs? Second, what is the planning process to manage the impact of a big grant on the Ministry’s budget? We have not had a billion-dollar donation to Universities yet in Singapore, but I hope we will soon. That would make a big impact to the Government Budget."
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00044,2019-03-01-T-002,44,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Chairman, the Member is right that in providing matching grants for donations raised by our Autonomous Universities (AUs), there can be large one-time payments from MOE to the AUs. That is why MOE's matching grants are supplemented by payouts by the Singapore Universities Trust (SUT). The SUT is a $2 billion trust fund that has been set up by the Government for the purpose of supporting the Enhanced Endowment Funding Model. At the same time, MOE works closely with the AUs to estimate the annual amount of matching grants required. We also plan and budget for long-term horizons, similar to what we do for other lumpy expenditure such as infrastructure spending. Where appropriate or necessary, we also spread out the Ministry's matching over a number of years."
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00045,2019-03-01-T-002,45,,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira, would you like to withdraw your amendment?"
2019-03-01-T-002-S-00046,2019-03-01-T-002,46,Walter Theseira,"Chairman, may I beg leave to withdraw my amendment. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for that detailed reply. And I thank again the Ministry for continuing to support Autonomous Universities in Singapore."

2019-03-01-T-004-S-00071,2019-03-01-T-004,71,,Minister Ng Eng Hen.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00072,2019-03-01-T-004,72,Ng Eng Hen,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. Let me thank Members for their continued commitment to a strong defence for Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00073,2019-03-01-T-004,73,Ng Eng Hen,"I note the speeches that many Members in this House have given during the Budget debate. It is particularly gratifying and reassuring for our future, for Singapore's future, that despite Defence, Security, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs accounting for one-third of our expenditure, that we have got support across the aisle, across parties. I think that is a strong signal that the future for Singapore bodes well."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00074,2019-03-01-T-004,74,Ng Eng Hen,"Last year was a busy year for Singapore. We staged a number of key events on international efforts on the world stage, and in response to Mr Vikram Nair and Ms Sylvia Lim, Singapore's image and standing, because we played host, were enhanced, but it also called for extra and stringent security measures here. In June, Members would remember that the SAF deployed at short notice – it was yes, on-off, on-off – and in two weeks, we were asked to host the US-DPRK Summit. Because such high-profile events can be attractive targets for terrorists, the SAF mounted a large-scale deployment involving 2,000 personnel, with dozens of aircraft, ships and vehicles, to provide air, land and sea security domes that covered Sentosa and parts of Orchard Road. Our efforts, together with those of the Home Team, proved a deterrent to would-be provocateurs. The SAF mounted a similar operation when Singapore hosted the ASEAN Summit in November where all the ASEAN Heads of Government and many other foreign dignitaries gathered."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00075,2019-03-01-T-004,75,Ng Eng Hen,"In October last year, MINDEF chaired the 12th ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM) and the 5th 18-member ADMM-Plus, which collectively represents four billion people and accounts for 90% of the world’s military. That meeting, we galvanised the ADMM and Plus countries to address common security concerns, including counter-terrorism and Chemical, Biological and Radiological Defence threats, and we facilitated ASEAN’s adoption of Indonesia’s “Our Eyes” Initiative. It is an initiative which can enhance regional counter-terrorism information-sharing. And Singapore will assist Indonesia to set up and operate this facility. This is an important initiative as we prepare to deal with the wave of returning fighters coming back from Iraq and Syria, even as ISIS loses ground there."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00076,2019-03-01-T-004,76,Ng Eng Hen,"I am also glad to report that under our Chairmanship, the ADMM adopted the ASEAN Guidelines for Air Military Encounters (GAME), the first such set of multilateral guidelines in the world, with the support of the Plus countries. GAME can prevent disastrous consequences that can result from unplanned encounters between military aircraft in the air. We have also worked on putting the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) – some Members asked about this, it has been put into practice across all ADMM-Plus navies, including during the inaugural ASEAN-China Maritime Exercise in October last year. Later this year, we will use CUES for the ADMM-Plus Maritime Security Exercise, which will include both the US and China. All in all, Singapore did its fair share to enhance regional security and stability. I think on that score, it was a productive and fruitful year."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00077,2019-03-01-T-004,77,Ng Eng Hen,"In the last few months though, we have had our challenges with Malaysia. Mr Seah Kian Peng had asked about this. Since last November, Malaysian government vessels have repeatedly entered Singapore’s territorial waters off Tuas, over which MPA, PCG and RSN vessels have exercised jurisdiction and enforcement without any protest or intrusions from Malaysia for more than two decades. Even now, two Malaysian government vessels continue to be anchored in our territorial waters off Tuas. Singaporeans and Members are familiar with these developments and I need not elaborate. Suffice to say, we have strongly cautioned Malaysia to withdraw their vessels. In fact, MFA’s press statement in December last year pointed out that, I will quote “Malaysia’s deployments in this area will not strengthen its legal claim and can only heighten tensions. Malaysia will be responsible for any untoward situations on the ground that arise from continued deployment of its vessels into this area.” And indeed, just as we warned could happen, last month, the Greek bulk carrier Pireas collided with the Malaysian government vessel Polaris. Mercifully, no bodily harm ensued, but it could have been much worse."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00078,2019-03-01-T-004,78,Ng Eng Hen,"Singaporeans will remember the collision between the USS McCain and the oil tanker Alnic off Pedra Branca in August 2017, where 10 crewmen perished. Even so, some in Malaysia have accused Singapore of orchestrating the collision with the Polaris. These false accusations would have been much louder and strident to push for retaliation against Singapore and Singaporeans, if lives had been lost in the recent collision."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00079,2019-03-01-T-004,79,Ng Eng Hen,"Our MFA and MOT officials are meeting for discussions and negotiations and the presence of these Malaysian government vessels does not help in any way, and in fact exposes them to danger and obstruct productive talks. The MPA, the PCG and the RSN are closely monitoring activities in Singapore’s territorial waters off Tuas 24/7, and will remain ever vigilant to guard our sovereignty and rights under international law."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00080,2019-03-01-T-004,80,Ng Eng Hen,"MINDEF will continue its efforts in defence diplomacy. Members have asked that, including Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Vikram Nair. We want to promote regional peace and stability. We make friends with those who are willing, and partner those countries whose interests are aligned with ours and who share our desire for inclusiveness, peaceful resolution of disputes and respect for the law."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00081,2019-03-01-T-004,81,Ng Eng Hen,"But at the same time, we must ensure that the SAF is strong and adequate to defend our rights when diplomacy fails and when others choose to do us harm or ignore our rights. As Prof Fatimah Lateef said, ""A strong SAF protects Singapore and Singaporeans."" And it has been our persistent investments and efforts to build the Next-Generation SAF that can better respond to the security threats for another generation. These developments are progressing well and I would like to elaborate on that, because many Members of Parliament has asked, how do we respond to different scenarios of threats that will come upon us in this generation? And we have to prepare for the future because it takes that period of time to build up that kind of SAF."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00082,2019-03-01-T-004,82,Ng Eng Hen,"First, homeland security. The Mumbai attack in 2008 showed us the devastating destruction that can come from the sea, and we are surrounded by seas. To deter and mitigate external attacks against Singapore, we will beef up security for our entire coastline. The SAF will add more optical sensors and coastal radars to deter and detect potential threats. We will build more unmanned watch towers for better coverage of the busy traffic across the Singapore Strait. We will also add unmanned surface vessels to patrol our waters, beginning next year."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00083,2019-03-01-T-004,83,Ng Eng Hen,"Members have asked for more details on our modernisation of the Next-Generation SAF – Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Pritam Singh, Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr Chong Kee Hiong and Mr Charles Chong – so let me elaborate. Our plans to build the Next-Generation SAF to better respond to security threats are progressing well for all three services. With your permission, Mr Chairman, I would like to display some slides on the LED screens and also ask for the handout to be distributed."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00084,2019-03-01-T-004,84,,Please do. [
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00085,2019-03-01-T-004,85,Ng Eng Hen,"Let me begin with the air. Mr Henry Kwek has asked about the F-35s. We have announced our plans to replace the F-16s, which will face obsolescence post-2030, with the F-35s. This will mean that the RSAF fighter fleet will consist of F-35s and F-15SGs, if plans come to fruition a decade or so from now."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00086,2019-03-01-T-004,86,Ng Eng Hen,"As stated previously, MINDEF will issue a Letter of Request (LOR) to the US to acquire F-35s. As required by US law for foreign military sales, the US Congress must approve the sale of F-35s. Our LOR will request an initial acquisition of four F-35s, with the option of a subsequent eight if we decide to proceed. Singapore has the endorsement of both the US Administration and the Department of Defense for our proposed purchase of F-35s. But the Congress must still approve it. In fact, President Trump wrote to Prime Minister Lee last month welcoming Singapore's plans to acquire the F-35. During my meeting with Acting Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan at the Munich Security Conference two weeks ago, he also said that the US was greatly appreciative of Singapore's decision and his department supported it."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00087,2019-03-01-T-004,87,Ng Eng Hen,"A word on price. The price of F-35s has been steadily falling due to healthy orders from the US and 10 other countries, including the UK, Italy, Australia, Japan and South Korea. DSTA's assessment is that now is an opportune time to put in Singapore's request. The current unit price of the F-35 ranges from US$90 million to US$115 million per aircraft, comparable to what we have paid for our F-15SGs. The Total Cost of Ownership of a fleet of F-35s, including maintenance across its lifespan, will also be similar to our F-15SGs. Nonetheless, MINDEF will continue to work with the US Department of Defense to optimise operating and maintenance costs."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00088,2019-03-01-T-004,88,Ng Eng Hen,The RSAF will also take delivery of new helicopters from 2020 onwards. The H225M medium-lift and our Chinook heavy-lift helicopters will replace our existing Super Puma and CH-47D fleets. These new helicopters will add capacity and be more effective in Search and Rescue or Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief operations.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00089,2019-03-01-T-004,89,Ng Eng Hen,That is for the Air Force. Let me move on to the Navy.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00090,2019-03-01-T-004,90,Ng Eng Hen,"For the RSN, our submarines in operation are over two decades old. We will replace them with four new Invincible-class submarines. The first was launched recently in Germany, with the other three being built. The Invincible-class submarines will have longer endurance, and also the latest locally-developed sensors and automated systems designed for optimal use in our surrounding waters. We have launched our submarines lately in Kiel facing the North Sea. We launched our previous class of submarines in the Baltic Sea. Those waters there are much colder. So, we have to optimise them for our warm waters here. We aim to have a full fleet of four Invincible-class submarines by 2025."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00091,2019-03-01-T-004,91,Ng Eng Hen,"For surface ships, our ageing missile corvettes, have served with distinction since 1989. They are also ""Pioneer Generation"" that will have to be retired soon, and they will be replaced by the new Multi-Role Combat Vessels (MRCVs). The first of these will be delivered around 2025, with full delivery expected by 2030. More than just improving capabilities, the new Multi-Role Combat Vessels will incorporate many new ideas. First of all, they will use less manpower. I think many Members of Parliament have pointed out, how we will deal with the one-third reduction in manpower? The MRCVs will use less manpower, about half the size of that found in modern frigates. This is quite an achievement. This is possible because we designed it from the onset, custom-built for lean manning, using technologies which automate many functions, including maintenance."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00092,2019-03-01-T-004,92,Ng Eng Hen,"As a result, there is also a cost saving of up to 10% in operating them, compared to other similar-sized frigates. The Multi-Role Combat Vessels will also have more unmanned air and sea drones, so it would not be just a manned ship, it will have air and sea drones and modular packages to extend their reach and flexibility against threats. Many Members are familiar with our LSTs or Landing Ship Tanks. I think many of you have sailed on them and they proved their worth time and again. Each time we deploy them in exercises, we say we are so grateful that we have this platform. So versatile and able to meet mission objectives. It has been the workhorse in our HADR efforts and othe other missions. The LSTs are ageing too, and will need to be replaced in the next decade by larger and more flexible Joint Multi-Mission Ships."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00093,2019-03-01-T-004,93,Ng Eng Hen,Let me move on to the Army.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00094,2019-03-01-T-004,94,Ng Eng Hen,"For the Army, the Next-Generation Armoured Fighting Vehicle will replace our M113 Ultras as the mainstay of the SAF's mechanised forces from this year onward. Singaporeans will see them soon on our roads at this year's National Day Parade. These Armoured Fighting Vehicles have better armour protection and mobility through urban environments. Another addition to the Army will be the Next-Generation Howitzers with extended range and greater precision strikes compared to our current platforms."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00095,2019-03-01-T-004,95,Ng Eng Hen,"I have talked about air, land and sea manned platforms, but the signature change, for the SAF 2030 and beyond, is that the SAF will become more of a hybrid force. We will use many more unmanned platforms. Some of the RSAF's unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been operating for more than a decade. They will be replaced by newer UAVs with better capabilities over the next few years. I mentioned the MRCVs and unmanned surface vessels too. But in the Army, soldiers within the Army will soon use micro-UAVs, your own UAV or the UAV for your unit, for the first time, which will be particularly useful in built-up and urban environments. These unmanned platforms will complement traditional manned equipment, to enhance responses across a full range of operational scenarios."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00096,2019-03-01-T-004,96,Ng Eng Hen,"In all, the Next-Generation SAF of 2030 and beyond, with this full complement of assets in air, land and sea, will be able to defend Singapore for another generation. This is the SAF that will take us into and guard our future. This is the SAF that our investments have bought or will buy. This is the SAF on air, land and sea with which the next generation of Singaporeans will celebrate for SG75."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00097,2019-03-01-T-004,97,Ng Eng Hen,"By then, we will have a state-of-the-art coastal surveillance network and air defence systems to form a shield around Singapore against incoming threats. The RSAF will fly F-35s and F-15SGs over our skies, supported by A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport aircraft, G550 Airborne Early Warning Aircraft, new helicopters and a host of new UAVs. The RSN will have Multi-Role Combat Vessels, Invincible-class submarines, new unmanned surface vessels and larger Joint Multi-Mission Ships, in addition to existing frigates and Littoral Mission Vessels. The Army will be more protected and mobile, with soldiers mounted in Next-Generation Armoured Fighting Vehicles and Terrex Motorised Vehicles. Leopard tanks, HIMARS and Next-Generation Howitzers will support them, complemented by a full suite of combat engineers, signals, logistics and maintenance platforms."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00098,2019-03-01-T-004,98,Ng Eng Hen,"But hardware alone, would not build you a strong army and a strong military. We will have to have new training facilities both here and overseas which will ensure that our NSmen and Regulars can build a modern and capable SAF that can defend Singapore and our interests. I know Members here have asked that, Mr Zainal Sapari, amongst others."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00099,2019-03-01-T-004,99,Ng Eng Hen,"The SAF of 2030 and beyond has been designed to be operated with a leaner manpower pool. Mr Baey Yam Keng, Mr Chong Kee Hiong, Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Pritam Singh asked about this. In other words, we design the SAF of 2030 and beyond to work with a reduction of manpower supply by a third after 2030. I have already mentioned the MRCVs for the Navy which need a smaller crew."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00100,2019-03-01-T-004,100,Ng Eng Hen,"The Next-Generation Howitzer which I mentioned earlier, will only need three men to operate, compared to nine now; so it is a significant reduction, and yet the Next-Generation Howitzer will fire more rounds accurately per minute. Autonomous and automated systems will reduce labour-intensive tasks, for example, runway damage assessment of our air bases and air strips. The modern systems and platforms of the SAF can also be operated by NSmen who are not PES A or B, and therefore effectively increase our utilisation of manpower pool. Pari passu with the acquisition of hardware, we will also invest more into training facilities for SAF soldiers."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00101,2019-03-01-T-004,101,Ng Eng Hen,"I last spoke to this House about SAFTI City in 2017. The Pioneer and Merdeka Generation are all too familiar with the old SAFTI – you would remember FOFO Hill, Pengkang Hill, the Pasir Laba Boat Shed and Elephant Hill. We charged up them and sometimes charged down them. SAFTI City will complement these traditional terrains with urban settings to better prepare our soldiers for a wide variety of operations in the 21st century. SAFTI City will be a wired city. We talked about our SMART City, we are hoping that SAFTI City will be a smart training ground."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00102,2019-03-01-T-004,102,Ng Eng Hen,"We will use more simulation and detailed monitoring to help our soldiers to learn better. It will be a far cry from the days that we did our NS and charged uphills or against enemy battalions shouting, ""Bang, bang, bang, bang!"" And they shouted, ""Bang, bang, bang, bang!"" back."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00103,2019-03-01-T-004,103,Ng Eng Hen,"This method is not new. For instance, our fighter pilots have been using this for decades to train for high-speed manouvers. After every manoeuvre, they sit down and say, ""Alright, you say what you did, he says what he did."" This is the objective. They showed the tracks, they showed where your weaknesses are. And they have been able to do that because planes are expensive and pilots even more so. But it is only now that modern technology allows us to scale this up for the same processes for individual soldiers within the Army."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00104,2019-03-01-T-004,104,Ng Eng Hen,"So, we have been doing this over the years where you can no longer assume that you have hit the target, and you actually have electric sensors on soldiers, on platforms, and the attrition rate is real. And I am glad to report that SAFTI City is taking shape and on schedule. We will build more roads and bridges so that motorised and mechanised troops in the Army vehicles can start training this year. SAFTI City will be progressively built and will have more than 200 buildings of varying heights and types when completed, all wired up."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00105,2019-03-01-T-004,105,Ng Eng Hen,"But with this kind of SAF for 2030 and beyond which can move great distances. Our Terrexes can move 70 km/h, and our Leopards close to that – slower perhaps across more difficult terrain. But if we only had space to train in Singapore, you could reach one end to the other within less than an hour. So, we will need larger training spaces. In particular, the training areas at Shoalwater Bay will be expanded. There will be new developments in Townsville Region in Northeast Australia. Under the Singapore-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, new facilities, such as Instrumented Combined Arms Air Land Ranges and Urban Operations Live-Firing Facilities, are on track to being built. I said that very quickly, but an air-land range is priceless. We can only do this in very few places now – some in the US because they have the land. It allows for coordinated strikes between land and air platforms. So, when these facilities are completed over the coming years, we will be able to train large groups of troops for up to 18 weeks annually, a significant increase from the current six to seven weeks, about a three-fold increase."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00106,2019-03-01-T-004,106,Ng Eng Hen,"Many Members have talked about digital defence. I completely agree. It is a battle front that we cannot choose to ignore or we ignore it at our peril. I think Mr Charles Chong, Mr Desmond Choo, Prof Fatimah Lateef and Mr Tan Wu Meng have spoken about this. I spoke to this House about the threat of hybrid warfare and its effect on the real world previously. We have seen this played out against the Baltic States and Ukraine, to name some. And as a culturally and ethnically diverse nation, we, too, are vulnerable to such hybrid attacks, including targeting of our IT networks to disrupt services and capabilities."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00107,2019-03-01-T-004,107,Ng Eng Hen,"Members have asked what is our progress of protecting this front and building up a force to protect this front. Two years ago, I announced the set-up of the Defence Cyber Organisation (DCO). DCO has stood up the Defence Cyber Security Centre. In other words, we have this defence cybersecurity centre within MINDEF and the SAF for daily operations against cyber threats against MINDEF and SAF IT systems, especially our command and control computer networks. In place are incident response teams which can also be deployed to support other national agencies during cyberattacks on critical systems."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00108,2019-03-01-T-004,108,Ng Eng Hen,"To meet these needs, the SAF has to expand the pool of regulars for the cyber domain, and they will be Military Domain Experts Scheme (MDES) personnel, as well as the non-uniformed Defence Cyber Experts. We have recently announced that more than 300 will be hired in the first phase."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00109,2019-03-01-T-004,109,Ng Eng Hen,"But NSFs, too, can play an important part in digital defence, just as they do for kinetic operations. I think that was the point by Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Vikram Nair. The 59-strong pioneer batch of the Cyber NSF Scheme enlisted in late 2018 after passing two rounds of rigorous tests. They are now undergoing an eight-month-long Cyber Specialist Cadet Course, in partnership with the Singapore Institute of Technology, and will graduate this August. We expect to take in another 80 to 90 Cyber Specialists this year to beef up our cyber units."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00110,2019-03-01-T-004,110,Ng Eng Hen,"Just as we have done for kinetic operations – many of you are familiar with our SAF firing ranges, many of you have fired there. Well, we have a cyber range as well – the Cyber Defence Test and Evaluation Centre. In this cyber range, our cyber soldiers are exposed to realistic training. We have created a mock-up, a simulation of the SAF’s networks and online traffic, and we use actual malware and attacks against these nodes. Like in live firing ranges – you are supposed to shoot straight – the SAF aims to train soldiers that can respond to these attacks in a realistic and challenging environment."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00111,2019-03-01-T-004,111,Ng Eng Hen,The SAF will also tap on NSmen with IT expertise as a result of their civilian jobs or training. One example is the existing NS Expertise Conversion Scheme. It allows non-officer NSmen with industry expertise to become MDES officers for cyber vocations. MINDEF and the SAF are exploring better matching of NSmen with their civilian IT vocations.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00112,2019-03-01-T-004,112,Ng Eng Hen,"All of us have a part to play in Digital Defence for Total Defence. In Singapore’s digital fortress, we are only as strong as the weakest link, and Senior Minister of State Dr Maliki will share more."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00113,2019-03-01-T-004,113,Ng Eng Hen,"These acquisitions in hardware and facilities, together with the will and skills of our NSmen and NSFs that make up the bulk of the SAF, will put us in a good position to deal with security challenges for another generation. If all these plans come to pass – and I will add that it will take us 10 to 15 years – the SAF will be one of the more capable militaries in the region."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00114,2019-03-01-T-004,114,Ng Eng Hen,"Our NSFs and NSmen will be able to train well and, most importantly, must train safely. The Inspector-General for Safety has been recently appointed, and the office expanded with more safety officers. A number of Members talked about safety – Mr Charles Chong, Mr Chong Kee Hiong, Mr Zainal Sapari. The Commanding Officers of individual units have also been charged with the responsibility and accountability of safety standards and outcomes. As a routine, the Commanding Officer will identify activities each day that pose higher safety risks to his servicemen and women, and satisfy himself that the safety response plan and mitigating measures for such activities are adequate. Safety is, more than ever, a command responsibility, but each soldier must play his role, too. And we are doing this so that we can have realistic training because, if you cannot train safely, you will be set back. Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How will address in greater detail the measures the SAF will take to achieve zero training fatalities."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00115,2019-03-01-T-004,115,Ng Eng Hen,"MINDEF has also decided to build a central facility to better respond to the needs of the NS community. A new National Service (NS) Hub will be built. It will bring together different services which are now scattered across Singapore. For example, today, pre-enlistees take their IPPT at, say, Toa Payoh Stadium, then go to Depot Road Central Manpower Base, and then attend medical reviews at the Military Medicine Institute (MMI) in Kent Ridge. The new NS Hub will take all these services scattered across the island and put them into a central location. Where is this magical central location? It will be opposite Cashew MRT Station, with easy access. The NS Hub will be built as a smart complex using modern technology for a seamless, user-friendly experience. Opposite Cashew MRT Station in MINDEF land. Do not worry, we will not take it from anybody. Construction will begin this year, and our national servicemen can look forward to their NS Hub by 2023."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00116,2019-03-01-T-004,116,Ng Eng Hen,Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How will elaborate on the other measures to enhance the NS experience.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00117,2019-03-01-T-004,117,Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Chairman, let me conclude. To develop such a capable SAF that I have just described, which can protect Singapore’s interests and keep Singaporeans safe for another generation, will require significant and steady investments. I make no bones about it. It will require resources and our commitment. I am grateful to Members of this House and Singaporeans for their steadfast and unwavering support towards a strong SAF."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00118,2019-03-01-T-004,118,Ng Eng Hen,"As I have previously committed to this House, we expect our nominal defence spending over the next decade to grow at 3%-4% each year, to at least keep pace with inflation. This year's Budget represented a 4.8% increase over last year. The commitment that I have put over the next decade of 3% to 4% holds despite this year's increase. There were just certain projects or acquisitions that have matured and, therefore, we have to spend more. However, the overall Defence expenditure will even out in subsequent years."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00119,2019-03-01-T-004,119,Ng Eng Hen,"Defence, especially for a small island like Singapore is crucial, if we are to safeguard our interests and deter aggression. Singapore is on track to build a modernised tri-service SAF – and perhaps even a quadri-service SAF, including the cyber force – that can meet security challenges both in the real and virtual worlds in the 21st century. If we continue our steady investments into defence and our NSmen maintain their commitment and resolve to defend Singapore, then our future will be secure for another generation. We can look forward to celebrate SG75 with the assurance that we have strong defences. Thank you."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00120,2019-03-01-T-004,120,,Senior of State Heng Chee How.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00121,2019-03-01-T-004,121,Heng Chee How,"Mr Chairman, Minister for Defence Dr Ng has just spoken about the need for national servicemen to train well and to train safely. Indeed, the strength of National Service (NS) is contingent upon the fighting spirit of our national servicemen. Our servicemen must undergo tough and realistic military training for the SAF to be an effective fighting force capable of safeguarding Singapore’s sovereignty. At the same time, a strong SAF that can defend Singapore must be built without compromising the safety of those serving."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00122,2019-03-01-T-004,122,Heng Chee How,"Mr Charles Chong asked about balancing operational readiness and safety. We understand the anxiety of our soldiers and their families arising from the recent training-related incidents. MINDEF and the SAF take the trust, confidence and expectations that Singaporeans have in our NS system seriously."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00123,2019-03-01-T-004,123,Heng Chee How,"The SAF’s safety protocols are audited and assessed by independent professionals from outside the SAF. This is done consistently. Allow me to share two examples. The External Review Panel on SAF Safety (ERPSS) is a standing panel commissioned to assess the SAF’s safety management systems and help ensure that the SAF’s standards and processes are sound and aligned with industry best practices. More recently, the External Review Panels for Heat Injury Management (ERPHIM) and the External Review Panel for Combat Vehicle Safety (ERPCVS) were convened in 2018. They assessed the safety procedures to prevent heat injuries and to ensure the operational safety of vehicles. Where shortcomings are discovered, the SAF has and will sharpen safety measures to further reduce the risks and to prevent recurrences."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00124,2019-03-01-T-004,124,Heng Chee How,"Just as a further point, the Army will strengthen training supervision and enhance safety equipment to improve combat vehicle safety. These and other specific measures that we shared in this House, we will implement them as soon as possible, and some have already been implemented. This demonstrates our unwavering commitment to safety."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00125,2019-03-01-T-004,125,Heng Chee How,"We will not only address individual incidents but will seek to enhance training safety at every level of responsibility. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim asked about how the SAF is strengthening safety culture at all levels of the SAF. As the Minister for Defence has highlighted earlier, an Inspector-General Office has been set up to inspect and audit the safety practices across the SAF. This Office, led by the Chief of Staff – Joint Staff, reports to the Chief of Defence Force and the Permanent Secretary of Defence to enforce safety procedures and to reinforce safety consciousness and culture from the highest level so as to ensure that command emphasis on safety is consistently applied."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00126,2019-03-01-T-004,126,Heng Chee How,"On the ground, the SAF has renewed the focus of commanders on safety. Commanders have comprehensively reviewed safety management plans and the overall training tempo. They know that they must lead by example in driving safety as a topmost priority. The Army will also ensure 100% inspection of all high-risk and field training. We want, through concrete action, to reassure Singaporeans that training safety is a top priority for MINDEF and the SAF."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00127,2019-03-01-T-004,127,Heng Chee How,"Ultimately, safety involves this, everything that I have mentioned, but it also involves more than sound systems and top-down measures. Safety must be part of our organisational culture, one that every soldier at every level has a role to own, to build and to foster."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00128,2019-03-01-T-004,128,Heng Chee How,"The SAF encourages open reporting. Mr Charles Chong asked about this. What does it mean by open reporting? Open reporting means that any servicemen can, at any time, report risky behaviour or near-misses and safety breaches. And the servicemen know that they can do so without any fear of penalty. They can call the 24-hour safety hotlines for the Army, Navy and the Air Force, and caller identities are kept anonymous. There are other measures by which they can also surface the feedback. So, the open reporting is about wanting to engender and to ensure openness in the culture; that you are encourage indeed, to bring this up."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00129,2019-03-01-T-004,129,Heng Chee How,"On enlistment day, recruits are briefed by commanders on how they can report safety breaches. Prior to training, soldiers can identify safety risks using risk assessment checklists and raise concerns to their superiors in a small group setting. This encourages them to look out for their own and their buddies’ safety."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00130,2019-03-01-T-004,130,Heng Chee How,"Since last year, the SAF has been developing an application called ""SafeGuardian"", which will allow SAF servicemen to use their mobile phones to report workplace hazards and instantly share them with other servicemen. So, when servicemen are in camp, they notice, for example, some sharp wire fittings that could potentially cause injury, then that serviceman can take a photo of that using the ""SafeGuardian"" app and inform the relevant SAF safety officers, so that immediate action can be taken to remove that hazard and to remove that risk. Their buddies nearby will also be informed via safety alerts to their mobile phones."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00131,2019-03-01-T-004,131,Heng Chee How,"""SafeGuardian"" can also provide access to safety checklists on-the-go, compared to the moment where these forms are only available in physical terminals within the camps."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00132,2019-03-01-T-004,132,Heng Chee How,"So, this app will begin its trial in our Naval Bases starting from March this year. It will be implemented in phases to the rest of the SAF as soon as possible."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00133,2019-03-01-T-004,133,Heng Chee How,"This effort will help enhance a safety consciousness and reinforce the point that safety is ""By All, For All""."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00134,2019-03-01-T-004,134,Heng Chee How,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked if we could recognise fallen servicemen, including erecting a memorial. The SAF honours our servicemen and women who die in service. Every year, the SAF observes a minute of silence at the SAF Day Parade to remember our fallen soldiers in the presence of our President or the Prime Minister as the Reviewing Officer. Individual units or formations also hold remembrance events to honour those among their ranks who perish during operations or training. We will never forget their sacrifice to keep Singapore free from those who want to do us harm."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00135,2019-03-01-T-004,135,Heng Chee How,"On this note, we also want to thank all our national servicemen for their commitment and dedication. Allow me now to speak on how we will enhance the experience for our national servicemen."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00136,2019-03-01-T-004,136,Heng Chee How,Mr Zainal Sapari asked about the importance of NS to Singapore. Securing Singapore’s freedom is a sacred duty shouldered by our national servicemen. It is only right that we continually think of ways to support them.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00137,2019-03-01-T-004,137,Heng Chee How,"Our national servicemen have to balance personal and NS commitments, and we must strive to increase convenience for them by reducing administrative burdens wherever possible. This will help them focus on the training. We will also maximise the potential and tap into the abilities of our increasingly better-educated pool of servicemen, so that they can contribute even more meaningfully. Mr Baey Yam Keng had asked for updates on our efforts."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00138,2019-03-01-T-004,138,Heng Chee How,"Our Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) are required to notify the MINDEF Notification Centre (MNC) and Home Team Overseas Notification Centre (ONC) of their overseas travel of less than six months' duration, which can currently be done via the NS Portal or by text. From 1 March today, we will remove this notification requirement. Servicemen just have to keep their contact details, including temporary contact information, updated on the NS Portal."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00139,2019-03-01-T-004,139,Heng Chee How,"Removing this requirement will not compromise operational readiness, because other exit control measures, such as the requirement to apply for an Exit Permit before traveling overseas for periods of six months or longer, will continue to apply. Control measures could be tightened if the need arises."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00140,2019-03-01-T-004,140,Heng Chee How,Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked how we intend to maximise our manpower resource with falling cohort sizes. How can we do more with fewer?
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00141,2019-03-01-T-004,141,Heng Chee How,"Besides better technology, equipment, process and job redesign and training of the NSmen, many NSmen also have very relevant and important niche civilian expertise in fields that are relevant both to the civilian side as well as to the military. For example, nursing or info-communications. NSmen with such expertise can now contribute to defence with their civilian expertise earlier in their Operationally-Ready NS training cycle. Previously, they had to complete the full 10-year training cycle before conversion to a role that allows them to utilise their civilian expertise. Now, if they are found suitable, they can be deployed to roles such as nursing officers and network communications officers after completing two High-Key In-Camp Training stints and have served five ORNS years."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00142,2019-03-01-T-004,142,Heng Chee How,"Another example  pre-enlistees are screened at the SAF Medical Classification Centre prior to enlistment. They will then be assigned an appropriate Physical Employment Standard (PES) grade, so that each person can serve the nation based on his capacity and capabilities, and this would include NSFs with disabilities. For instance, soldiers with hearing impairment or musculoskeletal disabilities, where found suitable, are assigned to support or administrative vocations, where they are deployed safely and are able to also contribute very meaningfully during their NS stints."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00143,2019-03-01-T-004,143,Heng Chee How,"We certainly also value the contributions from women to national defence. Since 2014, women have served in the SAF Volunteer Corps (SAFVC), in areas that support the SAF’s operational and training requirements. Our pool of SAF volunteers comprises a good mix of males and females, with about half being women."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00144,2019-03-01-T-004,144,Heng Chee How,"Mr Arasu Duraisamy asked about our partnerships to support skills upgrading. Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) from the SAF and the Home Team dedicate two years to focus on full-time training. Today, certain soldiering, fire-fighting and rescue competencies are accredited under the Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) standard."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00145,2019-03-01-T-004,145,Heng Chee How,"To keep pace with the national focus on skills mastery, we seek to support the NSFs’ transition to higher education or into the workplace. A suite of initiatives called ""SkillsFuture@NS"" will be launched this year with public and private sector partners."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00146,2019-03-01-T-004,146,Heng Chee How,"What can our NSFs, therefore, look forward to under these partnerships?"
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00147,2019-03-01-T-004,147,Heng Chee How,"First, more resources for skills upgrading after full-time NS. Today, NSFs are granted $350 worth of e-credits for them to subscribe to about 200 online courses – that is the course list – and these courses are offered by our local universities and polytechnics. These e-credits are valid up to one year after they complete full-time NS."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00148,2019-03-01-T-004,148,Heng Chee How,"We will extend the use of these credits to about 3,000 selected courses – up from the 200 – and amongst these courses will be a good number of SkillsFuture Series courses that focus on emerging domains such as data analytics and cybersecurity. We are also working with Institutes of Higher Learning to offer customised courses. NSFs may take these courses to obtain credit exemptions from relevant diploma or degree programmes after they complete their full-time NS. E-credits can also be used for these courses."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00149,2019-03-01-T-004,149,Heng Chee How,"For example, NSFs can use their e-credits to take a course on ""Introduction to Cloud Architecture"" that is offered by the Temasek Polytechnic (TP). Upon admission to TP’s part-time Specialist Diploma in Cloud Data Centre Technology and Management, participants who complete these online courses will be granted partial exemption from one module. This will go some way toward supporting our NSFs’ learning journey."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00150,2019-03-01-T-004,150,Heng Chee How,"Second, career discovery and exposure. This month, MINDEF/SAF will co-deliver a career orientation experience with SkillsFuture Singapore. This initiative is supported by our five Community Development Councils and the NTUC Employment and Employability Institute (e2i). SkillsFuture Advice workshops will be customised at the quarterly Career and Education Fair held for NSFs."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00151,2019-03-01-T-004,151,Heng Chee How,"We conducted a pilot of this career orientation workshop at Jurong Camp. One of our combat engineers, 21-year-old Corporal Ritesh Kumar, said the workshop helped him understand the various pathways available after he completes his full-time NS. He felt that this gave him and his buddies more useful guidance about their next stage in life. We will take in our servicemen’s feedback and suggestions to refine and improve the SkillsFuture@NS effort in the years ahead."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00152,2019-03-01-T-004,152,Heng Chee How,"Next, strengthening support for NS. Mr Henry Kwek asked about our plans to engage the community on NS issues. First, I want to express our thanks to ACCORD members for their valuable contributions toward the mission of working with educational institutions, businesses and community groups to strengthen community and total support for our defence and National Service."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00153,2019-03-01-T-004,153,Heng Chee How,"One of the highlights through the good work of ACCORD in 2018 was the inaugural Women’s Boot Camp. One hundred and three women out of 1,000 were selected for the camp. So, 1,000 applied for 100 places. So, in the end, 103 were accommodated for this two-day one night camp, so, it is an overnight camp. That camp gave the women participants whom I understand have ages that range from 13 to 64, so it is a wide range. Therefore, in there, there are daughters, mothers, sisters, wives, girlfriends, friends of servicemen, and what they got was a glimpse of military life. They came out seeing NS as tough, but necessary."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00154,2019-03-01-T-004,154,Heng Chee How,"One of them is 50-year-old Ms Koh Wee Min; she is a mother of one of our NSFs. When asked about her experience, Ms Koh said that it gave her a taste of some aspects of military life through participation in iconic NS activities such as clearing the Standard Obstacle Course. She said, ""I can now support my son emotionally and psychologically. It will also allay some concerns I have about training safety as I could see that safety is paramount to their training. It is reassuring to know that servicemen will get progressive training before they tackle more challenging tasks."""
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00155,2019-03-01-T-004,155,Heng Chee How,"This year, we will run another camp, so as to continue to engage our community and also this very important constituency, namely the other half of our population – the women – so that together, we can strengthen this support for NS and for the defence of our country."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00156,2019-03-01-T-004,156,Heng Chee How,"Our servicemen have told us that sharing photographs of their NS experiences in camp would also help them build a stronger sense of community. MINDEF and SAF have been exploring ways to allow servicemen to share their personal NS memories and experiences online, while safeguarding security of sensitive information."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00157,2019-03-01-T-004,157,Heng Chee How,"We are now working on a digital repository called ""NS Memories"" that will give NSmen access to official photographs of themselves and their buddies. Over time, the repository will catalogue the experiences throughout the NS journey. It will allow servicemen to share these photographs on their social media. We will conduct a trial with an active infantry unit for ""NS Memories"" this year. If proven successful, we will expand the initiative."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00158,2019-03-01-T-004,158,Heng Chee How,"Mr Chairman, the success of NS is measured by the peace safeguarded and maintained – day in, day out, year after year. Every day of peace that Singapore enjoys is testament to the effectiveness of our deterrence, diplomacy and defence. With a strong and resilient NS system that enjoys wide and deep public support, we can continue to be confident about Singapore’s future. Thank you."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00159,2019-03-01-T-004,159,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Chairman, Minister for Defence Dr Ng has spoken about the uncertain and volatile geopolitical environment that confronts us, and how a strong SAF is vital to help us navigate this landscape for Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00160,2019-03-01-T-004,160,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,History has shown us that having a strong defence makes all the difference. This is why our long-term and sustained investment in the SAF and Total Defence is vital for Singapore’s continued security and prosperity.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00161,2019-03-01-T-004,161,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"When Total Defence was first introduced in 1984, it was in response to a threat landscape where warfare was very much conventional. However, even then, there was recognition that potential aggressors would target not just the military, but the entire population."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00162,2019-03-01-T-004,162,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"As threats evolve, Total Defence becomes even more critical. Take terrorism for example. The face of terrorism has changed, from kinetic attacks spearheaded by Al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah (JI) in the early 2000s, to ISIS’ more insidious attempts to radicalise and recruit followers through the use of technology and social media, to deepen distrust between communities and sow discontent with the establishment. They even fund and instruct their members and sympathisers to launch terror attacks like suicide bombings in their own countries. ISIS may have lost ground in the Middle East, but links to our region remain alive. The return of foreign fighters exacerbates this threat."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00163,2019-03-01-T-004,163,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"In this age of the internet and social media, the resilience of Singaporeans will be tested through attacks from the digital front. This will be the new battlefront because of how connected we are, and how reliant we are on digital technology to communicate and to consume information. Singapore has one of the highest levels of internet penetration in the world, and according to a study done by media company “We Are Social” in 2018, people in Singapore spent an average of two hours daily on social media, with WhatsApp, YouTube and Facebook being the top three most used platforms. Sir, our connectivity opens us to threats from the digital domain, which will confront and define this generation. Many examples in Singapore and overseas illustrate the devastating impact that these threats can wreak."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00164,2019-03-01-T-004,164,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The Digital Dangers and the Need for Strong Digital Defence. Sir, for example, Estonia was one of the first countries in the world to experience this in April 2007 when a cyberattack caused online services of their banks, media outlets and government to be shut down. Citizens could not access cash machines and online banking services; news could not be printed nor broadcasted. More than 10 years on, cyberattacks in various forms remain a tool for those who would do harm to us."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00165,2019-03-01-T-004,165,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Another example, in July 2018, more recently, the Alaskan borough of Matanuska-Susitna or Mat-su, was, as a BBC article describes, sent “back in time” by a malware attack which forced them offline, resulting in some borough staff having to bring out old typewriters just to keep services going."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00166,2019-03-01-T-004,166,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Another challenge is how quickly information – and disinformation – can spread over the digital domain. The recent riots that broke out at a Hindu temple in Subang Jaya, Malaysia showed how the spread of rumours and fake news via social media just overnight could fan the flames of racial tensions, and incite social unrest. As Ms Joan Pereira noted, it is important for us to keep our Social Defence strong, so we stay united against any attempts to divide us. All communities and faiths have worked hard to build our multicultural and multi-religious society today. We must not let falsehoods pit different social groups against one another."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00167,2019-03-01-T-004,167,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Many of these digital dangers show that complacency, ignorance or negligence on the part of individuals could pave the way for an attack with disastrous consequences. A January 2019 report by NATO’s Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence outlined how their researchers managed to track and trick NATO troops using open source data primarily from social media. It was concerning how it was so easy for the researchers to identify troops, locate their battalions, persuade them to abandon their posts and reveal sensitive details about military manoeuvres. This example shows how much people take their online lives for granted, and are unaware about how the seemingly innocuous information they post about their lives can be used for harm – not just for themselves, but for the wider society."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00168,2019-03-01-T-004,168,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"And Singapore is not spared. We know how hackers stole the information of 1.5 million SingHealth patients. We have also seen the spread of fake news on a wide range of matters, for example, plastic rice or Halal pork, to more insidiously, false accounts of incidents that could inflame xenophobia, communalism, and puncture social harmony."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00169,2019-03-01-T-004,169,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"This is why we have strengthened Total Defence with a new Digital Defence pillar. Ms Joan Pereira and Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about our Digital Defence efforts. We want to bring across the message that every individual is at the forefront of Digital Defence, and this is not a cliché. It is of great significance, and as articulated in an editorial in The Straits Times, and I quote, “every citizen is a soldier in the digital war”. Unquote. Only if everyone plays a part – the Government, businesses, communities and individuals – can we make Digital Defence a part of Singapore’s DNA, and keep our defence total."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00170,2019-03-01-T-004,170,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"As a whole-of-nation effort, MINDEF has been working with various Government agencies to fortify Singapore and Singaporeans against digital threats. MCI and its agencies, the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the National Library Board (NLB) have in place various programmes to empower individuals, businesses and the wider community, so they can play a part by being secure, alert and responsible online. In MHA, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) has developed further its capabilities to deal with cybercrime, and educates the public on staying safe in cyberspace. As Dr Ng spoke about earlier, we have strengthened our defence sector networks through setting up the Defence Cyber Organisation (DCO), and ensuring that we have a strong core and pipeline of people with the right skills and expertise to do this work."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00171,2019-03-01-T-004,171,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We will also ensure that our Servicemen are prepared for threats from the digital domain. We are working with NLB to have all recruits going through Basic Military Training (BMT) attend an information literacy workshop to equip them to better recognise and deal with fake news and deliberate online falsehoods. For the rest of our personnel, MINDEF and SAF will inoculate them against hostile information campaigns and fake news, as well as strengthen cybersecurity awareness through enhancing our existing curriculum and learning journeys. We hope that collectively, these efforts will help our Servicemen better understand the role of fake news in modern warfare, the steps that they can take in response, and strengthen cyber hygiene as a whole."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00172,2019-03-01-T-004,172,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"For students, issues related to Digital Defence are already in MOE’s curriculum, and will be reinforced through digital literacy and Cyber Wellness programmes. Ms Joan Pereira asked about how we are reaching out to our youths. We refreshed the “Guardians of the City” (GOTC) game card this year to include threats from the digital domain. Students who have played the refreshed game felt it helped them better understand these threats and how they can play a part. For example, ITE College East student Deshaun Lau shared with us, and I quote, “Playing the game helped me realise that when we face digital threats, we must stay together as a community, and remind each other to take steps to prevent these attacks”. Unquote."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00173,2019-03-01-T-004,173,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Businesses too, are putting Digital Defence in action. A workplace design company, Space Matrix, has not only invested in cybersecurity systems, but also trained their staff to keep these threats at bay. Digital threats hit close to home when someone impersonated their CEO via email and asked staff for a funds transfer. They did not fall victim thanks to the vigilance of their staff who recognised the false email identification. The company subsequently fine-tuned their systems to better protect themselves for the future."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00174,2019-03-01-T-004,174,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Keeping Singapore Strong Together. While we step up efforts in Digital Defence, the multi-faceted threats of today mean that to keep Singapore strong, we need a collective effort where everyone plays a part and takes action across all six pillars of Total Defence. Mr Chairman, may I say a few words in Malay please?"
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00175,2019-03-01-T-004,175,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Chairman, the recent maritime and airspace disputes between Singapore and Malaysia have reinforced the importance of Total Defence for us. Our security agencies stand ready and vigilant to safeguard our sovereignty. Singaporeans also need to remain united and stand firm on our principles to protect our national interest. Therefore, it has been heartening to see how many Singaporeans have taken to social media to counter false claims and show support for Singapore’s position. One example is a post by Mr John Lam, who encouraged fellow Singaporeans to remain calm and civil when the maritime dispute between Singapore and Malaysia became tense. He used examples from Singapore’s past to show how we, as one people, have overcome our constraints, and came out stronger. For instance, when we were faced with the threats to cut our water supplies, we invested in water filtration and desalination technologies, and developed our own NEWater treatment plants. When faced with a sand import ban, we developed innovative and environmentally friendly ways of using less sand for reclamation."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00176,2019-03-01-T-004,176,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"What Mr Lam and many others have done embody what Psychological Defence is about – our people staying united and resolving to stand up for Singapore. Members of this house like Ms Cheng Li Hui have acknowledged the importance of this as well. The recent bilateral tensions between Singapore and Malaysia have helped Singaporeans better understand what we stand for, and why it is so important for us to take these positions – on upholding our territorial sovereignty and operating within a rules-based international order. Our small size and the volatility in our region show how crucial it is for Singaporeans to remain committed to our own defence, and having a strong Singapore Armed Forces."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00177,2019-03-01-T-004,177,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(In English)  I spoke earlier about how the terrorism threat is here to stay. Security agencies will do all we can to prevent an attack, but even if one takes place, it is important that every Singaporean knows what to do so that we can hold together, and bounce back quickly as a society."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00178,2019-03-01-T-004,178,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We commend ground-up initiatives that put Total Defence in action in this way, such as the example of the young Singaporeans who came together to develop the Bukit Panjang Emergency Preparedness Guide, with the support of Bukit Panjang Community Emergency and Engagement Committee (C2E), as Dr Teo Ho Pin had shared."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00179,2019-03-01-T-004,179,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"To build emergency preparedness, we have put in place the Community Response Module that equips MINDEF and SAF personnel to be active community responders by teaching them skills to better protect themselves and help those around them in the event of a terror attack. This complements MHA's SGSecure effort, which continues to build vigilance, cohesion and resilience in the community to deal with a terror attack. MINDEF's Total Defence partnerships with organisations, such as the Singapore Red Cross and Temasek Foundation Cares, also equip people with the knowledge and skills that they can apply in a crisis. For example, the Business Psychological Resilience Programme or B-PREP, part of Temasek Foundation Cares' ""Stay Prepared"" initiative, trains employees of companies in skills like psychological first aid."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00180,2019-03-01-T-004,180,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"MINDEF has also been actively reaching out to our youths and the wider community on Total Defence, and it is heartening to see how they have rallied around Total Defence. One example is our five students from Temasek Polytechnic – Benedict, Gabriel, Jed, Martin and Shing Hao. They developed a prototype Total Defence mobile application game, named ""The Lion City"". The game highlights how simple, everyday actions contribute towards building a strong and cohesive nation. The game's developers hope that by doing so, they can inspire their fellow youths to play their part and put Total Defence into action."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00181,2019-03-01-T-004,181,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Sir, in conclusion, Singapore has enjoyed peace and prosperity as we have a strong SAF, a strong National Service system, and strong public support for defence and security. Thirty-five years on and after the launch of Total Defence, we must continue to involve all communities and faiths to play their part. As we commemorate the Singapore Bicentennial this year, let us strengthen our resolve to safeguard our future of Singapore and Singaporeans. Thank you, Sir."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00182,2019-03-01-T-004,182,,Any clarifications? Mr Pritam Singh.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00183,2019-03-01-T-004,183,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Chairman. Sir, my question is to the Minister of Defence. Is MINDEF at liberty to share whether the variant of the Joint Strike Fighter that is going to be procured, is the conventional take-off and landing version or the short take-off and the vertical landing version?"
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00184,2019-03-01-T-004,184,Ng Eng Hen,Mr Singh would be aware that there is a aircraft carrier version and I can confirm with you that we are not buying that one.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00185,2019-03-01-T-004,185,,Any other further clarifications? Mr Vikram Nair.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00186,2019-03-01-T-004,186,Vikram Nair,I thank the Minister for the update on complete renewal taking place for many of our equipment. I am interested to know how much and to what extent these modifications will be developed in Singapore through our local defence industries.
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00187,2019-03-01-T-004,187,Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Chairman, there is no change in that sense in our procurement policies where we get the best of class for our needs. Price is a significant consideration. But also, when I say for our needs, obviously, a key restriction is manpower. And if you look at, for example, our ships, the reason why we went to local production, first of all, in our frigates, which we did with French DCN and then we built our own. Even with that, we designed it from conception to operation. Because few other nations are able to have the SAF that we have, that is able to defend a small island and have to do so with fewer people. So, for the ships, we went in that way. I think that has paid dividends."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00188,2019-03-01-T-004,188,Ng Eng Hen,"For Air Force, less so. From a maintenance point of view, we dealt with the issue by contracting it to some of our strategic partners, private companies. For the Army, some we have been able to do on our own to develop indigenous capability for local needs. So, I would say that our procurement is still price-sensitive, best of class but platforms that meet our needs. And where we can, we also recognise and that we must develop a local industry to be able to respond because even developing that capability for private practice requires time and effort. And we do not leave it, for example, to the marketplace. You cannot. And that is why, I think, over the years, a number of companies have been able to work with MINDEF and the SAF to meet our defence needs."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00189,2019-03-01-T-004,189,,"Mr Vikram Nair, would you like to withdraw your amendment?"
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00190,2019-03-01-T-004,190,Vikram Nair,"I would like to thank Minister Ng Eng Hen, Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How and Senior Minister of State Maliki Osman for their responses in a wide range of areas including giving us the assurance we will be safe for the next 25 years. National Service safety remains a priority and we are investing to deal with cyber threats and terrorism. I think these are all important considerations. And I thank the Ministry for being on top of it. Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment."
2019-03-01-T-004-S-00191,2019-03-01-T-004,191,Vikram Nair,"[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. (proc text)]"

2019-03-01-T-005-S-00194,2019-03-01-T-005,194,,Head N – Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr Vikram Nair.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00195,2019-03-01-T-005,195,Vikram Nair,"Chairman, I beg to move, ""That the total sum to be allocated for Head N of the Estimates be reduced by $100."""
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00196,2019-03-01-T-005,196,Vikram Nair,"I still recall vividly the images of the fall of the Berlin wall as a child. This was the physical manifestation of the ""iron curtain"" and its fall marked the end of the Cold War. Historians of the time, like Francis Fukoyama described this as the ""End of History"", the end of mankind's ideological struggle and the triumph of Western liberal democracy."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00197,2019-03-01-T-005,197,Vikram Nair,"The subsequent period, in the 1990s saw a defacto unipolar world with the former Soviet Union in crisis and the US as the sole superpower. Singapore had always been a historic and strong ally of the US in this region and this marked the way for development of a different kind. The whole world could come together and look for mutually beneficial economic collaborations. Economic growth through multi-lateralism prospered during this period."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00198,2019-03-01-T-005,198,Vikram Nair,This also paved the way for Singapore to engage China more deeply and China-Singapore relations started officially in 1990. And this was at a time when many other developed countries had imposed sanctions on China following the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00199,2019-03-01-T-005,199,Vikram Nair,"Singapore has always tried to play a constructive role in its international relationships, and I understand, from the start of international relations in 1990, has been a quiet spokesperson championing China's integration into the world economy."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00200,2019-03-01-T-005,200,Vikram Nair,"Deng Xiaoping and his team continued economic liberalisation through the 1990s and China grew steadily. Given China's base of more than a billion people, the effect of economic growth has been phenomenal. China has steadily moved up the ladder in economic size and has since become the world's second largest economy, overtaking Japan in 2011."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00201,2019-03-01-T-005,201,Vikram Nair,"Along with its economic growth, Chinese influence around the world has also grown steadily. China has become a major trading partner for most countries, including the US and a big investor in many regional countries, including in many parts of ASEAN. Most of this influence has been positive and mutually beneficial for all countries involved."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00202,2019-03-01-T-005,202,Vikram Nair,"However, there will always be an element of displacement when a new power rises. And unfortunately, relations between China and US have taken a more adversarial tone. The US has accused China of trading ""unfairly"" and has imposed tariffs on Chines imports. China has retaliated, and it appears a trade war is developing between these two economic giants, the two largest economies in the world."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00203,2019-03-01-T-005,203,Vikram Nair,This is worrying because it runs counter to all the hard work that has been achieved over the decades since GATT and subsequently the World Trade Organization (WTO) removed trade barriers and facilitated world trade. Singapore too has been caught in the middle with some of the US tariffs affecting Singapore's goods unintentionally.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00204,2019-03-01-T-005,204,Vikram Nair,"Current trade tensions between the US and China are worrying. While reports from recent negotiations between both sides have appeared positive, prolonged tensions could have a severe impact on the global and regional economy. These tensions are also spilling out into other areas, such as technology. Singapore has had strong relations with both the US and China. What is the outlook of US-China relations? I will be grateful if the Ministry can also share how Singapore manages relations with both countries, and how we can better position ourselves amidst these tensions?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00205,2019-03-01-T-005,205,Vikram Nair,"Another manifestation of this tension is in the South China sea, where China has had competing claims with a number of ASEAN allies and has taken an increasingly assertive stance. The US, of course, like many other maritime countries with an interest in these straits, has asserted its right of free passage over these waters. Of course, Singapore hopes the dispute will be resolved in accordance with international law, but that requires all parties involved to willingly submit the matter for determination in the event of a dispute."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00206,2019-03-01-T-005,206,Vikram Nair,"There have been news reports of China's military activities in the South China Sea, while the US and its allies have conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the region. ASEAN is negotiating a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea with China. Singapore has been a champion of this. I will be grateful if the MFA can provide an update on these negotiations, as well as the outlook for the situation in the South China Sea."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00207,2019-03-01-T-005,207,Vikram Nair,I would like to take my second and third cuts together.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00208,2019-03-01-T-005,208,,"Yes, please."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00209,2019-03-01-T-005,209,Vikram Nair,"Chairman, ASEAN was originally an alliance in 1967 between a small number of non-Communist South East Asian countries, namely Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. These countries were also our closest neighbours in terms of proximity. The relationship was close as we had alignment of interests in economic growth and political and security interests as well. Brunei, another close ally and neighbour became a member in 1984. At this time, much of the rest of ASEAN included Communist countries and the Cold War divided us."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00210,2019-03-01-T-005,210,Vikram Nair,"Following the end of the Cold War, ASEAN engaged many of these countries in Indo-China as well as Myanmar with a view to building mutually beneficial economic relationships. Eventually, these countries joined the fold in the course of the 1990s."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00211,2019-03-01-T-005,211,Vikram Nair,"Of course, as any group gets bigger, there are more likely to be differences of opinion and interests, and ASEAN has not been immune to this either. In recent years, ASEAN members have had differences over matters such as the South China Sea and on how to deal with the Rakhine state in Myanmar."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00212,2019-03-01-T-005,212,Vikram Nair,"However, despite these differences, we still have much in common and many areas on which we cooperate. As individual countries, we are relatively small, but as a group, we account for a population of more than 600 million with a GDP of more than USD$2.8 trillion."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00213,2019-03-01-T-005,213,Vikram Nair,"Singapore undertook the ASEAN Chairmanship in 2018, when ASEAN was at an inflection point. Singapore had sought to foster consensus within ASEAN on some of the key values that should underpin any framework for continued regional engagement. This includes ASEAN Centrality, inclusiveness, economic benefit, and support for a rules-based international order."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00214,2019-03-01-T-005,214,Vikram Nair,"Against the backdrop of a retreat from multilateralism and intensifying Sino-US competition which I spoke about earlier, how can ASEAN strengthen its centrality and try to speak in one collective voice on the more contentious regional developments and global issues?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00215,2019-03-01-T-005,215,Vikram Nair,"Our closest neighbour and with whom we have the strongest ties, in terms of culture, relationships and history is Malaysia. Singaporeans and Malaysians still make regular trips and the Causeway is the most heavily used link in the world between two countries. Most of us still have close family and friends living there."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00216,2019-03-01-T-005,216,Vikram Nair,"As such, it is always sad then relationships between the two governments worsen. Following the change of government in Malaysia, there has been an emergence of new tensions in bilateral relations with Malaysia. This started with a stalling on joint projects such as the high speed rail and later the RTS. There were also public statements that Malaysia will be re-considering matters such as the agreement on water."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00217,2019-03-01-T-005,217,Vikram Nair,The most worrying recent developments have been the two Malaysian vessels that came into our waters following a declaration of new port limits for Johore. These vessels still remain in our waters although the governments on both sides have taken steps to de-escalate matters.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00218,2019-03-01-T-005,218,Vikram Nair,"Given that Malaysia is our closest neighbour and both countries are highly interdependent, how will Singapore approach its relations with Malaysia going forward such that our national interests are protected and the bilateral tensions do not spill over to negatively impact the lives of our people?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00219,2019-03-01-T-005,219,Vikram Nair,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00220,2019-03-01-T-005,220,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Chairman, the Pakatan Harapan coalition took over the Malaysian government following the 14th General Elections in May last year. I would like to ask the Minister what has been Singapore’s approach towards engaging the new government and how would he characterise Singapore's interactions with the new government over the course of the last nine months?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00221,2019-03-01-T-005,221,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"On the dispute over the extension of Johor Bahru Port Limits, can MFA provide an update on the working group discussions and whether there has been any progress in terms of resolving the dispute?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00222,2019-03-01-T-005,222,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Chairman, Sir, the mutual suspension of Malaysia’s Restricted Area over Pasir Gudang and Singapore’s Instrument Landing System procedures will be effective until 31 March this year. I would be grateful for an update on the discussions on these two issues?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00223,2019-03-01-T-005,223,Vikram Nair,"Chairman, Indonesia has been a long standing and close ally of Singapore for many decades and both have been founding members of ASEAN since 1967. Next to Malaysia, Indonesia is probably the next closest in terms of culture and proximity."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00224,2019-03-01-T-005,224,Vikram Nair,"Prime Minister Lee and President Jokowi have had a number of high level meetings, most recently at the Singapore-Indonesia Leader’s Retreat in 2018. Singapore is Indonesia’s largest investor, and I understand, at this retreat a bilateral investment treaty was discussed and a currency swap was also announced between the two countries."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00225,2019-03-01-T-005,225,Vikram Nair,Would MFA be able to update members of the public on the state of our bilateral relations with Indonesia including key takeaways from our engagements last year? How will we work to maintain our relationship with Indonesia for the benefit of our peoples? Indonesia's presidential election will be held in April this year. How will we continue to engage the next Administration and strengthen our bilateral and regional cooperation with Indonesia?
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00226,2019-03-01-T-005,226,Chia Shi-Lu,"Mr Chairman, we observe a trend of more countries all over the world, including those in our region, becoming increasingly nationalistic and inward-looking. The recent elections and change in government in Malaysia had coincided with the emergence of prickly issues in Singapore-Malaysia relations."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00227,2019-03-01-T-005,227,Chia Shi-Lu,"As our other close neighbour, Indonesia, will have its own national elections in April, what is MFA's view on the possible impact this could have on bilateral relations with Singapore? What are some of the issues which have been unresolved and could become potential points of contention? Which are the main areas of common interests which we can pursue to strengthen our relationship?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00228,2019-03-01-T-005,228,,"Ms Joan Pereira, you can take the three cuts together."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00229,2019-03-01-T-005,229,Joan Pereira,"Sir, Singapore had benefited from the assistance provided by international organisations and foreign countries in our early years of development. The UNDP, for example, gave us invaluable advice on the formulation of Singapore’s economic development strategy, without which Singapore would not be the success we are today."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00230,2019-03-01-T-005,230,Joan Pereira,"In 1992, the Singapore Cooperation Programme or SCP was established as the main platform for Singapore to give back to the international community through training programmes for foreign government officials from fellow developing countries. The SCP's focus on human resource development reflects our belief that a country's most valuable asset is our human capital."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00231,2019-03-01-T-005,231,Joan Pereira,"Last year, the World Bank ranked Singapore as the best country for developing human capital. World Bank Group president Jim Yong Kim said that ""policies that build human capital are some of the smartest investments that countries can make to boost long-term inclusive economic growth."" How has the SCP, with its focus on developing human capital, helped Singapore to build our international network and standing? Would the Minister share examples and details of programmes and the impact of these on the relationships between Singapore and the foreign countries involved? Were there any subsequent projects of mutual collaboration and how have these been beneficial to both Singapore and the partner countries?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00232,2019-03-01-T-005,232,Joan Pereira,"Singaporeans are among the most well-travelled in the world. They make more than 20 million trips overseas every year, including overland journeys to Malaysia, and venture beyond. The increasing number of trips to destinations further afield such as Iceland, South America and Africa, in addition to perennial attractions such as Japan, South Korea and Europe, shows how strong our collective wanderlust is."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00233,2019-03-01-T-005,233,Joan Pereira,"Given the increasing uncertainty around the world, Singaporeans who travel often, or have family and close friends living abroad, would naturally be concerned whenever there is another natural disaster or terrorist attack in the news. Last year, there were a few major natural disasters, political riots and traffic accidents overseas where Singaporeans found themselves caught in. If caught in a major crisis or emergency abroad, our citizens located all around the globe would require more assistance and support from the Government. The complexity of cases may also increase."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00234,2019-03-01-T-005,234,Joan Pereira,"At the same time, public expectations of the quality and speed of assistance service have increased. I understand that MFA has over 50 overseas missions world-wide. I would therefore like to know what measures are being taken by MFA to address the needs and expectations of our travelling citizens. What travel advice should Singaporeans take note of, especially those who travel to places where consular support is not so accessible?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00235,2019-03-01-T-005,235,Joan Pereira,"Lastly, what is the role of our missions overseas in strengthening ties with Singaporeans living or working there?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00236,2019-03-01-T-005,236,Joan Pereira,"Our people’s confidence and support are crucial to the success of Singapore's foreign policy, especially in the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation in this digital age. Technology which allows information to reach us almost instantaneously can also deliver distorted and even false information."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00237,2019-03-01-T-005,237,Joan Pereira,"Disinformation campaigns by countries big and small are a relatively low cost means to undermine the will and resolve of other nations that they have disagreements with. Singapore is not immune. We are one of the most internet-connected countries, and one of the most diverse nations on earth. Countries that have differing constituencies and demographic compositions are particularly susceptible to such influence, which can set up contention against one another."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00238,2019-03-01-T-005,238,Joan Pereira,MFA requires the strong support of a united citizenry to carry out its work effectively. It is thus very important for us to ensure that Singaporeans understand the fundamental principles of our foreign policy so that they are able to exercise good judgement and not take in information at face value.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00239,2019-03-01-T-005,239,Joan Pereira,"I understand that MFA is expanding its foreign policy outreach to the Singapore public, especially the younger generation and students, to help them better understand Singapore’s foreign policy. Would MFA please provide an update on these outreach efforts?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00240,2019-03-01-T-005,240,Chong Kee Hiong,"Sir, the global situation is uncertain. Relations between the big powers – the US and China, the US and Russia, are under stress. There is an increasing trust deficit among states, and countries are questioning the benefits of multilateralism, openness, globalisation and free trade. This has resulted in a growing wave of support for protectionist and isolationist policies in some countries, undermining support for a multilateral, rules-based international order."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00241,2019-03-01-T-005,241,Chong Kee Hiong,"We cannot change the fact that Singapore remains a ""Little Red Dot"" on the map. We also cannot change our destiny that however the global landscape evolves and whatever challenges we may face, we will always do so as a small state."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00242,2019-03-01-T-005,242,Chong Kee Hiong,Small states like Singapore thrive in a rule-based and rule of law-based international order. What can we do to protect and advance our interests in the face of rising unilateralism across the world?
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00243,2019-03-01-T-005,243,Chong Kee Hiong,"Singapore is nonetheless not alone in being small. Countries who identify themselves as ""small states"" make up the majority of the membership at the United Nations. How is Singapore working with other small states in the international community to ensure that our collective interests are secured and that small states continue to be heard?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00244,2019-03-01-T-005,244,,"Mr Charles Chong, take the two cuts together."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00245,2019-03-01-T-005,245,Charles Chong,"Mr Chairman, the relationship between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America has been described by a former US Secretary of State as the most important bilateral relationship in the world this century. There is a long and historic relationship with the first voyage of direct trade between the United States and China having been recorded has taken place in 1784, some 35 years before Raffles landed in Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00246,2019-03-01-T-005,246,Charles Chong,"In fact, today, 1 March marks the 40th year of the upgrading of diplomatic relations between the USA and the PRC when the US liaison office in Beijing was converted to an embassy. So, on the occasion of 40 years of diplomatic relationship between the USA and the PRC, I would be grateful if the Minister could provide some insights into how Singapore is affected by the relationship between these two powers, and how we can act in the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans in navigating our own bilateral relationship between USA and China?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00247,2019-03-01-T-005,247,Charles Chong,"The current US administration has been in power for just over two years now. Whereas in the past the US-China relationship was sometimes described as symbiotic with bilateral trade and investment between the two countries having grown exponentially reaching US$710 billion in 2017, the last two years has seen an increase in tensions between the countries, particularly on trade but also in other areas including Taiwan and the South China Sea. These tensions over the past year has had a negative impact on the global economy and market sentiments."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00248,2019-03-01-T-005,248,Charles Chong,"The US and China have imposed tit for tat trade tirades on each other, a move which is at odds with Singapore's approach to free and open trade and one which runs contrary to our support of a rule-based multilateral trading system."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00249,2019-03-01-T-005,249,Charles Chong,"Being a small country, we need certainty in terms of how we conduct our trade relations and we value an adherence to well-established international norms, international law and binding contracts between states. So, without repeating the old chestnut involving fighting elephants and grass, I hope the Minister can provide some insights into whether US-China relations has affected the US engagement of Singapore and vice-versa. And if a trade war were to take place between US and China, could the Minister shed some light on how Singapore has prepared ourselves for the follow-up to this?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00250,2019-03-01-T-005,250,Charles Chong,"Mr Chairman, the second issue I would like to speak on involves US engagement of Southeast Asia. Singapore has been a long-standing and steadfast advocate of the US engagement of and presence in Asia. We are a key security partner of the US in the region with our defence relationship being formalised in 2005 through the Strategic Framework Agreement, and subsequently enhanced in 2015 with the US-Singapore Cooperation Agreement."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00251,2019-03-01-T-005,251,Charles Chong,"Since 2002, Singapore has hosted the annual Shangri-la Dialogue where Asia Pacific countries, including the US and South East Asia Nations come together to discuss defence and security issues. Thereby contributing to the enhancement of defence diplomacy amongst participating countries. But it is not just defence and security matters where we will be at a strong relationship. Indeed US and Singapore has strong partnership in many other areas. Bilateral trade in goods and services which nearly US$75 billion in 2017 and in that same year, the US continued to be the largest foreign investor in Singapore, while Singapore was the US' second largest Asian investor."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00252,2019-03-01-T-005,252,Charles Chong,"These days, whoever, the US appears to be focused on other regional matters such as the denuclearisation negotiations in North Korea. While on trade, a comprehensive and progressive agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership came into force at the end of last year with the conspicuous absence of the US who withdrew, from its predecessor. I would like to ask the Minister, if such a trend in the US engagement of the region over the medium and long term, would signal a shift in the US attention, away from Southeast Asia, which may have a negative impact on regional cooperation and collaboration with the US. And what does it mean for the US commitment to the region as well as its initiatives to engage Singapore and the rest of Southeast Asia?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00253,2019-03-01-T-005,253,,"Ms Tin Pei Ling, you can take two cuts together."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00254,2019-03-01-T-005,254,Tin Pei Ling,"China and the United States are in the midst of a protracted trade war. These two countries are the world's two largest economies. The Clash of the Titans has disrupted the global economy. Rounds of negotiation, deadlines, headlines and all."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00255,2019-03-01-T-005,255,Tin Pei Ling,"Institutions like the World Trade Organization are coming under attack, and politicians in many countries are unfortunately attributing the cause of their countries’ domestic problems to free trade. There is a surge in protectionism and anti-globalisation in much of the developed world. These will spell trouble for Singapore. Should multilateralism decline or fail, we risk being at the mercy of bigger countries."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00256,2019-03-01-T-005,256,Tin Pei Ling,"Trade is Singapore’s lifeblood. In this challenging environment, what can Singapore do to uphold the open rules-based multilateral trading system? And as multilateralism come on threat, we should look to other emerging markets for new opportunities."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00257,2019-03-01-T-005,257,Tin Pei Ling,"Central and Eastern Europe is a rapidly-growing region, with GDP growth significantly higher than the average in the European Union (EU). Last year, of the 12 EU members forecast to grow by three percent or more, nine were Central and Eastern European countries. Romania’s GDP growth for instance hit 6.9% in 2017, though this figure fell to an estimated four percent last year, which is nonetheless significant."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00258,2019-03-01-T-005,258,Tin Pei Ling,"As a country whose lifeblood is trade and connectivity, Singapore should always be on the lookout for opportunities to build new economic ties and strengthen existing ones. The economic potential of Central and Eastern Europe should not remain untapped."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00259,2019-03-01-T-005,259,Tin Pei Ling,"Over the last year, we deepened our relationships with several Central and Eastern European countries. There is now a direct flight from Singapore to Warsaw and recently, we have had high-level political exchanges with Russia, Turkey and Romania. I also note that Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis announced his intention to reopen the Czech Embassy in Singapore during his visit in January. It would appear we are gaining momentum."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00260,2019-03-01-T-005,260,Tin Pei Ling,"Given these conditions, how is Singapore continuing to engage the emerging economies in Central and Eastern Europe?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00261,2019-03-01-T-005,261,,"Mr Loh Thia Kiang, you can take both cuts."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00262,2019-03-01-T-005,262,Low Thia Khiang,"Chairman, Sir, as a highly connected small city state at the heart of Southeast Asia, Singapore is extremely vulnerable to upheavals in the region. China’s peaceful economic rise has taken a different turn with military maneuvers in the South China Sea and its soft and hard power diplomacy vis-a-vis individual ASEAN states. China’s rise has led other powers to turn to Southeast Asia. America was the first to do a pivot to Southeast Asia, entering into bilateral comprehensive partnerships with ASEAN member states. India elevated its “Look East” policy to the ""Act East"" policy in the shadow of China's One Belt One Road investments in South Asia. Japan has also shifted its geo-strategic focus from Asia-Pacific to Indo-Pacific."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00263,2019-03-01-T-005,263,Low Thia Khiang,"We have forged close relationships with the US and then with rising China, and more recently India, guided by economic pragmatism and geopolitical realism. We have maintained our sovereignty and our commitment to peace and international rule of law. We should continue to do all these, but does the new complex environment mean that Singapore should consider pursuing its own strategic pivot to Southeast Asia? There are at least two reasons why we should focus on Southeast Asia."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00264,2019-03-01-T-005,264,Low Thia Khiang,"First, ASEAN is fast becoming an economic powerhouse. Through the ASEAN Economic Community and other initiatives aimed at economic integration, GDP per capita increased by 70% from 2007 to 2017. The combined GDP of $2.77 trillion places ASEAN among the top 10 economies in the world. ASEAN has a young population, many countries are still in the earlier phases of development, so there is a lot of scope for growth. We should not miss this new growth story, right here in our neighbourhood."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00265,2019-03-01-T-005,265,Low Thia Khiang,"Second, with the global and regional powers turning their strategic focus to Southeast Asia, we should be careful. History has shown that when the great powers turn to a region and bring their strategic interests to bear on the countries, well meaning intentions could easily turn to hostile rivalries. We cannot afford to let the powers compete over us and disrupt our unity with divide-and-rule or containment strategies."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00266,2019-03-01-T-005,266,Low Thia Khiang,"We have painstakingly building up ASEAN after the Cold War. In the event that great power conflicts should erupt again, Singapore would fare better in an ASEAN standing strong together against foreign interferences. Realising the ASEAN motto of ""One Vision, One Identity, One Community"" may well be the key to Singapore's survival and success for the next 50 years."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00267,2019-03-01-T-005,267,Low Thia Khiang,"Sir, some foreign policy pundits and political scientists have emphasised the importance of soft power in the exercise of influence on the international stage. The American political scientist who pioneered the concept of soft power, called the ability to combine hard and soft power in a successful strategy, ""smart power"". It is time we deepen our soft power diplomacy to effectively implement what I believe should be a strategic shift to focus our foreign policy on Southeast Asia."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00268,2019-03-01-T-005,268,Low Thia Khiang,"Since 2015, communications consultancy Portland and the University of Southern California have published Soft Power 30 Index to measure the soft power of the top 30 countries on the international stage. In the last report, Singapore came in 21st. It comes with no surprise that the report ranked Singapore top in the category of ""enterprise"" due to our favourable business, rule-of-law and innovation environment. The ""smart nation"" initiative, underpinned by excellent digital infrastructure and digital government, has also led to a high ranking in the category of ""digital""."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00269,2019-03-01-T-005,269,Low Thia Khiang,"We need to change the perception of our neighbours of Singapore as an arrogant nation that likes to compare itself favourably to other developing countries. Oftentimes, the perceived condescension is due precisely to our success as a business hub and a global city adopting the most advanced technologies. Success breeds envy among neighbours, and this envy can turn toxic if our neighbours come to believe that our success is due to our taking advantage of their weaknesses."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00270,2019-03-01-T-005,270,Low Thia Khiang,"I believe we can do three things to enhance our soft power diplomacy to correct the perceived condescension and prevent envy from turning toxic on us. First, our government-to-government engagement should deepen with the objective of facilitating economic development of our neighbouring countries. We have done so much with China in this respect. For instance, last September, we inked deals with China to promote the replication of the Tianjin Eco-city development in other Chinese cities, establish a NUS institute in Chongqing to conduct scientific research as well as technology transfer and commercialisation, and develop start-ups and partnerships in emerging industries in Suzhou. Is there a reason why we are not reaching the same level of intense engagement with our ASEAN neighbours?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00271,2019-03-01-T-005,271,Low Thia Khiang,"Second, ASEAN is made up of countries with complex histories and cultures. We are one ourselves and it will take more than Government-to-Government engagement to develop our soft power diplomacy. We should enhance our people-to-people networking at institutional and practitioner levels for our cultural sector. We have signed arts and culture agreements with Australia and China that had led to intense professional exchanges and curatorial collaboration between museums. We should do the same with our ASEAN neighbours, especially since we share much historical and cultural kinship."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00272,2019-03-01-T-005,272,Low Thia Khiang,"Third, we should turn our attention to digital diplomacy. We already have the digital infrastructure to do so. The next step is to develop our capabilities in making use of it to achieve our diplomatic objectives. For instance, we could have made use of the Trump-Kim Singapore Summit last year to enhance our soft power when people all over the world searching ""where is Singapore"". I also welcome the launching of ASEAN Smart Cities Network. Singapore should become a smart nation exercising smart power."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00273,2019-03-01-T-005,273,,Miss Cheryl Chan. Not here. Prof Fatimah Lateef.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00274,2019-03-01-T-005,274,Fatimah Lateef,"Sir, Singapore and the US enjoy a long standing and deep relationship based on substantive cooperation in many areas such as economics, trade, education as well as defence and the security sectors. Our Strategic Framework Agreement with the US for example, formalises bilateral security and defence cooperation. We have both also enjoyed many years of exchanges including high level ones."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00275,2019-03-01-T-005,275,Fatimah Lateef,"In 2017 alone, the US was Singapore's third largest trading partner in goods and also its top trading partner in service. It is also Singapore's largest source of foreign direct investments. Conversely, Singapore is the US's second largest Asian investor, after Japan. Besides our regular defence collaboration and exchanges, we are also very active in the US-led Global Defeat ISIS Cooperation Coalition and we are the only Asian country to have contributed both in terms of military assets and personnel towards this. With the new developments in the US, internally and also in terms of its global status, how will Singapore continue to strengthen and deepen our cooperation and relationship with the US."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00276,2019-03-01-T-005,276,Speaker,"Mr Henry Kwek, you can take both cuts please."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00277,2019-03-01-T-005,277,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Chairman, Our bilateral relations with China are excellent, and has been described as ""progressive, forward-looking, and strategic"". In the joint-statement issues during PRC Premier Li Keqiang's official visit to Singapore last November, both sides also reaffirmed the principles of mutual respect, sovereign equality and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. At the same time, both sides also continued with frequent high-level exchanges and enjoy good cooperation in diverse fields."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00278,2019-03-01-T-005,278,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,We will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park this year. We celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City Project last year.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00279,2019-03-01-T-005,279,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"During the same visit by Premier Li, both sides signed several MOUs covering areas ranging from trade, finance, cooperation on the Belt & Road Initiative, culture and the environment, among others. Notably, we signed the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Upgrade Protocol, MOUs on Chongqing Connectivity Initiative – New International Land Sea Trade Corridor and the elevation of the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City to a state-level bilateral cooperation project. Can the Foreign Minister provide an update on the state of our relations with China? How is the progress of our Government-to-Government relations?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00280,2019-03-01-T-005,280,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"My Second cut. Singapore hosted the first US-DPRK Summit in June 2018. The choice of Singapore as the venue of the Summit reaffirmed our reputation as an impartial, reliable and safe country. The Joint Statement signed by the US and DPRK in Singapore is an important first step forward. Both sides have since kept up dialogues and exchanges. In fact, the US and DPRK held their second Summit in Vietnam over the past two days. However, despite the stated optimism for both sides to achieve an agreement, no deal was concluded when the summit ended yesterday."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00281,2019-03-01-T-005,281,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Many Singaporeans, including myself, welcome the positive developments on the Korean Peninsula and hope that the dialogue and efforts towards lasting peace and prosperity on the Peninsula will continue. Could MFA provide its assessment of the developments on the Korean Peninsula, and what role is Singapore playing to support diplomatic efforts towards a peaceful and de-nuclearised Korean Peninsular?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00282,2019-03-01-T-005,282,Sun Xueling,"Mr Chairman, our Leaders, including Prime Minister, Emeritus Senior Minister and Mr Lee Kuan Yew have had frequent meetings with their Chinese counterparts and enjoy good relations with them. Deputy Prime Minister Teo has also been described by former Chinese Vice Premier, Mr Zhang Gaoli as an old and good friend."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00283,2019-03-01-T-005,283,Sun Xueling,"Notably, in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of his reform and opening up, China post humorously conferred our Mr Lee Kuan Yew the Reform and Friendship Award in December 2018, in recognition of Singapore and Mr Lee's longstanding support for China's reform and opening over the years."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00284,2019-03-01-T-005,284,Sun Xueling,"Our good relations with China did not happen by chance. It was cemented by cooperating on a wide span of areas from economic cooperation, sustainable development, human resource development to social governance. It is also heartening to see that our 4G leaders are aiming to maintain momentum of cross-partnerships by taking the lead in many engagements with China. Many of our younger Ministers are leading the engagements via the Bilateral Trade Councils established with the Chinese provinces. For instance, Minister Heng Swee Keat is the Singapore Chairman for Jiangsu Bilateral Trade Council and Minister Chan Chun Sing is the Singapore Chairman for the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00285,2019-03-01-T-005,285,Sun Xueling,"As our economic ties deepened, more young Singaporeans will find opportunities to study and work in China. I would like to suggest that our young be briefed on the history and current developments of Singapore-China relations before they embark on their learning journeys in China so that they are given a holistic and current perspective. Ultimately, cooperation between two countries is based on each dealing with its internal challenges and opportunities and working with each other to advance common interests. How do we intend to take this mutually beneficial cooperation between Singapore and China to the next level?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00286,2019-03-01-T-005,286,Chia Shi-Lu,"Mr Chairman, as a free and open economy, trade is critical to Singapore and we welcome new trading partners and investment opportunities. We had established trade and investment links with the major economies and have a wide network of bilateral and multilateral Free Trade Agreements. These are all part of the soft infrastructure needed to support Singapore companies’ reach overseas to tap new opportunities and markets abroad."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00287,2019-03-01-T-005,287,Chia Shi-Lu,"There are many emerging economies with vast markets and youthful populations. Would MFA provide an update on our engagement with these economies, specifically Africa, Latin America and the Middle East?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00288,2019-03-01-T-005,288,Alex Yam,"Mr Chairman, as small countries and, more importantly, as neighbours , Singapore and Brunei shared many similarities and a strategic outlook on many regional and international issues. It is this that has led to a special relationship between our two countries, one that has been built over many years and on a foundation of deep, personal and institutional ties, dating back to the close relationships shared from the 1960s by the late Seri Begawan and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00289,2019-03-01-T-005,289,Alex Yam,"Having had the honour to visit Brunei on a number of occasions, as part of official delegations, including then President Dr Tony Tan's State visit in 2013. I must attest that the genuine warmth and welcome that our Bruneians extend to us is extraordinary. It is also noteworthy that President Halimah Yacob chose Brunei as a destination of her first state visit in May 2018 and we have a steady stream of high-level mutual visits every year, including the Annual Singapore-Brunei Young Leaders Programme. In her toast speech at the State banquet hosted by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah for her State visit, President Halimah emphasised that future generation of leaders on both sides have the responsibility to build on the existing relations between Singapore and Brunei and to bring those ties to greater heights."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00290,2019-03-01-T-005,290,Alex Yam,"The Currency Interchangeability Agreement which has been embraced since 1967 and our strong defence cooperation also underpins the robust ties between our two nations. What then are the steps that the Singapore Government is taking to continue strengthening the special relationship? It is, perhaps, also opportune for us to congratulate our Brunei and friends on the occasion of their 35th National Day this day and may our relations continue to grow ever stronger."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00291,2019-03-01-T-005,291,Terence Ho Wee San,"Mr Chairman, cultural diplomacy. In Mandarin first."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00292,2019-03-01-T-005,292,Terence Ho Wee San,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Arts and culture can become Singapore's soft power to open windows of the world. With the support from the Government, enterprises and various funds, the Singapore arts and culture brand has formed its unique style in the international arena. Arts and culture plays a very important role in diplomacy between countries. Local arts groups, such as the Theatre Practice, the Siong Leng Musical Association, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, Singapore Symphony Orchestra, Singapore Dance Theatre, have all been invited or sent to perform at renowned international art festivals on many occasions."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00293,2019-03-01-T-005,293,Terence Ho Wee San,"Going forward, I hope more local arts groups can be invited to perform overseas through strategic MOUs signed between our Government and other countries. I hope this kind of performances can be sustained, so that it can improve the standard of our arts and cultural groups which may one day match that of top overseas arts groups."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00294,2019-03-01-T-005,294,Terence Ho Wee San,"(In English)  In today’s uncertain geopolitical landscape, where aggressive and hard strategies may do more harm than good, soft power is key for small countries like Singapore, where it is even more important to rely on our positive attraction and persuasion to increase relevance to the international community, gaining support for our agenda."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00295,2019-03-01-T-005,295,Terence Ho Wee San,"Soft power is a critical foreign policy tool and I think we can do more to leverage our soft power, especially through arts and culture. Singapore is a harmonious society, with a rich and diverse multicultural heritage. Establishing Singapore as a cultural presence in the region can add another dimension to our bilateral accounts."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00296,2019-03-01-T-005,296,Terence Ho Wee San,"On this note, I would like to highlight that our arts and culture groups have been flying our flag overseas proud and high! Sri Warisan Som Said Performing Arts, founded by Cultural medallion recipient Mdm Som Said will be performing at our National Day celebrations in Melbourne; the Theatre Practice is going to bring Liao Zhai Rocks! to the Shanghai Culture Square in this March as part of their music season; Ding Yi Music Company is going to the China ASEAN Music Festival in May too! The SCO is also heading to Europe on our international tour this year. This is in line with NAC's SG Arts Plan, where we aspire to position Singapore globally, where arts and culture icons and works are appreciated by audiences at home and abroad. Our rich cultural heritage and history should also be actively profiled."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00297,2019-03-01-T-005,297,Terence Ho Wee San,"Through arts, cultural diplomacy, Singapore can project global influence and enhance relations with our foreign partners. Singapore’s rich and diverse multicultural heritage is one of the defining traits of our country, and of our identity as Singaporeans. It can also help foster unity, pride and cohesion among our people as it reminds us of our links to society, as well as to the region and the world. Cultural diplomacy, which profiles these similarities, as well as our uniqueness, can help to broaden and deepen our bilateral relations with other countries at the people-to-people level. It makes for deeper and more direct relationships with our friends in the region. This helps to strengthen our networks with our foreign partners, and Singapore's position as a valuable collaborative partner in the region."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00298,2019-03-01-T-005,298,Terence Ho Wee San,"Mr Chairman, we are after all a small country and must allocate our resources well – yet also have an effective network with our overseas missions. They can play an instrumental role in expanding Singapore’s cultural soft power to increase our presence and space. Could the Minister please provide us with an update on what are we doing on this front?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00299,2019-03-01-T-005,299,Teo Ho Pin,"Mr Chairman, Sir, over the last 50 years, ASEAN has worked hard to maintain peace and stability in the region. ASEAN has succeeded, for most of the part, in achieving this primary directive. As of today, the success of ASEAN has allowed it to not only be an enabler of peace, but also an enabler of economic interdependence."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00300,2019-03-01-T-005,300,Teo Ho Pin,"Sir, I would like to seek an update in regard to the key initiatives pursued by ASEAN to stay united and relevant to the world in this age of globalisation."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00301,2019-03-01-T-005,301,Teo Ho Pin,"Sir, with the advent of globalisation, and the creation and subsequent expansion of economic blocs around the world, the role of ASEAN must yet expand again. It is imperative that ASEAN fosters greater economic, social and political collaboration among its constituent nations."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00302,2019-03-01-T-005,302,Teo Ho Pin,"Sir, I wish to speak on economic collaboration. Namely, I would like to propose the creation of more business exchanges and partnerships in the region, and the proliferation of e-commerce in the ASEAN community."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00303,2019-03-01-T-005,303,Teo Ho Pin,"In regard to economic collaboration, ASEAN should encourage more business exchanges and partnerships in the region. We can learn from the European Commission. The Commission introduced an initiative known as European Strategic Cluster Partnerships or ESCP-4i in 2016. These partnerships aim to support the internationalisation of European SMEs from 23 different countries by placing them across 150 cluster organisations. These cluster organisations subsequently penetrate foreign markets in different fields ranging from construction to aerospace vehicles. As of last year, they have launched the second generation of the ESCP-4i. The ESCP-4i is poised to “support more than 17,000 European SMEs in accessing global value chains and taking a leading position globally”."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00304,2019-03-01-T-005,304,Teo Ho Pin,"Sir, a similar approach by ASEAN will empower ASEAN SMEs to compete in the global market by allowing them to achieve the economies of scale they require to do so."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00305,2019-03-01-T-005,305,Teo Ho Pin,"E-commerce presents opportunities not just for consumers, but also for businesses in ASEAN. We should utilise the platform of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network to allow for the global expansion of our firms through digitisation."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00306,2019-03-01-T-005,306,Teo Ho Pin,"Sir, I would also like to seek an update as to the progress of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network initiative which Singapore launched in its capacity as ASEAN chair last year"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00307,2019-03-01-T-005,307,Murali Pillai,"Mr Chairman, Sir, ASEAN-EU dialogue relations, connecting a combined population of more than a billion people, span more than 40 years."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00308,2019-03-01-T-005,308,Murali Pillai,"The relations have led to the identification of common goals and objectives in the areas of political and security cooperation, economic cooperation and socio-cultural cooperation. Much progress have been made on these fronts."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00309,2019-03-01-T-005,309,Murali Pillai,"The EU is ASEAN’s second largest trading partner. In 2017, ASEAN exported almost 135 billion euros worth of goods and services into EU. For the corresponding period, EU exported 91 billion euros to ASEAN. The EU is also the biggest provider of FDI in ASEAN. EU and ASEAN has also agreed to resuming talks for a region-to-region free trade agreement."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00310,2019-03-01-T-005,310,Murali Pillai,"On the security front, ASEAN and EU agreed to work together to enhance crisis response and disaster management."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00311,2019-03-01-T-005,311,Murali Pillai,EU is also the biggest donor to the ASEAN secretariat with fund of 200 million euros in support of ASEAN regional integration in addition to 2 billion euros of bilateral support to ASEAN member states.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00312,2019-03-01-T-005,312,Murali Pillai,"Without a doubt, EU is an important partner of ASEAN."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00313,2019-03-01-T-005,313,Murali Pillai,Singapore took over as country coordinator for ASEAN-EU dialogue relations in August 2018. It will hold this appointment until August 2021.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00314,2019-03-01-T-005,314,Murali Pillai,"In January 2019, Singapore co-chaired the 22nd ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting in January 2019 where an agreement in principle was reached to upgrade ASEAN-EU relations to a strategic partnership."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00315,2019-03-01-T-005,315,Murali Pillai,"In addition, the ministers from EU and ASEAN discussed cooperation as well as challenges on regional and international issues."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00316,2019-03-01-T-005,316,Murali Pillai,May I ask what are Singapore’s goals and priorities as country coordinator to enhance collaboration and relations between ASEAN and EU?
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00317,2019-03-01-T-005,317,Murali Pillai,Does Singapore anticipate any issues affecting ASEAN-EU dialogue relations arising from Brexit?
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00318,2019-03-01-T-005,318,Anthea Ong,"Mr Chairman, the Rohingya crisis is a full-blown humanitarian crisis with regional consequences. Voluntary repatriation is not seen as a viable solution by many given that the root cause of citizenship that results in the discrimination and abuse, as well as guaranteed safety, of the returnees, has yet to be resolved. The crisis is a sobering reminder that domestic issues can quickly become transnational ones overnight. Can I please ask the Minister to provide insights in the following"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00319,2019-03-01-T-005,319,Anthea Ong,(a) Is the passive non-interference policy of ASEAN still relevant in today’s globalised context?
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00320,2019-03-01-T-005,320,Anthea Ong,(b) Will ASEAN develop a refugee and asylum policy that includes guidance for action to be taken when a Member State’s internal issues cause people to flee to neighbouring states?
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00321,2019-03-01-T-005,321,Anthea Ong,(c) Will the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights be further strengthened for conflicts to be escalated to?
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00322,2019-03-01-T-005,322,Anthea Ong,(d) And will there be a Human Rights Court set up to interpret and enforce the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration?
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00323,2019-03-01-T-005,323,,"Mr Louis Ng, you can take the two cuts together."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00324,2019-03-01-T-005,324,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I have shared about my experiences visiting the Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar several times. I will always remember what I saw, the painful stories I heard and the people, especially the children I met. To be honest, the image of the child with a bullet wound in her arm is still very much on mind."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00325,2019-03-01-T-005,325,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My biggest fear now is that these people will be forgotten. Over a million of them now live in the refugee camps in Bangladesh. The attention on this issue is diluting as people move on to more recent crises and funding gets diverted away.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00326,2019-03-01-T-005,326,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"But as Minister stated, ""As long as the refugees remain in the camps, and have no jobs and means of livelihood, they will have no future prospects"". I also agree with Minister that ""we cannot expect quick fixes"". But we need to remember that in 1991, 28 years ago, 250,000 had already fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar. This is not a crisis that began last year or a few years ago."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00327,2019-03-01-T-005,327,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I do understand that this is an issue that we cannot solve on our own. However, we can help. Can the Minister and MFA share what plans MFA has in 2019 to support both Myanmar and Bangladesh in finding a long-term solution? Sir, I hope that all of us in this increasingly fragmented world remember that there is no us or them. There is only us, one human family, connected in ways we sometimes forget."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00328,2019-03-01-T-005,328,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, Minister has said that he does not foresee a sudden cessation of support from the UN and NGOs for the refugees in Bangladesh. He stated that he does not foresee that contingency occurring, at least not in the foreseeable future."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00329,2019-03-01-T-005,329,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I really hope so. At the same time, I know that the UNHCR needs $307.6 million in 2019 to meet the basic needs of the Rohingya refugees and the communities hosting them. It is worrying that they have only managed to raise 2% of this amount so far, as one million refugees need this for their survival."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00330,2019-03-01-T-005,330,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I appreciate that Singapore is one of the countries that make voluntary contributions to the UNHCR annually. I am glad that in 2016, as a responsible global citizen, we have increased our contributions to the UNHCR from US$50,000 to US$60,000. On top of this general donation, can we also consider donating to the UNHCR programme for Rohingya refugees specifically? Our contribution is comparable to those made by other ASEAN countries, but I sincerely hope we can contribute more to help the Rohingya refugees who so desperately need our help."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00331,2019-03-01-T-005,331,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Chairman, Singapore is a small and open country and economy. It is important for us to maintain strong linkages with all our Southeast Asian neighbours, and have strong and reliable partners in the region. Singaporeans are also living and working abroad in these countries in greater numbers."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00332,2019-03-01-T-005,332,Baey Yam Keng,"Some years ago, I was part of an official delegation led by then-Speaker Halimah Yacob to Laos. We met Singaporeans who were working and living there. I was surprised to meet one who has been living there for more than 20 years."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00333,2019-03-01-T-005,333,Baey Yam Keng,Southeast Asia’s growth outlook is extremely optimistic. There is a young population and a growing middle class. There are many work and career opportunities for Singaporeans to contribute towards and learn from.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00334,2019-03-01-T-005,334,Baey Yam Keng,"Given the growth trajectory and potential of Southeast Asia, there is space to expand our trade, investment and business links with these countries."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00335,2019-03-01-T-005,335,Baey Yam Keng,"We are more familiar with our immediate neighbours, Indonesia and Malaysia, with whom we enjoy close and longstanding partnerships. Beyond them, could MFA provide an update on what Singapore is doing to enhance our political and economic engagement of fellow ASEAN countries, in particular Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, Philippines, and Laos?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00336,2019-03-01-T-005,336,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, we saw several milestones in our relationship with India over the last two years. In 2017, bilateral trade between Singapore and India was S$25.2 billion. Singapore was India's second largest trading partner in ASEAN while India was Singapore's largest trading partner in South Asia."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00337,2019-03-01-T-005,337,Liang Eng Hwa,"In June 2018, India's Prime Minister Modi visited Singapore and was the first Indian Prime Minister to deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue keynote address in Singapore. He acknowledged that the political relations between India and Singapore are among the warmest and closest."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00338,2019-03-01-T-005,338,Liang Eng Hwa,"On the same year, in 2018, he made another visit to Singapore in November to speak at the Singapore FinTech Festival. During the event, he launched a global platform to connect FinTech firms and financial institutions, beginning with ASEAN and Indian banks, and FinTech companies. PM Modi noted that India and Singapore are also working to connect Indian and ASEAN's Small and Medium Enterprises anchored on an Indian platform and expanding it globally."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00339,2019-03-01-T-005,339,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, Singapore also overtook Mauritius to become India's top source of foreign direct investments in the first half of FY2018. These are encouraging developments which we should continue to pursue, particularly given that India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and a bright spot for our Singapore companies to invest in. Could MFA provide an update on the Singapore-India relationships?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00340,2019-03-01-T-005,340,Seah Kian Peng,"The Middle East appears to be far removed from Singapore, but its complex dynamics reach us across thousands of miles. The Israel-Palestine conflict remains of concern to Muslim majority countries and populations. There continues to be clashes along the Israel-Gaza border."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00341,2019-03-01-T-005,341,Seah Kian Peng,"Singapore, being in a region dominated by Muslims, requires us to be vigilant regarding these developments. Singapore is a speck of sand in the politics of the Middle East – but we have old friends there. In 1965, Egypt was the first Arab country to recognise Singapore's independence. We also share common interests, such as the need to promote religious harmony. There are Singaporean students studying in universities in the Middle East."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00342,2019-03-01-T-005,342,Seah Kian Peng,"Notwithstanding the security challenges in the Middle East, countries in the region present opportunities for our businesses given their vast markets and youthful populations."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00343,2019-03-01-T-005,343,Seah Kian Peng,"There is certainly room for us to create closer ties between the South East, and the Middle East."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00344,2019-03-01-T-005,344,Seah Kian Peng,"Increasingly, we find that we may have some role in economic diplomacy. Previous visits by our top leaders have sought to increase business links between our two regions."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00345,2019-03-01-T-005,345,Seah Kian Peng,Singapore’s investments in the Middle East have grown to more than $60 billion in 2012. There are many Singaporeans companies in the region such as Keppel and Sembcorp Group.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00346,2019-03-01-T-005,346,Seah Kian Peng,"Recently, Environment and Water Resources Minister and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Mr Masagos Zulkifli has suggested that Singapore and the Middle East could work together to develop water management technologies."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00347,2019-03-01-T-005,347,Seah Kian Peng,"Given these developments, I would like to ask the Minister to provide an update on our key engagements with the Middle East for 2019? How much have our investments grown since 2012 and have they borne fruit? How does Singapore balance our engagements with Middle Eastern countries amidst tensions in the region?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00348,2019-03-01-T-005,348,Amrin Amin,"Singapore and Japan enjoy a longstanding and close relationship underpinned by multi-faceted cooperation including trade and connectivity, and science and technology."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00349,2019-03-01-T-005,349,Amrin Amin,"Singapore and Japan also share strong people-to-people relations and cooperate on capacity building in other countries. There is much that Singapore can learn from Japan's experience in various areas. This being the case, there is room for both sides to build on our existing good bilateral relationship to share ideas and solutions that will help tackle issues of common interest. Some common challenges include ageing and declining populations."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00350,2019-03-01-T-005,350,Amrin Amin,"Could MFA provide an update on Singapore-Japan relations, in particular, on new areas of cooperation with Japan."

We have good economic cooperation and share a strong people-to-people ties. Many Singaporeans have taken an interest in various aspects of Korean culture, such as K-pop, K-drama and K-food."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00352,2019-03-01-T-005,352,Ong Teng Koon,"Last year, we hosted several high-level visits to Singapore including an introductory visit by the Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha in March followed by a State visit by President Moon Jae-in in July."

He said that cooperation between Singapore and the ROK would intensify to jointly prepare for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The ROK has one of the most innovative economies globally with a heavy emphasis on smart technologies and focus on research and development. Given Singapore's interest in developing a Smart Nation, there is room for both sides to broaden existing areas of cooperation and tackle common challenges."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00354,2019-03-01-T-005,354,Ong Teng Koon,"Could MFA provide an update on Singapore's relations with the ROK, in particular, the areas of our bilateral cooperation?"

So, it is good news that the strong EU-Singapore relations reached another milestone recently when the European Parliament approved the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the EU-Singapore Investment Protection Agreement."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00356,2019-03-01-T-005,356,Cheng Li Hui,"It is good news that 84% of our exports will be able to enter the EU duty-free, while the tariffs for the remaining products will be removed from the third to fifth year onwards. There will also be better intellectual protection for companies and individuals."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00357,2019-03-01-T-005,357,Cheng Li Hui,"Overall, it a pretty optimistic outlook where Singapore and the EU have further opportunities in the many years ahead to strengthen our trade and investment relations as the companies have now improved access to each other’s markets."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00358,2019-03-01-T-005,358,Cheng Li Hui,"Mr Chairman, this year will also be a critical year for the EU because its key institutions will see leadership changes. In May, the European Parliament will have its elections, while the European Council and the European Commission will have new Presidents."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00359,2019-03-01-T-005,359,Cheng Li Hui,"As the overall political climate in Europe is likely to shift, can the Minister provide an update on how we are engaging the EU and its member states in the face of these changes?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00360,2019-03-01-T-005,360,Arasu Duraisamy,"Sir, I note that the European Union-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) was recently approved by the European Parliament (EP). This is a positive development that will serve to enhance the already robust trade and investment relations with the EU and the individual EU member states."

Singapore has signed a number of bilateral trade agreements with the EU as a block. If Brexit does indeed happen, can the MFA elucidate  one, how will it potentially affect our relations with both the UK and the EU? How do we plan to manage our relationship with the UK in the post-Brexit era? And two, will there be plans to ink separate agreements with the UK once Brexit is finalised?"

However, in the recent years, it is evident that Canada has stepped up its engagement in the region. This is reflected in the two-way trade between Canada and the ASEAN member states, which increased to S$23.8 billion in 2017."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00365,2019-03-01-T-005,365,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"More recently, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau visited Singapore to attend the 33rd ASEAN Summit and related Summits as the Guest of the ASEAN Chair, and demonstrated Canada’s interest to the region. It was also a pleasant surprise to learn of Prime Minister Trudeau’s ancestral ties to Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00366,2019-03-01-T-005,366,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"While Singapore and Canada may be geographically distant, I believe we do share some key commonalities. Both countries support a rules-based multilateral trading system and uphold the shared values of multiculturalism. Both countries are also amongst the first six signatories that ratified the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in 2018, allowing the agreement to enter into force. Prime Minister Trudeau has said that the relations between Singapore and Canada ""will only deepen as the CPTPP comes into force and creates new opportunities and good, middle class jobs for people in both our countries""."

We are after all more than 10,000 km away. Yet, whether it is melting ice caps and rising sea levels, or the possibility of a new trade route, distant Arctic developments affect our very shores. Can MFA explain how our observership in the Arctic Council contributes to our understanding of how development in the Arctic impact Singapore? Can MFA update the House on Singapore’s response to rising sea levels, and the possible opening up of the Northern Sea Routes? How should our businesses prepare themselves for the changes in the Arctic?"

We are a small country with no natural resources, but have successfully harnessed technology, including sensors and automated meters, to fulfil our ambitions of becoming a smart city. Can we use Singapore’s home-grown innovations and leverage on our smart-city experiences to contribute to the ""Smart Arctic"" within our networks?"

The Arctic has been warming at twice the rate as any other place in the world. Can our academia also contribute to the body of research to inform global intervention?"

It is a connected world after all, and we can help to drive sustainable practices through regional forums such as ASEAN. Going ahead, how can we facilitate more regional understanding of the Arctic concerns? How can we continue to meaningfully engage with the Arctic Council and the Arctic Council member states?"

Americans and Europeans are doing so because they feel their jobs and ways of life are threatened by globalisation. Their heartlanders want to know how trade benefits them."

How has Singapore addressed this growing backlash against trade and economic integration around the world? What can we do to uphold the open and rules-based multilateral trading system for the benefit of all?"

2019-03-01-T-005-S-00378,2019-03-01-T-005,378,Mohamed Irshad,"On 8 March 2018, Singapore, together with 11 other countries, signed a version of the TPP that did not include the involvement of the United States – the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) was signed by Singapore and 11 other countries. I understand that the CPTPP has come into force on 30 December 2018."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00379,2019-03-01-T-005,379,Mohamed Irshad,"One of most important strategic objectives of the TPP for Singapore was that it would have entrenched the US engagement in the region. Without the US participation in the CPTPP, what are the benefits for Singapore to stay in the CPTPP? Chairman, I take my second cut."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00380,2019-03-01-T-005,380,Mohamed Irshad,"We are confronted with several geopolitical security concerns today. In the age of the digital revolution that we live in today, fake news and cybersecurity breaches are increasingly prevalent and has the potential to erode the trust between Government and society that has been carefully built up over the years."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00381,2019-03-01-T-005,381,Mohamed Irshad,"Sometimes, these have even become a tool of foreign policy. Reports suggest that a range of state and non-state actors are engaging in disinformation operations here, and these operators who have used online news articles and social media platforms to influence Singaporeans and legitimise other states international actions."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00382,2019-03-01-T-005,382,Mohamed Irshad,"How does MFA intend to combat fake news and educate our citizens properly about our foreign policy, in particular, our younger generation?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00383,2019-03-01-T-005,383,,Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00384,2019-03-01-T-005,384,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Chairman, in July last year, Dr Henry Kissinger – probably the most senior Secretary of State and Foreign Secretary in the world – declared, ""We are in a very, very grave period."""
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00385,2019-03-01-T-005,385,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We are, in fact, witnessing the rapid unravelling of the post-World War Two global order. And this unravelling is being accompanied by profound shifts in the balance of geopolitical power and also by unprecedented leaps in technology. And these changes are not a passing transient phenomenon. No one knows how long it will take for the world to set onto a new stable trajectory again. For Singapore, our external environment therefore will be increasingly volatile, ambiguous, complex and uncertain. And we cannot afford the luxury of navel-gazing."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00386,2019-03-01-T-005,386,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Let me therefore address the key foreign policy concerns, which, in fact, have been brought up by all the Members who have spoken before me."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00387,2019-03-01-T-005,387,Vivian Balakrishnan,"First, Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Charles Chong asked about Sino-US tensions. I agree with both of you this is the most important bilateral relationship in the global system. And the ability, or lack thereof, of the US and China to find a new modus vivendi will shape our era."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00388,2019-03-01-T-005,388,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The US actually envisioned and underwrote the post-World War Two global order, now 70 years old  ""Pax Americana"". In 1960, American share of global GDP was 40%. At that level, it was worth its while for the US to be a unilateral benefactor, umpire - global policeman, indeed - for the world. But its share has now declined to 24% of global GDP. Therefore, it is a completely legitimate political question for American voters to question whether it is worth their while to continue to sacrifice American ""blood and treasure"" for international interests. And there is an increasing bipartisan consensus that America has been taken advantage of by China, and must now play hardball."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00389,2019-03-01-T-005,389,Vivian Balakrishnan,"On the other hand, China is pursuing the ""China dream"" and is determined that the ""century of humiliation"" will not be repeated. It will not allow the US or any other power to stop it from taking what it believes is its rightful place in the world."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00390,2019-03-01-T-005,390,Vivian Balakrishnan,"This dynamic between the two powers is therefore shifting from one of engagement to one of strategic rivalry and competition. And consequently, new strategic architectures will arise. And countries, including we, will come under intense pressure to choose sides."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00391,2019-03-01-T-005,391,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Even if current Sino-US trade tensions are resolved, the strategic contest will continue to be waged but it will include areas  defence, energy, cyber security, and even outer space. And we can expect this major power rivalry to sharpen, especially in the technological arena. The ongoing arguments about 5G technology are a case in point. Both the US and China know that the first country to master the Fourth Industrial Revolution will have a huge advantage."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00392,2019-03-01-T-005,392,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Second, the digital revolution has already triggered disruptions in many other parts of the world. A rise in computing power, an explosion in big data, as well as progress in automation, robotics, new computational techniques, and smart technology have transformed societies and economies, and disrupted phenomena all over the world, including in Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00393,2019-03-01-T-005,393,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The digital revolution, which is still in its early phases, has also ushered a new Gilded Age, where the fruits of economic growth are unevenly distributed. The winners in this era are the giant technology companies and the digital oligarchs who control all the data flows. The losers are entire industries and less skilled workers who are at risk of being displaced by thee smart technologies. Workers everywhere in the world are anxious. They feel squeezed, and especially in the West, there has been a stagnation in middle-class wages for several decades."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00394,2019-03-01-T-005,394,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Consequently, with the erosion of the middle-class in developed countries, you will see that they are channelling their frustration towards easy scapegoats – the obvious ones  immigration; free trade - and increasingly, you will see that voters in the middle have become disenchanted with mainstream political parties."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00395,2019-03-01-T-005,395,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Populist politicians, who promise to impose protectionist and nationalistic policies and appeal to primordial loyalties of race, language and religion, are on the rise everywhere. We in Singapore must not allow these disruptive forces to fracture our own society. We can, and we must master the technologies of the future so that our people – our citizens - can remain successful and united. Then, and only then, can we preserve our independence and make decisions based on our own sovereign interests."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00396,2019-03-01-T-005,396,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The advances in information technology have made Singaporeans far more media-savvy, and has exposed us to the crowded marketplace of competing viewpoints and disinformation. But we must also be aware that this also raises the risk of us being influenced by foreign entities who are using these new tools, including using them in the political arena."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00397,2019-03-01-T-005,397,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Third, another worrying consequence of this uneven distribution of growth - both within countries and across countries - is the inevitable rise of protectionism and nationalism across the world."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00398,2019-03-01-T-005,398,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Around the globe, the right and left political wings have drifted further apart, hollowing out the political centre. The far right has responded to popular disenchantment by focusing on immigration and free trade. The liberals have tacked even further left and demanded radical redistribution. We are not so bad in this House. But you can hear faint echoes of those same political siren calls. This tumult of domestic politics and political polarisation has created a geopolitical order dominated by increasingly short-term transactional ethos and a zero-sum mind-set."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00399,2019-03-01-T-005,399,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Fourth, the global, multilateral rules-based trading system, embodied by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is now under serious threat."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00400,2019-03-01-T-005,400,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Ms Tin Pei Ling, Prof Walter Theseira asked about how we will try to uphold the multilateral trading system. The free, open, rules-based multilateral system actually has underpinned the success of Singapore and ASEAN and has been the formula for peace and prosperity for many decades."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00401,2019-03-01-T-005,401,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Unfortunately, countries under domestic political pressure increasingly view multilateral agreements on issues such as trade, climate change, security, arms control, cybersecurity, they view multilateral agreements as shackles on sovereignty and a burden on economic growth."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00402,2019-03-01-T-005,402,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Therefore, leaders in these countries are resorting to unilateral actions and prefer bilateral deals instead of multilateral deals. They repudiate multilateral approaches and the multilateral institutions that have kept the peace and facilitated prosperity."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00403,2019-03-01-T-005,403,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, over time, trade connectivity may shrink, tit-for-tat action on disputes will increase, and our ability respond to global challenges like radicalism, cybersecurity, and climate change will be impaired. Left unchecked, this will be a negative-sum game for everyone. Closer to home, we must remain vigilant about threats to regional stability and security."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00404,2019-03-01-T-005,404,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We are witnessing a surge in identity politics and exclusive extremism that raises the risk for radicalism and terrorism in our region. The return of ISIS fighters to Southeast Asia and the episodes of violence which we have see in the southern Philippines last year, are stark reminders that this is a clear and present danger. Mr Louis Ng also asked about the refugee situation at the Myanmar-Bangladesh border. Both of us have been there. I can tell you this remains an issue of concern. Dr Maliki will elaborate on our response later."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00405,2019-03-01-T-005,405,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In just the last few days, we have witnessed recent escalations of tension between India and Pakistan – again, another reminder that the old fault-lines remain are volatile and are susceptible to political exploitation. Therefore, the question which all of you have posed is how should we, in Singapore, respond to these challenges in this current state of the world. I would submit that our foreign policy principles remain as salient today as they were at our independence when constructed by Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr S Rajaratnam."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00406,2019-03-01-T-005,406,Vivian Balakrishnan,"First, we must continue to promote a rules-based international order. A system that upholds the rights and sovereignty of all states and the rule of law is important, especially to a small city-state like us. Without it, small countries will have very little chance of survival. Under a rules-based system, bigger powers do not get a free pass to act as they will. But in the exchange for that, what they would benefit from is an orderly, stable global environment. We all know that in Singapore, our trade volume is three times our GDP. I think all Members agree with me; that we must stand up for the multilateral, rules-based global trading system. This is not a debating point; this is our lifeblood for us in Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00407,2019-03-01-T-005,407,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, we continue to play an active role at the WTO, and in constantly trying to negotiate a web of free trade agreements at both the bilateral and multilateral level. Last year, we ratified the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Yes, in fact this deal started off with four small states – Singapore, New Zealand, Brunei and Chile. Then the Americans, Japanese, everyone else came in, and it became the TPP. And then America pulled out. Fortunately, with Japanese leadership and active support from the other 11 countires, we got the CPTPP signed, and then, to my pleasant surprise, enough of us ratified it so that it came into force on 30th December 2018. This is important. This leaves the door open. Hopefully, the United States, at some point, will find a political way to come back and to engage in trade and a strategic level with the Asia-Pacific. The CPTPP represents a market of approximately 500 million people and 22% of global trade, and will provide our companies with increased market access in the Asia-Pacific and these figures exclude the US. I am also happy to note there has been substantial progress on the negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and leaders of all the RCEP participating countries have committed to conclude the RCEP later this year."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00408,2019-03-01-T-005,408,Vivian Balakrishnan,"If we get this done, it would encompass 45% of the world's population and amount to 30% of global GDP. This would be big. We have also launched, and by this, I mean Singapore, Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with MERCOSUR, the Pacific Alliance, and the Eurasian Economic Union. The European Parliament just two weeks ago, voted in favour of ratifying the EU Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA). This is the first bilateral trade agreement signed between the EU and an ASEAN country. It signals the EU's commitment to step up engagement with Southeast Asia, and will be, we hope, a pathfinder for future agreements between EU and other ASEAN member states, and ultimately, of course, we hope that there will be an EU ASEAN Free Trade Agreement."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00409,2019-03-01-T-005,409,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We should also remember that as a port at the edge of the narrow straits that ultimately connects the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean, freedom of navigation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is absolutely critical for Singapore. And this is why we have always participated actively at the United Nations and in the formulation of international regimes and norms."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00410,2019-03-01-T-005,410,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We were a key player in the negotiation for the Law of the Sea Treaty that is UNCLOS, and also for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, on which I spent four and a half years of my life on. We continue to contribute actively to shaping new norms to govern the global commons, including emerging areas such as cyberspace and outer space."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00411,2019-03-01-T-005,411,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Second principle  we must always be a credible, consistent and reliable partner. We will continue to be honest brokers. We will deal fairly and openly with all parties. The key point is this and many of the Members have asked, how are you going to deal with people who force you, who are trying to force you to choose sides. The key point is our neutrality. And that Singapore cannot be bought, nor can we be bullied. We are not ""for"" or ""against"" anyone – we are ""pro-Singapore"". We are Singaporeans. We are ""pro-Singaporeans."" We will be nobody's stooge. We will not act on behalf of any other power. We act consistently and purely in the long-term interest of Singaporeans."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00412,2019-03-01-T-005,412,Vivian Balakrishnan,"And in fact, it is this sense of strategic predictability that has enabled Singapore to build up trust and goodwill and relevance, with all the major powers. And because we are credible, Singapore has been able to play a constructive role in international affairs. And we have kept up good relations with all the major powers. The US remains a key partner for us."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00413,2019-03-01-T-005,413,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We have continued our close cooperation in both defence and security spheres. We have strengthened our economic ties. Last year, both US President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited Singapore. While the current US Administration has adopted an unconventional approach towards issues such as trade, actually the fundamentals that underpin the strong bilateral relationship with us remain."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00414,2019-03-01-T-005,414,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Charles Chong asked about the US' engagement of the region. The US has significant investments in Southeast Asia and broad-based links with many Asian countries. In fact, the US has more invested in Southeast Asia than it has invested in India, China and Japan combined! Amazing statistics. I only discovered this when I read Vice President Mike Pence's speech two years ago and every time I meet, both the President and senior members of the administration, I remind them that the US has real ""skin in the game"" in Southeast Asia."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00415,2019-03-01-T-005,415,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The US has rolled out several initiatives to demonstrate its continued commitment to the region, including the US$113 million in new economic initiatives, and another US$300 million in funding for regional security cooperation. Mr Henry Kwek focused on our longstanding relations with China. In fact, several Members brought that up."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00416,2019-03-01-T-005,416,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Well, last year, we enjoyed a very good series of exchange of visits at the highest level. We also maintain regular exchanges through institutionalised platforms such as the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC), chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, the Singapore-China Forum on Leadership, also chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, and Singapore-China Social Governance Forum, again chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00417,2019-03-01-T-005,417,Vivian Balakrishnan,"On the economic front, Singapore, remains surprisingly as China's top foreign investor. We have skin in the game. While China has been our largest trading partner since 2013, both sides concluded the upgrade of the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement in 2018, and this will bring our economic cooperation to new heights. My colleagues will elaborate on these accounts in greater detail later, but the point I want to make is this  even at a time of increasing tensions and polarisation, we have maintained relations with both these key powers in a way that is robust, constructive and sets us up well for the future."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00418,2019-03-01-T-005,418,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Low Thia Khiang delivered an excellent speech, and I really could not find anything to disagree with him. His key point was whether we should shift our strategic focus to ASEAN. Actually, it is not about shifting strategic focus, but recognising that ASEAN has always been a cornerstone of Singapore's foreign policy and for our engagement with the region and the rest of the world. And I completely agree with him that we must strengthen the open and inclusive ASEAN-centric regional architecture."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00419,2019-03-01-T-005,419,Vivian Balakrishnan,"When we were the ASEAN Chair last year, we launched several initiatives to boost regional integration and to increase key partners' stake in the development of our region, including the establishment of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) and the Model ASEAN Extradition Treaty. We also achieved several key milestones for the ASEAN-China relations during the three years that we were the coordinator for that relationship from 2015 to 2018."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00420,2019-03-01-T-005,420,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We upgraded the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), a big step towards our goal of achieving two-way trade in excess of US$1 trillion and investment of US$500 billion between ASEAN and China by 2020. We are well on the way to achieving these targets. Both sides agreed on a single draft negotiating text for the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea. We will not solve all the problems there, but it is an important confidence building step."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00421,2019-03-01-T-005,421,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Vikram Nair asked about the progress of these negotiations. We are working towards completing the first reading by this year. We are encouraged by the momentum, but we should also realistically recognise that there is still a lot of work to be done. Both sides have also charted the future direction of the ASEAN-China relationship with the ASEAN-China Strategic Partnership Vision 2030, which was adopted at the 21st ASEAN-China Summit in November last year. My colleagues will again further elaborate on this later on."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00422,2019-03-01-T-005,422,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Our credibility has also consistently won us a seat at the G20 table over several years. I do not need to remind you that we are not among the 20 largest economies in the world. We are not there, but yet, we have been invited. And more recently we have been invited by Japan, the current G20 President, to participate in the G20 Meetings and the Osaka Summit later this year. We look forward to working closely with Japan to support Japan's G20 Presidency and its ambitious vision."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00423,2019-03-01-T-005,423,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Third, Singapore must continuously create relevance for ourselves so that we can be a successful and vibrant country. And here, I want to quote Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and he said, ""We must make ourselves relevant so that other countries have an interest in our continued survival and prosperity as a sovereign and independent nation. Singapore cannot take its relevance for granted. Singapore has to continually reconstruct itself to keep its relevance to the world and to create political and economic space.” If we are not successful, if we are not united, if we are not stable, we would be completely irrelevant. Mr Lee has also reminded us that there is no irreplaceable function that a small country performs."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00424,2019-03-01-T-005,424,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore was asked to host the 1st US-DPRK Summit last June. I think I have shared with Members before that we did not put up our hands to ask to host, but when we were asked, we had to say yes. But we are proud to have played a small part in easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. I think this reaffirms Singapore's reputation as an impartial, reliable and neutral, safe country, and a trusted and consistent partner. I want to thank all Singaporeans again for their forbearance and for showing the world what we can do at short notice, putting on a safe event which put us on the map, which made Singapore one of the most searched google terms, and hopefully people know where we are."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00425,2019-03-01-T-005,425,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We know that Vietnam just hosted the Second US-DPRK Summit in Hanoi. We know that things did not go exactly according to plan, but both sides will continue their dialogue, and we hope that their efforts in the future will ultimately lead to lasting peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00426,2019-03-01-T-005,426,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Finally, we must always aim to be a friend to all but an enemy of none. This is especially so for our immediate neighbourhood, where peace and stability are absolutely essential. Our closest neighbours will always be Malaysia and Indonesia. This is a geographical fact and therefore, they will always be of special importance to us. Mr Vikram Nair and Assoc Prof Dr Faishal Ibrahim asked about our relations with Malaysia. Mr Nair and Dr Chia Shi-Lu also asked about our relations with Indonesia."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00427,2019-03-01-T-005,427,Vivian Balakrishnan,"For Malaysia, although several bilateral issues have come to the fore in recent months, in fact, in just the last three months. We remain committed to resolving these issues in an amicable and constructive manner, and in strict accordance with bilateral agreements and international law."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00428,2019-03-01-T-005,428,Vivian Balakrishnan,"On the port limits issue, officials have been meeting to discuss measures to de-escalate the situation. Both sides are aware of the urgent need to prevent accidents and untoward incidents, like the recent collision between the Greece-registered bulk carrier Pireas and the Malaysian Government vessel Polaris, which was illegally anchored in Singapore Territorial Waters. The working group of senior officials is due to submit its recommendations to the two Foreign Ministers in early March, which is now."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00429,2019-03-01-T-005,429,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The Transport Ministers and the senior officials from both sides have been meeting to discuss the arrangements for Seletar Airport and the airspace over Southern Johor, including the instrumented approaches into Seletar Airport, and Malaysia’s Restricted Area over Pasir Gudang. Again, we look forward to finding a solution that is mutually agreeable. Fortunately or unfortunately, in my capacity as Acting Transport Minister, this is also my problem at this point in time."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00430,2019-03-01-T-005,430,Vivian Balakrishnan,"For Indonesia, our bilateral cooperation remains deep, multi-faceted and reinforced by frequent high-level exchanges."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00431,2019-03-01-T-005,431,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Our two economies are inextricably linked, with economic cooperation robust and expanding. Singapore remains Indonesia’s top foreign investor in 2018, US$9.2 billion worth of realised investments. We have committed investments in Indonesia such as the Kendal Industrial Park in Semarang and the Nongsa Digital Park in Batam. The US$10 billion bilateral financial arrangement, which was announced at the 2018 Leaders’ Retreat, and signed on 5 November 2018, reflects the confidence in the economic fundamentals of both countries."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00432,2019-03-01-T-005,432,Vivian Balakrishnan,Singapore and Indonesia also share common defence and security challenges. Our agencies collaborate closely through frequent defence exercises and in intelligence sharing for counter-terrorism purposes
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00433,2019-03-01-T-005,433,Vivian Balakrishnan,Mr Alex Yam asked about our relations with Brunei. We have a longstanding special relationship with Brunei and will continue to strengthen these bilateral ties. Our strong defence cooperation – many of us have trained in the jungles of Brunei – and Currency Interchangeability Agreement remain important pillars of our bilateral relationship.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00434,2019-03-01-T-005,434,Vivian Balakrishnan,We will leverage on other platforms to build Singapore's networks and soft power.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00435,2019-03-01-T-005,435,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Ms Joan Pereira asked about the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP). The SCP is a key example of our commitment to share our experience with other developing countries through human resource development. Since 1992, over 124,000 foreign officials have participated in our programmes and they represent an invaluable reservoir of goodwill for Singapore. My colleagues will provide further details."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00436,2019-03-01-T-005,436,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Terence Ho asked about Singapore’s soft power. The intangibles of foreign policy – the attitudes, the perspectives, the mind-sets – are very important. And in fact, they are the ultimate currency of our foreign policy because if people like us, trust us, depend on us, I think we will continue to do well."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00437,2019-03-01-T-005,437,Vivian Balakrishnan,"To cite an example, many of our overseas missions use cultural diplomacy to showcase the diverse heritage of Singapore, a heritage which embeds us firmly in the ancient and rich cultures of Asia. When we are able to showcase our arts practitioners' stories and innovative techniques, it allows friends in other countries to understand Singapore a little better, and to get to know our people at a more intimate level."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00438,2019-03-01-T-005,438,Vivian Balakrishnan,"More broadly, by being successful, by being honest, by building a society which is open, pragmatic, hardworking and rooted in our multicultural heritage, we build warm people-to-people relations and a store of global goodwill to Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00439,2019-03-01-T-005,439,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So here again I want to agree with Mr Low. I think you have made a very important point about humility in success. And we will pursue his suggestions on deeper engagement with ASEAN through economic projects, people-to-people ties and digital diplomacy."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00440,2019-03-01-T-005,440,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Looking forward, we must continue to strengthen our bilateral and multilateral partnerships with our neighbours and the major powers. It is important to manage our key accounts adroitly in order to preserve our strategic space and options. We will continue to maintain constructive and open engagement with Malaysia to manage and to resolve the differences and to advance the bilateral cooperation for mutual benefit."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00441,2019-03-01-T-005,441,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Indonesia is on track to hold legislative and presidential elections on 17th April 2019. I want to emphasise that Singapore does not take sides in the elections of any country, including our neighbours. We are committed to working with the government of the day."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00442,2019-03-01-T-005,442,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We hope for a smooth and peaceful election that will contribute towards Indonesia’s long-term stability and success. We look forward to continuing the strong and constructive partnership with Indonesia. We also look forward to working with Brunei to explore new areas of cooperation, such as aquaculture and agriculture. We will continue to engage the younger generation of Bruneian leaders through the annual Young Leaders’ Programme, which will be held in Brunei in 2019."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00443,2019-03-01-T-005,443,Vivian Balakrishnan,We will also continue to deepen and broaden our links and cooperation with other neighbours in the region.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00444,2019-03-01-T-005,444,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The Sino-US relations will continue to be the defining major power relationship in the 21st century. It is in everyone's interest to keep the US and China engaged in the region. Singapore has a big stake in good Sino-US relations; we will continue in a humble and constructive way to position ourselves as a helpful and reliable partner to both, and where relevant to be a valuable interlocutor."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00445,2019-03-01-T-005,445,Vivian Balakrishnan,"On the bilateral front, we will continue to enhance economic, defence, security including cybersecurity cooperation with the US."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00446,2019-03-01-T-005,446,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We are also working closely together with China, including on its Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00447,2019-03-01-T-005,447,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We should also continue to engage other key partners such as Australia, Japan, India and New Zealand, to keep them engaged in our region, and to establish Singapore as a partner of choice."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00448,2019-03-01-T-005,448,Vivian Balakrishnan,Australia remains a very close friend of Singapore. We continue to build on the positive momentum created by the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership which we signed in 2015. We are exploring new areas of cooperation such as the digital economy and cybersecurity.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00449,2019-03-01-T-005,449,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Japan continues to be a close and like-minded partner. We are expanding cooperation in areas, such as the Smart Cities, infrastructure cooperation, as well as the provision of technical assistance to third countries through the renewed Japan-Singapore Partnership Programme for the 21st Century."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00450,2019-03-01-T-005,450,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Our relationship with India remains robust and forward-looking. India has made great strides in digitalisation, and we are enhancing our FinTech collaborations, including linking up our electronic payment systems, banks, and businesses. With India's large population, which by the way will shortly overtake China to be the largest population in the world, Singapore's position as a regional hub gives us tremendous potential for us to work together."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00451,2019-03-01-T-005,451,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We continue to deepen relations with New Zealand, another like-minded and longstanding partner. In fact, we have just concluded negotiations to upgrade our bilateral FTA last November, and we are working to upgrade our relations to an Enhanced Partnership later this year."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00452,2019-03-01-T-005,452,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We reaffirm our commitment to free trade and an open, rules-based international order and multilateral trading system."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00453,2019-03-01-T-005,453,Vivian Balakrishnan,"As we develop our national capacity to innovate, we have also stepped up efforts to profile Singapore’s thought leadership in today’s innovation-led economy, and our contributions, through technical assistance under the Singapore Cooperation Programme. This has helped expand our mindshare and, as Mr Low reminded us, to increase our soft power in various parts of the world."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00454,2019-03-01-T-005,454,Vivian Balakrishnan,"But as I have said repeatedly in this House, diplomacy begins at home. Division at home, within the shores of Singapore, will paralyse our foreign policy. We need to continue to strengthen the resilience and unity of our citizens, and to build a deeper appreciation of the fundamental principles of Singapore's foreign policy and our vulnerabilities as a small country."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00455,2019-03-01-T-005,455,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We must continue to invest a fair share of our resources in diplomacy so that we can stand our ground, protect our sovereignty and keep Singapore safe. But we will never ask for more than we need. In fact, I would like to remind the House, if you look at all the Ministries' Budgets, MFA is the lowest and MFA has not asked for an increase this year. What we are asking for is more domestic support. And I am very grateful for the hard work and ingenuity of our diplomats; and the sacrifices of their families."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00456,2019-03-01-T-005,456,Vivian Balakrishnan,"All that we do in Singapore, including the larger Budget debate, must take into account the profound changes taking place in the region and world around us."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00457,2019-03-01-T-005,457,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We have to accept the geo-political realities and vulnerabilities of being a small island city state. We take the world as it is. But this does not mean that we are powerless. We must stay nimble, we must continue to seize opportunities whilst maintaining our balance in the midst of a rapidly evolving world, and we can do this with your support. We will secure Singapore's continued independence, well-being and prosperity. Thank you. [Applause.]"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00458,2019-03-01-T-005,458,,Senior Minister of State Maliki.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00459,2019-03-01-T-005,459,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. Minister Vivian outlined key foreign policy challenges for Singapore. I will now highlight opportunities for Singapore. First, strengthening existing partnerships; second, enlarging our circle of friends; and third, expanding and intensifying our outreach."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00460,2019-03-01-T-005,460,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"First, on strengthening existing partnerships."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00461,2019-03-01-T-005,461,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"I will begin with the US, a major defence and economic partner for Singapore. For decades, the US has been a stabilising force in the Asia-Pacific. Its continued commitment and sustained military presence in the region is even more vital today, given the evolving regional developments. We have developed broad and substantive defence ties with the US, underpinned by regular high-level visits, joint military training, defence technology cooperation, and professional exchanges."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00462,2019-03-01-T-005,462,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Since 2014, Singapore has contributed military assets and personnel towards the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS led by the US. During US Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Singapore in November, we signed a Letter of Intent to jointly develop a Singapore-US Cybersecurity Technical Assistance Programme. Last month, I attended the Meeting of the Ministers of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in Washington DC to share Singapore's ongoing efforts to build regional counter-terrorism capabilities. We are working towards the renewal in 2020 of our 1990 landmark agreement granting the US access to military facilities in Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00463,2019-03-01-T-005,463,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Notwithstanding our different positions on trade, Singapore and the US continue to enjoy robust economic relations. It remains our largest foreign direct investor. Its investment has increased by some 21% from S$280 billion in 2016, to S$339 billion in 2017. Nearly 4,500 US companies have set up shop here, creating jobs in finance, insurance, manufacturing, and trade. We signed new cooperation agreements on energy, standards, advanced manufacturing, and technology partnerships, as well as automatic exchange of financial account information."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00464,2019-03-01-T-005,464,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Incoming visits by President Donald Trump and Vice President Pence, and several other Cabinet Secretaries to Singapore, as well as Minister Vivian and other Singapore Ministers to the US last year, allowed both sides to exchange views on issues of mutual interest. We will sustain this steady rhythm of high-level engagements in 2019."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00465,2019-03-01-T-005,465,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Closer to home, ASEAN continues to be a key pillar of Singapore's foreign policy, as articulated by Minister Vivian earlier. When ASEAN was formed in 1967, Southeast Asia was a troubled and unstable region, rife with hostility and confrontation. It was a leap of faith for ASEAN's five founding Members to put aside their differences to bring the region together. The expansion of ASEAN from five to 10 Members, brought new opportunities and challenges, including creating consensus amongst 10 states with diverse political systems, histories and levels of economic development. ASEAN has come a long way since, but maintaining ASEAN's unity, centrality and relevance remains as important as ever."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00466,2019-03-01-T-005,466,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Vikram Nair and Dr Teo Ho Pin asked how ASEAN can strengthen its centrality and speak in one voice on contentious issues. Under the theme of ""Resilient and Innovative"" during our 2018 ASEAN Chairmanship, we focused on enhancing ASEAN Centrality, unity and relevance. For example, we launched initiatives to enhance aviation safety for military aircraft, combat terrorism and extremism, as well as strengthen ASEAN's cyber strategy development and capabilities. We deepened economic integration by focusing on growth areas in e-commerce and digital technology. These initiatives boost regional integration and increase key partners' stake in the development of our region."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00467,2019-03-01-T-005,467,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Amidst major power rivalry, ASEAN Member States will increasingly be subject to competing external pressures that may pull us in different directions. Balancing national interests against regional interests is a perennial challenge, but one we can overcome by increasing ASEAN's value proposition to each member and enlarging our sphere of common interests."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00468,2019-03-01-T-005,468,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Dr Teo also asked about the status of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network, or ASCN. The ASCN's 26 pilot cities came together last year to set out ASEAN's definition of a smart city and develop city-specific action plans towards becoming smart cities by 2025. Since 2018, ASCN has secured over 30 partnerships with interested private and public entities. For Singapore businesses, ASCN presents regional business opportunities in many areas, including urban development, human capital development, technology incubation and financial services. Singapore will work with Thailand, this year's ASEAN Chair, to shepherd the ASCN initiative onto its next phase of development."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00469,2019-03-01-T-005,469,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Singapore has taken over the country coordinatorship of ASEAN-EU Dialogue Relations from 2018 to 2021. Mr Muralli Pillai asked about our goals and priorities, and if Brexit will affect ASEAN-EU dialogue relations. While there remains much uncertainty over Brexit, Singapore aims to facilitate concrete and beneficial outcomes for ASEAN-EU dialogue relations. This includes ongoing negotiations on the ASEAN-EU Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement and efforts to resume negotiations on an ASEAN-EU Free Trade Agreement. These initiatives will deepen linkages between two dynamic integrated blocs with a combined market of more than one billion people, and realise significant economic opportunities for our businesses and our peoples. At a recent meeting co-chaired by Minister Vivian, ASEAN and EU Foreign Ministers agreed in-principle to upgrade ASEAN-EU relations to a strategic level and reaffirmed our shared commitment to multilateralism and a rules-based world order."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00470,2019-03-01-T-005,470,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"One complex and evolving issue that ASEAN has to deal with is the situation in the Rakhine State in Myanmar. Understandably, ASEAN Member States are concerned about the situation. The ASEAN Leaders and Foreign Ministers have discussed this issue extensively. However, there are no quick fixes. This is a longstanding and complex issue which needs a political solution."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00471,2019-03-01-T-005,471,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Ms Anthea Ong asked about ASEAN's policy regarding the situation in the Rakhine State. At Myanmar's invitation at the 33rd ASEAN Summit in November 2018, the Leaders agreed to despatch a needs assessment team to the Rakhine State to identify ways to support Myanmar's efforts in the repatriation process. That said, it is ultimately the responsibility of the Myanmar government and its stakeholders to find a viable and durable long-term solution."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00472,2019-03-01-T-005,472,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The discussions at the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, or AICHR, run parallel to and are consistent with the conversations between ASEAN Leaders and Foreign Ministers. Currently, there are no discussions amongst ASEAN on pursuing measures, such as a Human Rights Court, or a regional refugee and asylum policy. We must keep in mind that ASEAN Member States have different approaches in dealing with humanitarian and human rights issues due to their own history and domestic socio-political dynamics. It will be difficult to apply a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00473,2019-03-01-T-005,473,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Louis Ng asked whether Singapore could consider donating to the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, fund for refugees from the Rakhine State, in addition to our general contribution. As a small country with limited resources, we are not a major donor to the UNHCR. However, as Mr Ng pointed out, we increased our annual contributions in 2016. Our contribution is comparable to that of the other ASEAN countries. What is important is to stay focused on creating a conducive environment for refugees to return to the Rakhine State. That can only be achieved through internal dialogue and consensus."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00474,2019-03-01-T-005,474,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"ASEAN also has to deal with the threat of terrorism. Our region faces the heightened threat of returning fighters and radicalised individuals who may be persuaded to carry out attacks where they live. The recent bomb attacks at a cathedral in southern Philippines which claimed at least 20 lives, reminds us of existing threats to regional stability as well as racial and religious harmony. To combat these threats, platforms for information sharing such as the ""Our Eyes"" Initiative are vital."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00475,2019-03-01-T-005,475,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We will continue to work with like-minded countries to promote religious moderation and inter-faith harmony, while contributing to the counter-terrorism capacity-building efforts of our Middle East partners where possible. For instance, when Sheikh Ahmed Al Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Al Azhar, visited Singapore last May at Prime Minister's invitation, he shared insights on Islamic principles and practices in a multi-religious society, and exhorted our Muslim community to stay harmonious and to harness religion as a force for good. Such exchanges are critical, given the potential for extremism and conflicts in the Middle East to spill over in our region."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00476,2019-03-01-T-005,476,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Minister Vivian spoke about our relations with our closest neighbours. Mr Chairman, let me take this opportunity to underscore a few points in Malay."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00477,2019-03-01-T-005,477,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Several bilateral issues have surfaced with Malaysia in recent months, namely the port limits and airspace issues."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00478,2019-03-01-T-005,478,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"On the port limits issue, as members of the House are aware, Malaysia unilaterally extended the Johor Bahru Port Limits on 25 October 2018. Since late November 2018, Malaysian Government vessels have intruded repeatedly into Singapore Territorial Waters. We have protested the purported extension of the Johor Bahru Port Limits and these intrusions. These intrusions do not help Malaysia’s legal case."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00479,2019-03-01-T-005,479,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Instead, they have raised tensions and endangered navigational safety in the area, as shown by the recent collision between Greece-registered bulk carrier Pireas and Malaysian Government vessel Polaris, which was illegally anchored in Singapore Territorial Waters."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00480,2019-03-01-T-005,480,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The officials have been meeting to discuss measures to de-escalate the situation. Both sides are aware of the urgent need to prevent more accidents and untoward incidents. The Working Group is due to submit its recommendations to the two Foreign Ministers in early March.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00481,2019-03-01-T-005,481,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"On airspace, Singapore had planned to upgrade Seletar Airport to use Instrument Landing System (ILS) procedures. The ILS would have allowed flights arriving at Seletar Airport to land safely even in conditions where visibility is poor. However, Malaysia declared a permanent Restricted Area (RA) on 25 December 2018 which has affected flights operating to and from Seletar Airport."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00482,2019-03-01-T-005,482,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Following the meetings between the Foreign Ministers on 8 January 2019 and the Transport Ministers on 23 January 2019, both sides have mutually suspended the ILS procedures and permanent Restricted Area (RA) until 31 March this year. Since then, the Transport Ministers and senior officials from both sides have been meeting regularly to discuss these issues, and we look forward to finding a solution that is mutually agreeable."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00483,2019-03-01-T-005,483,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"As close neighbours, issues will naturally surface from time to time that we have to deal with together. What is important is how we deal with them – discussing in good faith, keeping in compliance with international law, and honouring existing agreements. Despite these current difficulties, Singapore still hopes to work with Malaysia for better relations, and for closer long-term cooperation that will benefit the citizens of both sides."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00484,2019-03-01-T-005,484,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Singapore-Indonesia relations are deep and multi-faceted. Frequent high-level meetings and exchanges underpin our strong ties with Indonesia. My colleagues and I are familiar with Indonesian leaders from the various regions and meet them regularly when they visit Singapore and when we travel there.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00485,2019-03-01-T-005,485,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Our two economies are closely linked. Singapore remained as Indonesia’s top foreign investor. Examples of recent key investments are the Kendal Industrial Park and Nongsa Digital Park. The plan for the Bilateral Financial Arrangement worth US$10 billion was announced at the 2018 Leaders’ Retreat between Prime Minister and President Jokowi, and this clearly demonstrates our mutual trust and confidence in each other’s economies."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00486,2019-03-01-T-005,486,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"In addition, we cooperate closely on the defence, security and counter-terrorism fronts to tackle common challenges. Indonesia will hold its legislative elections and presidential elections in April this year. We wish them a smooth and peaceful elections. We also look forward to continuing our strong, long-standing and cooperative partnership with Indonesia."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00487,2019-03-01-T-005,487,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(In English)  Mr Baey Yam Keng asked about Singapore’s engagement of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. We maintain strong ties with these neighbours through regular high-level exchanges. This year, we will commemorate the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relations with the Philippines. Trade with all six countries continues to grow. Our businesses are keen to collaborate in emerging fields such as FinTech, digital economy, smart cities and renewable energy."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00488,2019-03-01-T-005,488,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Thailand is a longstanding defence partner and continues to support SAF training. We have extensive technical cooperation with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. In 2018, we upgraded our technical cooperation centres in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam to the Singapore Cooperation Centres. These Centres enlarge Singapore’s mindshare by offering an integrated development assistance platform."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00489,2019-03-01-T-005,489,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,This brings me to my second point  that Singapore must strive constantly to enlarge our circle of friends.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00490,2019-03-01-T-005,490,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked for an update on our relationship with India. It is robust, forward-looking, and we have made progress across all pillars of our Strategic Partnership. Defence ties have strengthened. Our navies signed an agreement on logistics cooperation, and celebrated the 25th anniversary of the annual Singapore-India Maritime Bilateral Exercise last year."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00491,2019-03-01-T-005,491,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Singapore is India’s 10th largest trading partner and largest foreign investor. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Official Visit to Singapore in June 2018, we concluded the Second Review of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, known as CECA. Since CECA came into force in 2005, bilateral trade flows have doubled from S$11.18 billion in 2004 to S$25.2 billion in 2017. The updates to CECA will support greater economic cooperation and provide opportunities for our businesses and people. We have also grown our state-level engagement of cities such as Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00492,2019-03-01-T-005,492,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"With both countries making significant strides towards digitalisation, we have established a Joint Working Group to explore further cooperation in FinTech and innovation. We launched an initial link for our payment systems between Singapore’s NETS and India’s RuPay payment systems that will enable workers, tourists, and businesses to make cross-border transactions more securely and conveniently."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00493,2019-03-01-T-005,493,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked about our engagement of emerging markets in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Mr Seah Kian Peng also asked about our key engagements in the Middle East in 2019 and how our efforts have borne fruit."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00494,2019-03-01-T-005,494,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Our engagement of the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia is premised on expanding our economic space, looking after Muslims on pilgrimage, and sharing our development experience."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00495,2019-03-01-T-005,495,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"In the Middle East, our trade grew by 21.5% from S$50.6 billion to S$61.5 billion in 2018. We enjoy regular exchanges at the highest political level. Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean visited Jordan, Oman, and Israel in 2018. In January this year, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman met key Saudi leaders, including Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi has just visited Singapore yesterday where both sides issued a joint declaration on the Singapore-UAE Comprehensive Partnership."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00496,2019-03-01-T-005,496,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"High-level engagements this year reflect the potential for our ties to grow, especially with states trying to reduce oil dependency and diversify their economies. We will leverage the Gulf Cooperation Council-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, and work with our agencies to support our companies through legislative frameworks composed of the Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements, or DTAs, and Bilateral Investment Treaties, or BITs."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00497,2019-03-01-T-005,497,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Every year, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli leads a delegation to Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj Ministerial Meeting to seek an increase in our official Hajj quota. We obtained an increase in Hajj places in 2018. We recognise the limit to the increase that Saudi Arabia can accord each country in light of logistical realities, but will continue to make our case for more Hajj places for our pilgrims."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00498,2019-03-01-T-005,498,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Seah Kian Peng also asked about how Singapore balances its engagements with countries in the Middle East amidst tensions in the region. Several disputes and conflicts persist in the Middle East and North Africa. Singapore’s principle is to keep friendly ties with all countries, regardless of any disputes between them. The diplomatic rift between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt, is ongoing. We hope that all parties will work together to find a solution."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00499,2019-03-01-T-005,499,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The complex, multi-faceted Israeli-Palestinian conflict has particular domestic and regional salience. Tensions continue to simmer at the Israel-Gaza border, and have been exacerbated over the status of Jerusalem. Singapore maintains a principled and consistent position on this issue. We support a negotiated two-state solution with Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace and security. We hope that they can resume direct negotiations and make progress towards a just and durable solution."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00500,2019-03-01-T-005,500,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Meanwhile, we will continue to work with the Palestinian National Authority, or PNA, in practical ways. For example, we shared our development experience with PNA officials, and worked with the Japan International Cooperation Agency to conduct an inaugural ICT programme in Ramallah last month."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00501,2019-03-01-T-005,501,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Israel is one of our oldest partners. 2019 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations with Israel. We have developed a broad-based relationship with shared interests in many sectors such as research and development, and education."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00502,2019-03-01-T-005,502,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We are also gradually stepping up our engagement of Central Asia. The Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy has an on-going partnership with Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan to offer courses on public administration. Singapore companies are also exploring opportunities in education, infrastructure, and oil and gas sectors in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. I plan to visit Uzbekistan soon to explore other opportunities for cooperation."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00503,2019-03-01-T-005,503,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We are looking for opportunities to step up engagement of key countries in Africa. The continent is expected to grow 4% over the next two years. More than 60 Singapore companies, including SMEs across multiple industries, are operating in sectors as wide-ranging as manufacturing, digital economy, transport and logistics, and agribusiness. Today, Singapore is one of Southeast Asia’s largest investors in Africa."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00504,2019-03-01-T-005,504,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Further from home, Singapore’s interaction with Latin America has also grown. Our companies are exploring commercial opportunities in major economies in sectors as diverse as ports, airports, oil and gas, logistics, master planning, and education. MFA has worked with MTI to support these companies' entry into the Latin American markets. We are pursuing two Free Trade Agreements with the region. One is with the MERCOSUR trade bloc which comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, and is the world’s fifth largest economy. The other is with the Pacific Alliance, comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Once concluded, these agreements will help to facilitate trade and investment flows."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00505,2019-03-01-T-005,505,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Last year, we had a series of high-level exchanges with Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. This culminated in a visit by Prime Minister to Buenos Aires in November 2018 for the G20 Leaders’ Summit under Argentina’s Presidency. We will sustain such productive high-level meetings this year, including through Prime Minister's visit to Chile for the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in November 2019."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00506,2019-03-01-T-005,506,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Third, we should continue expanding and intensifying our outreach. Minister Vivian mentioned that Singapore Cooperation Programme, or SCP. The SCP was established in 1992 for Singapore to “give back” to the international community the assistance that we received in our early years of nation-building. It is a key conduit for us to provide human resource capacity-building to fellow developing countries, and has helped to build goodwill for Singapore across the globe."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00507,2019-03-01-T-005,507,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The SCP showcases our expertise and evolving capabilities, and allows our officials and companies to interact with foreign officials. In turn, this creates opportunities for our companies in areas such as urban consultancy services and digital technology."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00508,2019-03-01-T-005,508,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"This year, we have put together a special Climate Action Package of courses to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. As Small Island Developing States continue to be most vulnerable, we will step up our delivery of customised programmes to help them achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We will also contribute to smart city development in our region through our ASCN."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00509,2019-03-01-T-005,509,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"To conclude, Mr Chairman, to meet the foreign policy challenges of the day, we need to be pragmatic and resilient. But to seize the opportunities before us, we need to be optimistic, open-minded and courageous. Looking ahead, we should strengthen ties with our closest partners, enlarge our circle of friends and expand and intensify our outreach. Mr Chairman, I turn the floor over to my colleague Minister of State Sam Tan."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00510,2019-03-01-T-005,510,,"Before that, I would like to propose to take a break now."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00511,2019-03-01-T-005,511,,[(proc text) Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House. (proc text)]

2019-03-01-T-005-S-00518,2019-03-01-T-005,518,,Minister of State Sam Tan.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00519,2019-03-01-T-005,519,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. Sir, Minister Vivian outlined an increasingly complex global environment in which Singapore must operate. Senior Minister of State Maliki spoke on the state of Singapore-US bilateral relations. And I will elaborate on our relationship with China. Mr Chairman, please allow me to do so in Mandarin."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00520,2019-03-01-T-005,520,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Chairman, next year, we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Singapore and China. This is a very important landmark. In reality, our links with China are longstanding, with frequent exchanges long before the establishment of our diplomatic relations. As we all know, our founding Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew visited China in 1976 and China's leader, Deng Xiaoping visited Singapore in 1978. These mutual visits have laid a solid foundation for our bilateral exchanges and cooperation."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00521,2019-03-01-T-005,521,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Just now, Ms Sun Xueling highlighted how Singapore's younger 4G leaders continue to build strong relations with the Chinese leaders, and she also asked how we could take bilateral cooperation to the next level."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00522,2019-03-01-T-005,522,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mr Chairman, indeed, it is crucial that bilateral relations continue to grow seamlessly from one generation to the next. Last year saw a flurry of high-level visits on both sides. Prime Minister Lee, Deputy Prime Minister Teo, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman and many younger 4G Cabinet Ministers visited China. We hosted several Chinese leaders in Singapore, including Premier Li Keqiang, Vice Premier Han Zheng and Vice President Wang Qishan. I visited Wuhan and Changsha in July 2018, where local leaders and I discussed cooperation in a wide range of areas, including modern services such as finance and healthcare."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00523,2019-03-01-T-005,523,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Minister Vivian has highlighted three DPM-level bilateral platforms, namely the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC), the Singapore-China Forum on Leadership and Singapore-China Social Governance Forum. In addition, we have three Government-to-Government projects and seven business and economic councils with Chinese provinces and municipalities. These include Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Sichuan Tianjin and Zhejiang. We have trade and development councils with these municipalities. These institutionalised frameworks and concrete projects allow office-holders, including our 4G leaders and officials from both sides to exchange views and work together to address common challenges in our changing social, economic and political landscape."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00524,2019-03-01-T-005,524,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"The PRC government conferred a Reform and Friendship Award to Mr Lee Kuan Yew last year, in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up, affirming the robust, long-standing friendship between our two countries. Our first Government-to-Government project, the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park or SIP, was first initiated by Mr Lee and will celebrate its 25th anniversary this year. The development of the Suzhou Industrial Park has since inspired many similar initiatives within and outside China."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00525,2019-03-01-T-005,525,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Economic and trade cooperation has all along been a key pillar of the Singapore-China relationship. Since 2013, Singapore has been China's top foreign direct investor, while China has been our largest trading partner. Singapore was the first Asian country to have a comprehensive bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China. This year marks the tenth year since its implementation. Last year, both sides concluded the upgrade of the China-Singapore FTA, advancing our economic and trade cooperation to the next level."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00526,2019-03-01-T-005,526,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Our three Government-to-Government projects with China, namely the SIP, which I mentioned earlier, the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city (SSTEC), and the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity (CCI), are doing well. The SSTEC celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2018 and the CCI-New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor has connected the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road, thereby enhancing connectivity between western China and Southeast Asia and beyond."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00527,2019-03-01-T-005,527,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mr Chairman, as we take stock of what our two countries have accomplished together, we must continue to develop and progress. We cannot stick to our old ways of cooperation. We need to continue to innovate and develop new areas of cooperation for our mutual benefit."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00528,2019-03-01-T-005,528,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"In this regard, we are working closely together in areas relating to the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) that are good for Singapore, for China, and for the region. These projects aim to improve infrastructural connectivity, financial connectivity, third-country cooperation and professional services, including legal and judicial cooperation."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00529,2019-03-01-T-005,529,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Last year, we elevated the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City to a state-level bilateral cooperation project. We are now preparing to establish a comprehensive mechanism for cooperation between Singapore and Shanghai, in addition to the existing seven business and economic councils, thereby opening up a new chapter in our close cooperation."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00530,2019-03-01-T-005,530,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"(In English)  Mr Chairman, now allow me to continue in English. In addition to engaging the major powers, we must continue to strengthen relations with other key partners. Mr Amrin Amin sought an update on the Singapore-Japan relations, and new areas of cooperation with Japan."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00531,2019-03-01-T-005,531,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Our ties with Japan are close and multi-faceted with frequent high-level exchanges. Deputy Prime Minister Teo, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman and several Ministers visited Japan in 2018. In January 2018, I led a delegation to co-chair the 19th Singapore-Kagoshima Conference which is the longest-running forum of its kind that Singapore has with a Japanese prefecture. In line with Japan's G20 priorities, we are exploring possible collaborations with Japan to support infrastructure projects in third countries."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00532,2019-03-01-T-005,532,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mr Ong Teng Koon requested for an update on Singapore-ROK relations. Our relationship with the ROK are warm. ROK President Moon Jae-in made a State Visit to Singapore in July last year and several MOUs were exchanged to enhance our cooperation in trade, environment as well as Small and Medium Enterprises and start-ups. Both countries also discussed new areas of cooperation such as smart grid technologies, e-commerce, FinTech and cybersecurity."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00533,2019-03-01-T-005,533,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"To Mr Henry Kwek's questions on the Korean Peninsula, as Minister Vivian mentioned earlier, the US and the DPRK will continue their dialogue following the second US-DPRK Summit. Continued dialogue will ensure that the tension on the Korean Peninsula remains within control. Singapore will continue to work with the international community to support efforts towards lasting peace and stability on a denuclearised Korean Peninsula. In the meantime, we remain committed to implementing the UN Security Council Resolutions fully."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00534,2019-03-01-T-005,534,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"In the south, Australia is a like-minded partner, with whom we share deep historical ties and similar strategic perspectives. Our two countries share a common interest in promoting trade liberalisation. Bilaterally, our economic ties are strong. Singapore is Australia's largest trade and investment partner in Southeast Asia. We continue to build on the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership signed in 2015. We are exploring ways to further deepen the bilateral relationship at the upcoming Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee meeting. This is a very unique 3+3 meeting involving the Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence Ministers. We look forward to welcoming Australia’s Prime Minister to visit Singapore for the next annual Leaders’ Summit."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00535,2019-03-01-T-005,535,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Ms Cheng Li Hui asked how Singapore is engaging the EU. Singapore and the EU share good ties and we marked a major milestone in the relationship with the signing of the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement or EUSFTA, the EU-Singapore Investment Protection Agreement or EUSIPA and the EU-Singapore Partnership and Cooperation Agreement or EUSPCA in October last year, and their approval by the European Parliament just two weeks ago."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00536,2019-03-01-T-005,536,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mr Arasu asked what we can do beyond the EUSFTA to further relations with key EU members. Complementing the EUSFTA, the EUSIPA will enhance investment and business opportunities, while the EUSPCA will promote cooperation in areas such as education and science and technology. We will continue to work towards the full ratification and entry into force of these agreements."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00537,2019-03-01-T-005,537,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"As the EU undergoes a leadership transition in 2019 this year, we are committed to working with the new leaders to deepen and broaden our ties. We will also strengthen our bilateral relationships with the individual member states in the EU."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00538,2019-03-01-T-005,538,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mr Arasu also asked how Singapore will manage our relationship with the UK in the post-Brexit era. We have strong and longstanding bilateral ties with the UK that exist independently of our engagement through the EU. There are many bilateral agreements which will remain in force. We also recently launched the Singapore-United Kingdom Partnership for the Future to develop existing and new initiatives. As for the agreements with the EU such as the EUSFTA, we are open to having them apply to the UK after Brexit."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00539,2019-03-01-T-005,539,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about Singapore's engagement of Central and Eastern Europe. Singapore enjoys good and growing relations with the emerging markets in Europe, notably, Russia, Turkey, Poland, Romania and the Czech Republic. We have fruitful political exchanges and also ongoing collaborations in various sectors, such as science and technology. We will continue working with other European partners, such as the Eurasian Economic Union, with whom we are currently negotiating an FTA."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00540,2019-03-01-T-005,540,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Ms Jessica Tan requested an update on our engagement of Canada. I am glad to report that good progress has been made over the past year. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Singapore to attend the ASEAN Summit and Related Summits as a Guest of the Chair. A highlight was the signing of agreements on cybersecurity, infrastructure and also smart cities cooperation. Canada provincial governments are strengthening their economic presence in Singapore with the set-up of more provincial offices to promote trade and investments."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00541,2019-03-01-T-005,541,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mr Desmond Choo asked about Singapore's engagement with the Arctic Council (AC). Since becoming an AC observer in 2013, we have had the opportunity to engage Arctic experts and policymakers who can provide us with deeper insights into the possible consequences that a warming Arctic and the opening of new sea routes could have for Singapore. Where we have relevant expertise and experience, we have contributed to the work of the AC in its workshops and task forces, in areas of mutual concern, such as sustainable development and environmental conservation. In particular, our institutes of higher learning have initiated joint collaborations with researchers from the Arctic and Southeast Asia to share best practices and exchange ideas on common challenges, such as energy access in remote communities. We have also worked with several diplomatic missions in Singapore from Arctic member states to organise events to raise awareness of Arctic issues in Singapore, especially amongst the young people."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00542,2019-03-01-T-005,542,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"When I attended the 13th Arctic Frontiers Conference in Norway in January this year, I spoke about Singapore’s Smart Nation strategies at a discussion on ""Smart and Resilient Arctic Societies"". I am happy also to report that Singapore's contributions in this field have been well-recognised and received. Going forward, we hope to involve and familiarise more companies with the growing opportunities in the high north."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00543,2019-03-01-T-005,543,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"In conclusion, Mr Chairman, Singapore's survival depends on our effective cultivation of a wide network of partners and friends. Our external engagement, on both bilateral and multilateral levels, has grown dramatically over the last few years. This monumental task requires a whole-of-Government effort."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00544,2019-03-01-T-005,544,Sam Tan Chin Siong,MFA will continue to fly the Singapore flag high and strengthen relations with countries and regions around the world to secure Singapore's interests and also for Singapore's continued development. Thank you.
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00545,2019-03-01-T-005,545,Tan Wu Meng,"Mr Chairman, Minister Vivian spoke about the contours of today’s uncertain external environment. A key feature of this is the competition between major powers for pre-eminence. Tit-for-tat trade tariffs have affected the global economy, including Singapore's. I will share on what Singapore has done to actively uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system, by pursuing the strategies of openness, integration and diversification."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00546,2019-03-01-T-005,546,Tan Wu Meng,"Trade, at slightly more than three times our GDP, is Singapore’s lifeline. We have consistently articulated our support for free and open trade. The post-World War Two multilateral trading system anchored by rules and norms has served the world, including Singapore, well. However, just like any neighbourhood, we can expect friction when multiple parties, big and small, coexist in the same environment. Yet it is precisely this rules-based international system that allows such disagreements to be resolved through constructive cooperation and agreed rules in a non-discriminatory manner."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00547,2019-03-01-T-005,547,Tan Wu Meng,"Singapore firmly supports a rules-based and inclusive trading system, as embodied in the WTO. Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked if we can do more. Together with like-minded Members, we are working on WTO reforms to ensure that the WTO remains well-functioning and effective for all. This includes updating the WTO's rulebook so that it remains relevant to businesses and governments. For instance, there is scope to develop new trade rules to address e-commerce and the broader digital economy. Singapore’s commitment to the multilateral trading system is also evident through our various efforts to advance trade liberalisation and economic integration."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00548,2019-03-01-T-005,548,Tan Wu Meng,"Minister Vivian spoke on two key initiatives – the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which we are working to conclude this year, and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which entered into force on 30 December 2018."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00549,2019-03-01-T-005,549,Tan Wu Meng,"Mr Mohamed Irshad asked about the CPTPP's benefits for Singapore. Apart from the increased market access for our companies as mentioned by Minister Vivian, the CPTPP is also a forward-looking agreement."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00550,2019-03-01-T-005,550,Tan Wu Meng,"First, it updates rules in traditional areas, including services, investment and non-tariff measures."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00551,2019-03-01-T-005,551,Tan Wu Meng,"Second, it establishes a common set of enforceable rules to address modern trade issues in areas such as e-commerce and intellectual property."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00552,2019-03-01-T-005,552,Tan Wu Meng,"Apart from our immediate region, we have also looked across the Pacific to MERCOSUR (comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) and the Pacific Alliance (comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru) to diversify our economic and free trade networks."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00553,2019-03-01-T-005,553,Tan Wu Meng,"As Senior Minister of State Maliki highlighted earlier, we are negotiating Free Trade Agreements with MERCOSUR and the Pacific Alliance to create opportunities for Singaporeans and Singapore companies to expand into new areas, and enhance trade with emerging markets."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00554,2019-03-01-T-005,554,Tan Wu Meng,"Singapore also remains engaged at APEC and G20. Both are key multilateral fora which bring economies together for international economic cooperation. I attended last year's APEC Ministerial Meeting in Port Moresby together with SMS Maliki, while our Prime Minister attended the Leaders’ Meeting. Singapore sees great potential for APEC's leadership role in deepening regional economic integration and incubating new ideas."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00555,2019-03-01-T-005,555,Tan Wu Meng,"At Japan’s invitation, Singapore will attend the G20 Summit and related meetings in Osaka in June this year. As convenor of the Global Governance Group or the 3G, Singapore will continue to promote engagement between the G20 and the wider UN membership."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00556,2019-03-01-T-005,556,Tan Wu Meng,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked about advancing Singapore's interests in the face of increasing unilateralism globally. As a small state, we alone cannot deal with the complex and transboundary nature of today’s challenges. We must continue working through multilateral platforms, such as the UN."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00557,2019-03-01-T-005,557,Tan Wu Meng,"Singapore's role at multilateral platforms like the UN seeks to fulfil three main objectives. First, to strengthen the multilateral rules-based international system for greater global stability. Second, to be a responsible member of the international community by sharing our experiences and fulfilling our commitments. These include countering radical ideologies, strengthening cyber resilience and promoting sustainable development. Third, to work with like-minded partners to represent interests and perspectives of the region and other small states."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00558,2019-03-01-T-005,558,Tan Wu Meng,"We have done this through the development of cyber norms and partnerships in ASEAN, our role as convenor of the Forum of Small States, as well as convenor of the 3G."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00559,2019-03-01-T-005,559,Tan Wu Meng,"Singapore does not shy away from challenges. In every challenge, there is opportunity for Singapore to improve ourselves, to share our expertise and experience, and learn from other countries. I represented Singapore at two G20 ministerial meetings on Energy, as well as Trade and Investment in Argentina last year. At the inaugural Urban 20 Mayors Summit, the U-20, in Buenos Aires last October, I shared Singapore’s approach to urban planning and the core of our urban design, which must be fundamentally about ""seeing through the eyes of our people""."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00560,2019-03-01-T-005,560,Tan Wu Meng,"I also emphasised the importance of platforms such as the U20 and our ASEAN Smart Cities Network, which provide cities ""safe spaces"" to share and learn from one another, while building a shared commons of knowledge and best practices."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00561,2019-03-01-T-005,561,Tan Wu Meng,"Even as we look outward, our foreign policy is ultimately centred on firstly, serving the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans; and secondly, buttressing our domestic resilience."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00562,2019-03-01-T-005,562,Tan Wu Meng,"As Minister Vivian shared earlier  diplomacy starts at home; foreign policy starts at home. Given evolving regional and global dynamics, Singapore's foreign policy can only be successful with the support and understanding of Singaporeans."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00563,2019-03-01-T-005,563,Tan Wu Meng,"Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Irshad asked about MFA's foreign policy outreach efforts to the younger generation, as well as how to combat fake news."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00564,2019-03-01-T-005,564,Tan Wu Meng,"I am happy to share that MFA has been stepping up our outreach to Singaporeans – including our students – to explain the fundamental principles of Singapore’s foreign policy and our vulnerabilities as a small country. To mitigate the risks of Singaporeans being distracted, divided and deceived by fake news and online falsehoods, MFA must establish ourselves as the authoritative source of information on Singapore’s foreign policy. We have enhanced our public engagement through social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Telegram and WhatsApp, to establish MFA as an essential source for the public to verify facts and news."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00565,2019-03-01-T-005,565,Tan Wu Meng,"Ms Pereira also sought an update on MFA's measures to address the changing needs and expectations of travelling Singaporeans, advice for travellers, and the role of our Overseas Missions in strengthening ties with Singaporeans."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00566,2019-03-01-T-005,566,Tan Wu Meng,"Our consular work has increased in volume, increased in complexity, as more Singaporeans travel and work abroad."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00567,2019-03-01-T-005,567,Tan Wu Meng,"2018 was another busy year for us. There were several major natural disasters overseas. For example, we deployed a Crisis Response Team to assist Singaporeans who were stranded in Lombok following an earthquake in August last year."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00568,2019-03-01-T-005,568,Tan Wu Meng,"We launched the ""Be Informed & Be Safe"" initiative to provide safe travel information through various platforms, such as the new MFA website and social media. Travel advice for certain common destinations can now be found on the MFA website. We also produced four short videos featuring common travel myths during the year-end holiday travel period."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00569,2019-03-01-T-005,569,Tan Wu Meng,"MFA will continue to do our best to assist Singaporeans who get into difficult situations overseas. To have adequate financial protection against unexpected emergencies, Singaporeans should always purchase travel insurance when travelling."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00570,2019-03-01-T-005,570,Tan Wu Meng,"In addition, we have used technology to provide useful and timely services to Singaporean travellers. We are collaborating with partners to improve the public's experience through existing systems like the AskJamie@MFA virtual assistant on the MFA website. We will pursue new ways to digitalise the delivery of consular-related services, and improve user experience through a Service Journey approach."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00571,2019-03-01-T-005,571,Tan Wu Meng,"Our Overseas Missions are key touchpoints for Singaporeans living and working overseas. We will continue to work closely with various Government agencies like the Overseas Singaporean Unit on efforts to engage and strengthen bonds, so that Singaporeans overseas can remain connected to Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00572,2019-03-01-T-005,572,Tan Wu Meng,"On that note, I would like to highlight how resource-intensive MFA’s service of Singapore and Singaporeans is."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00573,2019-03-01-T-005,573,Tan Wu Meng,"Our MFA officers work under challenging conditions, and at great cost to our officers' personal and family lives. Our officers represent Singapore across a broad range of fields and issues, to protect our sovereignty and independence, look after overseas Singaporeans in trouble, and expand opportunities for Singaporeans."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00574,2019-03-01-T-005,574,Tan Wu Meng,"Mr Chairman, in conclusion, uncertainty will remain a common feature of the international landscape, but MFA will continue to seek out opportunities to advance the interests of Singapore and our fellow Singaporeans. Thank you."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00575,2019-03-01-T-005,575,,Any clarifications? Ms Anthea Ong
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00576,2019-03-01-T-005,576,Anthea Ong,"Thank you, Chairman. Could I ask a question and that is not on the Rohingya crisis. May I ask the Foreign Minister if MFA if there has been an assessment on whether there is support among the member states in terms of the review of the non-interference policy within ASEAN? I appreciate that this is a foundational principle of ASEAN when we were founded, but I would just like to get a sense from the Minister if there is an assessment on the support amongst the other countries."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00577,2019-03-01-T-005,577,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The principle of non-interference within ASEAN is actually a foundational principle. We need to understand the reason why we have to operate this way. This is because we are so vastly different. Even the EU has its own challenges with differences among themselves. But if you look at ASEAN, the 10 of us, size, economy, government systems, as I said before ranging from monarchies, military arrangements, a variety of democracies, it would fracture ASEAN if we were to abandon that principle."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00578,2019-03-01-T-005,578,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, I much rather our current practical approach, which is by moral suasion, by quiet diplomacy, discussion behind the scenes, and to tell our fellow members that, ""yes, you have a problem within your borders, but it has impact on us. And for what it is worth, these are our views, this is how we will offer to help."" And sometimes, if it is particularly egregious, we will have to say things publicly. And that is how it has operated all this while."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00579,2019-03-01-T-005,579,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I completely sympathise with your and Mr Louis Ng's concern for the refugees. But as Mr Louis Ng has also noted during his intervention, this problem has been around for a long time. It is pre-dated ASEAN and we cannot force a quick resolution. So, that is why, it is a long answer to your question, but we cannot abandon the principle of non-interference."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00580,2019-03-01-T-005,580,Vikram Nair,"I think Minister and Dr Maliki both mentioned that efforts have been taken to make the relationship with Malaysia more constructive. But just yesterday there were remarks by Dr Mahathir at a meeting with the Johor state government officials saying that he is encouraging people of Johor to protest against the current water deal to say it is unfair, and Singapore is a rich country, it should be more generous. Does the Minister have any comment on this?"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00581,2019-03-01-T-005,581,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I thank the Member for that pointed question. In fact, I think there is an article in The Straits Times"
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00582,2019-03-01-T-005,582,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Chairman, I am supposed to be diplomatic but I think Members of this House also know that I call a spade, a spade. This is a red herring. The 1962 Water Agreement is not about who is richer or poorer. It is about the fundamental principle of respecting the sanctity of agreements. Singapore's position on the 1962 Agreement has been clear and consistent. The 1962 water agreement was guaranteed – no, in fact, first I should say, that in 1962 when this Agreement was signed, Malaysia was an independent country. They had their own leadership. They had their own legal advice. And they entered into this Agreement in 1962. In 1965, when Singapore was ejected from the Federation of Malaysia, we took the precaution of ensuring that the 1962 Water Agreement was guaranteed by the governments of both Malaysia and Singapore. It forms in effect part of our 1965 Separation Agreement. Any breach of the 1962 Water Agreement would call into question the Separation Agreement. And this Separation Agreement is the basis for our existence as an independent sovereign state. Therefore, Malaysia and Singapore must fully honour the terms of the 1962 Water Agreement, including the price of water that is stipulated in it."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00583,2019-03-01-T-005,583,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Our long-standing position has been that neither Malaysia nor Singapore can unilaterally change the terms of this Agreement between our two countries. As I told the House – I think it was in July last year – Malaysia lost the right to review the price of water under the 1962 Water Agreement. In fact, Malaysia herself has previously acknowledged that they chose not to seek a review in 1987 because they benefited from the pricing arrangement under the 1962 Water Agreement."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00584,2019-03-01-T-005,584,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Dr Mahathir, whom I would remind the House, was the Prime Minister at that point in time – in fact, he was Prime Minister from 1981 to 2003. Dr Mahathir himself explained in 2002 that Malaysia did not ask for a review in 1987 as Malaysia knew that any revision would also affect the price of treated water that is sold by Singapore to Malaysia."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00585,2019-03-01-T-005,585,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Today, Singapore continues to sell treated water to Malaysia in excess of our obligation. Our obligation under the 1962 Water Agreement is to sell 5 million gallons per day, but actually today as we speak, we are selling around 16 million gallons per day. We are selling it at a fraction of the cost of treating that water. In other words, for every gallon, we are subsidising."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00586,2019-03-01-T-005,586,Vivian Balakrishnan,"On top of this, from time to time, PUB also receives additional requests to supply additional treated water to Johor. For example, just between 2 and 4 January this year, Singapore supplied an additional 6 million gallons per day of treated water. This is over and above the 16 million gallons per day that I described earlier. We supplied this to Johor when they needed more water because its water plants were experiencing a disruption, due to pollution."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00587,2019-03-01-T-005,587,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Furthermore, Members may recall that in 1990 – and again, I remind you that this is during Dr Mahathir's first prime ministership – the PUB and Johor signed an agreement in 1990 to construct the Linggiu Dam to increase the yield of the Johor river. Johor owns the Linggiu Dam but Singapore paid more than S$300 million for its construction and operational costs, as well as compensation for the land used by the Linggiu Reservoir, and for the potential loss of revenue from logging activities, and also inclusive of a one-time payment of the lease of that land for the remaining tenure of the 1962 Water Agreement."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00588,2019-03-01-T-005,588,Vivian Balakrishnan,"If – and this is an important point – if Malaysia had exercised the right to review the price of water in 1987, Singapore might well have made very different investment decisions on developing the Johor River. Overall, we have spent more than S$1 billion on water projects in Johor, and this has helped not only PUB's water works but Johor's own water works, which are also extracting water from the same river. In fact, Members would also recall that the Linggiu Reservoir's water level dropped to a historic low of 20% in October 2016 because there was a drought and we needed to use that water in order to supply the downstream water treatment plants."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00589,2019-03-01-T-005,589,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In periods of dry weather – and just by coincidence, Johor is experiencing a period of dry weather now – that is why there had been fires and that is why there have been the smell of burning material in Singapore in recent days. In this period of dry weather, Singapore continues to provide Johor with treated water upon their request and we do so out of goodwill without prejudice to our legal rights under the Water Agreement."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00590,2019-03-01-T-005,590,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We are permanent neighbours and we want to be good neighbours, and we have never shied away from dealing with difficult bilateral issues. This is why Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had proposed to Dr Mahathir when they met in November 2018 that both Attorneys-General of Singapore and Malaysia would need to better understand each other's positions on whether Malaysia still had the right to review the price of water under the 1962 Water Agreement. The Attorneys-General actually did meet in December 2018. Unfortunately, their discussions were overshadowed by the Johor Bahru port limits and the Seletar Instrument Landing System (ILS) procedures issues, issues that we are now trying to resolve. Nevertheless, the two Attorney-Generals will continue their discussion in due time."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00591,2019-03-01-T-005,591,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Since Separation in 1965, Singapore has chosen a different and unique fundamental philosophy of governance. Quite frankly, we have taken a different path of development."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00592,2019-03-01-T-005,592,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore has no natural resources; we are even short of water. But Singaporeans have long internalised that no one owes us a living. We have provided a framework where all our citizens strive to do our best and achieve our potential by dint of our efforts. We take a zero tolerance policy towards corruption. Our Government plans and invest for the long term as exemplified by this Budget that we are debating right now. We honour and fulfil our international agreements and commitments. As a result of that, businesses have the confidence to invest and grow in Singapore, and we make sure, as you all know in our Budget that we invest in infrastructure ahead of time."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00593,2019-03-01-T-005,593,Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, on that note, I will let Members of the House and fellow Singaporeans outside decide for yourself whether we have been ""fair"" or, to quote Dr Mahathir, whether we have been ""morally wrong"". I think the answer is obvious."
2019-03-01-T-005-S-00594,2019-03-01-T-005,594,,"Mr Vikram Nair, would you like to withdraw your amendment?"

Thank you very much for the hard work for the Ministry and the many people carrying out flag. With that, Chairman, I seek leave to withdraw the cut."

2019-03-01-T-006-S-00601,2019-03-01-T-006,601,Christopher de Souza,"Sir, reports have been made of foreign interference in various jurisdictions around the world. These include agents of influence, funding, hacks and leaks. For example, according to a report to the US Senate, Russia twitter bots seemed to have been involved in Brexit through social media. This is not to be taken lightly as inter-racial tensions were escalated by foreign state actors in the case of US, that is deepening the black-white divide."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00602,2019-03-01-T-006,602,Christopher de Souza,"State actors were allegedly behind the Macron hack and leaks, where forged emails were mixed with real ones and were released at the 11th hour. In Australia, their Parliament was hacked."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00603,2019-03-01-T-006,603,Christopher de Souza,"According to the Centre for International Governance Innovation, protection of critical infrastructure such as voting machines and voter registry are important to prevent and protect against foreign interference of the democratic processes."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00604,2019-03-01-T-006,604,Christopher de Souza,"Over the past five years, there has been an upward trend in the amount of cyber threat activity against democratic processes globally. Singapore is not exempt from such threats. Experts are of the view that the SingHealth cyberattack was by a state actor as the attack continued even after detection."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00605,2019-03-01-T-006,605,Christopher de Souza,"During the Singapore-Malaysia disputes last year, there was a noticeable increase in critical comments made by avatars. This may be hard to detect as false accounts and groups that originated from a foreign country can pose as local, as was done during the mid-term elections in the United States."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00606,2019-03-01-T-006,606,Christopher de Souza,"Therefore, we must guard against such threats descending on and vesting in Singapore. To do so, we need tighter legislation to deter external pressures from having an overt or covert influence on our domestic politics and sensitive issues, which should rightly be for Singaporeans to decide."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00607,2019-03-01-T-006,607,Christopher de Souza,How can we add muscle to our legislative framework and regularly update the regulatory machinery to preserve and protect the domestic policy-making as the rightful domain of Singaporeans? What can we learn of the modus operandi of foreign pressure groups – overt and covert – that have insurrected the policy-making and legislative spheres of other countries? Such a study will assist our Home Team to deter such modus operandi from being deployed here in Singapore.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00608,2019-03-01-T-006,608,Christopher de Souza,"The point is this – to preserve the effective and efficient running of Singapore, and to ensure our system of governance is not undermined by ill-minded external forces, we need to add more muscle to our armoury of legal weapons."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00609,2019-03-01-T-006,609,Christopher de Souza,"May I take my next two cuts, Mr Chairman?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00610,2019-03-01-T-006,610,,"Yes, please."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00611,2019-03-01-T-006,611,Christopher de Souza,"Thank you. A study of insurrectionist-fake-news movements around the globe show that hostile information campaigns are deployed in an attempt to undermine institutions, social cohesion and trust in governments. As effectiveness and efficiency can be hampered by an unabated spreading of untruths, the need for Singaporean security agencies to detect and counter them is crucial for the longevity of our system of governance and its continued efficiency."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00612,2019-03-01-T-006,612,Christopher de Souza,"Therefore, to protect Singapore's reputation as a safe country in which systems of governance, trade and industry function predictably and effectively, we should have an armoury of legal tools to combat propagators of fake news and the ill-consequences of their trade."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00613,2019-03-01-T-006,613,Christopher de Souza,It is important that this armoury of legal tools be versatile as disinformation campaigns have become even more sophisticated and we need to keep up with the advancements in techniques of concealment and manipulation.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00614,2019-03-01-T-006,614,Christopher de Souza,"For example, in a Politico article, it stated that ""fake news merchants are a step ahead"" of government efforts, challenging the definition of what constitutes fake news through the use of photo-based disinformation and the use of Internet messaging services like WhatsApp as well as employing techniques to mask their locations and purchase political ads in local currencies."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00615,2019-03-01-T-006,615,Christopher de Souza,"To that end, would MHA consider formalising such an armoury of legal tools into a legislative and regulatory framework to combat fake news emanating from domestic and foreign propagators?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00616,2019-03-01-T-006,616,Christopher de Souza,"Every 21 July, racial harmony day is celebrated. Why 21 July? The first series of riots in the Race Riots of 1964 began on 21 July. Those riots had been called ""the worst and most prolonged in Singapore’s postwar history."""
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00617,2019-03-01-T-006,617,Christopher de Souza,"But the fact that we can celebrate racial harmony day is a testament of how much stronger our unique social fabric has grown. Unique Singapore is made up of many races – Malay, Chinese, Eurasian, Indian and groups of other ethnicities."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00618,2019-03-01-T-006,618,Christopher de Souza,"Along with the ethnicities, there is a wide representation of religions. Living harmoniously and respectfully is, therefore, important. Through the Ethnic Integration Programme, people of different races live side-by-side. However, with the rise of inflammatory speech around the world – seeking to incite violence against people based on religion or race – what are our on-going plans to further safeguard our racial and religious harmony?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00619,2019-03-01-T-006,619,Christopher de Souza,"Further, what steps will be taken to combat hate speech which incites violence against race or religion where such incitement is conducted on social media?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00620,2019-03-01-T-006,620,Christopher de Souza,"It has been reported that since 2012, there has been a 600% increase in the number of users on Twitter globally that spout racial supremacy tweets. A United Nations expert stated that there is a ""dramatic"" increase in the number of websites and social media platforms that enable the incitement of violence."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00621,2019-03-01-T-006,621,Christopher de Souza,Tackling the social media aspect is important as words on social media can quickly go viral like a fire which is out of control. This can be done through the use of bots.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00622,2019-03-01-T-006,622,Christopher de Souza,"As it is more difficult to trace the origins of such speech, and identity can be easily masked, what legal tools will MHA deploy to deter would-be perpetrators from spouting inflammatory speech?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00623,2019-03-01-T-006,623,Christopher de Souza,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00624,2019-03-01-T-006,624,Rahayu Mahzam,"I sat on the Select Committee for Deliberate Online Falsehoods last year and one issue that came up quite strongly was the use of online falsehoods to stoke communal and religious differences and cause disharmony. Of particular concern to me is the ""slow drip"" effect, as some falsehoods may play on existing ""slow burn"" issues, such as simmering communal tensions, to create more serious crises in the long run."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00625,2019-03-01-T-006,625,Rahayu Mahzam,We have seen social media being used to spread inflammatory messages that could cause tension between different communities and to share hate speeches. These conversations are then carried into the real world and can affect the way we interact with one another. The online space is also used to spread practices which may not be compatible to our local context.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00626,2019-03-01-T-006,626,Rahayu Mahzam,"Sometime back, news broke about several foreign preachers being banned from preaching in Singapore for this reason. Foreign preachers, like Mufti Menk and Dr Zakir Naik, are popular online and their reach extends beyond physical space."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00627,2019-03-01-T-006,627,Rahayu Mahzam,"In light of the evolving online space and the importance of protecting social cohesion in Singapore, are there plans to further develop legislation or create other controls to safeguard our religious harmony?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00628,2019-03-01-T-006,628,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Chairman, religious harmony is vital for peace, and prosperity in our multiracial and multi-religious nation. Over the years, the Government and religious community have made great strides in safeguarding our religious harmony. We have continuously affirmed the need to foster a culture of mutual understanding and the attitude of live and let live, as well as to build strong bonds among different faiths."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00629,2019-03-01-T-006,629,Baey Yam Keng,"Building and maintaining religious harmony is an on-going effort since our independence, and we cannot be complacent. In that regard, we need to guard against the rise of narrow-minded and segregationist ideologies. We have seen examples of segregationist ideologies being propagated overseas, such as religious leaders telling their followers not to convey well-wishes to others on their religious holidays. Even though these segregationist ideologies may not cause immediate harm, like violence, they can divide society over time."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00630,2019-03-01-T-006,630,Baey Yam Keng,I urge the Government to work more closely with our religious communities to take steps to prevent such segregationist tendencies from taking root in Singapore. Can MHA share its plans to do so?
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00631,2019-03-01-T-006,631,,Mr Gan Thiam Poh. Not here. Mr Png Eng Huat.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00632,2019-03-01-T-006,632,Png Eng Huat,"Sir, it was reported in the Population White Paper of 2013 that about 40% of all marriages registered in Singapore involved a non-Singaporean and there was a rising trend in international marriages over the years as well."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00633,2019-03-01-T-006,633,Png Eng Huat,"These marriages would have strong and sustainable Singaporean core to begin with, and even more so, when these married couples decide to start a family. Some of these foreign spouses may be in their second marriage and have children of their own with them. While these foreign spouses may be granted permanent residency in due course, their children from previous marriages are facing an uncertain future. These children will not get PR status by default."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00634,2019-03-01-T-006,634,Png Eng Huat,"In such cases, Singaporeans with foreign stepchildren to raise, would have to struggle with non-subsidised school fees, medical fees and more, if they are unable to legally adopt these children."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00635,2019-03-01-T-006,635,Png Eng Huat,"Sir, some adoption procedures can be onerous, for example, to adopt a stepchild from China, the consent of the biological ex-spouse must be sought. If the ex-spouse is missing, non-cooperative or even hostile, it is next to impossible for the Singaporean to legally adopt his stepchild. Some of these stepchildren can never go back to their home countries as well because they were abandoned at birth by one half of their parents."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00636,2019-03-01-T-006,636,Png Eng Huat,"Sir, our TFR has been below the replacement rate for decades. Here, we have children who are already an integral part of the Singaporean core families, who are totally integrated into our society, and who are as Singaporean as any one of their local siblings. Can we not grant these children PR status at the very least, until they reach the age of 21? These grown up children can then make their own declaration to become citizens at that point in time."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00637,2019-03-01-T-006,637,Png Eng Huat,"In my conversation with Singaporeans with foreign stepchildren, they are deeply concerned how their stepchildren would feel as they grow older and come to know that they are actually quite different from their brothers or sisters in many ways. I urge the Ministry to grant these stepchildren of families with strong Singaporean Core, permanent residency or citizenship sooner rather than later."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00638,2019-03-01-T-006,638,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Mr Chairman, in January this year, it was reported in The Straits Times that MHA will be setting up a new Science and Technology Agency, with responsibility in research and procurement areas of border security and protection of critical infrastructures. With the increasing global threats posed by terrorism, cyberattacks and international crimes, this move is timely. The growth of new technologies poses a growth of new threats."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00639,2019-03-01-T-006,639,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Minister Heng, in his Budget speech, said that this year, digital defence has been incorporated as the sixth pillar that makes up Singapore's Total Defence."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00640,2019-03-01-T-006,640,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Can MHA share more on the plans for the new agency and how it will help enhance the capabilities of the Home Team?
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00641,2019-03-01-T-006,641,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"With digitalisation and advances in technology, what is the Home Team doing to leverage technology to enhance operations, service delivery and address the constraints faced with manpower? How will the new Agency use technology and information offensively and defensively?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00642,2019-03-01-T-006,642,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"To be effective in prevention, response and recovery of cyber-attacks, it will require inter-agency coordination. Other agencies, like the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Heath, are required in the research and development of home¬land security technologies. In what way is MHA fostering and driving inter-agency cooperation and coordination? What is MHA doing to attract the right talent and developing security specialists for the agency?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00643,2019-03-01-T-006,643,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,We know that cyber terrorism has no boundaries. Singapore cannot be effective without partnerships. The private sector also makes investment in technology for security and hence private sector partnership can also strengthen the use of technology for homeland safety.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00644,2019-03-01-T-006,644,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Can MHA share what public, private, national and international partnerships the new Science and Technology Agency intends to drive in researching, developing, and sharing homeland security technologies?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00645,2019-03-01-T-006,645,Low Thia Khiang,"Chairman, Sir, it was announced that the Home Team Science and Technology Agency will be established to develop science and technology capabilities to support the Home Team's operational needs. The Budget Book states that the Home Team is growing a pool of in-house scientists and engineers to develop capabilities in sense-making and surveillance, biometrics and profiling, forensics and dealing with chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives incidents."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00646,2019-03-01-T-006,646,Low Thia Khiang,"If the agency is the extension of the current work of the Science and Technology office to preempt and contain terrorist attacks, that is a good development. However, I am concerned with the scope of surveillance and profiling technology to be deployed and developed."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00647,2019-03-01-T-006,647,Low Thia Khiang,"Sometime ago, the Minister for Home Affairs said that the integration of facial recognition technology into the Home Team IT systems could help automate Police work. Recently, many organisations, including tech giants, such as Microsoft and Google, have raised alarm on facial recognition and its potential abuse if left unregulated. Some critics have pointed to China's misuse of the technology for political control."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00648,2019-03-01-T-006,648,Low Thia Khiang,"How will the Government ensure that the data collected is authentic, is secured and not subjected to abuse, political or otherwise? What safeguards are there to ensure that the privacy and rights of citizens will not be violated? What recourse will citizens have to address possible misuses of personal data and violations of privacy by the Home Team?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00649,2019-03-01-T-006,649,Low Thia Khiang,"I would like to know whether the Government has the intention to bring a Bill to Parliament to establish the Home Team Science and Technology Agency as a Statutory Board, so that the mission, role and specific functions of the agency can be transparently stated in law and regulated."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00650,2019-03-01-T-006,650,Gan Thiam Poh,"Sir, religious harmony is very important for Singapore. An effective way to nurture and strengthen religious harmony is to make sure that people from different religions interact with one another. However, in recent times, we have seen overseas examples of segregationist behaviour. For example, there were media reports about laundromats in Malaysia only wanting to serve Muslim customers and extremist Buddhist monks in Myanmar calling Buddhists to boycott Muslim businesses."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00651,2019-03-01-T-006,651,Gan Thiam Poh,We need to make sure that such separation of people based on religion is not acceptable here. Reducing social mixing among believers of different religions will divide our society over time and splinter our nation. How can we ensure that such segregationist practices do not take root in Singapore?
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00652,2019-03-01-T-006,652,Gan Thiam Poh,"The decision to establish the new Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HSTA) by the end of this year cannot come soon enough. In view of the volume and increasingly serious nature of digital threats, a dedicated agency will boost our Home Team's technological capabilities to provide greater support for its operational needs."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00653,2019-03-01-T-006,653,Gan Thiam Poh,The range of cases which our security agencies have to deal with are getting more diverse and more complex by the day. Cyberattacks and cybercrimes are escalating even as general crime rates are stabilising or falling.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00654,2019-03-01-T-006,654,Gan Thiam Poh,"Would the Minister share more details about the aims and key focus areas of HSTA? How will it interface with other similar agencies, such as the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA)?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00655,2019-03-01-T-006,655,Christopher de Souza,"Chairman, the world we live in is very different from the past. Through the porous and inter-connected Internet, crime and threats of unrest can be caused by players beyond a country's borders. Even within Singapore, the medium of the Internet provides a cover that can easily mask one's identity and location. Nevertheless, what is on the Internet can have consequences in real life."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00656,2019-03-01-T-006,656,Christopher de Souza,"As such, combating falsehoods, protecting race and religion from speech inciting violence, ensuring domestic politics and sensitive policy decisions remain the domain of Singaporeans. These are all key and important facets to our way of life and the continued effectiveness of our rule of law governance system. Science and technology can be studied and deployed to detect foreign and domestic actors who seek to spread falsehoods and incite violence."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00657,2019-03-01-T-006,657,Christopher de Souza,"As experts have stated, this is important as there are cyber-armies in the region that can be easily deployed against Singapore directly or as proxies for another country. This can also include civilians who unwittingly participate as circulators of disinformation or even as part of a ""militia"" that acts in support of a state-sponsored disinformation campaign."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00658,2019-03-01-T-006,658,Christopher de Souza,Will the new MHA arm in the form of the Science and Technology Agency work to deploy the disciplines of science and technology to deter disinformation or information that incites violence and instability?
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00659,2019-03-01-T-006,659,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, I would like to ask the Ministry on the Singapore Police Force (SPF)'s standard practice in reply to appeals made by a Member of Parliament or a grassroots advisor."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00660,2019-03-01-T-006,660,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"My Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) colleague once made an appeal on behalf of a member of the public who lives in a constituency he contested in General Election 2015. However, the appeal was not accepted. I would like to quote the reply from SPF, ""We regret that we are unable to process the appeal as a Government organisation can only consider representation from MPs/Advisors to grassroots organisations on behalf of their constituents."""
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00661,2019-03-01-T-006,661,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, on the other hand, it has come to my attention recently through SPF's replied letter to one of my residents that SPF acknowledged the PAP Party Branch Chairman's appeal and a carbon copy of the reply which was addressed to my resident was sent to the PAP Party Branch Chairman."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00662,2019-03-01-T-006,662,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, the PAP Party Branch Chairman is appointed by a political party. I am therefore surprised as to why the SPF acknowledged the appeal from PAP Party Branch Chairman whereas the appeal from an NCMP was not accepted. Sir, I seek clarity on the matter."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00663,2019-03-01-T-006,663,Desmond Choo,"Sir, Singapore's declining birth rate and ageing population has and will place further manpower constraints on our Home Team. At the same time, our officers will encounter more complex and sophisticated cases while frontline officers, such as those in ICA, will encounter heavier workloads and ever higher service expectations. Home Team Transformation 2025 was timely. Can the Minister update on the progress of the project, especially how it has impacted our ICA and SCDF officers?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00664,2019-03-01-T-006,664,Desmond Choo,"While technological changes have made law enforcement more complex for our Home Team officers, it also heralds the dawn of ever more effective officers. Law enforcement has evolved, from the physicality of beat patrolling to remote advanced monitoring and detection systems. Our older officers can be trained to take on different but equally productive work. How have we redesigned our jobs to take advantage of technology to help our officers to be productive even when they are older? How are we also reskilling our officers so that they can better utilise technology in their work?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00665,2019-03-01-T-006,665,Desmond Choo,"In the face of manpower constraints and increasing workloads, we must necessarily help officers to work better for longer. Law enforcement officers are like fine wine, they get better with age. Their legal knowledge and contextual experience are important in sniffing out suspicious cases. Many successful Police and ICA arrests are due to the skills of our officers built up over time."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00666,2019-03-01-T-006,666,Desmond Choo,The retirement age was revised in 2013. I encourage MHA to leverage on assistive technology and changes in job scopes and law enforcement methodologies to extend the retirement and re-employment age of our Home Team officers.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00667,2019-03-01-T-006,667,Desmond Choo,"In an increasingly complex operating terrain, we no longer have the monopoly of knowledge. Our officers often know what are the skills that they need to thrive in the environment. Will the Ministry consider setting up training committees comprising of ground officers, senior management and HQ staff in our various land divisions to explore new skills and new ways to train?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00668,2019-03-01-T-006,668,Murali Pillai,"Sir, it is clear that the Singapore Police Force’s scope of work has increased significantly in the recent past and this trend is likely to continue in the future."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00669,2019-03-01-T-006,669,Murali Pillai,"As an example, one need only refer to the amendment Bill to the Penal Code that was tabled in Parliament earlier this month. If passed, it will introduce a slew of new offences to better protect the more vulnerable amongst us. In addition, there is a trend of increasing e-commerce scams which saw an increase of 36.1% between 2017 and 2018. As the Singapore Police Force is the primary investigative body for such offences, it will have to consequently expand its investigative resources to deal with an expected increase in workload."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00670,2019-03-01-T-006,670,Murali Pillai,SPF will also have to ensure it has the resources to deal with security issues to keep Singapore and Singaporeans safe. This is not an easy task given the current geo-political situation and assessment of security threat.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00671,2019-03-01-T-006,671,Murali Pillai,"I am heartened to note that in this Budget, there is an increase in financial support to keep Singapore safe and secure. How will the Ministry ensure that the Police Force has sufficient manpower to handle this expected additional workload? Is there scope for the Police to be further freed from non-core duties, such as assisting members of public to update changes in their addresses? How much can technology really be leveraged to free up manpower given that there will always be a limit to what can be done without the human touch?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00672,2019-03-01-T-006,672,Gan Thiam Poh,"Sir, there is a growing trend of drug use liberalisation in the west, including towards cannabis. One can even purchase cannabis-flavoured drinks, cookies and ice-cream in nations where their recreational use have been legalised. However, the damage of such drug misuse on our health is undeniable. And I urge the Government to prevent this trend from taking root in Singapore. I am also very worried about how the abuse of such drugs will lead to the exploration of and subsequent addiction to other illicit drugs."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00673,2019-03-01-T-006,673,Gan Thiam Poh,What is the Government’s stance on this issue and how does it plan to respond to this growing trend globally? What measures do we have to ensure that such illegal drugs do not find their way into Singapore?
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00674,2019-03-01-T-006,674,Christopher de Souza,"Calls to decriminalise the consumption of highly addictive and illicit drugs should be viewed with skepticism and suspicion. These calls have an agenda – some of those voicing them have much to gain financially. Sir, drugs do fuel crime."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00675,2019-03-01-T-006,675,Christopher de Souza,"So, if we were to decriminalise the supply and demand of drugs, who suffers the social fall-out? Who has to pave the road to recovery of a citizen addicted to drugs? Who has to care for the family broken by a member’s drug addiction? Who suffers as a result of drug-related crime? Certainly, not the big industries seeking to profit from liberal drug consumption. Rather, it is the family of the drug addict that suffers the most – an innocent spouse, child, or baby – and of course the state. So, we must deter both the demand and supply of drugs. What then is MHA's position regarding moves to make cannabis legal in neighbouring countries? Separately, what steps are being taken to increase the employability of former rehabilitated addicts?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00676,2019-03-01-T-006,676,Tan Wu Meng,"Mr Chairman, there is a growing trend globally and regionally, to legalise cannabis for recreational and medical use. In October 2018, Canada became the second country in the world to legalise cannabis for recreational use, after Uruguay became the first such country in 2013. In the United States, around 10 states have legalised cannabis for recreational use and more than 30 states have legalised cannabis for medical use. In our region, two countries have recently legalised cannabis for medical use – South Korea in November 2018 and Thailand in December 2018."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00677,2019-03-01-T-006,677,Tan Wu Meng,"This trend poses implications for young people, for patients and for healthcare professionals. Young Singaporeans studying or working in jurisdictions which have legalised cannabis, may have attitudes towards drugs shaped by the social environment there. Patients in Singapore may read online posts about jurisdictions which have legalised cannabis for medical use. Healthcare professionals in turn may be faced with challenging conversations with patients, who might ask about differing policies regarding legalisation of cannabis for medical use, across different countries. What is the Government’s assessment of this emerging trend in overseas jurisdictions? And what is the Government’s response?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00678,2019-03-01-T-006,678,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Chairman, Singapore has always taken a tough stance against drug abuse. For drug traffickers, the death penalty may even be imposed. This policy stance takes into account the potential damage and detrimental effects that drug abusers cause themselves, their families and the wider Singaporean Community."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00679,2019-03-01-T-006,679,Sitoh Yih Pin,I do not think that this belief has changed over the years amongst the majority of Singaporeans.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00680,2019-03-01-T-006,680,Sitoh Yih Pin,"The recent numbers for 2018 released by the Central Narcotics Bureau, however, reveal a worrying trend."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00681,2019-03-01-T-006,681,Sitoh Yih Pin,"The total number of drug abusers arrested in 2018 increased by 11% from 2017. Of the 3,438 drug abusers who were arrested in 2018, about 40% or 1,370 of them were below 30 years old. Drug abusers in the 20 to 29 years age group continue to form the largest group of abusers in 2018. In particular, of the total number of drug abusers arrested in 2018 – 40% were new abusers. Of these new abusers, about two-thirds or about 64% were under 30 years old. The numbers suggest that there is a worrying trend where our youths of today have a more liberal attitude towards the use of drugs and are more likely to engage or partake in them. Sir, this is a trend that we must arrest."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00682,2019-03-01-T-006,682,Sitoh Yih Pin,It has been reported in the media just this week that there are plans by MHA to engage youths on the dangers of drug abuse as well as to legislate stiffer laws against the promotion of drugs to youths. I invite the Minister to share with this House further details of the Ministry’s plans to reduce the number of youths involved in the consumption of drugs.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00683,2019-03-01-T-006,683,Rahayu Mahzam,"Sir, in Malay please."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00684,2019-03-01-T-006,684,Rahayu Mahzam,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to join Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Amrin Amin in one of the outreach events for the Dadah Itu Haram campaign at the coffee shops within Bukit Batok as well as Changi Village. We joined several other volunteers, including representatives from the Singapore Muslim Women's Association (PPIS) to walk the ground and convey the anti-drug message to the shopowners and their customers."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00685,2019-03-01-T-006,685,Rahayu Mahzam,"Such efforts are a good platform to get to know the community and obtain feedback. Through the session with Mr Amrin, I found that generally many people are aware of this campaign and our community’s efforts to combat drugs. I realise that a lot of time and effort have been spent on this campaign and it appears to be successful."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00686,2019-03-01-T-006,686,Rahayu Mahzam,"Although there is now a deeper understanding of the importance of staying away from drugs and numerous efforts to help drug abusers rehabilitate, there is still some concern about the number of Malay/Muslim abusers compared to other communities. Drugs do not only affect the abuser, but also the drug abuser’s family and children. The effort to combat drug abuse in our community must continue. Therefore, I would like to ask for further details about the Dadah Itu Haram campaign. What was achieved over the course of the campaign? Has there been any effort to measure its effectiveness? Are there other plans to enhance public education about these anti-drug efforts so that we can see a reduction in the number of drug abusers or a decline in the drug problem within our community?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00687,2019-03-01-T-006,687,Pritam Singh,"Mr Chairman, Sir, earlier this week, the Central Narcotics Bureau shared that the number of drug abusers in Singapore in 2018 had increased by 11%, with new abusers comprising 40% of all cases. In concert, the drugs of choice have also evolved. Today, psycho-active substances and methamphetamine are the norm. To this end, the recent amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act in the direction of rehabilitation for hardcore addicts is to be welcomed."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00688,2019-03-01-T-006,688,Pritam Singh,"Minister shared during the debate that the profile of abusers had changed along with the change in profile of the general population. However, in the absence of more information on the background of hardcore addicts in DRC and LT, I am concerned that the latest rehabilitative improvements may inevitably be tilted in favour of addicts who come from more affluent households. On the surface of things, it would appear that they would have fewer obstacles procuring drugs as compared to low-income addicts who may resort to crime to feed their urge. Such a prospect may mean that hardcore addicts with criminal antecedents and para-criminal charges would ironically have lesser access to the new rehabilitation regime which can help keep them out of long-term detention."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00689,2019-03-01-T-006,689,Pritam Singh,"A useful indication of how the new regime may operate would be to have some sense of the income and social economic background of hardcore addicts who are under the LT regime. I would also like to enquire if there is a distinction to the type of drugs consumed by low-income and affluent addicts respectively. I urge the Ministry to keep a tab on this issue to see how low-income hardcore addicts can be better rehabilitated since many, in view of the concurrent criminal record of antecedents, may not be able to extricate themselves out of the LT regime towards rehabilitation. Paradoxically, these low-income hardcore addicts may need the most help and rehabilitative assistance."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00690,2019-03-01-T-006,690,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Chairman, when offenders are released from the prisons, many leave with a desire to change, to reconnect with their families and to contribute to the community. Securing employment is a critical step for ex-offenders to start afresh. Having and being able to keep a job gives one a sense of purpose and self-confidence. It also gives one meaning and satisfaction from being able to provide for their family and themselves. However, the transition from prison to work is not easy."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00691,2019-03-01-T-006,691,Baey Yam Keng,"With limited work experience or the gap from previous work experience and some with low or no educational qualifications, many inmates may only be able to qualify for entry-level positions when they re-enter the workforce. For many individuals, the fast-changing labour market is a concern. This is especially challenging for ex-offenders as they must adapt to a job environment that may have changed from the time when they went into prison."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00692,2019-03-01-T-006,692,Baey Yam Keng,"Employers’ support for ex-offenders in the workforce is key to enhancing inmates' employability. SCORE’s efforts to enhance inmates’ employability would be futile if employers are not receptive to offering inmates jobs when they are released. I have met several ex-offenders at my Meet-People-Session asking for help to find a job, and because of not being gainfully employed, they have to seek financial assistance to help their daily needs."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00693,2019-03-01-T-006,693,Baey Yam Keng,"What are MHA's plans to further enhance inmates' employability as part of the rehabilitation efforts? In particular, how will MHA be working with employers to strengthen the employment outcomes of our ex-offenders?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00694,2019-03-01-T-006,694,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Chairman, our prison takes a rehabilitative approach towards ex-offenders, and as such, there are a number of programmes to rehabilitate and re-integrate offenders so they may become responsible citizens upon completion of their sentence. But for rehabilitation to be successful, they must first have a safe place to stabilise their lives, or they could risk falling back to crime."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00695,2019-03-01-T-006,695,Saktiandi Supaat,"One of my residents started sleeping at the void deck of his flats for months shortly after his release from prison. He had a tiff with his family. He had no one to turn to, and was completely lost. He came to my Meet-the-People Session for food rations and help. I believe his case is not unique. I recently raised a question in Parliament about inmates who do not have a place to stay after their release. I was informed that those who are homeless would be referred to the Family Resource Centre at the Singapore Prison Service, as well as interim housing options, such as halfway houses and shelter homes."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00696,2019-03-01-T-006,696,Saktiandi Supaat,"I am concerned for those who thought they had a home to return to, but only to find that their family was not willing to accept them. They did not want to go back to get a referral, or they found the process to be troublesome. Then there are also those who do not like the interim housing options because of the restrictions. Some of my residents told me they prefer staying with friends who would have them, or in public places until they have found a stable job. Nevertheless, many job applications would require the applicant to give their home address, so this poses another stumbling block for this group."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00697,2019-03-01-T-006,697,Saktiandi Supaat,Can the Ministry and other relevant agencies establish a hotline and safe lodging coupled with job agency services to help these people get back on their feet? What more MHA and the prisons service can do to ensure the prisoners have the necessary fall back option if the homes they return to are not viable? Can more be done in terms of resources by MHA and other national agencies to ensure inmates have a hotline or safe lodging for them with a comfortable environment and embedded job search agency services for these groups of people before they stabilise their lives? Can MHA and relevant agencies also work with the private sector real estate agencies and/or property agents to ensure the supply of adequate matching of rental housing is available for inmates about to be released or have been released but found out they have emergency housing issues?
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00698,2019-03-01-T-006,698,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Mr Chairman, while the number of fires that occurred last year have fallen, more than half of them occurred in residences with more people injured in fires last year suffering from burns and smoke inhalation. In 2018 there were four fatalities from fires and all cases occurred at home."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00699,2019-03-01-T-006,699,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"A worrying trend is the number of fires involving electric bicycles and scooters and other personal mobility devices (PMDs). In 2018, there were 74 such fires. This is an increase of more than 50% as compared to the previous year and resulted in 22 injuries."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00700,2019-03-01-T-006,700,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"In our constituency at Changi Simei, there were three residential fires in 2018, two occurred during the charging of PMDs and another involved a fish tank catching fire. Thank goodness there were no fatalities."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00701,2019-03-01-T-006,701,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Two weeks ago, a fire broke out in the switch room of Carlton hotel. I was actually having lunch at the hotel and was amongst the thousand people that had been evacuated from the premises. Fortunately, there was no injuries but the fire did cause power disruptions for nearby buildings and several MRT stations."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00702,2019-03-01-T-006,702,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"With our dense population, high-rise buildings, close living proximity and work environments, how can we improve fire safety for our buildings, especially older buildings? How can we ensure the readiness of our people to know what to do to stay safe in the event of a fire?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00703,2019-03-01-T-006,703,Low Thia Khiang,"Mr Chairman, Sir, the SCDF designated residential buildings that go beyond 40 storeys as Super High-rise Residential Buildings. There are additional Fire Code requirements such as the creation of refuge floor with holding area at 20-storey intervals and the installation of larger capacity fire-lift. In 2013, such buildings were required to have two fire lifts to facilitate the evacuation of people with disabilities by firefighters."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00704,2019-03-01-T-006,704,Low Thia Khiang,"After a tragic fire at Marina Bay in 2014, where two security guards died in the fire, the requirement to appoint trained Competent Persons for Super High-rise Private Residential Buildings was implemented. The Competent Person, such as the Managing Agent’s supervisor, will perform fire safety duties and train security guards to execute evacuation procedures properly."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00705,2019-03-01-T-006,705,Low Thia Khiang,"In a fire at a 48th floor unit at Pinnacle Duxton in May last year, it was reported that a man and a woman, in their 60s, were hurt, suffering smoke inhalation. It was also reported that many residents living on the 47th and 48th floors chose to use the lifts to evacuate despite knowing the risk of being trapped in the lifts. A senior aged 64 years said he and his family walked from the 48th to the 45th floor, then gave up and took the lift to evacuate."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00706,2019-03-01-T-006,706,Low Thia Khiang,"I think there is a gap here for Super High-rise Public Residential Buildings, as there are no Competent Persons and trained security guards to help conduct regular public education of residents and facilitate proper evacuation during fire. There is urgency in this with the ageing society, as more and more seniors find it onerous to walk down 20 storeys to the refuge floor. Some seniors may not even know that they should not evacuate using the fire lifts."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00707,2019-03-01-T-006,707,Rahayu Mahzam,"The efforts taken in SG Secure to create awareness in the community and equip people with skills to respond to crises like terror attacks are commendable. The awareness on the ground of the importance of preparedness has been enhanced over the past few years. There is still some room though to develop the actual preparedness, for example by encouraging more people in the community to go through training for CPR and on the use of AED. This could be coupled with efforts to build racial and religious understanding amongst the different communities in Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00708,2019-03-01-T-006,708,Rahayu Mahzam,"At the international platform, we hear about the strength of ISIS waning. However, there are still instances of self-radicalisation occurring all around the world and in particular, in Singapore. We therefore need to continue being vigilant and continue to ""exercise those muscles"" so that we remain prepared. The efforts in creating awareness and preparedness must continue as we learn lessons from incidents abroad and reflect on the instances of self-radicalisation in Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00709,2019-03-01-T-006,709,Rahayu Mahzam,Could MHA provide an update on the efforts carried out so far and the plans for SGSecure moving forward as well as MHA's efforts in combating self-radicalisation?
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00710,2019-03-01-T-006,710,Gan Thiam Poh,"Sir, terrorism remains a grave concern and much as we prefer not to believe this, it is highly likely to be a matter of ""not if, but when"". So far, Singapore has been fortunate in that we managed to avoid major incidents, thanks to the diligence and competence of our security agencies. Besides boosting security measures, we have to strengthen our ability to deal with the consequence of potential attacks. Our community must remain united across ethnic and religious groups."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00711,2019-03-01-T-006,711,Gan Thiam Poh,Would the Minister share updates on SG Secure and how it would help to foster a community which is more resilient and self-reliant in dealing with crises like terror attacks as well as MHA's efforts in combating self-radicalisation?
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00712,2019-03-01-T-006,712,,"Mr Christoper de Souza, you can take both your cuts."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00713,2019-03-01-T-006,713,Christopher de Souza,"While we put in place steps to deter terror threats, we must, equally, be prepared in the event a threat vests on our shores. It is not just the prevention of terror attacks that counts but the ""cure"" after it happens. Even as we currently enjoy racial and religious harmony, we cannot take it for granted. A concrete sense of resilience must prevail in the minds of all Singaporeans – regardless of race or religion – to remain united, steadfastly protecting the racial and religious harmony while rejecting the threat of terror and its perpetrators. What steps has MHA taken to detect and deter self-radicalisation and what community-based exercises will be carried out to imbue a sense of post-attack resilience in fellow Singaporeans?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00714,2019-03-01-T-006,714,Christopher de Souza,"In 2018, the overall crime rate increased, mostly due to a 20.6% increase in scams conducted online or on the phone. Of the online crimes, a ""significant proportion"" were committed by foreign syndicates. Cybercrimes may have a transnational element to them, but their ill consequences can be felt harshly at home. This is especially when syndicates target the elderly in cheating cases or when love scams are deployed to take advantage of Singaporeans. To stem the harm felt in Singapore, my question is  how will MHA build on its capabilities to tackle local and cross-border cybercrimes and enhance public awareness to help prevent their re-occurrence?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00715,2019-03-01-T-006,715,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Chairman, traffic accidents are regrettable occurrences on our roads. In Singapore, we legislate strong measures to minimise the number of traffic accidents. In an ideal world, all traffic accidents should be prevented."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00716,2019-03-01-T-006,716,Sitoh Yih Pin,"In the meantime, it is clear that certain road user behaviours directly increase the risk of traffic accidents that could potentially result in injuries or fatalities. Instances such as drink driving or running a red light are two examples."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00717,2019-03-01-T-006,717,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Traffic accidents arising out of these reckless and irresponsible driving behaviors are avoidable and should be sternly dealt with as these drivers put not only themselves, but other road users at risk."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00718,2019-03-01-T-006,718,Sitoh Yih Pin,Some of the numbers recently released by MHA on the road traffic accident situation for 2018 raises serious concerns about such reckless and irresponsible driving behaviours.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00719,2019-03-01-T-006,719,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Drink-driving accidents increased by 17% from 2017 to 2018. In particular, the number of motorcyclists who were drink-driving and got involved in accidents increased by 51%! Red-light running violations increased by 15% with number of accidents resulting from red-light running increasing by 2.6%."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00720,2019-03-01-T-006,720,Sitoh Yih Pin,It has been reported that MHA is already taking steps to impose stiffer penalties for drink-driving and other road traffic offences.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00721,2019-03-01-T-006,721,Sitoh Yih Pin,I invite the Minister to share with this House if the Ministry is considering taking any other steps such as further raising awareness amongst the public or the imposition of a review course requirement for responsible driving on new or experienced drivers.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00722,2019-03-01-T-006,722,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,A recent survey by AXA Insurance showed that nearly one in two Singapore drivers feel that the roads have become less safe than three years ago despite a fall in fatal accidents and a drop in the number of accidents. Top reasons cited in the survey were more aggressive drivers and non-drivers on the road.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00723,2019-03-01-T-006,723,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Based on recent media reports, while the number of accidents has fallen, there is an upward trend in irresponsible driving. What are the causes for irresponsible driving in Singapore?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00724,2019-03-01-T-006,724,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"While technology has helped to make our cars and roads safer, technology has also become a source of distraction for many drivers who text or browse social media on their mobile phones, fiddle with their GPS or playlist on their devices while driving. Some reports have alleged that texting while driving is worse than driving drunk in its effect on your ability to drive safely, as it splits your attention."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00725,2019-03-01-T-006,725,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,What actions are taken to address dangerous driving situations? And how will the Home Team further improve road safety to make our roads safer for all road users?
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00726,2019-03-01-T-006,726,Murali Pillai,"Sir, in a number of jurisdictions across the world, there are stricter drink driving laws against probationary and young drivers as compared to other drivers. For example, in New Zealand, for young drivers, there is a zero alcohol limit imposed against them. Canada has similar laws. In many states of Australia, zero alcohol limits are also imposed on probationary drivers. It seems to me that the regulations are imposed not because young and probationary drivers are more likely to drink-drive compared to other drivers, but because there is a need to better protect them from the effects of alcohol which is likely to impair their judgement much more than the experienced and older drivers."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00727,2019-03-01-T-006,727,Murali Pillai,"In the past five years, the average number of probationary drivers in Singapore arrested for drink driving per year is 111. The corresponding figure for younger drivers is 17 per year. The average number of drink driving arrests per year is 2,298. Whilst the instances of drink driving amongst probationary and young drivers in Singapore are relatively low, the numbers are not piffling. More importantly, our laws do not make a distinction on the impact of alcohol on probationary and young drivers’ judgement as compared to other experienced drivers."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00728,2019-03-01-T-006,728,Murali Pillai,"For these reasons, I recommend that the Ministry consider putting in place a tiered drink driving system that takes into account the effect of alcohol on probationary and young drivers."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00729,2019-03-01-T-006,729,,Minister Shanmugam.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00730,2019-03-01-T-006,730,K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, I thank the hon Members for their comments."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00731,2019-03-01-T-006,731,K Shanmugam,"Twenty-eighteen was an intense year for the Home Team. High-signature events – the Trump-Kim Summit, the ASEAN Summit, (because we were the Chair of ASEAN), and, of course, some issues arose in our waters – the disputed Malaysia Johor Port Limits. So, to deal with that  Police Coast Guard have been operating at a very high tempo since when the dispute began, round the clock. And the entire Home Team because of the events of last year have been working round the clock. I want to thank all the Home Team officers for their hard work, their dedication and the professionalism with which they have approached their work."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00732,2019-03-01-T-006,732,K Shanmugam,"Let me move to an overview of the safety and security situation. Like in past years, we continue to rank very highly on indices on safety and security. The Gallup Global Law and Order Report of 2018, the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index of 2019 and the Global Smart City Performance Index of 2018, all ranked us number one on this score."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00733,2019-03-01-T-006,733,K Shanmugam,"The crime and drug situations remain under control and our internal surveys, which we do regularly, show that public trust and confidence in the Home Team remains extremely high."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00734,2019-03-01-T-006,734,K Shanmugam,"Let me now move on to what we intend to do this year. A significant step this year will be taken to qualitatively improve our capabilities. We are going to set up a new Science and Technology Agency that will help transform the Home Team through the increased use of technology to support operations – for example, through the use of biometric identifiers at our borders; using our sensors to better detect threats; and robotics to automate and streamline processes."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00735,2019-03-01-T-006,735,K Shanmugam,"The approach for the new Science and Technology Board is to deepen the Home Team's scientific and engineering capabilities. We want to strengthen the operational effectiveness, and we want to work on developing new technologies, focusing on threat detection, digital forensics, unmanned systems. Really, it will pull together Science and Technology (S&T) resources, integrate S&T requirements across the Home Team and attract and develop S&T talent, which is critical. Minister Josephine will speak in more detail about our plans."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00736,2019-03-01-T-006,736,K Shanmugam,We will also update the Committee on other plans to maintain Singapore's safety and security.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00737,2019-03-01-T-006,737,K Shanmugam,"Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin Amin will speak on drug abuse prevention, rehabilitation of offenders, cybercrime and the Home Team manpower transformation."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00738,2019-03-01-T-006,738,K Shanmugam,Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun Xueling will speak on improving fire and road safety and also improving community partnerships.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00739,2019-03-01-T-006,739,K Shanmugam,"I will speak on two emerging concerns, which Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Baey Yam Keng, Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Mr Gan Thiam Poh have raised  one, foreign interference in domestic politics; and second, trends that may undermine our religious harmony and what we intend to do about both of these. I will also speak about the rehabilitation of low-income drug abusers, a point raised by Mr Pritam Singh."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00740,2019-03-01-T-006,740,K Shanmugam,"First, on foreign interference in domestic politics. Last month, Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong spoke on overseas examples of foreign interference in domestic politics and elections."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00741,2019-03-01-T-006,741,K Shanmugam,I think Members and the public know the impact that foreign interference has on politics in different countries. It is well-documented. Hostile information campaigns have been used to weaken countries' resolve when countries are in conflict or tension between states – where one country uses hostile information campaign to destabilise the other country. Foreign actors have attempted to undermine democracy and elections in a number of countries. Foreign interference has also come into play to try and weaken the social fabric of different countries.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00742,2019-03-01-T-006,742,K Shanmugam,"Mr Christopher de Souza spoke about the need to look at what has happened to other countries, how they have dealt with foreign interference, and learn some lessons on what we can do. We intend to do that. We have been doing it."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00743,2019-03-01-T-006,743,K Shanmugam,"Several countries have, in fact, passed laws to combat both falsehoods as well as foreign interference. I will quote a couple of examples. In Germany, the Network Enforcement Act requires social media platforms to set up a process and the process must ensure that ""manifestly illegal content"", such as hate speech, should be removed within 24 hours of receipt of a complaint. Failure to comply could mean fines of up to 50 million euros."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00744,2019-03-01-T-006,744,K Shanmugam,"In Australia, recently, legislation was passed on dealing with foreign interference. Stiff penalties. There was a complete ban foreign political donations. And those who act on behalf of foreign nations or entities must declare that relationship. Failure to comply could mean up to five years' jail. And for foreign interference aimed at influencing elections or supporting foreign intelligence – people who engage in that could face a penalty of up to 20 years in jail. The kind of penalties that you see I think indicate the severity of the threat and how countries are reacting to them."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00745,2019-03-01-T-006,745,K Shanmugam,"We are studying their experiences; we are studying what has happened to them and what they are doing to combat the threat. Our current thinking is that early detection and exposure is critical. Second, we must be able to act quickly and keep up with new digital-age tactics. Third, apart from strengthening our laws, we have to build up the ability of Singaporeans to understand what is happening, to discern, to respond appropriately, and to try and resist foreign interference. We must train people to spot it but it is a reality that many people will find it difficult. We must also accept that. Some of the steps that I have outlined can only be taken through legislation. The Government will come to this House later this year with its proposals."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00746,2019-03-01-T-006,746,K Shanmugam,"Let me deal with the concerns raised by Mr Pritam Singh on low-income drug abusers. He said that recent changes to the Misuse of Drugs Act may inadvertently operate in favour of drug abusers who come from more affluent households, and are we are doing enough to help low-income hardcore addicts."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00747,2019-03-01-T-006,747,K Shanmugam,"I think the questions are fair. I will say look at the facts. He did preface his speech by saying he does not have the statistics with him. So, with that caveat in mind, if you look at those in long-term imprisonment, nine in 10 inmates, before these changes were made, were from the bottom 20th percentile of wage earners nationally."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00748,2019-03-01-T-006,748,K Shanmugam,"Long-term or (LT) inmates are drug abusers who have been picked up for the third time or more. That data shows that those in the lowest 20th percentile of wage earners are no more likely to have both drug and criminal convictions at the same time, as compared to those who earn more. They will be eligible to be channelled to DRC if they admit to drug use and have committed no other crime. That is an answer based on the facts in the current situation."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00749,2019-03-01-T-006,749,K Shanmugam,But take a step back more philosophically. Take a situation where there are those who abuse drugs and those abuse drugs as well as committed crime. Do they need to be treated differently?
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00750,2019-03-01-T-006,750,K Shanmugam,"For those who abuse drugs, the right thing to do is not to look so much at their economic or social background, but to see what is going to help them kick the habit and become useful citizens in society. And our approach based on many years of data and experience, science- and evidence-based, is that we can do more with rehabilitation. And that has been welcomed by all."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00751,2019-03-01-T-006,751,K Shanmugam,"At the same time, let us take those who commit crime in addition to abusing drugs. What is in their interest? It is in their interest that we help them both to kick their drug habit and, at the same time, not commit a crime."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00752,2019-03-01-T-006,752,K Shanmugam,What is in society's interest? It is also to prevent them from committing a crime and ensuring the safety of society.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00753,2019-03-01-T-006,753,K Shanmugam,"So, those on the second category need to be helped to move out of criminality and drugs. So, we try and achieve that through a number of programmes, when they are in detention."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00754,2019-03-01-T-006,754,K Shanmugam,"How to help them, whether in LT or DRC – stay off drugs and crime is something that we are intensely focused upon. And hopefully, with our programmes, regardless of which socioeconomic group they come from, when they come out, they are able to lead a healthy life and a more productive life from their own perspective."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00755,2019-03-01-T-006,755,K Shanmugam,"So, for example, we have put in place a range of programmes to address the varied and complex causes of both addiction and crime. So, for all drug abusers, Prisons provides psychology-based correctional programmes. So Members can understand, Mr Singh can understand, if you committed a crime, you have done this, you go in, you get access to psychology-based correctional programmes which I think they need to address their underlying drug addiction issues."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00756,2019-03-01-T-006,756,K Shanmugam,"They also undergo skills training and work programmes. For example, we find that for those who, when they come out, are able to keep a job, their recidivism rate is much lower. So, we have to help them while they are in prison to try and get the right attitudes towards getting and keeping a job. SCORE provides job matching to emplace them in jobs before they are released and job coaches to help abusers stay in employment, draw a steady income."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00757,2019-03-01-T-006,757,K Shanmugam,"We also partner the community – halfway houses, religious organisations, to provide various forms of support, for example, interim housing arrangements. So those with a higher risk profile of re-offending are given more help, through the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme. So, after they get released, they go through the scheme. LT inmates will be put through the scheme and legislation has now made it mandatory."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00758,2019-03-01-T-006,758,K Shanmugam,"Prisons also work closely with community partners and other Government agencies supported by MSF, to ensure that abusers and their families, when they need financial assistance, can tap on community resources, whether at the point when they get admitted into detention or post-release."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00759,2019-03-01-T-006,759,K Shanmugam,"We will monitor closely the results closely, from the changes that have been made. Our intention is to try and make it work and we will make further changes where necessary. We will monitor closely."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00760,2019-03-01-T-006,760,K Shanmugam,"Let me now move on to religious harmony. There are three worrisome trends. Members spoke about them or asked what the Government's response, I will identify three trends that are of concern."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00761,2019-03-01-T-006,761,K Shanmugam,"First  resurgence of identity politics around the world. More people are identifying themselves in narrow ethnic, cultural and religious terms. They turn inward, they reject diversity, they reject co-existence with others."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00762,2019-03-01-T-006,762,K Shanmugam,"Political parties and movements that ride this wave have gained traction around the world. For example, far-right parties have made electoral gains in France, the Netherlands and Germany. Alt-right movement gained prominence in the US as well. Significant support for religion-based parties and parties which advocate moves in this direction have gained in our immediate region as well."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00763,2019-03-01-T-006,763,K Shanmugam,"Mr Baey Yam Keng spoke about increasing segregationist ideas and practices. These views are all around. They can come from foreign preachers, they can come from the Internet. One particular example of such teaching is what was said in Myanmar. Ashin Wirathu – some Members may be familiar with him – urging Buddhists to boycott Muslim businesses. And I quote, ""do business or interact with only our kind  same race and same faith"". So, it is all around us, and he is not alone."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00764,2019-03-01-T-006,764,K Shanmugam,"The second worrisome trend, as Mr Christopher de Souza and Ms Rahayu Mahzam have noted, the Internet has allowed hate speech and incitement to spread further and faster, and there can be devastating effects."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00765,2019-03-01-T-006,765,K Shanmugam,"The third trend is religiously-motivated terrorist groups who continue to spread their propaganda. Overseas experiences show that in the immediate aftermath of a terror attack, there is distrust, there is suspicion between communities. And the rise of Islamophobic incidents in Paris, Brussels in wake of attacks would be known to Members."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00766,2019-03-01-T-006,766,K Shanmugam,"So, how do we respond? Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Mr Christopher de Souza asked how we should respond."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00767,2019-03-01-T-006,767,K Shanmugam,"First, of course, the non-""sexy"" bit as it were, what we have always been doing – continue to build a strong Singaporean identity, preserve and grow our common space and experiences. It is hard work. It is a lot of work and it takes a long time. But we are where we are here today because of all the steps that we have taken over 50 years."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00768,2019-03-01-T-006,768,K Shanmugam,"Our education system, public housing and National Service, all examples of us coming together, common space, people of different backgrounds, understanding, creating our own value system, and building common experiences. We have to build a strong Singaporean identity through these common experiences."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00769,2019-03-01-T-006,769,K Shanmugam,"We also have to guard against segregationist thinking, teachings and practices that seek to reduce the opportunities for Singaporeans of different religions and races to come together."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00770,2019-03-01-T-006,770,K Shanmugam,"Second, we have to continue to keep religion and politics separate. Our politics, our approach is secular. We have managed to balance the right to religious freedom, with a secular approach to politics, and with the need to ensure harmony, peace and security in our multi-racial, multi-religious society."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00771,2019-03-01-T-006,771,K Shanmugam,"A key challenge – it is an increasing challenge – is to ensure that we can maintain the right balance in the face of the challenges that Members have spoken about, that I have acknowledged."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00772,2019-03-01-T-006,772,K Shanmugam,"So, we have to work harder in the community to maintain and strengthen the Singapore value system. We also have to review our legislation to deal with some of the challenges. We are reviewing our Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act in this context. We aim to give more details later this year, after we have thought through some of the issues and done some consultations."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00773,2019-03-01-T-006,773,K Shanmugam,"Third, we have to preserve the culture of mutual respect for each other’s religions. We have to reach out across religious lines, and keep the avenues of conversation open. Religious harmony is built and nurtured on the basis of trust among the communities. So, the Government will continue to provide platforms to facilitate dialogue and build this trust. And, of course, the Government is a key player and partner in this process."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00774,2019-03-01-T-006,774,,Minister Josephine Teo.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00775,2019-03-01-T-006,775,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, I will focus on the Home Team’s efforts to use science and technology to safeguard Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00776,2019-03-01-T-006,776,Josephine Teo,The Home Team is in the midst of an ambitious multi-year effort to transform itself to remain effective and capable. Members would be familiar with the challenges confronting the Home Team.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00777,2019-03-01-T-006,777,Josephine Teo,"The terrorist threat remains high. While ISIS has lost most of its territory in the Middle East, it remains a potent threat, inciting attacks in our part of the world. We continue to see cases of self-radicalisation in Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00778,2019-03-01-T-006,778,Josephine Teo,Crime has also evolved. Criminals are employing more sophisticated tactics with the help of technology. We see this in the rise of cybercrime and online scams.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00779,2019-03-01-T-006,779,Josephine Teo,"The workload of the Home Team has continued to increase and public expectations are rising. To cope with these challenges, simply increasing manpower is neither sustainable, nor effective."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00780,2019-03-01-T-006,780,Josephine Teo,"The way forward is for the Home Team to change the way we do things. Technology is key. As Ms Jessica Tan pointed out rightly, technology will enable us to be effective, even in the face of manpower constraints."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00781,2019-03-01-T-006,781,Josephine Teo,One good example is at our checkpoints. Our borders are Singapore’s first line of defence against security threats.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00782,2019-03-01-T-006,782,Josephine Teo,"In 2018, we saw more than 212 million travellers and 10 million consignments, containers and parcels cross our checkpoints. So, people 212 million, stuff 10 million."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00783,2019-03-01-T-006,783,Josephine Teo,"Protecting our borders is no easy feat, and will only get more challenging. By 2025, we expect cross-border traveller and cargo volumes to increase by around 40% and 70% respectively. So we need to rely on technology to meet these challenges."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00784,2019-03-01-T-006,784,Josephine Teo,"One way to do so is through biometrics technology. ICA will implement the BioScreen-Multi Modal Biometrics System or BioScreen-MMBS, across our checkpoints later this year. This system will allow ICA to use a combination of any of the three biometric identifiers, namely iris, facial and fingerprints, for immigration clearance. This paves the way for a more efficient and secure immigration clearance process. BioScreen-MMBS will provide our officers with a more dynamic tool to accurately identify travellers, especially those who could be of security interest. It will also allow ICA to build a robust biometrics database comprising the face, fingerprints and iris of every individual who crosses our borders, for post-incident investigation."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00785,2019-03-01-T-006,785,Josephine Teo,"Technology is critical not only to combating threats at our borders, but also inland."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00786,2019-03-01-T-006,786,Josephine Teo,"I will highlight a few key areas. The first is in detection, sense-making and surveillance capabilities. From major security incidents abroad, we know that a strong, immediate and coordinated response is key to saving lives, neutralising threats and restoring order. This is where technology matters. We have invested heavily in surveillance, command-and-control, and sense-making capabilities."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00787,2019-03-01-T-006,787,Josephine Teo,"Today, our Police Operations Command Centre uses real-time video feeds and data to enhance incident response. Already, our installation of police cameras, or POLCAM, in public areas has effectively deterred crime. Since 2012, POLCAM and our enforcement efforts have driven down property damage cases due to unlicensed moneylending harassment by over 80%."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00788,2019-03-01-T-006,788,Josephine Teo,Surveillance capability is also critical for identifying and apprehending terrorists. The FBI used surveillance footage to identify the perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombing. Photos of the suspects were released within days of the bombing to help the public locate them.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00789,2019-03-01-T-006,789,Josephine Teo,"We have plans to further strengthen our detection, tracking and sense-making capabilities. Video analytics will allow the Home Team to rapidly track down criminals and terrorists. Joint operational dashboards and common situation pictures will enable us to deliver more coordinated responses to incidents."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00790,2019-03-01-T-006,790,Josephine Teo,"The second area is forensics. Technology can also improve our forensics methods. For example, Police are exploring the digitalisation of forensic data, and building intelligence into forensics systems, to improve their sense-making and analytical prowess. Digital forensic laboratories will enhance our ability to extract evidence from digital devices. These capabilities will go a long way in enabling the Home Team to rapidly generate leads, and to apprehend offenders."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00791,2019-03-01-T-006,791,Josephine Teo,"The third area is in robotics and unmanned systems. We will continue to strengthen and augment our physical force and presence using robotics and unmanned systems. SPF and SCDF are already doing so. Unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, give ground commanders a bird’s eye view of the operating terrain and enhances their situational awareness. Robots can help firefighters tackle large-scale fires more effectively and safely. Robots and UAVs will eventually be able to carry out even more complex tasks autonomously. They will play a greater role in surveillance, search and rescue operations and in dealing with hazardous materials."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00792,2019-03-01-T-006,792,Josephine Teo,The fourth area is in building a dedicated science and technology Agency for the Home Team to augment and maintain the Home Team’s operational edge.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00793,2019-03-01-T-006,793,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman and Members, I have spoken about some of the important capabilities that support the Home Team’s current operations and that help to keep security threats at bay. But we know that we are heading into a future where science and technology will play a bigger part. We have to up the game in order to keep Singaporeans and Singapore safe."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00794,2019-03-01-T-006,794,Josephine Teo,"MHA has thus far partnered other government agencies, such as GovTech, DSTA and DSO, as well as industry partners like ST Engineering and Singtel, to develop these capabilities. We are currently ramping up our collaboration and partnership with these and other partners. For example, MHA will work with GovTech more closely in the area of ICT and digital services. And DSTA will help MHA to develop future command and control systems and new marine platforms."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00795,2019-03-01-T-006,795,Josephine Teo,"But as we look to further leverage technology, we will need to set up a dedicated agency to further develop the Home Team’s science and technology capabilities. Why is a dedicated agency going to be able to do that better?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00796,2019-03-01-T-006,796,Josephine Teo,"First, many of the capabilities I have spoken about, such as forensics, biometrics and surveillance, will become increasingly critical to safeguarding Singapore. We must stay ahead in these areas. Second, many of these capabilities are unique to the Home Team, reflecting our distinct operational context and mission requirements. Like other countries which have dedicated technical agencies for homeland security, the Home Team needs to strengthen our core team of scientists and engineers."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00797,2019-03-01-T-006,797,Josephine Teo,"Third, a dedicated agency will boost the joint Home Team approach, with capabilities developed and shared across Departments."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00798,2019-03-01-T-006,798,Josephine Teo,"Lastly, centralising science and technology talent that is today distributed across the different Home Team departments, will better support career development for the officers, which in turn deepens organisational capabilities."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00799,2019-03-01-T-006,799,Josephine Teo,"Ultimately, to combat fast-evolving security threats and to safeguard Singapore, the Home Team must possess deep in-house capabilities and expertise to build mission-critical abilities in a responsive manner."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00800,2019-03-01-T-006,800,Josephine Teo,"Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about our plans for and the role of the new agency. We intend to table a bill in Parliament to establish a Home Team science and technology agency as a Statutory Board under MHA."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00801,2019-03-01-T-006,801,Josephine Teo,"It will be responsible for developing and sustaining capabilities to support Home Team Departments. To achieve this, the agency will conduct applied research, and develop new systems to be deployed in the Home Team’s various operations. The agency will help to direct our investments in capability development, which will more than double from $979 million in FY2019, to $1.9 billion in FY2025."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00802,2019-03-01-T-006,802,Josephine Teo,"For the scientists and engineers of this new agency, technical expertise is necessary, but not sufficient. They must also have a deep understanding of the Home Team’s unique operational needs, in order to apply and integrate effective solutions, and to work alongside Home Team officers. They will be part of the Home Team, so that we can build capabilities in a timely and responsive manner."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00803,2019-03-01-T-006,803,Josephine Teo,"The new agency will not duplicate efforts, but will continue to tap on existing Whole of Government centres of expertise. We are looking to establish the agency by the end of the year, and will provide more details in due course. And I look forward to debate in Parliament. I welcome Members' views and contributions when we table the Bill."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00804,2019-03-01-T-006,804,Josephine Teo,"Mr Low Thia Khiang asked an important question about data security. This is of course an issue that is very much on our mind, especially as the use of technology and data becomes more prevalent across the Home Team."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00805,2019-03-01-T-006,805,Josephine Teo,"Today, there are already strict guidelines on how data is collected, accessed, stored, and protected in the Home Team. For example, sensitive data can only be accessed by authorised officers who have a legitimate purpose for doing so. There are also systems in place that help to track and monitor what data was accessed, or modified by whom, to guard against abuse, and to ensure that data collected is authentic and secure. So, there is a trail. You can find out who made what modifications."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00806,2019-03-01-T-006,806,Josephine Teo,"Where a citizen suspects that his personal data has been misused by any Home Team Department, he should approach my Ministry, or GovTech, and action will be taken to investigate. And if we find out that something was done, we will take disciplinary action. Anyone found abusing data for unauthorised uses will be severely dealt with under the law."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00807,2019-03-01-T-006,807,Josephine Teo,"Sir, our surveillance and data collection capabilities serve no other purpose than to allow us to better safeguard Singapore and Singaporeans. MHA takes its responsibility as the custodian of the data it collects very seriously. We, of all agencies, understand that any data abuse, breach, or leak, can severely compromise public trust."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00808,2019-03-01-T-006,808,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, if you will allow me, I would like to conclude in Mandarin."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00809,2019-03-01-T-006,809,Josephine Teo,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Chairman, in the coming years, science and technology will become increasingly indispensable in the Home Team’s efforts to combat security threats. They will help to keep Singapore and Singaporeans safe and secure."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00810,2019-03-01-T-006,810,Josephine Teo,"It is of utmost importance that we plan ahead, to ensure that our Home Team officers have the full support they require to exploit technology to our advantage. A new dedicated science and technology agency for the Home Team will give us the much needed expertise and focus to do so."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00811,2019-03-01-T-006,811,Josephine Teo,I am confident that the Home Team will succeed in its mission to keep Singapore safe and secure.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00812,2019-03-01-T-006,812,,Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00813,2019-03-01-T-006,813,Amrin Amin,"Mr Chairman, I will focus on four areas  fighting cybercrime and scams; transforming the Home Team; keeping Singapore drug-free; and supporting rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00814,2019-03-01-T-006,814,Amrin Amin,"On the first area, fighting cybercrimes and scams. Last year, crimes reported increased by 1.4%, largely driven by an increase in scams. More than $158 million was lost to scams in 2018 and this is just a conservative estimate."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00815,2019-03-01-T-006,815,Amrin Amin,"The public continues to fall largely for three types of scams  e-commerce scams, such as online purchase scams; two, credit-for-sex scams, where scammers pose as attractive women on social media platforms; and, three, China officials' impersonation scams, where victims receive calls from seemingly official numbers, and are told to provide banking details or remit money to assist in ""criminal investigations"". Last year, one victim lost about $1.7 million this way."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00816,2019-03-01-T-006,816,Amrin Amin,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked about how MHA would be tackling cybercrime, especially those targeting the elderly and Internet love scams."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00817,2019-03-01-T-006,817,Amrin Amin,We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00818,2019-03-01-T-006,818,Amrin Amin,"First, we have strengthened international cooperation with foreign law enforcement agencies to disrupt foreign syndicates. Last year, Police conducted joint operations with the Royal Malaysia Police and Hong Kong Police, which led to the arrest of over 40 suspects responsible for over 150 Internet love scams across three jurisdictions."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00819,2019-03-01-T-006,819,Amrin Amin,"Second, we have devoted more resources. In 2017, Police set up the Transnational Commercial Crime Task Force to investigate cross-border scams. To date, we have seized more than $1.5 million and frozen over 600 bank accounts. Police also set up the E-Commerce Fraud Enforcement and Coordination Team in November last year. In just two months, more than 200 e-commerce scam cases were solved and 26 scammers were arrested."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00820,2019-03-01-T-006,820,Amrin Amin,"Third, we have raised public awareness. There is a dedicated scam advisory hotline and ""Scamalert.sg"" website which provide information on latest scams."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00821,2019-03-01-T-006,821,Amrin Amin,"We have worked with online marketing platform Carousell, convenience stores, remittance agencies, banks and other stakeholders to remove suspicious advertisements, publish scam advisories, and look out for potential scam victims."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00822,2019-03-01-T-006,822,Amrin Amin,"To educate the elderly who are vulnerable to such scams, Police conducted Silver IT Fest 2018. Police also reached out to elderly residents through home visits and Silver Watch, a programme to equip seniors with crime prevention knowledge."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00823,2019-03-01-T-006,823,Amrin Amin,"Together with the National Crime Prevention Council, we launched the ""Let’s Fight Scams"" campaign, partnering community and businesses. We will continue to focus on this fight."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00824,2019-03-01-T-006,824,Amrin Amin,"Mr Chairman, turning now to my second area – Home Team Transformation. MHA has embarked on Home Team Transformation since 2015. The Transformation aims to strengthen joint operations in the Home Team, deepen our science and technology capabilities, and upskill our officers to better meet future challenges."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00825,2019-03-01-T-006,825,Amrin Amin,The Transformation efforts are progressing well. Mr Murali Pillai asked about how MHA would ensure that Singapore Police Force (SPF) would be sufficiently resourced to continue to operate effectively.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00826,2019-03-01-T-006,826,Amrin Amin,"The SPF is constantly looking at new ways to improve productivity and efficiency of our officers. As part of the Home Team Transformation, systems are developed to support ground operations and ease administrative workload. One example is SPF's convenient and citizen-centric e-Services. On 8 July 2018, the revamped e-Services 1.0 was introduced."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00827,2019-03-01-T-006,827,Amrin Amin,"Members of the public can now perform online transactions such as reporting crimes, from home. Self-help terminals have also been installed at several Neighbourhood Police Centres. Time saved from automating such services can be re-directed to frontline core policing duties where human touch is crucial."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00828,2019-03-01-T-006,828,Amrin Amin,"Another key aspect of policing is community partnership. In 2018, SPF introduced a new vocation for its voluntary service vocation. It is called VSC (Community). I attended the training graduation of the inaugural batch of 38 VSC (Community) officers in April 2018. From 38 officers, we now have 134 VSC (Community) officers."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00829,2019-03-01-T-006,829,Amrin Amin,"Dressed in a blue police polo T-shirt and black cargo pants, VSC (Community) officers join regular police officers at high visibility patrols in community areas, assist in crowd and traffic regulation, and security checks at major security events."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00830,2019-03-01-T-006,830,Amrin Amin,VSC (Community) is an example of how the community can help augment police resources and contribute to our nation’s security.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00831,2019-03-01-T-006,831,Amrin Amin,Mr Desmond Choo asked how we are re-skilling our officers to better utilise technology and whether there is scope to form training committees.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00832,2019-03-01-T-006,832,Amrin Amin,"The Home Team recognises the importance of upskilling our officers to take on higher value work. This is crucial as we transform, introduce new concepts of operations, and re-design existing jobs to leverage new technologies."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00833,2019-03-01-T-006,833,Amrin Amin,"MHA formed a Skills Transformation Development Team to identify the training required for officers to meet increasing operational expectations. The team identified a need to develop officers' skills in key areas such as data analytics, technology literacy and cybersecurity."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00834,2019-03-01-T-006,834,Amrin Amin,"Mr Desmond Choo also asked about the re-employment of officers. In the last five years, MHA re-employed about 45% of our retired uniformed officers. We aim to re-employ as many of our officers as we can."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00835,2019-03-01-T-006,835,Amrin Amin,"I will now turn to my third area – keeping Singapore drug-free. Mr Chairman, this is a top priority for MHA."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00836,2019-03-01-T-006,836,Amrin Amin,"Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Tan Wu Meng asked about Singapore’s views on the moves by some countries to legalise the use of cannabis."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00837,2019-03-01-T-006,837,Amrin Amin,"The Government’s stand on illicit drugs, including cannabis, is clear. Drugs are addictive and harmful. Research has shown that they lead to irreversible brain damage, and even death. But strangely, some countries have legalised cannabis. Contrary to evidence, they portray raw cannabis as ""harmless"" and even having ""health benefits""."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00838,2019-03-01-T-006,838,Amrin Amin,"The trend is largely driven by commercial lobbying thirsty for profits, and serves as a politically expedient way out of a drug abuse situation over which some governments have lost control."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00839,2019-03-01-T-006,839,Amrin Amin,"Public interest and the welfare of individuals, families and societies are sacrificed on the altars of bad science, profits and political expediency."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00840,2019-03-01-T-006,840,Amrin Amin,Preventive education is our first line of defence against the drug scourge.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00841,2019-03-01-T-006,841,Amrin Amin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked about MHA's plans to engage youths on the harms of drug abuse. This is a concern. Young abusers below 30 formed close to two-thirds of new abusers arrested last year. The number of new youth abusers below 20 increased by 30% last year to 305.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00842,2019-03-01-T-006,842,Amrin Amin,"Today, CNB reaches out to students through talks, roadshows, social media and projects. With their talents and passion, youths can be powerful anti-drug advocates."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00843,2019-03-01-T-006,843,Amrin Amin,"Let me share some examples. Nanyang Polytechnic graduates, Jillian Khoo and Teh Yu Yin produced an illustrated book titled ""Captain Drug Buster vs Dr Wacko  The Final Showdown"". The storybook teaches our 7- to 10-year-olds on the harms of drugs. Teachers and parents can read to their children and equip them with the facts about the harms of drugs early. You can get this storybook at primary school, public and Parliament libraries."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00844,2019-03-01-T-006,844,Amrin Amin,"Another example  19-year-old Singaporean, Ms Nur Afikah, participated in the annual United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Youth Forum in March 2018. At the Forum, she exchanged ideas with representatives from 25 other countries on running effective programmes to prevent drug abuse. She spoke from personal experience having witnessed the devastating impact of drugs on relatives and friends. At 2019's Youth Forum, Singapore will be represented by Javier Ng, a 17-year old ITE student."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00845,2019-03-01-T-006,845,Amrin Amin,"Javier and Afikah are among 122 youth Anti-Drug Abuse Advocates. Our youth advocates have organised various events, most recently, an anti-drug roadshow at Singapore Institute of Management."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00846,2019-03-01-T-006,846,Amrin Amin,"Even as we do more in preventive drug education, we cannot let up on enforcement. We amended the Misuse of Drugs Act recently to introduce contamination and child endangerment offences."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00847,2019-03-01-T-006,847,Amrin Amin,"Acts of contamination which facilitate or promote drug use have been criminalised. Drug abusers who leave drugs lying around at home and expose children to the risks of drugs, will also be criminally liable."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00848,2019-03-01-T-006,848,Amrin Amin,"We will also strengthen our drug rehabilitation regime. We will make a distinction between abusers who only consume drugs, and those who face charges for other offences of harm to society."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00849,2019-03-01-T-006,849,Amrin Amin,"Pure drug offenders will undergo intensive rehabilitation in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre, instead of going through the long-term imprisonment pathway. After their release, they will be subject to longer supervision in the community of up to five years."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00850,2019-03-01-T-006,850,Amrin Amin,A key factor that keeps offenders from re-offending is strong pro-social support. Family is an important source.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00851,2019-03-01-T-006,851,Amrin Amin,"Prisons has set up the Family Interventions and Reintegration Support Team (FIRST) in July 2018. Under this trial, Family Case Managers work closely with community partners to strengthen dysfunctional families, so they can support and be meaningfully involved in the rehabilitation of their loved ones. With strong family support, the reintegration process for the inmate becomes easier."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00852,2019-03-01-T-006,852,Amrin Amin,"As mentioned by Mr Saktiandi Supaat, unfortunately, there are still cases where ex-offenders are unable to return home due to unresolved family grievances. For help, they can go to Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association's Step-Up Centre in Sengkang and the newly opened centre in Taman Jurong. They may also call the ComCare hotline or approach the nearest Social Service Office or Family Service Centre. If they have no alternative family support and are unable to afford other housing options, they can apply to HDB for public rental housing."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00853,2019-03-01-T-006,853,Amrin Amin,"There are schemes to support those in need, and inmates are briefed on help avenues before release. We are constantly reviewing to see how else we can support ex-offenders in their re-integration. It is a difficult journey but ex-offenders must also take ownership and responsibility for their reintegration."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00854,2019-03-01-T-006,854,Amrin Amin,"The community is another critical component of pro-social support. The Malay-Muslim community has made significant efforts to mobilise support against drugs and for ex-offenders. Mr Chairman, with your permission, I will speak in Malay."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00855,2019-03-01-T-006,855,Amrin Amin,(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Drug abuse affects all communities. But this issue has been haunting our Malay community. Malay drug abusers form the biggest proportion of abusers. It is worrying that the proportion of new Malay drug abusers and those aged below 30 years old are increasing.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00856,2019-03-01-T-006,856,Amrin Amin,"Our community, however, is not easily defeated, and will not give up easily. The war against the drug menace will continue to be fought with the strong support of the Government, Malay/Muslim organisations, religious leaders, families and our Malay youths."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00857,2019-03-01-T-006,857,Amrin Amin,Ms Rahayu Mahzam mentioned the Dadah Itu Haram Campaign that was launched in April 2017.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00858,2019-03-01-T-006,858,Amrin Amin,The Dadah Itu Haram campaign harnesses the community's strength and demonstrates the community's firm stance against the scourge of drugs.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00859,2019-03-01-T-006,859,Amrin Amin,"Although only 2 years old, the Dadah Itu Haram campaign is not moving at a slow pace, but in fact has reached out to the community very quickly. The outcome has been beyond our expectations. Every fortnight, our volunteers distribute Dadah Itu Haram campaign collaterals at mosques across Singapore after Friday prayers."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00860,2019-03-01-T-006,860,Amrin Amin,Barbers share about the dangers of drugs at their barbershops while cutting hair.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00861,2019-03-01-T-006,861,Amrin Amin,"As PERSES sepaktakraw league play their sepaktakraw, they actively help to spread anti-drug messages."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00862,2019-03-01-T-006,862,Amrin Amin,"Food stalls, music jamming studios, as well as car dealers and workshops also participate by sticking Dadah Itu Haram campaign decals as a reminder and a call for vigilance."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00863,2019-03-01-T-006,863,Amrin Amin,"We will continue to alert our community about the threat of drugs and take action so that our families and our children are conscious of the dangers, and are protected."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00864,2019-03-01-T-006,864,Amrin Amin,"Over 50 events were conducted, with 300 organizations and businesses as campaign partners as well as 300 volunteers, and we also reached out to more than 100,000 Malay/Muslims in 2018."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00865,2019-03-01-T-006,865,Amrin Amin,I am proud that we now receive interest from members of our community. They want to contribute to the success of this campaign. They feel like it is a calling to do so.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00866,2019-03-01-T-006,866,Amrin Amin,Examples are our fishing brothers from The One Nation Angler Association (TONA); the cycling group Flow Riders; and the NUS Malay Society with their annual Paradigma event which reaches out to help youth abusers.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00867,2019-03-01-T-006,867,Amrin Amin,"The Dadah Itu Haram campaign is a Community Campaign, the Voice from People’s Heart."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00868,2019-03-01-T-006,868,Amrin Amin,"Apart from the Dadah Itu Haram campaign, organisations such as Jamiyah, Pertapis, Pergas and the Muslim Counselling Service provide support to ex-abusers while they are in and out of prison. I wish to elaborate on two programmes."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00869,2019-03-01-T-006,869,Amrin Amin,"First AMP, the DRP (Development and Reintegration Programme) programme that I launched in November 2018 is progressing well."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00870,2019-03-01-T-006,870,Amrin Amin,"To date, 185 offenders and families received support and help in the form of financial assistance, skills upgrading and education for children."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00871,2019-03-01-T-006,871,Amrin Amin,"I salute AMP for its determination and sincerity. AMP is the first organisation to provide all-round continuous support, from in-care counselling, family support, to support after their release."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00872,2019-03-01-T-006,872,Amrin Amin,"Second, MUIS. MUIS has produced sermons which are delivered during Friday prayers for inmates. This special sermon focuses on the needs of drug abusers."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00873,2019-03-01-T-006,873,Amrin Amin,"Additionally, religious teachers in MUIS are developing a religious education curriculum that will equip inmates in not only religious knowledge, but also values such as responsibility to self and family, self-confidence and the importance of staying away from drugs that destroy families and degrades morals."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00874,2019-03-01-T-006,874,Amrin Amin,MUIS and the other M3 partners will work together to deal with this challenge.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00875,2019-03-01-T-006,875,Amrin Amin,The work is far from over. The drug menace is not fully under control. It is still widespread in our community. Let’s come together. We will fight with our heart and soul.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00876,2019-03-01-T-006,876,Amrin Amin,"Employment is another key in breaking the offending cycle. Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about support for ex-offenders to find jobs. In 2018, 96% of ex-offenders who requested assistance from the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) secured a job before release. Ex-offenders who are unable to secure jobs on their own, can apply for jobs via SCORE's online job portal or contact SCORE's Employment Assistance Unit."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00877,2019-03-01-T-006,877,Amrin Amin,"Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Baey Yam Keng asked about steps taken to increase the employability of ex-offenders. We have launched several initiatives last year. First, Prisons School has launched a Diploma programme in Business Practice (International Supply Chain Management), with Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Inmates can benefit from the projected increase in manpower demand of the logistics sector upon their release."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00878,2019-03-01-T-006,878,Amrin Amin,"Second, since June 2018, SCORE has enhanced the WSQ training in culinary skills to include advanced modules."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00879,2019-03-01-T-006,879,Amrin Amin,"I visited Prisons last month and observed inmates learning to make chicken soup, not from ready-made sachets, but from scratch. Eighty-six inmates have successfully attained the Higher WSQ certification as of December 2018. With this certification, they can work at kitchens as kitchen helpers and progress the ranks to commissioned cooks."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00880,2019-03-01-T-006,880,Amrin Amin,"Third, SCORE has partnered Workforce Singapore (WSG) to emplace ex-offenders on short-term work stints under the Career Trial Programme."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00881,2019-03-01-T-006,881,Amrin Amin,"The trial allows a prospective employer to assess performance and job fit for up to 480 hours, before offering an ex-offender permanent employment. No manpower cost is incurred as the training allowance is paid by WSG. Since its November 2018 launch, 24 employers offering more than 150 vacancies have come on board."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00882,2019-03-01-T-006,882,Amrin Amin,"And besides offering such programmes which are geared mainly for inmates with longer sentence, we have also reviewed how we can help inmates with short sentences."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00883,2019-03-01-T-006,883,Amrin Amin,"Last year, the National Committee on Prevention, Rehabilitation and Recidivism (NCPR), a Committee co-led by MSF and MHA, was set up to oversee national efforts to prevent offending and re-offending and enhance rehabilitation."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00884,2019-03-01-T-006,884,Amrin Amin,The Committee assessed that there was scope to offer targeted support for higher-risk inmates with sentences of less than a year as a good number of them may still have a high risk of re-offending.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00885,2019-03-01-T-006,885,Amrin Amin,"And since June 2018, Prisons started to provide psychology-based correctional programmes to higher-risk inmates serving between six months and a year. This group of inmates will undergo an abridged pre-release programme and a Reintegration Needs Assessment before release. Prisons will also work with the National Council of Social Service on a pilot to place 60 higher-risk inmates with short sentences on voluntary case management after their release, to assist with reintegration."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00886,2019-03-01-T-006,886,Amrin Amin,Keeping Singapore safe and secure is our promise to Singaporeans. We will deliver.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00887,2019-03-01-T-006,887,,Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun Xueling.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00888,2019-03-01-T-006,888,Sun Xueling,"Mr Chairman, I will focus on three areas  road safety, fire safety, and counter-terrorism."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00889,2019-03-01-T-006,889,Sun Xueling,"I will first speak on road safety. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked how MHA will address the upward trend in irresponsible driving, such as drink-driving and red-light-running. Ms Jessica Tan spoke about distracted driving. Since 2014, Traffic Police has been doing its utmost to encourage responsible driving, nudge motorists to drive safely in camera zones. It has publicised the locations of its cameras, installed signage and blinker lights, and painted the cameras in bright colours. Yet, irresponsible driving remains a concern."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00890,2019-03-01-T-006,890,Sun Xueling,"To address this, MHA will be amending the Road Traffic Act to enhance criminal penalties for irresponsible driving, especially in egregious cases. We want to ensure that irresponsible drivers receive sentences commensurate with the harm that they cause, and are kept off the roads for longer periods of time. To complement this, MHA will also raise composition sums for road traffic offences, including the offence of using a mobile phone while driving."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00891,2019-03-01-T-006,891,Sun Xueling,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin also asked if MHA will review course requirements for new or inexperienced drivers. This year, Traffic Police will be introducing mandatory simulator training for all learner drivers, on top of existing course requirements."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00892,2019-03-01-T-006,892,Sun Xueling,"Mr Murali Pillai asked if MHA would consider putting in place a tiered drink-driving approach that takes into account the effect of alcohol on probationary or young drivers, as compared to other drivers. Our laws currently do not differentiate alcohol limits to different classes of drivers, because we cannot make an a priori claim on the effect of alcohol on persons based on factors like age and experience."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00893,2019-03-01-T-006,893,Sun Xueling,"Furthermore, Traffic Police does not enforce drink-driving offences based solely on whether one has violated the alcohol limit. A person would also be deemed to have been drink-driving as long as he has consumed alcohol and had been unable to control his vehicle, even if he did not exceed the prescribed statutory alcohol limit. These criteria apply to all drivers, regardless of age or driving experience."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00894,2019-03-01-T-006,894,Sun Xueling,"In the end, we must recognise that the problem of dangerous driving cannot be curbed by regulations alone. Since the launch of the ""Use Your Roadsense"" campaign in 2015, Traffic Police and its partners have been actively promoting graciousness and responsibility amongst various groups of road users. Road safety is a shared responsibility, and we all need to play our part."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00895,2019-03-01-T-006,895,Sun Xueling,"Mr Chairman, I will now speak on fire safety. Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Low Thia Khiang asked how we can improve fire safety. Singapore has one of the lowest rates of fire fatalities in the world. This is owed largely to our high fire safety standards. Many of our fire safety provisions are incorporated at the design stage. For example, every residential unit is designed as a fire compartment to prevent the spread of fires to adjacent units. Fire escape routes are designed to have adequate ventilation, while infrastructures, like rising mains and hose-reels, are built in to aid fire-fighting operations."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00896,2019-03-01-T-006,896,Sun Xueling,"Ms Tan and Mr Low said it was important that residents know what to do in the event of a fire. Public education is indeed a key priority for us. SCDF regularly conducts events, like Emergency Preparedness block parties, to teach residents emergency response skills, including how to extinguish small household fires and how to evacuate from a smoke-logged room. SCDF also works closely with senior activity centres to conduct regular fire safety awareness workshops for the elderly."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00897,2019-03-01-T-006,897,Sun Xueling,Mr Low asked about whether residents in super high-rise public residential buildings can safely evacuate during a fire. Our evacuation strategy for ensuring the safety of residents in such buildings is multi-layered.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00898,2019-03-01-T-006,898,Sun Xueling,"First, we require such buildings to incorporate various fire safety measures in their design, such as refuge floors and fire lifts."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00899,2019-03-01-T-006,899,Sun Xueling,"Next, we are building up a strong corps of community volunteers to help with evacuations. SCDF works closely with the Community Emergency and Engagement, or C2E, Committees and the Community Emergency Response Team, or CERT, to direct evacuation procedures in the event of a fire incident. These teams comprise grassroots leaders and residents staying in the vicinity, who are trained to assist in evacuation and crowd control in an emergency. SCDF familiarises them with the fire safety facilities unique to super high-rise residential buildings, to ensure that they are equipped to perform their roles effectively."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00900,2019-03-01-T-006,900,Sun Xueling,"These volunteers are key partners to manage fire incidents in their initial stages, until Home Team officers arrive on scene. On-site, Home Team officers will go door-to-door and facilitate the evacuation of residents who have yet to leave their units, and if necessary, will use the fire lifts to evacuate those with mobility issues."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00901,2019-03-01-T-006,901,Sun Xueling,"SCDF also devotes specific resources to educate residents living in such buildings. For example, SCDF conducts door-to-door engagements and evacuation exercises for the residents of these buildings to ensure that they are familiar with evacuation procedures. SCDF has also produced a poster and disseminated a poster to specifically educate residents in such buildings on what they should and should not do in the event of a fire."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00902,2019-03-01-T-006,902,Sun Xueling,"Mr Chairman, in Mandarin, please."

2019-03-01-T-006-S-00908,2019-03-01-T-006,908,Sun Xueling,"(In English)  Mr Chairman, in English. Ms Jessica Tan also asked how we can improve fire safety standards for older buildings. Currently, SCDF reviews the Fire Code constantly to stipulate new fire safety provisions. For example, a new requirement last year was for home fire alarm devices to be installed in all new residential premises."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00909,2019-03-01-T-006,909,Sun Xueling,"However, changes to the Fire Code only apply to new buildings and buildings that undergo addition and alteration works. To ensure that older buildings are also upgraded with time, MHA will be amending the Fire Safety Act. Owners of selected older buildings will be required to put in place critical fire safety upgrades. We will prioritise high-risk industrial buildings, public buildings, and hospitals, and work closely with their owners to ensure that the new requirements are practicable."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00910,2019-03-01-T-006,910,Sun Xueling,"The amendments will also address enforcement gaps. Currently, it is an offence for certain parties such as building owners, occupiers, and industry professionals to install non-compliant fire safety products. However, it is not an offence if parties are involved in the supply of non-compliant fire safety products, but stop short of installing them on buildings. With the amendments, SCDF will be able to take action against any errant party who use, or cause the use of, non-compliant fire safety products. SCDF will also be able to order errant parties to take remedial actions, such as recalling or stopping the sale of non-compliant products, and removing them from buildings if they have been installed."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00911,2019-03-01-T-006,911,Sun Xueling,"Mr Chairman, I will now speak on our counter-terrorism efforts. The terrorism threat to Singapore remains high and we remain an attractive target to ISIS and other groups. We may not have yet been hit but we certainly have been targeted and we must not take our security for granted."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00912,2019-03-01-T-006,912,Sun Xueling,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked about measures that MHA is taking to detect and deter self-radicalisation. The threat is very real. Since 2015, 24 radicalised Singaporeans have been detected and dealt with under the Internal Security Act. This is a stark increase from the 11 such cases that were detected between 2007 and 2014."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00913,2019-03-01-T-006,913,Sun Xueling,"While the overall responsibility for counter-terrorism lies with the Home Team, the community also plays an indispensable role, especially in detecting suspected cases of self-radicalisation. Families, friends and colleagues are best placed to notice such signs in an individual. For example, Mr Mohamad Faishal bin Mohamad Razali who was detained under the ISA in April 2018, had told two of his friends about his plan to participate in armed violence overseas. His friends and family members had tried to dissuade him but to no avail. Eventually, someone who knew of his plans, alerted the authorities so that he could be prevented from continuing down the path of radicalisation."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00914,2019-03-01-T-006,914,Sun Xueling,So I encourage the public to report suspected cases as soon as possible. Early reporting not only prevents the commission of violence and loss of lives; it also gives the individual the best possible chance of being rehabilitated.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00915,2019-03-01-T-006,915,Sun Xueling,"Our religious communities also played a critical role. For example, the Religious Rehabilitation Group is a voluntary group of Islamic scholars and teachers, who not only conduct counselling and rehabilitation for radicalised individuals, but also invest significant educational efforts to ward off extremist thinking in the general Islamic community. We cannot allow extremist ideologies to take root in our society, and we must safeguard our way of life."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00916,2019-03-01-T-006,916,Sun Xueling,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked for an update on SGSecure. The SGSecure movement began by sensitising the public to the terror threat, and imparting basic information and skills to cope with an attack. As awareness grew, we focused more on raising preparedness. We have worked with workplaces, schools, neighbourhoods, and places of worship to help them be crisis-ready. Today, three in four Singaporeans are aware of SGSecure, one in two Singaporeans believe that we are well-prepared to handle a terror attack on our shores, and almost all Singaporeans believe that we will stand united in the face of an attack."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00917,2019-03-01-T-006,917,Sun Xueling,"In the coming months, a new series of SGSecure initiatives will be rolled out. They include  holding SGSecure events at condominiums; more public roadshows; forming an SGSecure Responders Network to mobilise first responders from the community; and bringing together stakeholders from different domains to be part of the Community Response Round Table. With these new initiatives, we hope to make participation in SGSecure programmes more accessible, and to strengthen our whole of society response to the terror threat."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00918,2019-03-01-T-006,918,Sun Xueling,"LastIy, I would like to address Mr Faisal Manap's question about Police's standard procedure in replying to appeals. The Police will consider all proper representations which include representations from elected Members of Parliament and from Grassroots Advisors on behalf of their own constituents, and their grassroots leaders. All appeals will be assessed on their own merit. Representations by non-elected Members of Parliament, such as Non-Constituency Members of Parliament and Nominated Members of Parliament, will be treated as personal appeals by the appellants."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00919,2019-03-01-T-006,919,Sun Xueling,"Mr Chairman, let me conclude. In the face of public safety risks and the heightened terror threat, it is more important than ever for Singaporeans to partner the Home Team. We succeed only when the community stands with us, shares our vision and partakes of the same effort. Together, we will build a safe and secure Singapore."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00920,2019-03-01-T-006,920,,Are there any clarifications from Members? Mr Faisal Manap.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00921,2019-03-01-T-006,921,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, I would like to thank Senior Parliamentary Secretary for her reply. The Senior Parliamentary Secretary only mentioned about Nominated Members of Parliament, as well as Non-Constituency Members of Parliament appeal is being treated as kind of a personal appeal. What I mentioned, what about for the PAP Branch Chairman? What are MHA's views of such appeals?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00922,2019-03-01-T-006,922,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his question. As I mentioned earlier in my reply, the Police will consider all proper representations which include representations from elected Members of Parliament and from Grassroots Advisors on behalf of their own constituents, and their grassroots leaders."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00923,2019-03-01-T-006,923,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, I did hear clearly Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned Grassroots Advisors and elected Members of Parliament, but my question is  how does MHA respond to a PAP Branch Chairman who appeals on behalf of an individual?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00924,2019-03-01-T-006,924,K Shanmugam,"Does Mr Faisal have the letter? And if you do, can you please first check the facts and see if the person was also a GRA, because Police are very clear, they will respond to Members of Parliament and they will respond to Grassroots Advisors. It does not matter if they have any other positions, but I think you should check and let us know whether that person is also also a Grassroots Advisor, and I am sure he would have been."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00925,2019-03-01-T-006,925,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, I can confirm that the person whom I have mentioned is a Grassroots Advisor, but the letter that I have with me, the signatory is of a PAP Branch Chairman. It was not mentioned that the appointment was a Grassroots Advisor."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00926,2019-03-01-T-006,926,K Shanmugam,"The Police will respond, like other Government agencies, to Members of Parliament and Grassroots Advisors regardless of any other appointments they may hold."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00927,2019-03-01-T-006,927,,Mr Png Eng Huat.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00928,2019-03-01-T-006,928,Png Eng Huat,"Can I ask the Ministry with regards to my cut  what is the roadmap for Singaporeans with step children; in terms of their children getting their PR or citizenship if they cannot be legally adopted, as I have explained in my cut?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00929,2019-03-01-T-006,929,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, perhaps let me explain why legal adoption is needed in the first place. It is primarily to safeguard the interest of the child and the public. Without legal adoption, there is no biological or legal nexus between a Singaporean step parent and his foreign step child. That is why we require the adoption, to formally establish the parent-child relationship between them in the eyes of the law."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00930,2019-03-01-T-006,930,Josephine Teo,"The effect that this has, is to put the legal status of the child beyond question. For the child, it clearly establishes that his adoptive parents have legal responsibilities and obligations to care for him. This is also in our public interest as there is no ambiguity."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00931,2019-03-01-T-006,931,Josephine Teo,"Because adoption is a serious matter, obviously, the process has to be rigorous and effort must be made to ensure that the child's welfare is safeguarded. For the adoption of foreign stepchildren which Mr Png asked about, MSF already allows for a shorter process and the Family Justice Courts will also appoint a guardian in adoption to conduct social investigation, to assess the prospective adopters' parenting capacity and the family's circumstances. So, there is already a roadmap available. Through the investigations, some prospective adopters may be assessed to be unsuitable and these adoptions cannot proceed."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00932,2019-03-01-T-006,932,Josephine Teo,"Others may not be able to adopt their stepchild if the natural parent does not agree to the adoption. And in these circumstances, the law already allows the Family Justice Courts to dispense with the requirement if it is the Court's judgment that adequate effort has been made and there is no reason to believe that the natural parent is contesting for the custody of the child. If the Court is satisfied after it has assessed, it can decide to dispense with the requirement."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00933,2019-03-01-T-006,933,Josephine Teo,"If I may summarise, the process is there for good reasons and instead of doing away with the process, I think let us instead help the deserving families to meet the requirements and to allow the Court to exercise its judgment."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00934,2019-03-01-T-006,934,,Mr Yee Chia Hsing.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00935,2019-03-01-T-006,935,Yee Chia Hsing,"Can I ask the Minister; currently, is it an offence for someone to know of a friend or a family member who is thinking of committing a terrorist act or after has been self-radicalised, and not to report? If it is not an offence, what are the policy considerations for not making it an offence?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00936,2019-03-01-T-006,936,K Shanmugam,"It will be difficult and unwise to give a broad answer to a question like this. It depends much on what is it that the person is planning to do and the degree of association, the help or other kinds of assistance the person who knows has given. Is it just pure knowledge, is it something more? I think it depends on a variety of factors, but such a person who knows of a potential terrorist action would be well advised to report to the agencies and quite a number of the arrests that Internal Security Department has made over the years has in fact been based on reports from family members, friends, others who have noticed that something is not quite right."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00937,2019-03-01-T-006,937,,"Mr Faisal, if it is a new question, I would allow it. But if it is a question which has already been answered, I will disallow it. Please proceed."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00938,2019-03-01-T-006,938,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, one final clarification. Just now, it was mentioned that apart from the elected Members of Parliament as well as Grassroots Advisors making appeal, any other appeals will be taken as a personal appeal."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00939,2019-03-01-T-006,939,,That is correct.
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00940,2019-03-01-T-006,940,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"So, am I right to say that appeals of Non-Constituency Members of Parliament, Nominated Members of Parliament and a political party Branch Chairman will also be considered as normal appeal, and there is no merit to it? There is no further consideration or special consideration being made or being looked into when these appeals come from these groups of people, as I mentioned just now?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00941,2019-03-01-T-006,941,,"Mr Faisal, that question has already been answered, but I will allow Mr Shanmugam to repeat the answer again."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00942,2019-03-01-T-006,942,K Shanmugam,"There are two parts to this. One is  as a Government, we try and say ""no wrong door"". So, if a person is entitled to make an appeal on behalf of somebody, for example, a Grassroots Advisor, then if it comes from some other letterhead or he does not mention that designation, nevertheless the agencies will check. If he is a Grassroots Advisor, then it is a little bit pointless to write back to him and say – and meanwhile time is taken up – ""Send it to us for a different note, mention your designation and then we will deal with it"". I think that is a very bureaucratic way of dealing with it. We want to try to help the residents. I am sure, so do you."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00943,2019-03-01-T-006,943,K Shanmugam,"So, in order to help the resident, when the person who is writing the appeal comes within the rules, as in, he holds an appointment either as a Member of Parliament or as a Grassroots Advisor, the agencies will respond, will deal with it and will respond. Because the interest of the Government is also to deal with the appeal in the interest of the residents. At the same time, there have to be some rules of who the agencies will respond to and will not respond to."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00944,2019-03-01-T-006,944,K Shanmugam,"They cannot respond to everybody who purports to write on behalf of somebody else. How do we know if indeed that it is so? If it is a Grassroots Advisor or a Member of the Parliament, then we can hold the person responsible for whatever is said. And as Mr Faisal knows, some of these representations can have legal consequences as well. Any other representation from anyone else will be treated as an individual representation."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00945,2019-03-01-T-006,945,K Shanmugam,"Now, in terms of the status, the weight that is to be given to appeals, proper appeals, appeals by Members of the Parliament and Grassroots Advisors, the fact will be considered and they will be assessed in accordance with our rules.And as Mr Faisal will know, sometimes, there is a grey area. Often that is what the person who is writing the appeal letter is trying to do. Trying to persuade the agencies, that this is the case that comes in a grey area where some discretion ought to be exercised. And the agencies which deal with it, the Police, will have to look at it, see whether it is an appropriate case for discretion to be exercised, and deal with it, and it is all put in writing, so that everything can be looked at, and see whether it conforms to our rules. When the Police responds, whether it is yes or no. And where necessary, the reasons are set out, so that anyone can look at this and ask further questions."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00946,2019-03-01-T-006,946,,"Yes, Mr Irshad."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00947,2019-03-01-T-006,947,Mohamed Irshad,"The Minister mentioned about the Singaporean identity and to have our own Singapore identity. I would like to quote Minister Indranee, who mentioned last year that, ""What it means to be Singaporeans of particular pertinence as a country heads into its next phase of development."" And such, would it be of merit to have sort of a national conversation on what it means to be Singaporean, similar to the style of Our Singapore Conversation."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00948,2019-03-01-T-006,948,Mohamed Irshad,"And second thing I would like to ask is, especially our Muslim youths, who are easily influenced by external influences, extremist thinking, very black and white sort of a preachings from outside Singapore, would it be of interest to reform the Singapore Muslim identity campaign that was launched sometime ago by Dr Yaacob. Would it be of interest to bring it back again, to sort of protect our youth and to educate them, to innoculate them from these influences from outside?"
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00949,2019-03-01-T-006,949,K Shanmugam,"I think the primary essence of your question on how we deal with the on-going programme on Singapore Muslim Identity. It really needs to be answered by the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs. If I can take one step back, the point you made about young Muslims finding it very appealing to look at black and white preachings, I do not think that it is restricted to young Muslim youth. I think it cuts across many different religions, races. Beyond religion, as you can see from different parts of the world, black and white sound bytes are appealing, even in very matured democracies. It is much easier to listen to simple sound bytes rather than a more reasoned point of thinking. It does takes time to put it across."
2019-03-01-T-006-S-00950,2019-03-01-T-006,950,K Shanmugam,"But we know what the challenges are in terms of the trends that have come across, I have said that in my speech. It is not restricted to Muslims, I think it cuts across all religions, we need to try and bring them together and ensure that the secular space that we have created for politics is there. And at the same time, one pursues freedom to practice one's religion – and we guarantee that – at the same time to create and make sure that the common space we have created is maintained, all will have to contribute to that. The different religious organisations, faiths, people, secular organisations, the Government."

Furthermore, an effective and efficient legal system, a good body of legal precedents, effective international dispute resolution bodies such as SIAC, Maxwell Chambers, SICC, the Courts, a qualified legal Bar, in-house counsel and AGC make for an excellent and formidable formula for the further growth of Singapore as a legal hub. What measures will MinLaw undertake to further bolster Singapore’s reputation as a regional and global legal hub?"
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00960,2019-03-01-T-007,960,Christopher de Souza,"Another important aspect is promoting the use of Singapore law. How will MinLaw help to promote Singapore Law as the law of choice governing domestic, international and cross-border agreements at the time the parties sign those agreements? This will ensure Singapore Law’s body of case precedents is relevant and applicable to the rapid changes in how business is conducted. The more Singapore law is used, the more relevant it becomes and the more parties will want to choose it. The net effect is the development of Singapore’s jurisprudence not only locally but regionally, and quite possibly globally."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00961,2019-03-01-T-007,961,Christopher de Souza,"Thus, how will the Ministry support the increased use of Singapore Law as the governing law in contracts and Singapore as the jurisdiction in which rights arising from the contract are adjudicate upon should disputes arise."

2019-03-01-T-007-S-00966,2019-03-01-T-007,966,Rahayu Mahzam,"Having legal troubles is often an unexpected event, which many typically do not financially prepare for and litigation often is physically, emotionally and financially draining. So, when there is a need to commence action or defend a case in Court, it is common to hear of situations where the individual is financially stretched and has difficulties financing legal costs. The inability to finance one’s litigation could possibly result in the inability to pursue justice in a case."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00967,2019-03-01-T-007,967,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Legal Aid Bureau, the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme and the legal clinics help to provide assistance to those who may not be able to afford to pay for legal advice or representation. I also welcome the amendment to the Legal Aid and Advice Act last year which sought to enhance the process and provision of legal aid to ensure access to justice. It is always a calibration but I would like to ask if there are other efforts which could be put in place to ensure that persons of limited means continue to have access to legal aid."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00968,2019-03-01-T-007,968,Rahayu Mahzam,"On this note, I would like to repeat the proposal I made before in this House to encourage and incentivise low bono efforts by lawyers. We have many lawyers already doing pro bono work but this often comes at a cost to the lawyer’s earnings. A law practice is also a business and would have overheads and operational costs just like any other professional service. Bearing this in mind and considering the need to close some gaps, we may therefore want to cast our sights on a more sustainable solution which could be a win-win solution for all."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00969,2019-03-01-T-007,969,Rahayu Mahzam,I would therefore like to ask if MinLaw would consider developing a framework to support low bono efforts by lawyers to augment existing legal aid schemes?

Increasingly, in some standard form mass market consumer contracts that ordinary Singaporeans enter into without much room for negotiation, such as some insurance policies, there are contractual requirements that the parties go to arbitration in the event of a dispute. They must go to arbitration. No legal proceedings. Even for needy Singaporeans with good claims under their insurance contracts who have met the Legal Aid Bureau’s Means test and Merits test for aid."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00972,2019-03-01-T-007,972,Chen Show Mao,"To belabour the point, these are needy Singaporeans who are poor enough, who have good enough claims, and who could otherwise have pressed their claims in court with the help of legal aid if the contract had not contained this arbitration clause."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00973,2019-03-01-T-007,973,Chen Show Mao,"So, there are many good reasons why an insurance company that drafts the policy would want such an arbitration clause. But one effect of such a clause is that it may keep a needy Singaporean from pressing a meritorious claim in the event of a dispute, since Legal Aid currently does not cover the costs of arbitration proceedings. Sir, even one such case that falls through this particular crack feels unnecessary."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00974,2019-03-01-T-007,974,Chen Show Mao,"I would like to ask that the Minister look into extending aid to eligible recipients, namely Singaporeans who have met the means test and the merits test for legal aid to help them cover the cost of arbitration proceedings to which they have been mandatorily directed by arbitration clauses in standardised contracts used in large volume."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00975,2019-03-01-T-007,975,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Since coming in forth in November 2014, can Ministry of Law provide an update on the number of cases filed, mediated and heard on an annual basis from 2014 to 2018 under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA)? Among all Prevention of Harassment Act cases filed, what is the breakdown of the type of cases, example, how many involve community, neighbours; how many are online harassment, how many are sexual harassment cases and how many are workplace harassment cases. If the State Courts have not started monitoring the type of cases, can I suggest it starts to do so, as this will give us a better appreciation of the different types of harassment happening on the ground. By the same token, I suggest that the decisions and judgment of the State Courts and selected POHA cases, particularly those cases of interests, be published so that complainants and perpetrators know and will keep within the boundaries of the law."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00976,2019-03-01-T-007,976,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Chairman, I like to declare my interest that I am a practicing accountant. Not too long ago, my firm had the unfortunate experience to be involved in a commercial dispute that resulted in my firm taking a legal suit against a defendant party. I say this, with the greatest of respect to the many litigation lawyers in this House – that being a litigant is not a pleasant experience."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00977,2019-03-01-T-007,977,Sitoh Yih Pin,"In the business world, civil litigation has traditionally been the primary tool for commercial dispute resolution. However, those, amongst us, who has ever been involved in litigation will tell you that it is a costly and resource intensive exercise for the litigants concerned. The litigants often have little or no control over the process and at the end of the day, it often produces outcomes that leaves one or sometimes both litigants dissatisfied."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00978,2019-03-01-T-007,978,Sitoh Yih Pin,"The commercial dispute that my firm was involved in was referred to the Singapore Mediation Centre for Mediation as a form of alternative dispute resolution. This, I understand, is something that is strongly encouraged by the Courts in recent years. I was hesitant at the outset, unsure if a mediated settlement was possible, especially in disputes where parties were deeply entrenched in their respective commercial positions. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. The Mediation was expertly handled with clear directions and targets set by the experienced and professional Mediators. I found the Mediation format to be less contentious, driven by parties instead of lawyers and crafted to empower parties to directly address their key concerns in the dispute, hear from each other and seek a solution where both parties are prepared to accept."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00979,2019-03-01-T-007,979,Sitoh Yih Pin,"From a commercial perspective, Sir, I could see Mediation as a cost effective and efficient mechanism for businesses to resolve commercial disputes without being embroiled in litigation. In the premises, I invite Minister to share with this House the Ministry’s plans, if any, to promote the greater use of Mediation as a platform to resolve commercial disputes."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00980,2019-03-01-T-007,980,,"Mr Murali, you have four minutes for your three cuts."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00981,2019-03-01-T-007,981,Murali Pillai,"Sir, I would like to declare my interest as a lawyer in private practice. On the first cut, in last year's Committee of Supply deliberations, I suggested that the estate administration process for a person dying intestate, meaning without a will, be looked into with a view to simplifying the procedure. As Members would know, currently, if the value of the estate of a person who died intestate is less than $50,000, the Public Trustee is able to administer the estate without the need for the family to make a court application. However, this option is not open for estates worth more."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00982,2019-03-01-T-007,982,Murali Pillai,"Since the Government has access to identity data of beneficiaries of a person who has passed away intestate such as his or her spouse, children and parents, there is scope to devise a more cost-effective and efficient system to administer the estate, hopefully without the need to involve the court system."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00983,2019-03-01-T-007,983,Murali Pillai,"The hon Senior Minister of State, as she then was, informed that the Ministry would undertake a review of the estate administration system after the completion of the work on the civil justice system reform. I would be grateful for an update on this matter."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00984,2019-03-01-T-007,984,Murali Pillai,"On the next cut, as Members of this House may remember, in January 2017, amendments were made to the Civil Law Act to enable third party funding for international arbitration and connected matters. Given that third party funding can potentially facilitate access to justice by enabling parties who may not have sufficient financial means to prosecute their claims, I had suggested that the framework be extended to litigation cases."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00985,2019-03-01-T-007,985,Murali Pillai,"There is also a case to allow for third party funding for commercial litigation cases in the Singapore International Commercial Court, particularly the offshore cases. The hon Senior Minister of State, as she then was, informed this House that the Ministry would like to test the third party funding framework within the international arbitration sphere before deciding to expand the categories. She also stated that the relevant stakeholders will be consulted too. I would like to respectfully seek an update on this matter."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00986,2019-03-01-T-007,986,Murali Pillai,"In 2015, the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC) was established with a view to broaden the suite of dispute resolution options here, apart from international arbitration and mediation, and further enhance Singapore’s standing as a leading international dispute resolution centre."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00987,2019-03-01-T-007,987,Murali Pillai,"As stated by the hon Senior Minister of State, as she then was, in this House, the underlying objective is for the SICC to be a neutral venue for international commercial litigation for parties with little or no connection to Singapore but who need and value a neutral jurisdiction with a strong tradition of the rule of law, experienced and respected commercial judges and legal services of high quality."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00988,2019-03-01-T-007,988,Murali Pillai,"The SICC currently has, in addition to our own experienced Supreme Court judges, 16 International Judges, who are also highly regarded jurists in their own jurisdictions. The diversity of the SICC judges’ backgrounds add to the strength of the SICC. Despite being recently set up, the SICC has already drawn compliments from commentators for the quality of its judgments."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00989,2019-03-01-T-007,989,Murali Pillai,"Also, the jurisdiction of the SICC has been widened to enable it to hear cases involving international arbitration law; an area which all the SICC judges would be very familiar with. In addition, Singapore acceded to the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements which allows SICC judgments to be enforced in jurisdictions of the contracting parties, thereby broadening the reach of SICC judgments."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00990,2019-03-01-T-007,990,Murali Pillai,I would like to seek an update from the hon Minister on the development of SICC as well as his Ministry’s efforts to entrench Singapore as a choice location for dealing with international disputes as well as how Singapore’s legal industry would benefit from such efforts. I also seek an update from the Ministry on its review of my suggestion that Singapore accedes to the Apostille Convention to facilitate easier recognition of foreign legal documents in Singapore.
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00991,2019-03-01-T-007,991,Rahayu Mahzam,"Like other industries, the legal sector also has to transform in this changing economy. There is new technology available that could increase productivity and developing areas of law which firms could venture into to grow their business. I would like to ask about the efforts being done to help small and medium law practices, to leverage on technology to remain relevant, build internal capabilities and access regional opportunities."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00992,2019-03-01-T-007,992,Rahayu Mahzam,"At the Singapore Academy of Law Annual Lecture last year, the Chief Justice commented that the profession’s response to legal technology has been lukewarm. He highlighted a 2017 study by the Law Society which found that only 9% of small and medium-sized law practices used technology enabled productivity tools. There is indeed hesitation on the part of the small and medium firms, because unlike bigger firms, they cannot afford to dedicate resources and time to this effort in the midst of continuous and ongoing legal work. I appreciate the efforts with TechStart and FLIP. However, perhaps, the support could be enhanced with the provision of customised consultancy services to study work processes in that specific law firm so as to make a business case for adopting legal technology and appropriate proposals on the transition process which would address the firm’s unique needs."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00993,2019-03-01-T-007,993,Rahayu Mahzam,"I also appreciate the Lawyers Go Global programme that could help law firms internationalise. In this regard, are there specific efforts to ensure lawyers and law firms can venture into new areas of law? Many small and medium firms may only be doing family law and general litigation in the domestic market. If they wish to access regional opportunities, they may need to develop new practice areas. Would the Ministry consider providing support for those who wish to do so, perhaps through the proper curation of Continuing Professional Development courses?"
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00994,2019-03-01-T-007,994,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The illegal industry is not spared from the onslaught of disruptive forces. Technology, stiff global competition and growing commercialisation of the law will radically transform the depth and breadth of practice and traditional models of legal work. The report of the working group on legal and accounting services and the professional services industry transformation map advocate for the transformation of industry through development of high growth areas, innovation, reskilling and upskilling the workforce boosting productivity and internationalisation of practices. However, much of the conversation has centered on firms and lawyers. I would like to ask the Minister of Law, what plans are in the pipeline to develop legal para-professionals who are also significant contributors in the ecosystem."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00995,2019-03-01-T-007,995,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"At the recent round table discussion with legal para-professionals jointly organised by NTUC and the Singapore Academy of Law, para-professionals shared that they faced pay limitations and career bottlenecks and encountered employers who were not able to fully appreciate the potential of para-professionals. Concerns were also raised on the viability of the para-professionals with the introduction of technology, such as Artificial Intelligence. While this round table discussion was only the first of the series of engagements to better understand the needs of para-professionals and the support they need in the work place. The consensus was that, more must be done to better recognise the potential of our para-professionals."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00996,2019-03-01-T-007,996,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I have three suggestions on how the potential of our para-professionals can be maximise in tandem with our industry transformation push. First, expand the value proposition. To accelerate industry transformation efforts, we need to expand the value proposition of para-professionals. Some possible complementary roles that para-professionals can undertake are – Innovation Managers or Transformation project roles to drive legal innovation or transformation in workplace. Learning and Development roles to grow legal and legal-tech skillsets. Technology roles to enable adoption of legal technology to boost productivity such as e-discovery, case management and legal research and analytics tools. Business Development roles to understand foreign legal jurisdictions to enable internationalisation."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00997,2019-03-01-T-007,997,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Second, continuous learning, to enable para-professionals to take on these expanded new roles, it must be provided with access to continuous learning opportunities provided by industry recognised or endorsed training providers."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00998,2019-03-01-T-007,998,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"And third, structured wage and skills pathways for progression. Structured wage and skills pathways can provide guidance to employers on how to maximise the potential and value add of the para-professionals to their organisation and provide for para-professionals progression and upward labour mobility."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-00999,2019-03-01-T-007,999,,"Mr Christopher de Souza, you can take both your cuts."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-01000,2019-03-01-T-007,1000,Christopher de Souza,"Chairman, in order to tap on the regional opportunities in the legal market, firms need to be prepared to explore spheres outside Singapore. Allow me to declare my interest as a practising lawyer. International arbitration where parties are often cross-bordered is one key area of regional opportunity. Also, in October last year, a new Singapore infrastructure dispute management protocol was introduced to help mega infrastructure projects around the region manage disputes and minimise the risks of time and costs overruns. How is Ministry of Law, assisting firms in Singapore with ideas for technological advancement or Blue Ocean Strategies to tap on the Regional Market thereby creating more job opportunities for Singaporeans and being better able to serve Singapore based or Singapore owned companies."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-01001,2019-03-01-T-007,1001,Christopher de Souza,"Next, innovation and invention drive corporations to better their products. As a result, lives of consumers improved. To incentivise such innovation, corporations' Intellectual Property (IP) must be protected. How is Ministry of Law bolstering Singapore's already formidable IP Protection regime such as to incentivise more companies to invest in, protect, and commercialise their IP here. Thank you."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-01002,2019-03-01-T-007,1002,,"Mr Patrick Tay, you can take both cuts."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-01003,2019-03-01-T-007,1003,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Ever wary of minimising burn rate, technology startups may be tempted to differ investment in Intellectual Property protection. To those we have not tried to protect Intellectual Property, it feels complex and expensive. Too often, start-ups end up forfeiting Intellectual Property rights by neglecting to protect their hard work."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-01004,2019-03-01-T-007,1004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Some simple and cost-effective techniques can minimise the anxiety yet help protect core assets. Can IPOS consider extending and expanding the current funding and support mechanism for our local FinTech Start-Ups and provide a one-stop service to educate, advise and hand-hold our start-ups in this IP protection journey? This will range from advising on patent protection and taking cognisance of non-patent intellectual property rights."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-01005,2019-03-01-T-007,1005,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"﻿My second cut – Intellectual Property Protection for the Creative Sector. There are more than 30,000 in Singapore’s creative sector workforce. This figure encompasses many freelance and self-employed workers in the creative sector."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-01006,2019-03-01-T-007,1006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I have spoken to and engaged many of these professional freelancers in the past years through the Labour Movement. In fact, IPOS has worked closely with the Labour Movement as part of the Copyright Act review and has engaged the freelance professionals within the Labour Movement's network. The workers and the Labour Movement are thankful for the close partnerships. Speaking on behalf of the thousands of professional freelancers in the creative sector, from photographers to actors, actresses, scriptwriters, graphic designers or creative directors, can Ministry of Law explore to see how the copyright regime can be further strengthened to better protect the creative ideas and works of these many creative freelancers?"
2019-03-01-T-007-S-01007,2019-03-01-T-007,1007,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Mr Chairman, with digitalisation, ideas and innovation become increasing important for companies to differentiate themselves and compete effectively. Hence, the management of these intangible assets and intellectual property is key."
2019-03-01-T-007-S-01008,2019-03-01-T-007,1008,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,How are Singapore businesses identifying and using intellectual property (IP) to grow and expand their businesses and have they been successful? What measures are in place to assist Singapore businesses in commercialising their IP?
2019-03-01-T-007-S-01009,2019-03-01-T-007,1009,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"The Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) has identified IP as a key driver of Singapore's future economic growth. To enable this, we must have a skilled and competent base to support companies in the protection and commercialisation of their IP. With this focus on innovation, what are the job opportunities and careers for Singaporeans in IP? What measures are in place to develop and grow the talent base of Singaporeans in IP?"

2019-03-01-T-009-S-01017,2019-03-01-T-009,1017,,Adjourned accordingly at 6.48 pm.
2019-03-01-T-010-S-01018,2019-03-01-T-010,1018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what current percentage of cleaning companies apply the progressive wage model to their foreign cleaners; and (b) whether the Ministry will start collecting such data if it does not currently do so.
2019-03-01-T-010-S-01019,2019-03-01-T-010,1019,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) was introduced to address the effects of cheap-sourcing that had depressed wages for local cleaners hired by cleaning businesses. While the PWM is mandatory for these cleaners, it is not applicable to foreign cleaners, who are typically hired on different terms, with employers bearing other related expenses, such as additional levies and accommodation arrangements."
2019-03-01-T-010-S-01020,2019-03-01-T-010,1020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The PWM is intended to sustain productivity-driven wage growth for resident low-wage workers, hence the collection of related data focuses on local cleaners. Nonetheless, as at 31 January 2019, about 23% of licensed cleaning businesses employing foreign cleaners were paying wages at or above the levels stipulated under the PWM to their foreign cleaners."
2019-03-01-T-010-S-01021,2019-03-01-T-010,1021,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We encourage more employers to upgrade their workers' skills and implement productivity-based wage progression in accordance with the key tenets of the PWM, regardless their workers' citizenship."
2019-03-01-T-011-S-01022,2019-03-01-T-011,1022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Education in each of the past five years, how much funding has the Ministry provided on a per-school basis and a per-student basis respectively to (i) secondary schools offering the Special Assistance Plan and (ii) secondary schools not offering the Special Assistance Plan."
2019-03-01-T-011-S-01023,2019-03-01-T-011,1023,Ong Ye Kung,"The baseline average funding per secondary school student is about $15,000 a year. In addition, MOE resources our schools based on the needs of the students and the additional programmes that they offer."
2019-03-01-T-011-S-01024,2019-03-01-T-011,1024,Ong Ye Kung,"For example, Crest and Spectra Secondary, and schools with Normal (Technical) students receive 30% to 50% more resources per student than the baseline provision."
2019-03-01-T-011-S-01025,2019-03-01-T-011,1025,Ong Ye Kung,"Additional resources are also provided for various specialised programmes for students across schools, such as English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil language elective programmes. MOE provides over $3,000 per student per year for the Elective Programme in Malay Language for Secondary Schools (EMAS)."
2019-03-01-T-011-S-01026,2019-03-01-T-011,1026,Ong Ye Kung,"Within this framework, Special Assistance Plan (SAP) Schools at the secondary level also receive additional resources, at about $300 per student each year to develop students' proficiency and interest in Chinese language-related studies. The resourcing per student is lower due to the economy of scale derived from larger student participation numbers."
2019-03-01-T-011-S-01027,2019-03-01-T-011,1027,Ong Ye Kung,"There has been much attention paid to SAP Schools lately. We need to see SAP Schools from the broader perspective of an evolving, multi-cultural Singapore. SAP Schools were established after the Chinese medium schools were closed due to falling enrolment. They will continue to be relevant, as part of Singapore's approach for every community to preserve and practice their cultures, religion and languages, while ensuring there is enough common space to develop a unique Singapore identity. Countries around us are catching up or surpassing us in teaching their people multiple languages. We should preserve our programmes and institutions to develop bi-literate and bi-cultural talent at this crucial point in history."
