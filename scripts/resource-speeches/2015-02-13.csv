2015-02-13-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how are the public transport operators' recent fare increments derived; (b) whether the Ministry has plans to revise the fare increments computation formula; and (c) whether the fares has to be revised annually.,1,1,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00001
2015-02-13-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) with the sharp drop in oil prices, why are the public transport operators allowed to raise their fares; (b) how much will these operators benefit from the fall in oil prices; and (c) why are these operators not absorbing the 2.8% increase carried over from 2014 given that they are running profitably.",1,2,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00002
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Madam, with your permission, may I take Question Nos 1 and 2 together, please?",1,3,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00003
2015-02-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,4,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00004
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, fare adjustments are guided by the fare adjustment formula and process recommended by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee (FRMC) and was accepted by the Government in 2013. The formula is pegged to changes in the Core Consumer Price Index, Wage Index and Energy Index over the preceding year, less 0.5% for productivity gains. The Core Consumer Price Index and the Wage Index constitute 40% each of the fare formula. The Energy Index, constitute the remaining 20%.",1,5,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00005
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The formula broadly reflects the operating cost structure for the public transport operators. The Fare Review Mechanism Committee had also recommended that fare review exercises be conducted annually. This is so that commuters do not have to endure a sudden, large fare adjustment after a few years. This formula and process for fare adjustment is valid for five years, until 2017, and we will review it again thereafter.",2,6,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00006
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Er Dr Lee has asked how the recent 2.8% fare increment was derived and why fares were increased despite the sharp drop in oil prices. Er Dr Lee will recall that the full fare adjustment quantum considered by the Public Transport Council (PTC) in the 2013 fare review exercise was actually 6.6%. So, they considered 6.6% for the 2013 fare review exercise. But the PTC was mindful of the impact of a large fare increase on commuters, and so, the Council decided to grant only a 3.2% increase, or less than half of the 6.6% increase.",3,7,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00007
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The remaining 3.4% was carried over to the fare review exercise for 2014. If you add this 3.4% to the negative 0.6% for the 2014 fare adjustment quantum, we therefore get a total fare adjustment quantum of 2.8% for the 2014 fare review exercise. In short, the current fare increase was due to the carry-over from the last exercise and the fall in oil prices in 2013 helped to mitigate this.",4,8,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00008
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The continued fall in oil prices in 2014 and the start of this year will generate some cost savings for the transport operators. I should point out, however, that energy costs comprise about 20% of the operating costs for the sector, which is why the Energy Index is only 20% of the fare formula. Other costs, which include salaries for bus drivers and other public transport workers, account for the remaining 80%, and these have continued to experience upward pressure. We also expect operating costs to go up when higher operating standards come into effect from 2016. Notwithstanding this, overall, we are likely to see a negative fare adjustment of about 1% for the fare review exercise in 2015, because the energy costs have come down significantly in 2014. The 2015 fare adjustment that we will do at the end of this year, will take into account all the indices of 2014.",5,9,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00009
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"When deciding the fare adjustment, the Public Transport Council also has to ensure that the overall public transport system remains financially viable. Er Dr Lee has asked if the public transport operators could absorb the fare increase out of their profits. The fact is that operating buses and trains is not a highly profitable business; far from it.",6,10,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00010
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"In fact, of all the profits that are generated, roughly about 95% comes from the non-fare business, and at most 5% comes from operating trains and buses. Only in the recent quarters have fare revenue and income crept marginally above costs. Operators, however, need to make profits, for example, to pay for future capital expenditure. In a previous Sitting of this Parliament and in reply to a supplementary question from Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, I mentioned that SMRT has significant future capital commitments from now to 2019, somewhere in the region of $2 billion. We spoke about that. From now to 2019, SMRT has significant future capital commitments in the region of $2 billion. How do we put this $2 billion in context? Well, it is more than three times the cumulative profits that it has made in the last five financial years.",7,11,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00011
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The most important thing is to re-assure Members of this House and the commuting public that the Government is committed to ensuring that public transport fares always remain affordable. In this regard, it is worth noting that households have generally been spending a smaller proportion of their income on public transport over the last 10 years – a point I have made in previous Committee of Supply debates and I will again show this in the coming COS debate in March.",8,12,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00012
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"In addition, during fare exercises, special attention is paid to vulnerable groups, such as senior citizens, persons with disabilities and lower-wage workers. For this year, fares will remain unchanged for these groups of commuters in the April fare exercise, and generally the fares for more than 1.1 million commuters will be held constant.",9,13,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00013
2015-02-13-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and patience. The fact is that whenever there is a fare review, it attracts a lot of discussion amongst residents. The fact is that the companies, the operators are allowed to do business beyond bus and trains, and so, residents expect them to cross-subsidise. The fact is that both SBS Transit and SMRT recently reported huge jump in profits – if I remember correctly, SBS Transit reported 27.8% jump in 2014 profit and SMRT 58.4% increase in Q3 profit. Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister to seriously consider the fare review formula. Can this formula include profitability instead of just about operating cost? And can the review of the formula be brought forward, instead of waiting until 2017?",1,14,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00014
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, let me thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for her passion and for championing these various areas. Indeed, there is a certain amount of cross-subsidy that is taking place. Even for SBS Transit, if you have seen the recent results for the whole of FY2014, the buses continue to make a loss. The reason the company remains profitable – and I will come to the profit figures in a while – is because of the other income that they have managed to generate as a result of rentals, commercial operations and so on.",1,15,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00015
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For SBS Transit, the profit for the whole year increased from about $11 million-plus to $14 million-plus. In percentage terms, very high; but in terms of absolute numbers, measured against total revenue for the year of about $1 billion, you really see that the profit margin is about 1.5%. The profit margin for SMRT for the past FY – their FY ends only in March 2015 and it would not be appropriate for me to speculate what the final quarter's figures are – the profit margin for SMRT was 5%. As I had mentioned before, this was largely due to the revenue and profits that they generate from their non-fare business – commercial operations, rentals, taxis and so on. SMRT, you may recall, had been losing money on buses for quite a number of years, and only in the recent quarter have we seen a turnaround, helped partly by measures that they have taken as well as the fortuitous situation of a reduction in fuel costs.",2,16,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00016
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"At the end of the day, what is important, the overriding factor that is of importance must be  are our fares affordable, how do our fares compare to that of other countries and cities? Because if you say that you stifle every possibility of a private operator making some profit, improving efficiency, productivity of which there is a dividend that is paid to all commuters through that 0.5% in the fare formula, if you stifle all that, then, ultimately, if it results in an even larger increase in fares, is that of benefit to everybody? That, to me, must be the question that we always ask.",3,17,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00017
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"That is the question that the PTC looks at very carefully – how do you find a balance between making sure that fares are affordable to commuters, and yet ensuring the financial viability of the entire system. If the system ultimately is not financially sustainable, then over time, the Government and all taxpayers will have to step in to bail it out. The important thing is to make sure it remains financially viable; make sure that our fares are affordable on two counts. One is in comparison with other cities; and two, in comparison with household income and the percentage that households are paying on public transportation.",4,18,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00018
2015-02-13-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his explanation. I think the overriding factor must be whether there is a justification for an increase in the fare since the reported profit keeps going up. Anybody who invests in the company will know that those operators do not bear high risk because they are providing a basic need; everybody will have to take public transport if they do not own a car. My question is to come back to this fare review formula. Can the profitability of the PTOs be included in the fare review formula? Can the change in the formula be effected earlier?",1,19,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00019
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On the formula, I think it is always useful to allow a formula to run for a number of years. We have had this formula running since 2013. I think it is useful for it to continue until 2017 and we do a review then. On the point that profitability has increased and therefore, we should not increase fares – I take the Member's point. Thus, the converse must also be true – that when profitability has decreased, even though they are profitable, we must allow them to increase fares.",1,20,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00020
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"So, the Member's point was when profitability increases, take that into account, and therefore do not allow them to increase fares. Now, I see the Member's point, that as long as they are profitable, we cannot allow them to increase fares. And hence, we come back to the question of what incentive is there for them to be even more efficient and more productive, which ultimately benefits the commuters? If they run a shoddy operation, and the business becomes very expensive, ultimately, we all bear the costs. That always is a fundamental.",2,21,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00021
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Second point is this  we have mentioned that they have major financial commitments over the next few years, until 2019. I hope that point is not lost. They have commitments to buy trains and all the other projects that we had spoken about in the previous parliamentary sessions, amounting to about $2 billion.",3,22,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00022
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Therefore, if you take $2 billion, what does it all mean? It is more than three times the cumulative profits over the most recent five years. More than three times of that. They will have to figure out a way to meet these commitments. They will have to figure out a way to make sure that they remain profitable. But most important of all, they will have to figure out a way to make sure that they continue to improve on reliability and the service that they offer to commuters.",4,23,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00023
2015-02-13-T-001,Chia Yong Yong,Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member),"<span style=""color  rgb(51, 51, 51);"">  I would like to ask the Minister  in relation to the provision of public transport, is there not also a duty on the part of the providers to see that as part of their public service? In other words, we should not look at profitability and determine the price of public transport fares, just solely on the basis that the buses may or may not be making profits. The fact is that there is cross-subsidisation within the company, and overall, there is profit. So, should the company or rather the PTC then not take that into account in determining the fare as well? Thank you.</span>   I would like to ask the Minister  in relation to the provision of public transport, is there not also a duty on the part of the providers to see that as part of their public service?

2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker, and I thank Ms Chia for that supplementary question. Indeed, as I have mentioned earlier, there is a certain amount of cross-subsidy. They do not determine the fares; neither do they determine the standards because, really, at the end of the day, they are almost running like monopolies. The last thing you want for them to do is to be able to determine standards and to determine fares. So, the standards are actually determined by the Land Transport Authority. The fares are determined by the Public Transport Council.",1,25,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00025
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We have debated extensively in this House about the fare formula that was derived in 2013 after Mr Richard Magnus and his team took an extended amount of time to study this matter carefully, as well as to consult widely before coming out with the fare formula.",2,26,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00026
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"My fundamental point is this, which is really an elaboration of what I have mentioned to Er Dr Lee Bee Wah  are we better off if the services are provided by an entity that is run effectively, that is able to keep costs down, that is able to allow us to enjoy relatively low fares, certainly compared to cities around the world, is that of benefit to us?",3,27,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00027
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"And if that is of benefit to us, rather than the converse which we have seen in a number of cities where they run nationalised systems, not very efficiently done, the cost goes up, they have no handle on that as well as on other aspects of transportation. Ultimately, it is borne by much higher fares in those cities or through a large subsidy from government and taxpayers, if you look at those two possibilities, then I think certainly the former must be more enjoyable and acceptable for Singaporeans. That is, I think, the situation that we have today.",4,28,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00028
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"I understand the point and I understand the concern that people always have over profitability of these operators - what is the reasonable amount, what is acceptable, and so on. In the past, we also look at Return On Total Assets (ROTA), but for the recent fare formula, I think they have also tried to make sure that we just do not look only at the ROTA but try and have a formula that mirrors more closely the operating cost of the two operators. And, at the same time, make sure that the productivity improvements that they do make, part of it is given back to commuters as well.",5,29,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00029
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"So, hopefully, we are trying to arrive at a balance where fares are affordable, in relation to household income and expenditure; fares are affordable in relation to what other cities around the world may be paying for the same level of service or a lower level of service, in fact. And fares are affordable because there are various targeted subsidy schemes that the Government may put in place in order to protect the most vulnerable groups. I think that is the situation that we are trying to achieve.",6,30,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00030
2015-02-13-T-001,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, a supplementary question. From the Minister's reply, it seems to me that the fare needs to be increased, so that the operator remains profitable and with that, they can thereby be more efficient. That is the logic that I understand. But on the converse, will it be that if the company or the operator is profitable and productive enough, they would have made enough profit and there is no need to increase fare?",1,31,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00031
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, I am not really sure I follow the argument of Mr Low Thia Khiang so much. But let me try to interpret what I understand from it - that if they are profitable enough and productive enough, there is no need, or if they are efficient enough, productive enough and profitable enough, forget about the profitability. If they are efficient enough and productive enough, there is no need to increase fares.",1,32,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00032
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Theoretically, yes, except that they do face cost pressures as well. They employ more people, many of them Singaporeans. Their employees do expect wages to go up. You run Town Councils, some of you run companies and so on, and you know the cost pressures that we all come under, and they come under to.",2,33,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00033
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Much as they would like to reach that state of nirvana where efficiency, effectiveness, productivity can overcome all these pressures, the truth is that 80% of their cost largely mirrors the Core CPI as well as the wage increases. We know wages have been going up; we know that Core CPI has been going up; we have been fortunate that the 20% component, that is, the energy index has gone down, using the index for 2013. In the second half, prices have come down compared to 2012.",3,34,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00034
2015-02-13-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"So, I am not so sure that you can actually escape from the fundamental point that they do, like every other entity, public or private, come under the same cost pressures, the same expectations of their employees to see a reasonable increase in the wages. Driving buses, for example, is a very manpower-intensive kind of operation together with the maintenance of the buses. I think, inevitably, they cannot avoid coming under the same pressures which is reflected in the formula that Mr Magnus and his team have derived.",4,35,2015-02-13-T-001-S-00035

We have a Capability Development Fund that helps them to tap on that to apply technology, human capital development and also productivity improvements.

Police will continue to educate consumers to beware of such scams when they do online shopping.

2015-02-13-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. The crime rate involving e-commerce has increased by more than 200% in 2014 – 225% to be exact – and it is a cause for concern. And the problem, as he says, is compounded by the low solving rate of e-commerce crime. I had, last year, in September, suggested that the Police consider setting up a dedicated cyber crime unit so that they can really look at the different aspects of cyber crime, get the relevant skill-sets and also look at the transboundary kind of situation. But it did not appear to Senior Minister of State Magasos at that time to take this suggestion seriously. So, if the e-commerce crime rate has increased so rapidly, would MHA consider this suggestion again?",1,60,2015-02-13-T-004-S-00060
2015-02-13-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, we share the Member's concern over the rising rate of such cyber crimes. The Police have been taking a series of measures. As I mentioned, one aspect of them pertains to the collaboration with other Government agencies as well as the transaction providers or the service providers, and also conducting broader education campaigns in order to raise the awareness. Police are also constantly upgrading their cyber capabilities and they work closely with international partners and experts in order to track down persons who use the Internet to commit crimes. The nature of this crime is such that it is somewhat elusive at times, given the nature of the medium and the transboundary nature of the transactions. But having said that, there is increasing collaboration and the Police have got specific resources allocated for this purpose. And I would add that the Police are also working with Interpol's new Global Complex for Innovation, which is located in Singapore. One aspect of this Complex is a digital crime centre that supports digital forensic and develops new solutions to tackle cyber crime. So, I want to assure the Member and, indeed, all Members of the House that this is something that is taken seriously. The Police have allocated specific resources, maybe not a division, as suggested by the Member, but there have been allocated resources and specialties developed, and there is collaboration with international bodies as well as the Interpol centre in Singapore.",1,61,2015-02-13-T-004-S-00061

2015-02-13-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I thank the Minister for the positive reply. I think we are all aware that Singapore public transport is heavily subsidised by the Government. My thinking is that since it is heavily subsidised, and actually there are profits made by the transport companies, and there are also savings there, would the Ministry perhaps consider making all Singaporeans as shareholders of these public transport companies, so that they get to share in the savings, especially for this year, which is SG50? I think we had done that in the past via the issuing of Singtel Special Shares. Perhaps, the Government may consider that to celebrate SG50 and to thank all Singaporeans for their support this year, for the understanding that they show, and for the support of the transport operators, especially in the past two years, for the inconvenience that some of them have to go through.",1,66,2015-02-13-T-005-S-00066

The ratio of morning peak commuters to pre-peak commuters heading to the city has been sustained at around 2.1, compared to 2.7 prior to the trial. This translates to a 7%-8% shift since the trial started. A survey by LTA showed that the lack of flexible work arrangements may be a reason why the shift has not been more pronounced. To address this, we have been working with employers in the city through the Travel Smart programme since July last year. Forty-three companies have joined the programme so far.

2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Glaring lapses that are most disturbing to me and many others are the mismanagement of the sinking funds, the disregard for the governance of related party transactions and conflict of interest, shocking lack of internal control, mishandling of the S&CCs arrears and several instances of amounts collected and paid out that were not properly recorded, to name a few.",3,129,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00129

2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The financial affairs for the Town Council were in such a shambles that both AGO and, earlier, the AHPETC independent auditors were unable to draw any meaningful opinion on the Town Council's state of affairs and transactions. AGO said that due to the inadequacies in the accounting system and procedures, the financial statements prepared were inaccurate and not reliable. And, hence, they were unable to establish if public funds were properly spent, accounted for and managed.",5,131,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00131
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"AHPETC's independent auditor had not once but twice and, in fact, two years in a row, stated that they were not able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide basis for an audit opinion.

2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Qualified opinions from independent auditors are about the most disapproving opinion you can get from an auditor. And it usually suggests material discrepancies that compromise the accuracies and integrity of the financial statements. Any companies receiving a qualified opinion would almost drop everything to immediately address the issues raised and would expeditiously act to rectify the concerns raised as well. However, in the case of AHPETC, its response to the adverse audit report was surprisingly one of sloppiness and lack of urgency with a number of audit issues not rectified thereafter.",8,134,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00134
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The public is not accessible to the Town Council's state of finances and processes.

In the last three years, the public and Parliament were denied the right as there were no credible and unqualified financial reports that can be based on and to scrutinise.",9,135,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00135
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, yesterday, Ms Sylvia Lim told the House that many committees had been formed by the Town Council, and how she chaired her chairman's committee meetings, the various measures she has put in place, the Members of Parliament's estate visits. They were all mentioned in the annex that she presented. Well, form without substance is meaningless. What really matters to the public are results and desired outcomes, in the sense that funds are well spent and accounted for. Clearly, in the case of AHPETC, the outcomes are a let-down.",10,136,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00136

It is the duty of every one of us here in this House to resolutely uphold the high standards of governance in Town Councils, certainly no worse standards than any companies or charitable organisations. We must not let any errant practices erode public confidence and trust in the integrity of the finances of Town Councils. We, the elected representatives, are the guardians of governance, transparency and accountability. And it cannot be just form without substance, talk without actions.",14,140,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00140

2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In AGO's report, it flagged that AHPETC had failed to make the required transfers of the conservancy and service fees and the Government grants into the sinking fund accounts for the last three quarters of FY2011/2012, in non-compliance with the Town Council Financial Rules. It later transferred a $2.7 million and an additional amount of $1.2 million only after being queried by AGO.",17,143,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00143
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Monies in the sinking fund are set aside for future cyclical maintenance, such as repainting of common areas, replacing water tanks and pipes, re-roofing and electrical rewiring, upgrading of lifts, which is a costly item, replacing rubbish chutes and water pumps and so on. These are the real things that need to happen with money from sinking fund.",18,144,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00144
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The consequences of having insufficient money in the sinking fund are that many of these essential maintenance works may not be done and, hence, resulting in poorer living conditions, the living environment, frequent breakdowns and repair disruptions, and even compromising the safety of residents. These consequences may not be seen in the initial few years but, as the estates ages, residents will soon be at the short end of the stick and suffering. And the Town Council may have to levy more S&CC to pay for the maintenance costs. And, of course, there is also this risk of inflation that you have to take into consideration.",19,145,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00145
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"It is for this reason that sinking funds are segregated and ring-fenced so that Town Councils cannot dip into these funds for other operating and routine uses. If there are no regular and diligent contributions to the sinking fund, it will soon run out of money and there will be no cyclical maintenance to talk about.",20,146,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00146
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Like the reserves that the country builds up over the years for our long-term security, the accumulation and disciplined contribution to the sinking fund are at the core of the type of government that we want in Singapore, which is, to do whatever is right and in the long-term good of Singapore and our people. In contrast, mismanagement and wrong use of sinking funds, tells a different set of value system – that of short-sighted and populist government.",21,147,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00147
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I am very concerned that AHPETC took such a lax attitude towards the sinking fund. If AGO had not pointed out this lapse, it is only common sense to expect that the Town Council sinking fund would soon be running short of funds to maintain the estates Then, we will see the estate deteriorating and the quality of life worsening for the residents.",22,148,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00148
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Also of particular concern is another related lapse pointed out by AGO with regard to the GST input tax claimed from IRAS. In this case, sinking fund expenditures were paid from the sinking fund's bank accounts for two financial years. However, the two amounts claimed – $643,000 and $888,000 – were not returned back to the sinking fund and ended up in the operating account. This, again, will deplete the sinking funds which are for longer term use. Instead, the funds were transferred to the operating account which is for short-term use.",23,149,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00149
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In another instance, maturing deposits of $5.49 million intended for the sinking fund was not credited into the sinking fund bank account. Again, it went into the operating fund account. According to the AGO's report, even after restoring the full amount, the sinking fund is still short of the missing $490,000.",24,150,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00150
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"These and other lapses related to the sinking fund pointed out by the AGO will seriously undermine the adequacy and sufficiency of the sinking fund, and this is not unacceptable.",25,151,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00151
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The WP is not new in running a Town Council, having run Hougang Town Council for more than 20 years. Hence, it surprised me why AHPETC did not transfer the money, as required, to the sinking fund bank accounts. It is not about whether you have a good IT software system or not. It is simply about whether the management is conscious of the importance of the sinking fund and the presence of mind to see that this is adhered to.",26,152,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00152
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),The previous PAP-run Town Council for Aljunied left a healthy reserve of about $90 million to the current WP-run Town Council. It is only right that the current leadership of the Town Council ensured that the long-term funding needs of the Town Council are safeguarded and the hard-earned monies of the residents are properly and fairly spent.,27,153,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00153
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),The AGO's report also pointed out the serious conflict of interests issues and the disregard for related party transactions; which were well covered by Minister Shanmugam and Minister Khaw yesterday.,28,154,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00154
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Again, I want to record my serious concern on this situation where the ""Group of Four"" or the ""Gang of Four"" sit as key appointment holders of AHPETC and yet are also the owners and directors of the company that render for-profit services to the Town Council. And most amazingly, notwithstanding the related party transactions and the fit and proper issues, they were given the job of certifying work done and approving cheque payments from the Town Council to their own company.",29,155,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00155
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, again, the common sense question is  how can that be allowed to be passed by the Councillors of the Town Council?

2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"It also amazing to see how AHPETC has flip-flopped and reported wide swings in the S&CC arrear numbers. The arrears report to MND and to AHPETC's Finance & Investment Committee were unreliable and are not aligned. More than three years into running the Town Council, AHPETC still does not have a system that can generate reliable arrears data. This is unsustainable and unfair to residents who duly pay their S&CC.",32,158,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00158

2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Last night, at a coffee shop dinner, an auditor friend of mine told me an interesting comment. He said, ""Why is the People's Action Party (PAP) doing Workers' Party (WP) a favour by helping them to get their house in order, and yet being accused of bullying the WP?"" He said that the way things are going, the Town Council is clearly down on a slippery slope and in no time it will turn into a monster and collapse on its own weight.",35,161,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00161
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, I had to explain to him that as a responsible political party, we cannot allow such poor management of public funds and public money to occur and impacting the lives of our citizens, even if it means hurting us politically, and also the perception that PAP bullies WP. In any case, we are more concerned whether WP is bullying their own residents with these malpractices. From the numbers that Minister K Shanmugam just clarified, obviously the MA is charging the Town Council a lot more than the other Town Councils, and from the other numbers that have been reviewed, it is quite clearly that FMSS has clearly short changed the town council. In other words, the Town Council paid more, and the residents get less.",36,162,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00162
2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Speaker, what we have learned from the AGO report is far from the best practices that we expected from a political-linked organisation like Town Councils, funded by public money and run by elected Members.

2015-02-13-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Finally, I want to quote a comment made by Mr Zulkifli Baharudin, in Wednesday's Straits Times.

We took time to have the data and process reviewed internally and externally before we released our S&CC arrears rate of 5.66% as at 30 September 2014 a few weeks ago. In short, we were not evasive when we said we would address the issue in due course.

While there were invoices under dispute, there were also instances where HDB was reviewing claims dating back to May and November 2012.",20,186,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00186
2015-02-13-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"In subsection (ii) of the same para, NEA rejected four invoices from AHPETC because they were wrongly sent to one of the regional offices. NEA further explained that by the time the invoices were received by the relevant division, the period provided for payments or credit period had lapsed and NEA was unable to process the invoices for payment. The agency then requested AHPETC to re-issue the four invoices.",21,187,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00187
2015-02-13-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Madam, invoices do not carry expiry dates. The 30-day credit term listed on an invoice is to let the debtors know that they have to pay within the stipulated period or the creditors will reserve the right to impose penalties. It is common to replace a missing invoice under the same invoice number and date, or to re-issue an invoice due to amendments but to request for new invoices due to expired credit terms is highly unconventional.",22,188,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00188
2015-02-13-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),To void an invoice needs justification. Is it right to do that just so an agency can be seen to be prompt in making payments on paper?,23,189,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00189
2015-02-13-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Under the same report for Disclaimer 6(a) on page 23, AGO also revealed that AHPETC does have a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for non-routine works contrary to what the previous auditor had claimed. AGO was of the opinion that AHPETC should stipulate a timeline for verification works to be done by property officers after job sheets were received in the SOP, not that AHPETC does not have a SOP.",24,190,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00190

2015-02-13-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The headline in the Lianhe Wanbao, ""Town Council Secretary and GM pay their own company $6.6 million"", is very mischievous.

2015-02-13-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Last, I wish to touch on safeguarding public funds. It is a waste of public funds for an incoming administration to develop a new computer system that does essentially the same functions as the previous system, which was also develop with public funds.",30,196,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00196
2015-02-13-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I understand in the old days, HDB used to provide Town Councils with a centralised computer system. It makes perfect sense since Town Councils are set up to manage only HDB estates and the common areas. Who else would have the latest data on the number of flats in an estate, the types of flats, the residency status of the tenants, the amount of grant each flat should receive, when to start collecting S&CC and whether the unit is rented out whole or partial? All these information affects S&CC and grants.",31,197,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00197
2015-02-13-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"And such systems are not cheap to develop. The old system at Aljunied Town Council cost over $20 million hardware and software split amongst other PAP Town Councils. AHPETC has spent over half a million dollars just to replicate the old system and what the old system could do, and we still have a way to go. Is that not a waste of resources and public funds? Setting up a centralised computer system will certainly safeguard residents' interest and money no doubt.",32,198,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00198
2015-02-13-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Madam, there are many observations made in the AGO report but at the end of it all, the buck stops at AHPETC. I cannot remember if any Minister had ordered any audit or any audit on any Ministry or Organ of State in recent times due to disclaimers or adverse opinions expressed by its auditors but nonetheless, AHPETC has cooperated in this audit and will take lessons from the findings in the spirit of public accountability and good corporate governance.",33,199,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00199

2015-02-13-T-010,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Png had compared the AGO's report of its audit on AHPETC to the findings that the AGO makes during its annual audit of Government agencies. But I would like to ask, in relation to the conclusion that it drew to AHPETC's audit, and I quote from its report, that ""The AGO concluded that unless the weaknesses are addressed, there can be no assurance that AHPETC's financial statements are accurate and reliable and that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed.""",2,202,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00202

2015-02-13-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,I have drawn example of AGO's reports because I read them every year. It is not meant to be a comparison with AHPETC's AGO report. I have mentioned at the final part – it is not meant a comparison but it is meant to point out that such lapses do exist which I had mentioned that good corporate governance is the work-in-progress. We have accepted the AGO report – we have accepted it and Mr Low Thia Khiang has already stated at the beginning of his speech that we support the motion.,1,204,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00204

That is the effect of what he was saying.",1,206,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00206
2015-02-13-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,And so I seek this very specific clarification. I think it is an important clarification because the audits that the AGO conducts of Ministries and statutory boards is something that is done every single year. The report is tabled to Parliament. And every Ministry or statutory board that has findings has to account for it.,2,207,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00207
2015-02-13-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"When, in the past, as a Member of the backbench, I had been seated in the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). I can share with Members very honestly and very certainly that Ministries and statutory boards, when they respond to queries, they take a very different attitude and reply to the PAC is a very different tone than the tone that is reflected in the AHPETC's comments to the AGO.",3,208,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00208
2015-02-13-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, I wanted to seek this clarification because Mr Png, it seems to me, has suggested that Ministries and statutory boards have the same problems. But the conclusion drawn by the AGO is a very specific one. It says that unless the weaknesses are addressed, there can be no assurance that AHPETC's financial statements are accurate and reliable and that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed.",4,209,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00209
2015-02-13-T-010,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I would like to know whether Mr Png is aware of any other occasion that the AGO has drawn the same conclusion for a Government Ministry or statutory board.

Ms Sylvia Lim has already spoken on the first two points covering related party transactions and the transfer of sinking funds.",1,214,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00214

The AGO found no significant matters in these documents that would materially affect the Town Council's FY2012/2013 financial statements. Be that as it may, the Town Council acknowledges the points made by the AGO on this note.",2,215,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00215

This broadly covers the lapses in internal control, procurement and inadequacies in record management and accounting system.",3,216,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00216
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I will deal with these matters focusing on the disclaimers and issues that have the highest financial signature in the spirit of full transparency and accountability to the residents of AHPETC and to Singaporeans.

2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, lift upgrading programme and lift expenses. Mdm Speaker, Foo Kon Tan's fifth disclaimer was on the HDB Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) and covered its inability to determine the accuracy of AHPETC's lift upgrading expenses of about $18.6 million.",5,218,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00218
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To provide some context to this point, the FMSS' staff who previously worked in the Hougang Town Council environment were not familiar with the nature of the billings to HDB for LUP works, as no lift upgrading was carried out in Hougang SMC in the past. Some LUP bills were passed on to FMSS from the previous Managing Agent under the PAP-run Aljunied Town Council. This matter was also brought up in Parliament in 2012 by Ms Sylvia Lim.",6,219,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00219
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In particular, the Town Council was concerned about instances where it was billed one year in advance by the HDB and certain bills were carried over from FY2011 to FY2012, amongst other matters. Accordingly, the Town Council did not recognise LUP expenses in earlier years amounting $8.38 million as the Town Council disputed its share of LUP expenses with the HDB. In view of the very large numbers, one can understand why the Town Council took a cautious approach. The AGO report has since confirmed that the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council has fully paid up the $18.61 million owed to HDB in May 2013 and that this matter has been fully resolved.",7,220,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00220
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Associated with this point is Foo Kon Tan's fourth disclaimer which stated that lift repair expenses of about $1.6 million were expenses that related to the previous financial year and that the Town Council management did not ascertain the quantum of the prior year's expenses and that their expenditure had been over-stated.,8,221,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00221
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Town Council informed the AGO that some work orders were not raised before 31 March 2012 for works performed in FY2011/2012 due to a staff oversight, explaining the incorrect recording of those expenses. The AGO found out that the actual amount of expenses relating to FY2011/2012 included in the FY2012/2013 audit was actually $63,902 and that the impact of this error in the AGO's words was, I quote, ""not significant.""",9,222,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00222
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Nonetheless, the AHPETC informed the AGO that with the implementation of the work orders system module on 1 April 2012 for non-routine works, and 1 October 2012 for routine works, lift repair expenses would be accounted for in a timely manner going forward.",10,223,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00223
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Point two, receivables from various stakeholders. The second disclaimer from Foo Kon Tan covered receivables from the Citizens Consultative Committee (CCC), a carry-over largely of the CIPC funding process governed by MND to the previous PAP Aljunied Town Council. The other stakeholders in this disclaimer are the taxman and sundry debtors. The total amount in question under this heading is about $3.1 million.",11,224,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00224
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, the CCC. The AGO's findings revealed that, in fact, about $614,237 was due from the CCC while the remaining $563,622 were receivables from other parties such as tenants and lessees. Separately, even though the HDB had banked in about $388,887 into the AHPETC's bank account in June and September 2012, the Town Council was unable to match the receipts to the corresponding receivables.",12,225,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00225
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Town Council would like to acknowledge the AGO's efforts in unravelling this disclaimer and following up with the Ang Mo Kio Town Council which in the aftermath of the AGO's audit and intervention, established that the reimbursement it received from HDB should have originally been made to AHPETC instead by virtue of boundary changes made on the occasion of the 2011 General Elections.",13,226,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00226
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I will deal with the point by the AGO that it was able to unravel the issue of the CCC receivables using documents given to it by AHPETC later in my speech, covering the handover and taking over of records between the old Aljunied Town Council and AHPETC and the management of records in general.",14,227,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00227
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Secondly, on receivables from the taxman, IRAS. Foo Kon Tan noted in its FY2012/2013 audit report that it was not able to ascertain receivables amounting to $110,735. AHPETC acknowledges that these receivables were wrongly stated and that it has duly reversed out these incorrectly stated receivables in May 2014.",15,228,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00228
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thirdly, on sundry debtors. Foo Kon Tan noted in its FY2012/2013 audit report that it was not able to ascertain about $1.8 billion of receivables from sundry debtors. The AGO found out that the Town Council had incorrectly over-stated about half these receivables and that the Town Council should have been more industrious in recovering payments on a timely basis.",16,229,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00229
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, while the Town Council acknowledges this point, a bit of background will be helpful to contextualise this particular issue. When the Town Council upscaled the Hougang Town Council's computer system to replace the terminated system used by the former Aljunied Town Council, the Hougang system had a limited number of categories for Town Council operations. This system was set up for the operation of a single member ward of an Opposition Town Council. The accounting for Government programmes such as the revitalisation of shops, neighbourhood renewal programme and schemes involving Town Council's collaboration with NEA were new and in some cases, unheard to the management of the AHPETC. Like Lift Upgrading, many of these were not extended to Hougang in the past.",17,230,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00230
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Separately, some invoices were the subject of disagreements with the HDB on co-payment for faÃ§ade repair to HDB blocks, and hence were subject to follow-up by the TC resulting in them not being removed as receivables. The Town Council has since informed the AGO that it has received payment from sundry debtors in the two Financial Years after the Foo Kon Tan audit of FY2012/2013, amounting to $508,730, of which $483,134 was owed by the HDB.",18,231,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00231
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Separately, the AGO report noted that about $376,316 remained outstanding to AHPETC from the HDB and NEA respectively, with some owed for more than two years. The AGO's findings also confirmed that NEA had overlooked eight invoices amounting to $11,673 owed to AHPETC. For two particular invoices not rejected by HDB and deemed to be in order, HDB informed the AGO that it was still reviewing claims amounting to $175,067, which it received in May and September 2012, almost two and a half years after they were presented to the HDB by AHPETC.",19,232,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00232
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, notwithstanding, the TC has adopted a practice of management regularly churning out a list of debtors and appointing a finance staff to follow up with debtors by issuing reminders on the sums owed. This due diligence will have a positive knock-on effect in ensuring that receivables owed are captured in the accounts to accurately reflect the transactions and state of affairs in the Town Council.",20,233,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00233
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Point three, creditors and accrued expenses. According to Foo Kon Tan's disclaimer, the total amount in question under this head comes to $647,094. The first issue on accrued liabilities covers a claim by Foo Kon Tan that the Town Council did not have a standing operating procedure (SOP) covering the timely recording of liabilities. I will deal with this issue, first.",21,234,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00234
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The AGO has taken a different position from Foo Kon Tan on this point, to correctly report that the Town Council indeed had an SOP, with the qualification that this SOP does not stipulate a timeline for verification works done by property officers after job sheets were received to enable the timely issuance of work orders. I have since personally checked on the SOP with the Town Council's property manager, and confirmed that for the overwhelming number of accrued liabilities, the SOP now puts the timeframe from job completion to issuance of payments to take a maximum of three months.",22,235,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00235
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Secondly, with accruals without work orders. Foo Kon Tan reported that the Town Council was unable to provide details covering some $338,379 in accrued expenses from the previous Aljunied Town Council. The Town Council explained that it was not able to provide the details required as it did not have supporting documents. The AGO was able to find out that some of these items were over-statements, as the Town Council did not reverse out the accrued expenses from its accounts.",23,236,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00236
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"As explained earlier, the Town Council was hampered operating a GRC with a manual works order system. With the roll-out of a new works order system in 2012, the Town Council is enhancing its SOPs to ensure that moving forward, an accurate reflection of the amounts due to external parties is established.",24,237,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00237
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thirdly, on other payables. The AGO found poor monitoring and lack of due diligence by the Town Council in following up on items in a temporary clearing account which Foo Kon Tan noted came up to $308,715. The Town Council has since cleared up many of the receipts, and we will put in resources to clear up the remaining amount.",25,238,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00238
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, the TC accepts that proper management involving the handover of records from the previous management was something that on hindsight should have been better addressed. The reality at that time was that many staff who signed for finance-related files from the previous Managing Agent after GE 2011, resigned in 2011 and 2012. With this came the loss of the institutional knowledge specific to documents pertaining to the handover period.",26,239,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00239
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Going forward and in the interest of better corporate governance, the Town Council will monitor the management and handover of records more systematically. To that end, proper handover procedures for resigning staff prior to the issuance of their final pay check have already been implemented.",27,240,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00240
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Before concluding, Mdm Speaker, I wish to say a few words about tenders and contracts as I have been the Chairman of the Tenders and Contracts Committee since 2012. In that context, it would also be appropriate for me to make some comments about the Managing Agent's role in the decision-making process involving the calling of tenders and award of contracts in view of some media reports insinuating personal benefit for FMSS by virtue of being the Managing Agent of AHPETC.",28,241,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00241
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Firstly, in a situation where FMSS is a tenderer in a tender called by the Town Council, as was the case in 2011 for the Managing Agent contract, FMSS is kept at an arm's length and a China wall is built between FMSS and the Town Council. What happens in such a case? The evaluation of such a tender is done solely by the elected and appointed members of the Town Council, all of whom have no interest, pecuniary or otherwise, in FMSS. The decision-making to award the tender in such a case will be the sole remit of the Tenders and Contracts Committee. No staff member of the Managing Agent is privy to the evaluation or decision-making process in this case. The Secretary of the Town Council Mr Danny Loh and its General Manager Ms How Weng Fan are not involved in this process at all.",29,242,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00242
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In 2011, in view of operational exigencies, a decision was made with the concurrence of Town Councillors, and as detailed earlier, FMSS did not participate in the evaluation or recommendation in strict adherence with the Town Council financial rules.",30,243,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00243
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This was the same scenario that played itself out late last year and early this year, when Town Councillors met to evaluate the specifications of the Managing Agent tender for FY2015 and beyond.",31,244,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00244
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In a second scenario where FMSS does not participate in the tenders called by Town Council pertaining for example to conservancy lift maintenance and horticultural contracts, FMSS' role is purely administrative. FMSS is expected to evaluate and assess the tenderers and recommend which tenderers meet the minimum requirements of the Town Council. At no point does FMSS make a decision on whom to award the tender to.",32,245,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00245
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"FMSS' administrative role is purely to advise the Tenders and Contracts Committee on the tenderers and their submissions. It is for the Committee to deliberate and determine in the interests of the residents of the Town Council which tenderer the contract ought to be awarded to after considering all the relevant facts. Once again, no personal benefit is accrued to FMSS by virtue of these processes.",33,246,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00246
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, I have not covered all the points made by both the AGO and PwC in their reports. But I have focused on the big sum items. This in no way downplays the weight the Town Council places on arrears where there are amounts owing or owed, and for reconciliation or follow-up are lower or less significant.",34,247,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00247
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Town Council will strengthen its processes and we will do it with the same vigour when we sought to ensure that residents' lives would not be affected during the course of the post GE2011 handover. I would like to thank all the staff of the Town Council, past and present, for their efforts and service to the Town Council. I note that the AGO, with a full-time team working for almost a year, with up to 16 personnel including those from PwC, did not flag out any potential criminal wrong-doing on the part of any staff member of the Town Council.",35,248,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00248
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),We will make full use of the AGO's findings to boost our financial systems and processes. Thank you.,36,249,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00249
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, in my 24 years as a lawyer, I have investigated the affairs of a number of companies, including listed companies, and have authored a few audit or investigation reports myself. It has been my experience that lapses are invariably caused by human failings. You may have good systems in place, but ultimately, your systems are only as good as the people who run them.",1,250,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00250
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There will always be individuals who will ignore or try to get around the rules - sometimes because they are lazy or complacent, sometimes because they are incompetent and sometimes, unfortunately, because they are dishonest. Almost always, they are not questioned or challenged because of the positions they occupy. In every case I have been in, losses were suffered.",2,251,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00251
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"And so, the findings in the AGO report are depressingly familiar to me. I have read a number of media and online reports which have portrayed the report's findings as ""lapses in control"", ""inadequate oversight"" or ""poor management of records"". Indeed, there are many such findings in that report. But these understate the gravity of the findings.",3,252,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00252
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, I had planned to come to this House to make the point that these are serious matters. But then I encountered something quite bizarre. The people I discussed the matter with kept telling me – do not attack the Workers' Party; they will only get more sympathy; find a way to move on; you have to keep in mind the politics.",4,253,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00253
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I could not get my head around that. Has it really come to this? This is a matter involving public funds. How could anyone in good conscience ignore or downplay what the AGO and PwC have found? These are not partisan bodies. And Mr Png accepts that. Indeed, AGO routinely audits Government agencies and does not shirk from highlighting lapses, and Members of all parties in this House have rightly criticised those lapses and held the Government to account. So, why should the Workers' Party be let off easy just because they are the Opposition? And why should their residents be forced to accept anything less than full accountability? This cannot be the right way forward.",5,254,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00254
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"And sure enough, when Mr Low and Ms Lim spoke yesterday, they tried to downplay the breaches and make excuses for themselves – we are small; we are learning; the system is against us; these are only procedural lapses. That is playing politics. And these excuses are flimsy.",6,255,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00255
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Low says that unlike the PAP Town Councils, the WP cannot find a Managing Agent, very difficult for them. But the Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council does not have a Managing Agent. For the last 19 years, we have been managing the Town Council ourselves. We employ our own staff and ensure that they are trained and have the proper skills to do their job. We are not perfect, but we consistently score an all-green ratings in our TCMRs; our accounts are submitted on time and all the time, are unqualified.",7,256,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00256
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Low also had no Managing Agent when he ran Hougang Town Council. So, this issue of a Managing Agent is a complete red herring. Mr Chen Show Mao, a very experienced corporate lawyer, then suggests the rules on disclosing conflicts are unclear and difficult to apply. But that is not correct. The rules are simple; he must know that. Besides, they have professionals they can turn to for advice. And if the rules are so unclear, why is the AHPETC the only TC with difficulty following them?",8,257,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00257
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, Mdm Speaker, to me, all these are deflections and distractions. What is more important is what the AGO report actually says. And these findings cannot be brushed off as down to inexperience or a lack of resources. This entire episode raises questions about the competence, accountability and integrity of those who run AHPETC. Minister Shanmugam gave examples yesterday and some are worth re-stating.",9,258,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00258
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, the appointment of FMSS and FMSI, and their ownership by the Secretary of AHPETC and his wife, who is also the General Manager of FMSS – both hard core Workers' Party members. By any standard of corporate governance, the engagement of FMSS and FMSI involve a conflict of interest. Ms Lim suggests that FMSS was appointed because CPG did not want to continue as Managing Agent. But there is still no explanation as to why FMSS was formed seven days after the election results, and before CPG discontinued its services.",10,259,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00259
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But that is not all. There is nothing wrong per se with an engagement which involves a conflict of interest, provided – and this is critical – it is in the best interests of the organisation, the conflict is fully and properly declared and disclosed, and the risks are managed. The AGO report makes it clear that all this was not done. The AGO report notes that PwC Consulting did not see any documentary evidence that the AHPETC Town Councillors had considered the full extent of the conflicts of interests involved and the safeguards needed. We are still waiting for an explanation why the minutes do not reflect that Mr Loh and his wife's ownership of FMSS was not declared. Still waiting for that.",11,260,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00260
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But that is still not all. We heard the examples yesterday of how the Secretary, General Manager and Deputy General Manager routinely issued works orders and approved payments, effectively, to themselves. Mr Png says there are oversight committees, but PwC was unable to determine if the Chairman and Vice Chairman of AHPETC adequately verified payments to related parties before they sign the cheques.",12,261,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00261
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Png repeats what Ms Lim says, and says that these are over recurring payments, and that if you do not pay them, the rubbish will pile up high. But again, that is not the point. They keep missing the point. Just because there is a contract does not mean you pay blindly. Where is the oversight? In other words, what is the assurance that the very people who are in a conflict did not take advantage of their position? The report makes it quite clear that there was no such assurance. There was no assurance that the services they were being paid for were performed or performed adequately.",13,262,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00262
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In other words, these people were patting themselves on the back while lining their own pockets. And, now, they have all ended up in knots. So, these are egregious breaches that demand a proper explanation, not excuses. And it cannot be a question of inexperience.",14,263,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00263
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, was the appointment of FMSS, the party in conflict, in the best interests of the Town Council? The report says that there was no open competition in FMSS' appointment and, therefore, no assurance that AHPETC obtained competitive prices for their services. The report then gives an extraordinary account of how FMSS' fees came to be approved. It states that the AHPETC Town Councillors were assured that FMSS would charge about the same amount as the previous contractors. But this was false. The report notes that the combined fee of the previous contractors was only about $49,000 a month. As it turns out, the fees billed by FMSS for the period from October 2011 to June 2012 averaged $67,000 a month, more than 35% per cent higher. In short, their own Town Councillors were misled. Ms Lim now says all these were errors, rounding-up errors, and so on. But such an error is so flagrant that it certainly raises suspicions and warrants a more thorough investigation.",15,264,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00264
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"What is important to appreciate is that it is not the AGO's remit to determine whether dishonesty was involved. And even if we accept that a mistake had been made at the outset, it is hard to believe that the nine months of over-payment was not discovered.",16,265,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00265
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But the worst thing for me in this entire debate – really, the worst thing for me – was that Ms Lim and her team said in response to the AGO report that it confirms that no monies are missing nor has criminal or dishonest activity been uncovered. Mr Low repeated that argument yesterday and I think it is being said ad nauseam in this House. This is a consistent line they are giving this House and no doubt to their residents as well.",17,266,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00266
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But this is blatantly misleading on two counts. First, the report says no such thing. In fact, after that statement came out, the AGO responded that Ms Lim's, and I quote, ""broad conclusion cannot be derived from AGO's audit"".",18,267,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00267
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"What does the report in fact say? An important element of the cases I mentioned involves piecing together what went wrong and tracing or figuring out where monies have gone to. By and large, this can be done because almost all transactions leave paper trails, and forensic accountants use documents to analyse, reconstruct and draw a picture of what had happened. But what does the AGO report say about the state of AHPETC documents? I will quote some portions.",19,268,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00268
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"At paragraph 5.13, ""PwC was not provided with sufficient documentary evidence for it to independently ascertain the manner and extent of verification of the payments at the cheque-signing stage by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.""",20,269,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00269
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"At paragraph 5.28, ""AHPETC did not have a proper system to ensure that documents were properly accounted for and safeguarded. AHPETC was unable to provide supporting documents for the period April to July 2011 to its auditor.""",21,270,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00270
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"At paragraph 5.31, ""AHPETC also could not provide some documents required during the current audit that concerned transactions taking place after AHPETC had taken over from the previous Town Council."" So, it has nothing to do with the previous Town Council. ""In response to reminders, AHPETC indicated that it could not locate some of the documents and was still looking for others, three months after the request for the documents.""",22,271,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00271
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"And then the report concludes at paragraph 4.1, I quote, ""until the weaknesses are addressed, there can be no assurance that AHPETC's accounts are accurate and reliable, or that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed.""",23,272,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00272
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In short, the AGO cannot say if public monies have all been accounted for because documents which AHPETC were obliged to keep are missing. So, contrary to what Ms Lim and her colleagues want the public to believe, the AGO report does not by any stretch confirm that no monies are missing, or that there is no criminal or dishonest activity. Rather, it says that it does not know because of the way the Town Council has mismanaged its operations. If AHPETC considers this an endorsement, then it speaks volumes about its attitude towards managing public funds.",24,273,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00273
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, my second problem with that statement, because as Mr Shanmugam explained and as any person with any common sense knows, loss does not only occur when money is stolen. There are numerous instances in the report of possible breach of fiduciary duties by AHPETC officers. We now also know that FMSS was paid far more than other Managing Agents. We now know that there were substantial over-payments to FMSS, which would not have been discovered but for the audit. And we also know that an operating surplus of over $3.2 million has become a deficit of over $700,000. That money is not going to come back. This is something we still have not heard an explanation for. Could there be more examples? We do not know because the accounts for FY2013 have not yet been submitted.",25,274,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00274
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"While lapses can occur in all organisations – and I accept that – my experience has also shown me what distinguishes a good organisation is its response to discovering those lapses  failings are acknowledged, systems tightened, losses made good and those responsible dealt with.",26,275,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00275
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, what was AHPETC's response? First to brush off the many lapses as, I quote, ""mistakes and omissions due to inadvertence, human error, IT system constraints and a lack of experience dealing with certain scenarios."" And then, second, to misleadingly spin the report as an endorsement that there was no wrong-doing.",27,276,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00276
2015-02-13-T-010,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"It was a blasé response from people charged with handling millions in public funds. They did initially come to this House with a different, more contrite tone – I thought I heard that – and I acknowledge their saying that they will support the motion.

How many will have the accounting or legal training to know the full implications of the report and know the right questions to ask?

In fact, not just their residents, it should be all Singaporeans because half of their revenue comes from Government grants which we all contribute to.

2015-02-13-T-010,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Thank you. May I refer you to the AGO report, main report, page three?",1,294,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00294
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Minister. Minister, those figures originated from the income and expenditure statements for Financial Year 31 March 2012, Financial Year 31 March 2013. Now, if we look into those figures, that is correct for 2010 under the previous Aljunied Town Council. If we look at the operating expenditure, there five heads. Cleaning Works under the previous Aljunied Town Council was $5.1 million dollars; under the AHPETC in 2012 was $6.7 million. For Lift Maintenance, it was $1.8 million in 2010 and $4 million in 2012. That is a rise of about $2.1 million to $2.2 million. Water and electricity was $8.9 million in 2010 and it was $10.1 million in 2012. It was a larger town by 2012, so that explains that. There are two other heads, but let me deal with the one which has the largest cost increase, which is lift maintenance.",1,295,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00295
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I remember sometime in 2012, there was an episode where a lift did not home to the correct floor. There was a resident in the lift. This was in Paya Lebar, if my memory serves me right. In 2011, I beg your pardon. And the resident, of course, had a very jarring experience. At that point, the Members of Parliament got to know about it and we were quite concerned about safety issues involving lifts and lift maintenance. So the Town Council commissioned the consultant to try and understand our lift maintenance contracts, lift maintenance procedures, whether there was any problem with them and what we could do to improve the situation.",2,296,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00296
2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"And at that point, it was determined that for the novated contract from the Aljunied Town Council, it had third party who was looking after all the lifts in the town and we had a lot of different types of lifts, as I am sure the other Town Councils do – 9G lifts, Mitsubishi lifts, Sigma lifts, EM Services, Otis, Fujitec, and it goes on and on, of course. So, the recommendation that was made to the Town Council was to try as far as possible to ensure that for lift maintenance, get the original equipment manufacturer to be maintaining those lifts. And this was quite an important consideration for us because we were noticing that the lift downtimes for lifts which were maintained by this third party contractor were rather long.",3,297,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00297

2015-02-13-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Yes. I will finish up very shortly. Because of those downtimes, we decided, ""Look, we have to probably invest a bit more money and try and make sure that our lift maintenance procedures and contracts are up to the mark or up to the satisfaction of the Members of Parliament. And that really explains the large jump of about $2.2 million. It is the largest jump in the operating expenditure. And that explains that figure. Thank you.",1,299,2015-02-13-T-010-S-00299

AHPETC recognised that it is good control practice for bank reconciliation to be independently reviewed and for the reviewer to sign off and date on the bank reconciliation statement as evidence of review. When Aljunied-Hougang Town Council was formed in 2011, the merger resulted in the TC inheriting several bank accounts from the former management, in addition to those from Hougang Town Council. These accounts were mainly used for receipts and payments. To streamline the accounts, the Town Council decided to close unnecessary accounts, leaving only four accounts, that is, one operating fund and one Sinking Fund account each with two banks.

Why did this happen? Either the MA is totally incompetent or they deliberately decided not to fill the Sinking Fund to show a better financial picture and have a large operating account to pay for expenses, the largest item being the MA fees.

2015-02-13-T-012,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Yesterday, in this House, Ms Sylvia Lim rejected the suggestion that the arrangement with FMSS was to benefit their friends. So, may I ask  are they your friends, or at least, were they? Yes? Did they benefit? Yes, richly so. The structure that the Workers' Party set up allowed this to happen. You awarded contracts at these exorbitant rates and allowed them to get away with it. What other conclusions can be drawn?",19,352,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00352

They have said that they would support this Motion. I hope the support is in substance, not just form. If they support the Motion in substance, one would have expected that they will conduct a forensic audit, that they will take legal action against the Managing Agent FMSS; that they will file accounts immediately, on time, as required by the law and any administrative action; that they will put in place checks and balances where there is a severe conflict of interest. And their residents deserve to know what had happened. Are you prepared to come clean and explain and answer all the questions which have been raised in this House? How exactly will you safeguard the interest of residents?",24,357,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00357

Over the last two days, we have seen so clearly how they have created a system where there is no check, no balance. You cannot even check yourself, or are you not willing to check yourself? They have been entrusted with running a Town Council. Where is the First World Town Council that they should be delivering?

Mr Low said that he will account in Parliament and, indeed, Ms Lim told the press earlier that the Workers' Party will explain in Parliament. But Mr Singh said in Chamber yesterday that he would only answer to his residents door-to-door. In fact, Mr Pritam Singh spoke about transparency, that the Workers' Party will press the Government for as much information as possible. But they do not even provide information to their own auditors. What the House witnessed yesterday is unbelievable. Unbelievable. Mr Pritam Singh had said this, and I quote, ""We will constantly press the Government for more information especially since it is so selective with the information it releases."" When asked pertinent questions on transparency and accountability by Mr Shanmugam, Mr Pritam Singh said that he would not give a reply in Parliament – the First World Parliament which he claims he wants to build, and which Mr Low Thia Khiang said he would account to. He refuses to answer to Parliament. So, why is Mr Singh so selective about where he answers his questions?",29,362,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00362

But the PAP Town Councils also started from scratch when they were first formed. The PAP Town Councillors had no experience in municipal administration. But they had plenty of integrity and sense of responsibility. Mr Low said that we must therefore de-politicise the transitioning process. Newly elected Members of Parliament should not be tested, implying that they should simply be elected to oppose the Government in a First World Parliament, and not to have to show that they can actually govern.",33,366,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00366

Indeed, it is the opposite of what Mr Low Thia Khiang used to maintain, running Hougang Town Council for 20 years until the Workers' Party's team messed up in AHPETC  that, contrary to what the PAP thinks and claims, there is nothing to running Town Councils, and the Opposition run them as well as any PAP Town Councils and, therefore, people should vote for them. Mr Low calls for the Town Council issue to be de-politicised, but he is politicking.

So, Mr Low, you are the Secretary General of the Workers' Party, and have just said the exact opposite of what Ms Sylvia Lim, Chairman of the Workers' Party, said in this House in 2013. Did you just change your mind when things went wrong in AHPETC, or you never believed in what you were doing?

We actually made some transfers before even the AGO audit commenced. Of course, it is true that we did not make the transfers on time; it was not done deliberately. As I mentioned in the House yesterday, we thought that it was acceptable to keep the monies in the Operating Fund, pay Sinking Fund expenses out of there and then net the thing off. I think I said that in my speech. So, there was some misunderstanding on our part of that but we admit that the rule, read strictly, is clear and that we should have done the quarterly transfer.",1,410,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00410

2015-02-13-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The discussion was very detailed, the analysis of the MA rates. We looked at some factors such as  first of all, they were providing more staff than the previous MA; secondly, they are a company set up just to service us and we require them to operate quite a number of offices because of the boundaries of the town. Our town operated a total of five offices and one collection centre, so it is quite a lot of administrative costs. And, third of all, they are a company set up focusing on our work and, because of that, they may not have the same economies of scale as the larger companies that are running the other MAs. So, these were some of the factors that we took into account.",4,413,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00413

So, these are some of the factors. The discussions were very frank and also based on the expected cost structure. We benchmarked the salaries that they were paying their staff; we got an HR consultancy to come in to see that it is within the market benchmark.

They would have only transferred back because they knew what the rules are. So, the question is why did they not transfer everything back before the AGO came in?",1,415,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00415

So, is there an incentive for them to do this, if there is intention for greed and money? There is no guarantee, because you have to go through a public tender.

Eventually, the financial health of the Town Council will be placed at risk. This can only be at the expense of the residents.",15,455,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00455
2015-02-13-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"That is why we require all organisations to prepare fully audited financial accounts, unqualified. Unfortunately, we all know now, the Town Council had not been able to do so for several years. I think Mr Liang Eng Hwa put it quite succinctly – FMSS has severely short-changed the Town Council. The residents there pay more, and get less!",16,456,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00456
2015-02-13-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Minister Shanmugam probed further and asked about the financial position of FMSS, and whether FMSS would publish its accounts. Mr Heng did the same thing just now. And, as we heard, there was no reply. But I bet that the FMSS is one of those rare companies which are profitable from year one. And if my guess is correct, we can safely assume where the husband-and-wife team places their priority. To preserve the peace with the residents, they work on the visible aspects of Town Council work  cleaning the floors, maintaining the lifts. And in any case, such work is not done by them. It is outsourced to external contractors and, in fact, the FMSS is paid to oversee them. As for the invisible aspects of Town Council work that residents do not get to see, like corporate governance, accounting procedures, timely payment into the Sinking Fund, and reducing operating deficits, they probably figure that such things being out of sight can wait. But this is also at the expense of the residents, though the effects may not be obvious immediately. It is only as a result of their own auditor's disclaimers, and now the deeper findings of the AGO audit, that we have sight of the mess that they have been hiding from all of us.",17,457,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00457
2015-02-13-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Minister Shanmugam gave us a vivid analysis of the intrinsically troubling structure of FMSS and its relationship with AHPE Town Council. He is our Law Minister. He said in this House that the structure is downright unlawful, and that it is a serious breach of fiduciary duties for any Town Councillor to have approved such a process. Inflated fees were paid to the FMSS, in return for gross incompetence, placing the Town Council's financial health at risk. The excess fees paid to FMSS, we have heard, were estimated at $1.6 million per year. So, in four years, it is $6.4 million; $1.6 million per year, $6.4 million for four years. In three short years, the Town Council's finances deteriorated from a $3.3 million surplus to a deficit of almost $¾ million. In short, FMSS and its owners who de facto run the Town Council have milked it, and residents' money and public funds have, in this manner, been abused. That was the conclusion and the statement by Minister Shanmugam. So, in this House yesterday, he asked the elected MPs whether they were aware of this governance structure and process. No answers! Whether collectively or individually. Instead, we were inundated with speeches over several hours on minutiae details, details which are already recorded in the appendices of the auditors' report. Minutiae details which they have also offered to the Auditor-General, and many of which had been rejected by them. But they recycled it here and conveniently kept silent on the key questions put up by the Minister for Law.",18,458,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00458
2015-02-13-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Workers' Party (WP) MPs had made light of the AGO findings when they asserted yesterday that AGO had found no evidence of loss of money or fraudulent activity. But as we have now heard, this is a misrepresentation of AGO's conclusions. Mr Hri Kumar highlighted this point. AGO pointed this out in Appendix A of its report when the WP tried to put such words in AGO's mouth. AGO did not draw such a conclusion, that there was no loss of money or fraudulent activity. In fact, with so many documents missing, and the accounts unreliable, who can be sure that there was no wrongdoing?",19,459,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00459
2015-02-13-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Instead of making such an assertion, attributing a conclusion to the AGO audit which, in fact, the AGO had categorically rejected, Mr Low or Ms Sylvia Lim should just roll up their sleeves and do real work  mount a serious forensic investigation, as suggested by Mr Hri Kumar, into the records and pursue all the findings of the AGO report, clean up the accounts, correct the flawed structure, institute a robust system, discipline any errant officers, get the MA to return the money, explain to their residents.

2015-02-13-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"While the incompetence of FMSS, the Managing Agent, caused all these problems, it was in the end only the proximate cause. The primary cause was, unfortunately, the dereliction of duty by the Town Councillors, condoning this, allowing it to happen, and then making excuses for it when uncovered, instead of putting things right. Only they, the Town Councillors, can unwind the mess. If I may borrow another Chinese saying  “解铃还需系铃人”, that is, ""Only he who attached the bell can remove it.""",21,461,2015-02-13-T-012-S-00461

The result is the deteriorating financial health of the Town Council, with all signs suggesting it is only going to get worse this year and the next. If a listed company had such an auditor's report, the Chairman of the company would be duty-bound to investigate and to satisfy himself and his shareholders whether fraud or criminal conduct was involved.

I expect him to take action against the FMSS for their monumental incompetence. That would be the right thing to do.
