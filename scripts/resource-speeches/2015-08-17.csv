2015-08-17-T-001,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein,asked  the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in light of the recent Auditor-General's Report for FY 2014/2015 on lapses found in public sector entities (a) whether the respective Ministries have conducted their own investigations into the lapses; (b) whether these investigation reports will be made public; (c) how many of these lapses are repeat lapses; and (d) what are the measures the respective Ministries plan to take to tighten controls and avoid serious lapses that affect the proper use of public funds.,1,1,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00001
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"I thank Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein for his question. Before I get into the specifics, let me briefly explain that there are two types of audit conducted annually by the Auditor-General's Office (AGO).",1,2,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00002
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),,2,3,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00003
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The first type is a financial statements audit. AGO checks if the Government Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the law. The Government Financial Statements incorporate the accounts of all Ministries, Departments and Organs of State. AGO's audit hence covers the accounts of all these agencies.",3,4,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00004
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),,4,5,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00005
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The second type of audit is a selective audit. AGO checks on individual public agencies' compliance with rules and procedures, and also on their internal controls. AGO does these selective audits on a selection of agencies every year.",5,6,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00006
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),,6,7,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00007
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"For its audit of the Government Financial Statements, AGO has given an unmodified audit opinion this year, just as in previous years. That is to say, the Government Financial Statements, containing accounts of the Ministries, Departments and Organs of State, are reliable, and public funds are properly accounted for. The same is true for the Statutory Boards, all of which received an unmodified audit opinion from their respective auditors for the Financial Year 2014/15.",7,8,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00008
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),,8,9,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00009
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The findings reported in the Auditor-General's latest report for FY2014/15 did not affect AGO's opinion of the Government Financial Statements. The findings, which are the result of the various selective audits performed by the AGO, highlight lapses in complying with the rules and procedures which the Government imposes on itself to ensure proper conduct. Each of our agencies takes every lapse seriously, and ensures improvements are made promptly.",9,10,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00010

2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"I will now address the specific questions that Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein has raised. All of AGO's audit findings are looked into by the Heads of the respective agencies. In the case of Ministries, this is the Permanent Secretary. The Permanent Secretaries and the other Heads of the respective agencies are responsible for ensuring that the lapses are rectified and steps are taken to minimise recurrence. This includes the need for further investigations within the agencies when required, and to take disciplinary actions where warranted. Any suspicion of corruption or fraud is referred promptly to the Police, and investigated thoroughly.",11,12,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00012

2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"With regard to Statutory Boards, their audit findings and any further investigations are also reviewed by their respective supervising Ministries.",13,14,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00014
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"In this year's report, AGO has observed lapses in some agencies regarding their administration of grants, management of procurement or revenue contracts, management of contract variations and related-party transactions. All the agencies involved have conducted their own investigations into the lapses. Except for one audit finding, concerning an agency's procurement of event management services, all the other audit findings in this year's AGO report were not repeat lapses.",14,15,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00015
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"All agencies where lapses were found have taken steps to improve. Depending on the problem, this includes closer monitoring by supervisors and internal auditors, improved and clearer internal guidelines for officers, enhanced IT systems to enable better tracking, and developing fund administration guidelines for management of programme vendors.",15,16,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00016
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Further, officers responsible for the lapses are taken to task. Because of the consistent way we have dealt with lapses in the past, all public officers and their supervisors know that if they are responsible for any misdoing, firm measures including disciplinary actions will be taken whenever necessary. All officers know that. If there is any misdoing, firm measures will be taken, including disciplinary actions wherever necessary.",16,17,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00017
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Except for one case in the latest AGO findings which has been referred to the Police for further investigation, all the other cases were due to administrative or procedural lapses. These were mainly due to a lack of knowledge, carelessness or poor supervision. But even where there is no evidence of fraud or corrupt intent, an officer may face serious disciplinary action, such as having his salary increment withheld and being debarred from promotion for a few years. And this indeed does happen.",17,18,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00018
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Mr Mohd Ismail has also asked if Ministries' investigation reports will be made public. The Public Accounts Committee, comprising Members of this House, can and has called up public agencies to give a full account for areas which are of concern to the Committee. Agencies are required to submit all materials related to their cases, including investigation reports, to the Committee if asked. The Committee then gives its opinions and observations, including its assessment of the agencies' follow-up action, to Parliament and to the public.",18,19,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00019
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"To go beyond this and make public each agency's investigations into every lapse each year will not help in ensuring the thorough internal investigations needed to get to the bottom of things. What matters is that agencies take each and every lapse seriously, and take steps to minimise recurrence.",19,20,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00020
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"To conclude, let me reassure Members that we have a sound system of checks and balances in place in the public sector, which is why it is regarded as one of the cleanest and most reputable administrations in the world. Public officers and agencies know they have a responsibility to safeguard the use of public funds. Internal controls are in place within each agency, audits by an impartial AGO are carried out regularly and rigorously, and the AGO's findings are made public. The agencies take prompt action whenever problems are found, and make no attempt to cover them up. And where there is any suspicion of fraud or corruption, investigations are thorough and errant officers face the full measure of the law regardless of their seniority.",20,21,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00021
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),Page  8,21,22,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00022
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Any AGO audit must be expected to turn up some lapses and oversights. If nothing was found, I would be concerned about the independence and rigour of AGO's audits. We take every lapse seriously and ensure prompt remedy. But we cannot tighten controls to the point of eliminating all lapses. It is not possible to avoid human lapses completely in any large organisation, and we would also be weighing down the system with more rules than is sensible for an effective administration. It would freeze decision-making within our agencies. We must therefore continue to maintain a sensible balance of rules, subject ourselves to regular and thorough audit, and take full and proper actions whenever problems are found.",22,23,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00023
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Finally, I should emphasise once again that AGO's findings on compliance with rules and procedures do not impinge on its assessment that the Government's financial accounts are reliable. They leave no doubt as to whether the public's money is fully accounted for and in safe hands.",23,24,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00024
2015-08-17-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit,"Mdm Speaker, in his reply, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman mentioned about the different types of audit conducted by the AGO. I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he could help us better understand the different types of audit that AGO conducts. For example, those that AGO conducts on the various Ministries and agencies on an annual basis, versus those that AGO conducted on the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC), and what are the differences?",1,25,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00025
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"On the first part of Mr Liang Eng Hwa's question, as I have explained, there are two types of audit. One is an audit of the reliability of your financial statements; the other is a selective audit that AGO does each year on different agencies on quite a wide range of issues, mainly to do with their compliance with the rules and procedures that we have out in place to ensure proper conduct. But it goes beyond that also -- it looks at wasteful spending, whether there is value-for-money in spending, and a range of other issues. So, AGO has the remit to decide on what is relevant in its selective audits and it has ranged quite widely across our agencies.",1,26,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00026
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The fundamental issue which I highlighted in my answer is that AGO has given an unmodified opinion on the Government's financial statements. That is indeed the fundamental difference between the AGO's opinion on the Government, compared to the AGO's opinion after its special audit of AHPETC.",2,27,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00027
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The problems in AHPETC are fundamentally different. The entire system of accounts is a problem. If I can quote from the AGO Report on AHPETC, ""There can be no assurance that AHPETC's accounts are accurate and reliable, or that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed"". This is not just a matter of poor accounting procedures. It arose because there were so many weaknesses and omissions in the AHPETC accounts that its own auditors and the AGO were not able to determine if monies in the accounts have been safeguarded or how they have been used. That is the heart of the matter. It is the entire system of accounts.",3,28,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00028
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Page  9,4,29,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00029
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"There is no remotely similar problem in Government. As I have mentioned, the AGO has given the Government an unmodified audit opinion on its financial statements, both in the latest audit as well as in previous years. This means that the accounts of all the Government departments, the Ministries and the Organs of State are reliable, and public funds are properly accounted for. The same is true for the Statutory Boards which have their respective auditors. They all received unmodified audit opinions from their respective auditors in their latest audits.",5,30,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00030
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"If I can put it simply, the whole house of AHPETC's finances is unsafe, if you look at what the AGO findings say. Both AHPETC's own auditor and the AGO could not certify the AHPETC house as structurally safe, structurally sound. Apart from it being unsafe and unsound, there are also many individual defects and problems.",6,31,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00031
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"By comparison, the Government agencies audited by AGO do not have unsafe houses. The house is safe. There is no question as to whether public monies are fully accounted for. There are some repairs needed to the house in specific areas but everyone can be confident that the house is safe. And there is also full visibility. The curtains are not drawn. There is full visibility. This is the fundamental difference.",7,32,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00032
2015-08-17-T-001,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The Deputy Prime Minister said that the findings in the AGO's Report are mostly not repeated; they are not repeat findings. How did the Minister arrive at that conclusion because the AGO, when it does audits it selects agencies and it may not select the same agencies or Statutory Boards every year. For example, the People's Association, the last time AGO did an audit was quite some time ago. How does the Minister arrive at the conclusion that most of the findings are not repeat findings?",1,33,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00033
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"I would not be able to say that every fault or lapse found this year has never happened before. As the Member said, the AGO, like any external auditor, can only make selective audits and focuses on different transactions each year in different agencies. However, if the Member asks me for an assessment, looking at all the years of the AGO's reports ─ and I must say that AGO is a very thorough organisation ─ it is clear that lessons are taken in each and every case. There are one or two instances where you literally get a recurrence of the same problem, which we take very seriously. But by and large, lessons are taken.",1,34,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00034
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"I have to emphasise that there will be no perfection in this matter. From time to time, there will be human lapses and, despite the rules having been put in place and strengthened after initial audit findings, you will sometimes get people overlooking the rules. But by and large, if we look at the way Government agencies have responded to the AGO reports, actions have been taken, disciplinary actions have also been taken, and improvements have been made. We do track this.",2,35,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00035
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"We also track whether there is a recurrence in the same agency or the same type of problem. In this year's report, for instance, there was only one recurrence out of that whole set. We track every single lapse to see, ""Has this happened before? Were the lessons taken after the last time it happened?"" And we found only one example where, in fact, there was a recurrence of the same type of lapse.",3,36,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00036

2015-08-17-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Madam. Three clarifications and supplementary questions for Deputy Prime Minister Tharman. He made some reference in his answer to the audit done by the AGO on the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council, and I would like to ask him some questions on this.",1,38,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00038
2015-08-17-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Firstly, is he aware that the Town Council has since filed the subsequent audited accounts for FY13/14 by 30 June 2015?",2,39,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00039
2015-08-17-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, can he confirm if he has read those accounts?",3,40,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00040
2015-08-17-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thirdly, the auditors that audited our accounts which were recently submitted on 30 June, is he not aware that out of the 13 disclaimers that were put into our previous accounts, the auditors have confirmed that only three remained unresolved?",4,41,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00041
2015-08-17-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Last of all, is the Deputy Prime Minister also not aware that in this recent audit that we did for FY13/14, our auditors actually made the observation that except for certain specific issues, the Town Council has actually complied with the Act, in terms of keeping proper accounts and books?",5,42,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00042
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"I have been reading the reports regarding the latest accounts. First, of course, it has to be noted that they were submitted very late, several months after they were meant to be submitted to the Ministry of National Development (MND). MND, in fact, issued a reply to queries on the matter, which I have read. The accounts are still qualified with disclaimers of opinion. They are qualified on several accounts.",1,43,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00043
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"First, I should note also that these are new auditors appointed by AHPETC. They have flagged eight different areas of concern involving non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements ─ eight areas where there was non-compliance. And these were fairly basic areas. They were not minor areas of infraction. There were still matters to do with related-party transactions, quite significant matters. There were lapses with regard to transfers to sinking funds, which is an extremely important matter for all Town Councils  failure to transfer monies to sinking funds when due is really putting the house at risk. The transfers that AHPETC made, according to its own auditors' report, were late. And as you will recall from the AGO's previous report, errors were discovered in the computations only after AGO's audit. So, there is something seriously wrong there.",2,44,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00044
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"There were also problems to do with the accounts themselves  problems to do with the opening balances; problems to do with determining the accuracy of the service and conservancy charges that were owed to the Town Council; problems to do with accounting for creditors and accrued expenses. So it is not something to be white-washed. When the house is structurally unsafe, one does not just go and put a new coat of paint on the front walls. I think it needs a very hard look. The foundations need to be put in place. It is hard work. But you have had a lot of time to do so.",3,45,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00045
2015-08-17-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Madam. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has not actually answered my questions whether he accepts that in the FY13/14 accounts which our auditors approved, that they have noted that out of the 13 disclaimers from the past, only three remained unresolved. So, I would like him to confirm whether he accepts that point.",1,46,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00046

2015-08-17-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Secondly, does he also accept that some of the areas which our auditors highlighted were actually carried over from the previous Council opening balance issues, for example? That is the second point.",3,48,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00048
2015-08-17-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The third point, also regarding the sinking fund transfers, I think it is public knowledge that the Town Council has still not received its operating S&CC grants for FY14 and FY15. So, is Deputy Prime Minister not aware of that as well?",4,49,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00049
2015-08-17-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Last of all, does the Deputy Prime Minister not accept what I put to him earlier that the auditors' opinion was that except for the specific observations, we have complied with the Act?",5,50,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00050
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"This is like saying that, except for the fact that the pillars of my house are in serious danger of collapsing, everything is fine. The examples that I have given of the areas that the auditor has qualified do strike me, as a Finance Minister, as being fairly serious examples. They are not minor infractions which you put a coat of paint over. They are very serious examples. So, I would, really, strongly advise not to get into the game of saying whether it is three or eight and so on, but to look into the substance of the matter. These are very serious issues, of failure to transfer monies to the sinking funds, being unable to account for your service and conservancy charges after a few years. They are very serious matters to be taken seriously by everyone up and down the line. I would strongly advise that.",1,51,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00051
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Second, on the matter of grants ─ was that what you asked about? Here, again, I have looked at MND's statement on the matter which I have in front of me. I am sorry to have go through it again, but I will have to take you through the key issues.",2,52,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00052
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"First, AHPETC had made a rather unusual request that the MND grants ─ which ought to be split, going by the normal rules and procedures, between the sinking fund and the operating fund ─ AHPETC made an unusual request for all the monies to go into the sinking fund. And MND, despite the unusualness of this request, said it was prepared to consider the suggestion and merely asked for some cash flow information to ensure that, if the MND does as requested, the delivery of essential services would not be compromised. That was an entirely reasonable request by MND. They are willing to entertain the suggestion you made, but they would like some information to make sure that delivery of essential services is not compromised.",3,53,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00053
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"AHPETC has not answered these questions. They are very reasonable questions, legitimate questions, and it has not answered these questions. And this is exactly the same thing as what happened in 2014.",4,54,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00054
2015-08-17-T-001,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"I think you will also know ─ and I do not have my materials in front of me ─ that what is owing from the operating fund to the sinking fund is actually a very substantial sum. Even if you take into account MND's grants ─ which MND is willing to discuss with you, and you have part of the MND grant that has to properly go into the sinking fund, and another part which goes into the operating fund -- the amount that is owed to the sinking fund from the operating fund would not be solved by MND grants. There is a more fundamental problem.",5,55,2015-08-17-T-001-S-00055

2015-08-17-T-002,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"Mdm Speaker, I just have three questions. Just now, the Minister said that there was documented proof for one claim. So, the AGO's Report is wrong, as the Minister was trying to say that there is actually one claim where there are no supporting documents. The second question is about sample size. There are about 1,800 GROs. Can the Minister share what is the sample size and how many were audited? The third question is about the adverse opinion that PA got due to the GRO accounts which were not cited, not presented or included into the PA accounts, and that was why the auditor gave it the adverse opinion. But the Minister said that there were no irregularities. How does the Minister know that, because the auditor has not seen the GRO accounts?",1,81,2015-08-17-T-002-S-00081
2015-08-17-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, first of all, let me correct the point brought up by Mr Png. It is that of the four claims, only one had supporting document; three did not at the point of claim. Subsequent to the observation by AGO, the CCC went back to the vendors to retrieve the evidence of payment. In other words, there was a lapse in the procedure, but they have rectified that by verifying the claims with the vendors.",1,82,2015-08-17-T-002-S-00082

2015-08-17-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Secondly, sample size. Mdm Speaker, PA has no decision over the sample size. In fact, all these are decided by the AGO. However, it is to the interest of PA to ensure that these lapses are isolated in some cases and not widespread across the whole organisation. The GRO accounts have been subjected to internal audits every year by public auditors appointed by PA. In other words, it is not that the accounts have not been audited all these years; it is not that it is being subjected to this sort of audit for the first time. So, I think it is important to highlight that we do not depend on AGO to audit our accounts. PA as a grassroots movement does its internal audits for all GROs all these years. And since 2012, we have consolidated all accounts into PA's accounts and subject the whole account for external auditing.",3,84,2015-08-17-T-002-S-00084
2015-08-17-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Thirdly, Mr Png asked about the adverse opinion and irregularity. It is important that Mr Png recognised what Deputy Prime Minister Tharman said earlier. There are two different types of audit. One is about auditing the accuracy, the reliability of your financial statements, of your accounting system. That is the function of an external audit conducted by the external auditor. The second type of auditing is about compliance, the compliance audit. For the grassroots organisations, as I had mentioned earlier, all our GRO accounts have been subjected to internal audits all these years. That is the reason why I say it with confidence that there was no irregularity at the system level.",4,85,2015-08-17-T-002-S-00085

For a large-scale disruption where bus bridging cannot be effectively implemented at all stations, a special bridging plan will be implemented to serve commuters living in major towns in the northern, western and eastern parts of Singapore. This will allow commuters in the city to travel via alternative MRT lines to key interchange stations such as Bishan, Paya Lebar and Buona Vista, and subsequently use the special bridging buses for onward travel to towns such as Ang Mo Kio, Woodlands, Tampines and Choa Chu Kang.

2015-08-17-T-003,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, may I ask the Senior Minister of State this  on the event in question on 7 July, the feedback given was that the stations were quite chaotic. Many of the commuters did not know what was happening and they did not know where to go or what bridging buses were provided. If indeed LTA has worked with the transport operators about how to manage a rail disruption again, then why was the situation not better managed? Having said that, would there be better management, better practices of similar kind of breakdowns? Would there also be contingency plans to better manage announcements as well as crowd control at the stations. At the end of the day, many commuters accept that trains, like all mechanical things, do break down. But they want to know, ""What do I do next as a commuter? Do I get stuck in the station?"" Or for commuters who are going to the MRT stations, they have to know, ""Do I even go there?"" How do we prevent people from going to the train stations when the system has broken down?",1,101,2015-08-17-T-003-S-00101
2015-08-17-T-003,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, indeed, the operators together with LTA do have Rail Incident Management Plans. But I think it is fair to say that for the incident that occurred on 7 July, the scale of it was not something that they planned adequately for. That is why the management of the incident fell short by commuters' standards. What we want to do is to improve on those contingency plans, whether it is in relation to the bus connections or other travel connections that the commuters really want. In terms of the information, it is an area still being looked into as well. Those areas are still being looked into as well. Whilst we are continuously looking into those areas, the contingency plans relating to the bus connections have been firmed up and they have been put in place.",1,102,2015-08-17-T-003-S-00102

As I have mentioned briefly earlier, while we have forwarded these investigations to be carried out to CAD, there are no issues with the centres in respect of safety as well as well-being of the children under their care. There are about 700 over children in the 11 centres and we are working very closely to make sure that the safety and the well-being of the children are not being compromised. On that end, the centres' operation can continue.",2,159,2015-08-17-T-005-S-00159

Why do we do that? We sent one MSF staff together with one ECDA staff to each centre - at least two staff at each centre and some, three staff, for bigger cohort - to ensure that other than looking at this CDA-related issue, we also have the ECDA staff who were there to look at the interests of the children, teachers and principals. I want to give you that assurance. The 20-plus colleagues from MSF and ECDA were there over three days, in the morning and in the evening time, to coincide with the timing when parents, grandparents or caregivers will send the children to school and fetch them home. The MSF and the ECDA staff have spent significant efforts to explain this very recent development to the parents, grandparents and the caregivers. We have also provided very comprehensive letters about the measures being taken and the touch point they can go to if they need any clarifications. That is one point. I wanted to stress a bit on the continuity of the service to assure the Members where the Sweetlands centres are in their ward.",3,160,2015-08-17-T-005-S-00160

2015-08-17-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"How do they do so? One important measure is that all the childcare centres are licensed by ECDA to ensure that the centres adequately meet the requirements in a few areas  the physical environment, safety (which I mentioned earlier); health, hygiene, nutrition, staff training, programme and curriculum as well as administration. So it is a very comprehensive licensing framework, and the licence tenure for a childcare centre can range from six months for those centres where we need to watch very closely. The tenure can be as short as six months or as long as 24 months. So these measures are in place. Really, I want to assure the Members – where Sweetlands centres are in your ward – that through all these measures, ECDA will certainly keep a close watch and ensure that the centres continue to provide quality care to the children in the school.",5,162,2015-08-17-T-005-S-00162

The matter is now with our Commercial Affairs Department. They are carrying out the investigation and I hope Members understand that we should let it take its course.

One of the issues was precisely one that the Member had raised – the number of elderly in the estate. A number of them may be living alone and, therefore, how best do we look out for their welfare. This is where I think there is a system approach from Government agencies and VWOs. But I believe that there is space for the community to play an active role. How do we reach out to find out who these old people are, how are they doing, what is their welfare like, are we able to organise amongst ourselves regular visits to check on them, or to visit them just to keep them company, and I think you can build up a network which actually will strengthen community ties but at the same time looking out for the elderly in our own community itself. And do you then fuse this in with the broader systems provided by VWOs and the agencies concerned? I think that is an area that we can look at as a model to develop not only just in a particular area, which is ageing, but across the island because this is a trend that will develop in Singapore in the not very distant future.",7,173,2015-08-17-T-006-S-00173

Elder abuse may be more common than is recognised, particularly amongst seniors with dementia or other cognitive impairments. Will the Minister agree that the barriers to recognising and reporting elder abuse should be addressed? One of them is the lack of a clear definition of elder abuse. Other barriers to reporting elder abuse include lack of knowledge, denial, fear of making the situation worse, desire to maintain family relationships, fear of ending up in court or a lack of belief that the situation will improve. Can I ask the Minister how does the Ministry plan to deal with these barriers? What are the Ministry's plans to increase the public's awareness of elder abuse, neglect and exploitation, and to educate people on detecting, intervening and responding to such cases?",1,181,2015-08-17-T-006-S-00181

As we all know, as more of us age, I think, like I said, it is important that we age well but there are vulnerabilities. For the reasons that she has cited, there are various barriers, which is why, as a whole, the community needs to play a part, so that between all of us, somewhere along the line, we ensure that no one falls between the gaps. Firstly, families, and I think one will be education, and we will want to step up more in terms of creating awareness amongst family members. And this is even amongst the elderly themselves to understand what represents neglect and what recourse is available to them.",1,183,2015-08-17-T-006-S-00183

And then you have the broader community, you have friends, neighbours, people who are in the community that you associate with, for example, medical healthcare workers will be one example. I am not sure whether we are at the stage where we want to make it mandatory but we can also make sure that they do understand what the symptoms are, what are the signs to look out for, and whether could they, in turn, trigger the process in terms of alerting the local SSOs, Family Service Centres, to be able to follow up on these cases. So, really, it takes the whole community.

2015-08-17-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"So I think raising awareness; education, that is something we need to do; strengthening the laws is important because the change of the laws will allow us to step in even when the barriers are there, meaning that where we deem that an individual's welfare is at stake, the laws will allow us to step in and intervene. But this is where I said, there is only so much that you can mandate, but I think there is a very big role for the community to play. If all of us begin to be aware of how we could contribute to that, I think we can actually bring down the numbers. Although the numbers may not be large but I think for the elderly who are affected by this, it is not just physically traumatic, I think it is emotionally very trying, especially when it comes from family members.

One, I am surprised that the numbers of 80 per year, in terms of complaints related to race and religions is quite low, considering the fact that many Singaporeans and especially among the minority communities, the Malay and Indian communities who have come up to raise concern that there is a discrimination that goes on. Does MOM think that this number is a little under-declared, or do you think that it is barrier for people to come forward to make reports?",1,222,2015-08-17-T-008-S-00222
2015-08-17-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Secondly, specific to the example given by the hon Member, Mr Zainal Sapari was that about the case of Ms Heidi Heng. That is one way in which it is very difficult to prove in the sense that you do not overtly put up the requirements but at the same time at the back end, when they found out she was a Chinese Muslim, but she meets the language criteria, not specific for this case but there are cases which we have heard of - how many of such cases have been reported? And out of the 80 cases that MOM receives a year, how many are actually found to be guilty and what form of recourse does MOM have with regard to race and religious discrimination by employers? Work Pass discrimination only works if you are dealing with the nationality-based discrimination, but for religious- and race-based discrimination, what is the recourse taken on such employers and how many of them are found guilty per year, for the last five years?",2,223,2015-08-17-T-008-S-00223

2015-08-17-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have also noted, the number of cases over the last five years have actually remained relatively stable, about 80. We encourage anyone who feels that they are victims of discriminatory workplace practices, to come forward and inform TAFEP, but when we talk about promotional and capability-building approach, we are also talking about educating the employers, the human resource (HR) practitioners, the supervisors in the companies not to inadvertently practise discrimination at the workplace.",2,225,2015-08-17-T-008-S-00225

As I have said, for the 80, less than 80 actually, cases that comes up to us, TAFEP will investigate every case and when there is no evidence, as you have noted, it is not easy. It is unlike other employment offences, it is actually not easy to prove discriminatory practices. And therefore, if TAFEP sees that there are gaps in HR practices, or gaps in some of the hiring practices, TAFEP will advise and share guidelines with these employers.",3,226,2015-08-17-T-008-S-00226

Where the pre-existing condition is less serious or can be managed safely with appropriate medication, schools will allow the student to participate in the overseas trip provided, amongst other things, they are satisfied that the activities conducted are appropriate for the student and there are adequate medical facilities available at the destination to manage and support the student's pre-existing condition.

The question is that there are probably some parents with children with pre-existing illnesses, but not of a very severe nature, who are agreeable to have their children participate in these overseas trips. But, there might be concern that if something does happen of a medical nature to their children, the policies purchased for them by the school, may not cover them for these illnesses. There are certainly do exist policies out there which do cover pre-existing illnesses admittedly for a premium but I do not think it is a prohibitive one. So, I would just like to ask again if the Ministry of Education would consider giving this option to the schools in question. With regard to the cost, I suppose is something that can be decided by the school or the parents or amongst both parties.",1,239,2015-08-17-T-009-S-00239
2015-08-17-T-009,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"Madam, as I have said in my reply, we leave it to the schools to decide on whether a student or a staff member is fit or good enough for certain types of overseas trips. Some overseas trips can be very physically challenging, but some may not be. So, students with certain pre-medical conditions may be allowed or encouraged to take part in some overseas trips which may not require too much physical exertion.",1,240,2015-08-17-T-009-S-00240

Of course, it is up to the individual families or staff members to decide on whether they want to take part in the activities, for which we do not disallow, or whether they want to buy an additional travel insurance coverage. So far, as far as I know, and this is only done from the end of last year, there is only one insurer that provides additional travel insurance coverage, which means that the demand for such additional travel insurance coverage for pre-existing medical condition, is relatively low.",2,241,2015-08-17-T-009-S-00241

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, globalisation has increased the transnational reach of organised criminal groups (OCGs). Advances in technology enable OCGs to operate with greater ease across national borders and reap substantial benefits. For example, in February 2015, Australian Police seized illegal drugs worth AUD$12 million from an international drug syndicate, and arrested Hong Kong and Canadian nationals. In 2013, Hong Kong Police arrested more than 1,800 people in a major crackdown on triads covering Hong Kong, Macau and parts of mainland China. They have been charged with offences such as illegal gambling and money laundering.",2,256,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00256

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, Singapore is one of the safest cities in the world but we are not immune to the threat of organised crime. Our law enforcement agencies have detected the work of organised syndicates behind some serious criminal offences such as drug-trafficking and unlicensed moneylending. A serious offence is a threat in its own right. But it poses an even greater threat to our safety and security when perpetrated by an organised crime syndicate. Such organised criminal groups are well-resourced and able to mount and sustain large-scale illegal activities over prolonged periods.",4,258,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00258
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Organised criminal groups often operate across jurisdictions. Their leaders mastermind and finance criminal activities from overseas to deliberately distance themselves from their henchmen who execute the actual crimes. Therefore, the highest echelons of organised criminal groups are often able to evade detection and arrest. Even when apprehended, it is more difficult to secure a conviction against them because of the structure of their organisations and their indirect link to the criminal acts.",5,259,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00259
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"So, we need laws that target the pernicious activities of these organised criminal groups, and those in their higher echelons. They are the ones who instruct and intimidate others into criminal acts, yet are most shielded from enforcement. That is why we need an Organised Crime Bill - to enhance our ability to disrupt the activities of OCGs at various levels of their hierarchy so as to prevent them from establishing a foothold to perpetrate serious crimes.",6,260,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00260
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"In developing the Bill, my Ministry has drawn reference from similar legislations in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, as well as the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC). My Ministry has also consulted the legal fraternity in Singapore and incorporated several of their suggestions.",7,261,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00261

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clause 2 of the Bill defines an ""OCG"" as a group that comprises at least three persons, however organised, which has as one of its objectives the obtaining of material or financial benefits from the facilitation or commission of any serious offence.",9,263,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00263
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"There are three key elements to this definition. First, the OCG must comprise at least three persons. The focus is on groups that pose an organised crime threat to Singapore. This approach is similar to the UNTOC and laws in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The Bill does not target ad-hoc groups that commit isolated crimes.",10,264,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00264
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Second, the purpose of forming the group must be to obtain a financial or other material benefit from the commission of serious offences. These serious offences comprise the third element and are listed in the First Schedule to the Bill. These are offences like murder, drug-trafficking and unlicensed moneylending under existing laws such as the Penal Code, the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Moneylenders Act.",11,265,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00265
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Part 2 of the Bill sets out the general offences relating to the activities of an OCG. The provisions under Part 2 allow our law enforcement agencies to tackle organised crime activities which threaten our safety and security, even if these acts are committed outside Singapore. I will now elaborate on the key clauses and will refer to them collectively as Part 2 offences.",12,266,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00266

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),Clause 6 criminalises the recruitment of members for an OCG. The penalties for this offence are enhanced if the person recruited is a vulnerable person or a person who is below 21 years of age.,15,269,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00269
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clause 7 makes it an offence to instruct a person to commit a Part 2 offence or any other offence for an OCG. This targets the masterminds and leaders, who wield significant influence, control the finances, make key decisions, and instruct others to execute the criminal activities. Our intent is to punish the person who instructs the commission of offence for the OCG, that is, the ""brains"" of the operation, more severely than the person who carries it out.",16,270,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00270
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clauses 8 and 9 make it an offence to provide or procure aid to commit a Part 2 offence or any other offence for an OCG. Clauses 10 and 11 respectively make it an offence to allow organised criminal groups to use one's premises to conduct illegal activities, and for any person to deal with the illicit property of OCGs. The aim is to deprive these groups of resources. The penalties for these offences in relation to an individual are imprisonment for up to five years, or a fine of up to $250,000, or both.",17,271,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00271
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clause 12 makes it an offence to facilitate the commission of Part 2 offences or serious offences for OCGs and the penalties in relation to an individual are imprisonment for up to five years, a fine of up to $100,000, or both.",18,272,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00272
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),Clause 13 empowers a court to impose enhanced penalties for the commission of any offence if the offence is committed at the direction of or for an OCG. The Bill doubles the maximum fines associated with the offence; and the maximum imprisonment term will be increased by two or five years.,19,273,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00273
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, let me now turn to the Powers and Orders that can be issued on a conviction or non-Conviction basis",20,274,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00274
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Mdm Speaker, our enforcement agencies always seek to prosecute criminals in court and secure a conviction. Where appropriate, upon such criminal conviction, the sentencing court can also order the confiscation of benefits of crime under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA).",21,275,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00275
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"However, criminals in the upper echelons of OCGs often create many layers and elaborate structures to distance themselves from the criminal acts. Hence, it is not always possible to prosecute such criminals and secure a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. To effectively disrupt the activities of an OCG, and deny such criminals their ill-gotten gains, we need other levers.",22,276,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00276
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"This Bill will therefore provide for the issuance of Preventive Orders and a civil confiscation regime. Applications for some of these Orders and for civil confiscation will be heard in civil proceedings, which are separate and independent of any criminal proceedings. This means that the application can still proceed even if the person has not been charged or has been acquitted. These Orders can also be made against a person who has committed a serious offence associated with an OCG before this Bill comes into force.",23,277,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00277

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Mdm Speaker, the Bill provides for the Courts to issue three Preventive Orders - the Organised Crime Prevention Order, the Financial Reporting Order and the Disqualification Order. These Orders aim to safeguard law and order and protect the public by preventing, restricting or disrupting the involvement of persons in organised crime.",25,279,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00279
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clause 15 provides for an Organised Crime Prevention Order which can be made to restrict a person's activities whether or not he is convicted, that is, on a conviction or non-conviction basis. These include restrictions on the premises to which a person may have access, and how he may associate with others. Before an Order is issued, the Court must first be satisfied that the person has been involved in a Part 2 offence or a serious offence associated with an OCG; and second, have reasonable grounds to believe that the Order would protect the public by preventing, restricting or disrupting any involvement of the person in such offences.",26,280,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00280
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),Clause 17 specifies that an Organised Crime Prevention Order can be in effect for up to five years. Clause 19 provides for such persons to be monitored by means of an electronic device.,27,281,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00281
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),Clause 21 provides for the Court to issue a Financial Reporting Order requiring a person to furnish financial reports as required.

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"The Organised Crime Prevention Order and the Financial Reporting Order are subject to a number of important safeguards. All applications have to be made by the Public Prosecutor. Applications that are made on a non-conviction basis must be heard by the High Court. The subject will have the opportunity to be heard before an Order is made. In addition, third parties can make representations or appeals against the making, varying or discharging of an Order.",30,284,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00284
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Finally, the Disqualification Order, which can be issued only on a conviction basis, serves to prevent the person from acting as a company director or taking part in the management of a company.

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Mdm Speaker, it is widely acknowledged that the primary motive for organised crime is financial gain.

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"To effectively deal with organised crime, we must be able to deprive these criminals of their ill-gotten gains.

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"This civil confiscation regime is similar to the conviction-based regime for the confiscation of criminal benefits under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA). The main difference is that a confiscation order may be obtained under the Bill by proving, on a civil standard of proof, that is, on a balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt, that a person has carried out organised crime activities.",36,290,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00290
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"The proposed civil confiscation regime is not unique to Singapore.

This Bill confines our civil confiscation regime to organised crime.",37,291,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00291
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"The main provisions of the civil confiscation regime are largely similar to those in the CDSA, with changes made for a non-conviction based model of confiscation, and the introduction of additional safeguards.",38,292,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00292
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clause 61 provides for the Public Prosecutor (PP) to apply to the High Court for a confiscation order.

First, all applications have to be made by the Public Prosecutor, and heard in the High Court. There is also a provision for appeals to be made to the Court of Appeal. Second, there is a statutory limitation period to the civil confiscation regime. The Public Prosecutor must commence civil confiscation proceedings within seven years of the subject carrying out the organised crime activity. Third, the Bill protects the rights of innocent third parties. In addition, the High Court has the power to provide relief from confiscation, if it is assessed that the confiscation would result in undue hardship to the subject or third parties.",44,298,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00298

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Mdm Speaker, the Organised Crime Bill targets organised criminal groups because they pose a significant threat to our safety and security, with their capacity and resources to commit crime on a larger scale and on a sustained basis.

It will allow our law enforcement agencies to tackle organised crime threats decisively by strengthening their powers to detect and investigate s, disrupt and curb their activities, dismantle their organisation and deprive them of their ill-gotten gains.",46,300,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00300

2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, I rise to support the Bill. The Bill boosts our abilities to clamp down on and sanction individuals involved in organised criminal groups. It introduces a wide range of organised crime offences under Part 2. In particular, the Bill significantly enhances punishments under section 7 and section 13 and creates new offences.",1,304,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00304
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Under section 7, a person who instructs another person to commit an offence for an organised criminal group will face the punishment prescribed for that offence and more. Where the offence is committed in consequence of his instruction, the instructor can be fined up to four times the maximum fine prescribed for that offence and have an additional 10 years tacked onto the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed for that offence. And under section 13, a person who commits an offence will be subject to an enhanced punishment regime where it can be proved that the offence was committed for an organised criminal group. Such a person can be fined up to twice the maximum fine prescribed for that offence and have a further five years added to his prison sentence. These enhancements are significant and will help the police clamp down on organised criminal groups.",2,305,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00305
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"When I first mentioned this Bill with some friends last week, their immediate reaction was  is the mafia or are the triads operating in Singapore? I hope the Minister will share the relevant statistics/facts, and elaborate on the particular types of organised criminal groups that the Ministry is concerned with and intends to target. He mentioned moneylending in his speech. Could he give us other examples? This would give us a better understanding and appreciation of the Bill and its purpose.",3,306,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00306
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My next point is one for clarification. The Bill defines a ""locally-linked organised criminal group"" as ""a group that has its only purpose, or one of its purposes, the obtaining of a financial or other material benefit from the commission by or the facilitation of the commission by, any person of any serious offence"". The purpose of the group is, therefore, key to its characterisation as an organised criminal group, and is an important element in establishing the offence. But how does one establish a ""purpose"" in relation to the serious offence? Let us take, for example, a group of youth who, out of folly, perhaps may steal a motor vehicle. This is a serious offence under the Bill's Schedule. How will it be ascertained whether the requisite purpose is present such that the gang constitutes an organised criminal group?",4,307,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00307
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),Page  35,5,308,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00308
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I would like to ask the Minister  what evidence will be looked at to determine what the purpose of a group is, especially if the group is based overseas? This is important because all the sanctions in the Bill - Part 2 offences, Organised Crime Prevention Orders, Financial Reporting Orders, Confiscation Orders, all of them - are predicated upon a person belonging to, acting for or being involved with an organised criminal group. And while the issue of whether a group is an organised criminal group may sometimes be clear, some cases will fall in a grey area. This has implications on whether the enhanced penalties under section 13 and attendant sanctions on the group's members will apply.",6,309,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00309
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My next point has to do with Organised Crime Prevention Orders (OCPOs) and Financial Reporting Orders (FROs). These orders may be issued under a conviction regime or by the High Court under a non-conviction regime. In other words, no criminal offence has been found or found by the court. The court is given a very wide mandate to impose restrictions under an OCPO. An OCPO may contain ""such prohibitions, restrictions or requirements"" and ""such other terms"" as the court considers appropriate for the purpose of protecting the public by preventing, restricting or disrupting any involvement by the person in any Part 2 offence or any serious offence associated with an organised criminal group. Indeed, section 16 gives an open-ended list of restrictions that may be imposed, and these include restrictions on an individual's travel within and out of Singapore, means of communication as well as his access and use of any premises or items. Section 19 even provides for electronic monitoring of an individual subject to an OCPO.",7,310,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00310
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The same threshold of ""protecting the public"" applies for FROs, which require individuals to make financial reports setting out particulars of their financial affairs. Significantly, while both OCPOs and FROs must not be in force for longer than five years, it appears that both orders can be renewed indefinitely by the court.",8,311,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00311
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"It is indisputable that OCPOs and FROs must have a broad scope if they are to be effective in crippling the activities of organised criminal groups. The trade-off is that the power to order OCPOs and FROs may be exercised in an oppressive or abusive manner. In this regard, I have two questions for the Minister.",9,312,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00312
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, there is a higher chance that a mistake may be made under a non-conviction regime because of the lower standard of proof  proof on a balance of probabilities as opposed to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. What safeguards are in place to minimise the chances of OCPOs and FROs being unduly issued?",10,313,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00313
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, how will the threshold of ""protecting the public"" be satisfied? What must be shown apart from the fact that the individual has been involved in Part 2 offence or an offence associated with an organised criminal group? This has a direct bearing on how liberally orders for OCPOs and FROs will be made.",11,314,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00314

2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"To conclude, the Bill gives us more tools to attack and dismantle organised criminal groups, and ensure that they and their sympathisers do not benefit from the proceeds of crime. We will be able to intervene and disrupt all stages of the group's operations, from the initial stages of recruitment and the instruction of others, to the later stages where offences are committed and the group profits from their criminal acts. And where individuals pose a particular risk, we can restrict and monitor them via OCPOs and FROs.",13,316,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00316
2015-08-17-T-011,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But it is precisely because the Bill contains such formidable provisions that we have to be careful that powers under it are exercised prudently and only when the circumstances warrant it. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.",14,317,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00317
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill. It is aimed at combating organised crime by equipping our law enforcement agencies with the weapons to pre-empt organised crime activities, pursue their leadership who may be based overseas and deprive them of their ill-gotten gains.",1,318,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00318
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"There is increasing evidence that organised crime groups here are expanding their links with overseas syndicates, not only are their networks expanding, their range of criminal activities is also diversifying, resulting in a larger, more complex mix of threats at our very doorsteps. Currently, we may feel that organised crime here is under control, albeit still extant. This may lead to some questioning why we should pass this Bill. But it is precisely because we need to disrupt and stultify the spread of organised crime before it becomes entrenched, before it grows to a point where organised crime threatens public safety and economic stability, that we need this Bill now.",2,319,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00319
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"I have, however, two queries on this Bill. The first concerns the criteria our Home Team will apply to determine the extra-territorial coverage to tackle transnational organised crime.",3,320,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00320
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Under the Bill, this requires a tight nexus between the offence in question and the resultant harm to Singapore. The rationale for this nexus requirement is not to overtax our Home Team's resources in requiring them to assist the international community to tackle cases with little or no impact in Singapore.",4,321,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00321
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"I do not question the logic of this. However, I worry that we draw the line too tightly around what offences have an effect in Singapore. This may affect the cooperation that we need of foreign law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate and apprehend the leaders and key members of syndicates who may be located overseas. This is indeed the challenge of combating international criminal networks.",5,322,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00322
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Most foreign law enforcement agencies work on the principle of mutuality where they will render assistance to another country's police force, who would do likewise for them. Thus, if out of concern for husbanding our Home Team resources, we define offences which have an effect in Singapore too narrowly, we risk losing the very cooperation internationally that is essential to combat transnational crime syndicates.",6,323,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00323
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),Could the Minister address this concern and clarify how he will balance with competing aims of not over-exerting our Home Team's resources on one hand with the ready provision of assistance before law and enforcement agencies necessary to secure their mutual cooperation?,7,324,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00324

2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"The second concern I have relates to the civil confiscation process which reverses the burden of proof on a subject to prove the legitimacy of his property. In other words, any property which is disproportionate to the subject's known sources of income and which he cannot explain to the court's satisfaction is presumed to be the benefits of organised crime. This reversal of the burden of proof is similar to that under the Corruption Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA).",9,326,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00326
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"However, the CDSA is directed at those convicted of corruption, drug trafficking or other serious offences. In other words, a conviction is necessary before the civil confiscation process with its reversal of the burden of proof, is triggered.",10,327,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00327
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Under this Bill, the subject of this confiscation process need not have been convicted of a criminal offence under the Bill. Indeed, he may have been tried for an offence under the Bill and even acquitted. To then subject him to the reversal of the burden of proof, where the subject has to justify and explain all his property or otherwise have it presumed that they represent the proceeds of organised crime, can work a severe injustice if he is truly innocent.",11,328,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00328
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"After all, to be presumed innocent until proven guilty is still a fundamental tenet of criminal justice. To presume the subject's property to be the proceeds of organised crime where he has not been convicted or even charged and then acquitted would, in my view, undermine that fundamental principle.",12,329,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00329
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Let me make clear that I entirely support that our agencies should have the ability to take civil confiscation proceedings against any subject, even if he has not been convicted of any offence. And I take full note of what the Minister has said that with the upper echelons of organised crime syndicates, they may be at several removes to the actual members who commit the crimes. But it is the reversal of the burden of proof in a situation where no conviction is obtained that I feel gives rise to the potential for injustice.",13,330,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00330
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Could the Minister clarify how the risk of such injustice could be reduced, if not eliminated? Could the reversal of the burden of proof only apply when the subject has been convicted of an offence under this Bill or, at least, of a similar offence overseas? Or could the risk be addressed by prosecutorial guidelines which should be publicised, which set out clearly when civil confiscation proceedings could be initiated against subjects who have not been convicted or even acquitted, of offences under the Bill?",14,331,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00331
2015-08-17-T-011,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"This is important as, while we all want to make Singapore free of organised crime, we do need to respect the rights of individuals who may be accused or suspected but not yet convicted of organised crime offences.

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, as the Clerk distributes the handout, I want to thank Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Alvin Yeo for supporting the Bill and also for the queries that they have raised. The issues they have raised fall into a few broad areas  three, in particular. First, of the need for the Organised Crime Bill; second, how the Bill will be used to tackle organised crime more effectively; and, finally, the safeguards, especially for some of the provisions pertaining to civil confiscation. I will address each in turn.",1,337,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00337
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, both Members have agreed with the need for the Bill and I welcome their support. Organised crime groups are a menace and pose a serious threat to our safety and security. And they have the resources to commit serious crimes on a large scale and for prolonged periods. They structure themselves to evade law enforcement, especially at the higher echelons, by having layers and elaborate structures, each with discrete and separate functions.",2,338,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00338
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"While overall crime, and organised crime in particular, in Singapore is generally under control, we must ensure that we have the necessary powers to effectively address the threat of organised crime should the need arise. This is especially important as OCGs will evolve with globalisation and advances in technology. They will find new ways to perpetrate crime and evade the law. This Bill will strengthen significantly our ability to prevent organised crime from taking root in Singapore.",3,339,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00339
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Mr Hri Kumar asked about the types of OCGs and organised crime activities that we are concerned about. Our law enforcement agencies' greatest concerns today lie with the involvement of OCGs in crimes such as drug trafficking and unlicensed money lending (UML).,4,340,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00340
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I would like to explain this further using the illustration in the handout. The handout describes the typical structure of a drug trafficking group, and it is based on actual cases that the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has dealt with. The graphic shows the complex and layered nature of the OCG. The OCG's activities are initiated and coordinated by the mastermind, OCG Leader X, who is located overseas − the large big circle, you cannot miss him and he looks fairly sinister. He takes orders for drugs from his partners in Singapore, and instructs drug supply syndicates and courier coordinators to deliver drugs to these partners. Once brought into Singapore by couriers, the drugs pass through multiple hands, channels and layers before being sold to drug abusers. The illicit proceeds from the drug trafficking activities flow back to OCG Leader X and further finance the illegal activities of the OCG. The arrows in green give you the flow of funds.",5,341,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00341
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Currently, CNB can take action under the Misuse of Drugs Act against persons in the lower rungs of the OCG, such as the runners and street-level traffickers. These are the persons in the bottom two layers of the OCG. With the OCB, such persons can be subject to enhanced penalties for committing these offences for an organised criminal group.",6,342,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00342
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"However, the organised criminal group will be able to easily regroup by replacing these lower level operatives by recruiting more persons to perform such roles and continue their operations. To be effective, we need to take action against persons higher up in the hierarchy.",7,343,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00343

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The persons in the middle tiers of the organised criminal group – A, B and C – are OCG Leader X's partners in Singapore. In most cases, CNB is able to arrest and charge such persons under current laws.",9,345,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00345
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Under the Bill, the local partners will also be liable for new offences such as instructing the commission of an offence for an organised criminal group and recruiting members for an organised criminal group , that is, Part 2 offences. And if convicted, they will face higher penalties under the Bill.",10,346,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00346
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To tackle such organised criminal groups, this Bill provides additional levers beyond criminal sentences. The Public Prosecutor (PP) can apply for an Organised Crime Prevention Order (OCPO) to restrict the activities of persons A to C, for example, by placing restrictions on the premises to which they have access to, and the manner in which they may associate with other persons. This will curtail their involvement in the organised criminal group's activities.",11,347,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00347
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,The Public Prosecutor can also apply for a Financial Reporting Order (FRO) to require them to furnish financial reports to CNB. This will allow CNB to trace and track their finances.,12,348,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00348
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, the Bill will allow us to deal more effectively with the mastermind, the OCG Leader X. These leaders, like X, usually operate from overseas and they would create many layers and structures to distance themselves from the actual drug trafficking activities and ensure that they do not personally handle the drugs. This makes it difficult to secure a drug trafficking conviction against them.",13,349,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00349
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"With the new offences created under this Bill, OCG Leader X will be liable for criminal offences such as instructing the commission of an offence for an organised criminal group and recruiting members for the same group.",14,350,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00350
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In addition, the benefits he derives from his criminal activities can be subject to the civil confiscation regime.

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I hope this example illustrates to Members, somewhat more vividly, how an organised criminal group can pose a greater threat to Singapore's safety and security, even if they are not similar to the traditional notions of mafia or triads that Mr Hri Kumar has referred to.",16,352,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00352
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Hri Kumar has also asked for relevant statistics regarding organised crime. As I have mentioned earlier, and Members have acknowledged, our overall organised crime situation is generally under control. Nevertheless, in the area of drugs, between 2012 and 2014, CNB seized almost $47 million worth of drugs, and broke up over 60 drug syndicates. Many of these syndicates are small-scale operations in Singapore without elaborate structures, similar to the local networks of Persons A, B and C in the illustration.",17,353,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00353
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"However, in some of these cases, there are suspected links between these syndicates and transnational organised criminal elements, in other words, the activities go beyond our borders and are part of a larger structure.",18,354,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00354

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,We must also be prepared for the emergence of new types of organised crimes and modalities that can threaten Singapore's safety and security.,20,356,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00356
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Hri Kumar asked about the evidence that will be used to determine whether the purpose of a group is to obtain a financial or other material benefit from the commission by or the facilitation of the commission by, any person of any serious offence.",21,357,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00357
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, the purpose of the group can be established through its activities, for example, whether the plans and preparations of the organised criminal group are focused on financial gain, how the serious crime is executed, and how the group deals with the proceeds of the crime. In doing so, our law enforcement agencies will rely on evidence such as the communications between the members of the organised criminal group, statements recorded from witnesses and organised criminal group members, any instruments of crime seized, and the conduct of the members of the organised criminal group in relation to the offence.",22,358,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00358
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, in Mr Hri Kumar's example of a gang of foolish youths stealing a motor vehicle, if, in fact, the gang steals the vehicle and discards the vehicle thereafter and, it is an isolated case, the Penal Code would be the most appropriate lever with which to deal with this sort of criminal act. Let me also emphasise that the focus of this Bill is on organised criminal groups that commit serious offences on a sustained basis. The Bill does not target ad hoc groups that commit isolated crimes.",23,359,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00359
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Let me also take this opportunity to address Mr Alvin Yeo's question on the extra-territorial nature of offences created under the Bill. I acknowledge Mr Yeo's point that it is important for Singapore to be able to provide assistance to other countries in the area of organised crime as part of the international collaboration and cooperation that we have with overseas law enforcement agencies. However, the most important consideration, in deciding on the scope and coverage of new offences in the context of Singapore, is to criminalise the activities that are of greatest concern to Singapore. And this is the principle which has guided the manner in which we have drafted this Bill.",24,360,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00360
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I want to assure the Member that this Bill, and the way it is drafted, will not impinge on our ability to render assistance to foreign law enforcement agencies when warranted by the situation. For example, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA) allows for mutual legal assistance to be provided for a wide range of offences and that is the basis on which our law enforcement agencies have been cooperating with their international counterparts.",25,361,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00361
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Alvin Yeo have asked about the safeguards to ensure that the OCPO, FRO and civil confiscation orders, which can be sought through civil proceedings, requiring a lower standard of proof as compared to a criminal conviction, are used only in appropriate cases. I think these are valid points. I explained earlier some of the safeguards and I wish to reiterate them.",26,362,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00362
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, let me first say that the overall safeguards that the Bill provides for before an OCPO, FRO or civil confiscation order can be issued in civil proceedings. First, law enforcement agencies will investigate and build the case against suspected organised criminals. Their priority is to prosecute the criminals in court as far as possible, in other words, to secure a criminal conviction. The decision to apply for one of the orders or for a civil confiscation order, in the absence of a conviction, is made separately by the Public Prosecutor. So, there is a separation between the law enforcement agency that does the investigation and gathers the evidence and the Public Prosecutor who makes the final assessment on whether such orders are to be applied for.",27,363,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00363

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Second, these proceedings must be heard in the High Court, where the Public Prosecutor has to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the defendant has been involved in a Part 2 offence, or a serious offence associated with an organised criminal group. The defendant will have the opportunity to defend himself, and he can avail himself of the same defences available if he had been subject to a criminal prosecution. The OCPO/FRO or confiscation order will be issued only if the High Court is satisfied with the merits of the case. There is also provision for appeals to the Court of Appeal.",29,365,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00365
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Let me now also address specific queries raised by Members. Mr Hri Kumar asked about the threshold of ""protecting"" the public  how the threshold of ""protecting"" the public will be satisfied before the OCPO/FRO is issued. This would involve the assessment of risk, that the person is still likely to be involved in organised crime activities without the Order.",30,366,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00366
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mdm Speaker, in deciding on the issuance of the Orders, the Court would have to balance the public benefit that the Orders would bring, in terms of greater security and safety, against the restriction and requirements that would be imposed on the person. In other words, the application for or issuing of the order must be commensurate with the risk of the subject getting involved in organised crime activity without the Orders. So, the law enforcement agencies and the Public Prosecutor would have to make an assessment of that risk and persuade the Court of that assessment before the Orders can be issued.",31,367,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00367
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Let me also respond to Mr Hri Kumar's query on whether both Orders can be renewed indefinitely. This is not the case because if the law enforcement agencies see the need for a new order upon the expiry of the previous order, they would have to approach the Public Prosecutor to make a fresh application to the High Court, and it would be subject to the same risk assessment and test before the Court.",32,368,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00368
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Alvin Yeo also asked about the civil confiscation provisions which reverse the burden of proof, onto a subject to prove the legitimacy of his property. As Mr Yeo has pointed out, this approach is similar to that we have used in the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA). And the civil confiscation regimes in New Zealand and Australia similarly put the onus on the subject of a civil confiscation proceeding to establish that his property is derived from lawful activity.",33,369,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00369
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Let me also reassure the Member that the civil confiscation regime will used judiciously against organised group criminals. The Public Prosecutor is required to first prove to the High Court on a balance of probabilities that the subject has carried out organised crime activity within the statutory period of seven years. A confiscation order is therefore not made simply on the grounds that the defendant cannot explain the origins of his wealth. We first have to establish the predicate offence on the balance of probabilities.,34,370,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00370
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"It is fair to place the burden of proof, we believe, on the subject to prove the legitimacy of his property thereafter. After all, he is in the best position to explain how he derived those assets, and these are also matters which are specifically within the subject's knowledge, and which will be difficult for anyone else to prove. The subject will have the opportunity to show that his assets which are disproportionate to his known sources of income are not ill-gotten.",35,371,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00371

2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I want to emphasise that such provisions are not unique to Singapore. The preventive orders are closely modelled after the UK's Serious Crime Prevention Order and Financial Reporting Order. Countries like New Zealand, Australia and the UK also have civil confiscation regimes. In fact, these countries allow the use of such powers even against persons who commit serious offences without any organised crime influence. The experiences of these countries have shown that such tools are effective and necessary to prevent and disrupt organised crime. Having said that, I want to assure Members that the powers embedded in this Bill will be exercised judiciously with the strong set of safeguards that I have elaborated on.",37,373,2015-08-17-T-011-S-00373
2015-08-17-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, let me conclude by emphasising the considerable harm that organised crime activities can cause to Singapore's safety and security. We therefore need law enforcement levers that can aid the fight against organised crime. And this is why we have studied the laws in other jurisdictions to develop the Bill, which is scoped to target the threats posed to Singapore by organised criminal groups. I urge Members to give your full support to the Bill, so that our law enforcement agencies will have the necessary powers and tools to tackle the scourge of organised criminal groups and continue keeping Singapore safe and secure.

I think we can make reference to the Asian Development Bank. The Asian Development Bank was established in 1966, with Singapore as one of its founding members. From 1967 till now, Singapore-based companies have obtained US$1.35 billion in project funding. Amongst these, funding for 2,384 projects was disbursed to contractors and suppliers, while funding for 311 projects went to Singapore consulting firms. As of 31 December 2014, Singapore has contributed US$523 million to the Asian Development Bank in terms of capital subscription and funding, and in turn received US$1.35 billion worth of contracts.

In the area of infrastructural development, government-linked companies are in the forefront, and have a very credible track record. In bidding for AIIB projects, they have a higher success rate compared to the SMEs.

In economic terms, the AIIB is a timely venture. While the Asia-Pacific has been growing tremendously over the last 20 years, there are still a lot of infrastructure investments needed in many parts of Asia.",2,436,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00436
2015-08-17-T-012,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"The demand for such financing – both to develop basic infrastructure within countries, as well as to deepen linkages across countries in the region – remains massive. A recent ADB report cited the need for up to 8 trillion dollars of investment in infrastructure in Asia over the years 2010 through 2020. The AIIB can help to fulfil this demand. Through our proposed participation, Singapore can play its role in fostering the development and integration, in raising living standards for millions of people as well as in promoting greater economic integration for Asia as a whole.",3,437,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00437

If properly executed and coordinated, such investments in infrastructure would provide a boost to industrial productivity and hence economic growth in the region. Singapore also stands to benefit directly. From my own perspective from the financial sector, I know that investment banks or commercial banks cover Indo-China out of their Singapore offices. So, when demand for financial services grows in Indo-China, Singapore will benefit more than other competing financial hubs.",5,439,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00439

2015-08-17-T-012,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Amidst concerns about the geopolitical uncertainties that a newly assertive China may bring, it is important to recognise that closer economic integration in Asia will be pivotal for advancing and preserving political stability in the region. The AIIB can be a platform that makes such closer, tighter economic integration possible. By bringing together key regional players as joint economic stakeholders, the AIIB can bring into focus the common interest that all nations have in avoiding conflict and preserving regional peace. The goal of releasing the full economic potential of Asia can then take centre-stage. To draw a parallel, the experience of our continual engagement with Myanmar over the long term provides an example of how the objective of economic development and cooperation can be a positive force towards fostering political stability.",7,441,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00441
2015-08-17-T-012,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),The economic and political reasons I have highlighted are important enough that Singapore – despite our small size – should take an active interest in the AIIB initiative.

Why has this been the case? One natural concern is that the AIIB will become a competitor to other international financial institutions, especially the Asian Development Bank. More importantly, there are also concerns that the AIIB will come to be seen as a vehicle for advancing the national interests of its largest shareholders, specifically China.",9,443,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00443
2015-08-17-T-012,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"It is, of course, much too early to pass such judgement on the AIIB. But as a founding member with a seat at the table, I would urge that we be cognizant of such potential criticism, and instead work towards ensuring that the AIIB achieves its vision of becoming of a modern and truly participatory international development bank. Our proposed commitment of $250 million will represent only a quarter of a percent of the total capital stock of $100 billion of the AIIB, so we will always look like small players in the big picture of things. But I would submit that there are nevertheless unique opportunities for Singapore to play a responsible role, even in these early stages where the institutional structures of the AIIB are being laid out.",10,444,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00444

This is important not just from the perspective of cost-benefit analysis, but also for ensuring that infrastructure projects that are financed take the long view to be environmentally safe and sustainable, and are not just pushed forward for the sake of quick growth at all costs.",12,446,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00446
2015-08-17-T-012,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Similarly, our credibility in forging clean and efficient institutions will be valuable, and may give us a say in how the corporate governance structures of the AIIB are formulated. Our hard-earned reputation as an honest broker on the international stage can also be leveraged, to help ensure that the portfolio of projects that the AIIB finances will be truly diversified and representative, and not be seen as advancing the narrow interests of one or two dominant shareholders.",13,447,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00447
2015-08-17-T-012,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"These are early days, of course, in the formation of the AIIB. But I would urge that the Ministry give thought to how our views and interests can be most effectively articulated as the founding member countries discuss the shape of this new institution. This is to ensure that the directions the AIIB takes will indeed be to the broad benefit of all of Asia, while also being consistent with Singapore's own national interests.",14,448,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00448
2015-08-17-T-012,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"In sum, I support our participation in the proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The ambition and scale of this project has the potential to promote economic development and closer trade ties across Asia for many years to come. Singapore and Singaporean companies need to be alive to the opportunities that this may bring. At the same time, our participation in this project sends an important signal of Singapore's willingness to be a constructive global citizen, and is another step towards safeguarding our relevance as a small country that holds its own in the international arena.",15,449,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00449
2015-08-17-T-012,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"As with any significant multilateral initiative, the devil will be in the details. There, I urge that due diligence and effort be exercised to ensure that the ultimate shape the AIIB takes will be truly participatory and motivated by shared economic interests, and that the AIIB will indeed mature to be an institution that is in its own stated aims, ""lean, clean, and green"". With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.",16,450,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00450
2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, let me first thank Mrs Lina Chiam, Mr Thomas Chua and Mr Ong Teng Koon for their support of the Bill. They have made good points which I agree with. As a small, open economy, Singapore's economic prospects are tied closely to those of the region and the world, and in particular, infrastructure development plays a critical role in unlocking Asia's economic potential by strengthening the region's facilities and improving regional connectivity -- all of which will benefit Singapore as a hub for trade and businesses.",1,451,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00451
2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"International financial institutions like the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the AIIB, complement the financial and knowledge resources of governments and the private sector. In particular, they bring a high level of expertise in project design and structuring, which individual governments may not have, particularly those that are still dealing with developing economies. By working with governments, these international institutions also help to reduce risks in large scale infrastructure projects, help to make them bankable, and draw in private sector financing. The AIIB will better position Asia to meet its infrastructure and connectivity needs thereby promoting greater regional integration.",2,452,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00452

2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As Mr Thomas Chua and Mr Ong Teng Koon have pointed out, Singapore-based companies and financial institutions stand to benefit from partnerships with the AIIB and its member countries, especially given Singapore's expertise in infrastructure development, as well as urban governance and planning.",4,454,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00454
2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Thomas Chua also made a good point that Singapore companies, both Temasek-linked companies and SMEs, should work together to bid for projects at the AIIB and other international financial institutions. The Government supports such partnerships. For example, we introduced the Partnerships for Capability Transformation initiative which promotes collaborative projects between large organisations and local SMEs to facilitate knowledge-transfer, capability-building and the co-creation of innovative solutions.",5,455,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00455
2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"More importantly, we will continue to support our SMEs' internationalisation efforts to expand their reach and build scale. To this end, in Budget 2015, the Government made several enhancements to the internationalisation programmes available to Singapore companies. For example, we raised the support level for SMEs under IE Singapore's grant schemes from 50% to 70% for three years. We also setup Clifford Capital to provide financing and catalyse more business opportunities for Singapore-based companies venturing into cross-border infrastructure projects. SMEs can tap these initiatives as they look for project opportunities in the region and beyond.",6,456,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00456
2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Related to this, Mr Thomas Chua highlighted the need to improve communications between the Government and the business community on opportunities in the region. We agree with that.",7,457,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00457
2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Government currently works with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to establish platforms that connect stakeholders involved in Asian infrastructure projects to share experiences and business opportunities in this sector. We will do the same with the AIIB. For example, IE Singapore organises the Asia Singapore Infrastructure Round Table for Government officials and businesses to discuss to the development and financing of specific infrastructure projects. Since its inauguration in 2013, the Round Table has attracted more than 600 industry practitioners with over US$6,000,000 worth of projects discussed.",8,458,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00458
2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Let me now move on to the point highlighted by Mr Ong Teng Koon, that despite our relatively small shareholding in the AIIB, Singapore should play a constructive role in shaping the AIIB to be an open, inclusive and modern institution.",9,459,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00459
2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I agree with Mr Ong's views, and indeed that is the stance that Singapore has been taking. From the onset, the Government has taken a proactive approach in shaping the development of the AIIB, by contributing our ideas and contributing our experiences. We have participated actively in the negotiations, and worked with other prospective founding members to establish a strong governance structure and high-operating standards for the AIIB. Discussions on the bank's operational and financial policies are still underway and we will continue our efforts to ensure that the AIIB is established as a well-respected institution of high standards that complements existing multi-lateral development banks. I think this is also a concern which Mrs Lina Chiam voiced. In fact, the AIIB has the advantage of building on the experiences of the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank to establish itself as a strong institution.",10,460,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00460

2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Let me wrap up by addressing some of the concerns raised by Mrs Lina Chiam regarding immunities and privileges. On this point, I should remind Members and emphasise that while Singapore was one of the first countries to give its support as a founding member, there are by now 57 countries that have come on board the AIIB. Fifty of these have already signed the articles of agreement. These countries include Australia and the United Kingdom. So, we are in good company, and in fact in Singapore, we set a rather high bar for international organisations operating here and also it is not every day that a new international organisation like the AIIB is set up. We take, for example, the World Bank - was set up in 1944; the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was set up in 1966. We are in 2015. So, the concern that we will suddenly be flooded with all these international organisations in Singapore, all enjoying privileges and immunities, is not a major concern at all.",12,462,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00462
2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In any case, I should point out that whatever privileges and immunities that we could grant to the AIIB would not be more than what other international organisations, like the World Bank or the ADB, currently enjoy in Singapore. So, I would like to reassure Mrs Chiam on that point.",13,463,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00463
2015-08-17-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, on that note let me now conclude. The AIIB is an important addition to the international financial architecture, and it is going to be a key international financial institution in our region. Joining the AIIB is both a natural step as well as a critical move for Singapore as an international financial centre and a business hub for the region. The AIIB Bill provides for Singapore to ratify the AIIB Articles of Agreement and to become a member of the Bank. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.",14,464,2015-08-17-T-012-S-00464

2015-08-17-T-013,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Madam, the Employment Act is Singapore's main employment law. It provides for the basic terms and working conditions for employees, while balancing employers' need to stay competitive. It is complemented by the Industrial Relations Act. Together with our tripartite partners, we regularly review our laws to keep pace with the changing labour force profile and employment landscape. We last amended the Employment Act in 2013 to extend protection to more workers. We also amended the Industrial Relations Act in 2014 to better meet the needs of our PMEs.",3,478,2015-08-17-T-013-S-00478

It proposes amendments to the Employment Act in two key areas. First, we will be requiring employers to provide itemised payslips and key employment terms in writing to their employees. Second, MOM will be setting up an administrative penalty framework to make less severe breaches of the Employment Act non-criminal. Let me elaborate.",4,479,2015-08-17-T-013-S-00479
2015-08-17-T-013,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"The first set of amendments proposes to give itemised payslips and key employment terms in writing to employees covered under the Employment Act. On the one hand, providing such documents will allow employees to better understand their regular salary components, as well as employment terms and benefits. On the other hand, this will help the employers to prevent misunderstandings and minimise disputes with their employees. Overall, this is better for employers and employees. We plan to make the new requirements for itemised payslips and key employment terms effective from 1 April 2016.",5,480,2015-08-17-T-013-S-00480
2015-08-17-T-013,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Madam, in coming up with these requirements, MOM actively consulted and took feedback from our tripartite partners. In particular, the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) gave us practical feedback about the difficulties faced by small businesses in implementing these changes. We have therefore made adjustments to include flexibility for employers, but without compromising protection for workers. So, for example, employers will have flexibility to issue the payslips and key employment terms in either soft or hard copy, including handwritten copies.",6,481,2015-08-17-T-013-S-00481
2015-08-17-T-013,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"For payslips, even if workers are paid weekly or fortnightly, employers will be allowed to consolidate payments into one monthly payslip. For key employment terms, common terms can be provided in the company's employee handbook or website, so long as the information is easily accessible to workers. In addition, key employment terms apply only to employees who work for at least 14 days continuously. This means that employers need not give key employment terms to casual workers who work only for a few days now and then.",7,482,2015-08-17-T-013-S-00482

At the end of the month, the employee would be coerced to donate quite a sum of money in cash for mistakes he has made. It is hard to report the boss' wrongdoings because of lack of evidence.

According to MOM's statistics, the number of claims registered with the Individual Disputes Section show that claims for arrears of wages rose 38% between 2011 and 2014, outstripping the growth in employment. As a proportion of all registered claims, such arrears accounted for the bulk, ranging from 43% to 60% in the period 2004 to 2014.

Further, employers are also not required to provide written records of key employment terms to the employees. Most notably, although the existing sections 95 and 96 require that records of employment terms and salary payments and deductions be kept, the criteria for determining the failure of compliance are not made clear in each of these sections.

Low-wage workers, including low-wage foreign workers, are more exposed to such poor employment practices.

I would like to suggest that for workers earning below $1,900 – employers must be required to issue a hard copy for their workers' payslips and KETs. For several low-income workers, they may not be in the practice of relying on electronic communications and records. This may hinder the effectiveness of the amendment in protecting workers when they do not even know how to access their payslips or KETs. Hence, hard copy payslips and KETs are much easier for them to manage and account for.",6,566,2015-08-17-T-013-S-00566

With a clear itemised payslip, written employment contract with key provisions and well-kept employee records, it will help minimise acrimonious disputes, long legal tussles, miscommunication, stress, time and monies. This is a great boon for all workers as they can more easily overcome the need to carry out discovery, resolve and gather the evidence and facts in the course of a disagreement or dispute.

Employees and workers also need to know their rights. This will not be an easy task and will require MOM to work closely with our tripartite partners to ensure all employers are well equipped and supported to institutionalise the systems and HR practices to comply. Furthermore, employees also need to know their new entitlements and rights.

As for hard copies, the Chinese, Malay and Tamil versions will be made available shortly. We also provide one-to-one hands-on assistance for SMEs and provide funding support as well.

2015-08-17-T-014,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin,"Mdm Speaker, we have long debated and discussed not only in this House but outside, on the concerns of the elderly especially when they are in their twilight years. This is the phase in their lives where they are most vulnerable as not only they are no longer working but they are also not in the best of health. And, in some cases, this is also the time when their children would have set up their own families and unable to cope with looking after their aged especially in financial support.",1,639,2015-08-17-T-014-S-00639
2015-08-17-T-014,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin,"Strengthening the social safety net is always a right thing to do. Life is not perfect where everyone in the family has a successful career and a good-paying job. In Singapore, we are no different. We have families who are more closely-knitted and others who are dispersed and some even dysfunctional. Hence, there are seniors who face challenges to cope with their daily expenses and they do not have strong support network (either family or relatives). Some live alone and if you visit their home you can see very basic items like a foldable metal table, an old flask and maybe a kettle beside a tray with two cups in the living room. The bedroom is as stark with a bed and a cupboard, and the kitchen hardly has any utensils.",2,640,2015-08-17-T-014-S-00640
2015-08-17-T-014,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin,"Madam, in the early days of our economic development, up to the 1980s, I assume, our economy was driven primarily by manufacturing and manual labour. Our workforce demography was majority blue collars. Back then, the cost of living was low and majority of Singaporean workers and families were able to cope with low wages. But now cost of living has risen, seniors are living longer lives, and they have higher expectations. Some may be in their mid-60s and need more support.",3,641,2015-08-17-T-014-S-00641

I would propose that this criterion be applied with more weightage than the housing type of the eligible applicant or even the support when the seniors apply for this scheme.",6,644,2015-08-17-T-014-S-00644
2015-08-17-T-014,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin,I would also suggest that 100% or the majority of Silver Support disbursement be given in cash directly into individual senior citizen's bank account instead of the CPF Account.

We must continue to take care and provide for our elderly so that we promote filial piety not only in words but also in action. I wish we can disburse more for the seniors. So, apart from asking the Government for more, similarly I hope the philanthropists and the well-to-do in Singapore could also work closely in the community to assist our elderly and complement the effort of the Government to support our elderly in their twilight years.",8,646,2015-08-17-T-014-S-00646

Many beneficiaries of the SSS would also be recipients of schemes like ComCare, the Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance and other financial assistance. Will there be some database sharing between the relevant agencies, whilst maintaining confidentiality of course, as required at the same time? This would be useful, and the coordination and oversight for the elderly will then be more systematic and organised.

For the SSS, the proposal is a quarterly pay-out. However, if the coordination that I mentioned earlier in point 1 above can be practically carried out, can the SSS disbursement be meted out on a monthly basis instead.

This saves the trouble for them to get the application forms and to sign up. Moreover, many of them may not be IT-savvy and have to do it the hard copy way if required and thus may be more time consuming. So, that was a welcomed change indeed.",6,653,2015-08-17-T-014-S-00653

As for those on the margin, for example, as highlighted by Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, those with a private housing address but actually do require the help. So, these are the marginal cases, while they do not automatically qualify for Silver Support, they can write in to the Commissioner to appeal and we will consider each case on its merits.",3,659,2015-08-17-T-014-S-00659

Madam, unlike the other financial assistance schemes like ComCare and the Pioneer Generation (PG) Assistance that do so, Silver Support is an income supplement and is not intended to be a substitute for other sources of retirement income, which would include CPF savings, private savings and family support. As Deputy Prime Minister Tharman put it during the Budget debate, Silver Support supplements incomes in a modest but meaningful way. Other schemes where we have adopted a quarterly payment approach include the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme, which is also designed to supplement incomes.",6,662,2015-08-17-T-014-S-00662

I would like the Ministry to consider publishing through the media or through Parliament at regular intervals the details of research projects rejected by the various institutional review boards and the reasons for their rejection. This is in addition to the details of projects that are submitted to the Ministry of Health for special approval, including details of serious adverse events as identified in clause 2. This is chiefly to keep the public informed and aware of the workings of the self-regulation framework, particularly since this is a highly specialised area that requires significant intervention for the effects of this Bill to be understood by the layman. More specifically, in view of the importance of clause 63 as a regulatory tool for the Bill, I would like to ask the Minister how the penalty threshold of a $20,000 fine and a two-year imprisonment term was derived which, in my view, is set at a rather low threshold.",16,763,2015-08-17-T-015-S-00763

Secondly, it recommends that the Government commit to publishing details of human biomedical research that will be carried out under this Bill's auspices and recommends that reporting regulations to Parliament be placed upon research institutions and review boards that seek to carry out restricted research.

First, that the irregularities found of the PA is also a common occurrence across the various statutory boards test-checked by the AGO. Second, such lapses are not one-off incidents, but occur with an alarming regularity year after year. Time and time again, the AGO has noted recurring financial lapses over the years. For instance, between the Financial Years 2010 and 2014, recurring lapses have been observed by the AGO, which includes",26,836,2015-08-17-T-017-S-00836
2015-08-17-T-017,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"First, lapses in procurement and tender contracts as a result of a failure to adhere to the Government procurement rules, principles of transparency and open and fair competition. The relevant Statutory Boards who were supposed to ensure a competitive bid for tender, had failed to do so and had waived competition on extremely weak grounds. For example, the AGO found that National Parks (NParks) had awarded three consultancy contracts worth a total of $20.77 million and had waived competition without compelling reasons. Although NParks had cited tight timeline as the main reason for waiving the competition, the AGO said it found ""no evidence to show that the tight timeline was caused by unforeseen and urgent events"".",27,837,2015-08-17-T-017-S-00837

2015-08-17-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker, Mrs Lina Chiam has raised three points which I would like to address. The first is her concern over repeated lapses. As was noted in the earlier replies by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman and Minister Lim Swee Say, public agencies are subject to annual audits whether by internal auditors as well as external auditors or the Auditor-General. Lapses are taken seriously and investigated and appropriate actions taken to prevent recurrence. Depending on the problem, the measures include closer monitoring by supervisors, clearer guidelines for officers, enhanced IT systems to enable better tracking and various other measures. As a result, while recurrent lapses can still happen, they are the exception rather than the norm. I should say this again, whilst from time to time, there are recurrent lapses, they are very much the exception rather than the norm.",1,848,2015-08-17-T-017-S-00848
2015-08-17-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"For example, in this year's audit by the AGO, and I say this not to trivialise the matter but just to state factually, only one of the findings was a repeat lapse and this was not because the agency did nothing following the first observation, but that AGO thinks their new measure were still not rigorous enough. So, the agency did something after the finding but AGO thinks that is not good enough. That is the rigour of the system that we have. I should also emphasise what was pointed out before that notwithstanding these findings, the AGO has given an unmodified audit opinion this year and in previous years on the Government's financial statements. So, that is on the first point.",2,849,2015-08-17-T-017-S-00849
2015-08-17-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The second point which Mrs Chiam raised had to do with the adequacy of training and the competency of the officers involved in procurement. Apart from policy reviews and procurement systems, it is equally important to build up the capabilities of our procurement officers. After all, most lapses occur not because there are no rules, but because the rules were not complied with as required. We have a training framework which was enhanced recently. This is the new procurement competency framework which details the competencies expected of officers in various procurement roles so that they can carry out their work effectively. There is also a training roadmap to help our officers build up their mastery of procurement knowledge and skills.",3,850,2015-08-17-T-017-S-00850

2015-08-17-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We also launched the procurement specialist track last year to professionalise and provide clear career development pathways. There is a career development forum that gives opportunities to finance and procurement officers to deepen their skills and/or widen their exposure to different job scopes and organisational settings. In addition, there are ongoing efforts to tap the knowledge and experience of officers who have built up valuable expertise over the years in specialist areas, such as construction and ICT. This allows officers to learn from one another and from established practitioners.",5,852,2015-08-17-T-017-S-00852
2015-08-17-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Thirdly, with regard to Mrs Chiam's suggestion on more centralised procurement, to provide the context, I should remind Members that our procurement rules are calibrated to the value and risk of the purchases. Therefore, the approval process is highly centralised for high value projects. Projects above $80 million must be approved by the Development Planning Committee comprising three Cabinet Ministers after rigorous scrutiny by the senior officials in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry concerned before tenders can even be called. Roughly, half of the total value of public sector procurements each year goes through this Development Planning Committee process. Those of us who have been involved in this know how much rigour and scrutiny is involved. Approval of lower value procurements is typically decentralised for greater efficiency and responsiveness. Even so, the process is governed by a clear set of rules and complemented by regular audits.",6,853,2015-08-17-T-017-S-00853
2015-08-17-T-017,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Singapore is not unique in this. Decentralised procurement is practised in most advanced countries with efficient procurement systems such as Australia and the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, for common goods and services, some forms of centralised purchasing are, in fact, being practised today. We have over 50 bulk contracts which all Government agencies can tap on, covering items such as office equipment and professional services. Overall, we aim to strike a judicious balance. As the needs of the public sector agencies have grown more complex and varied over time, excessive centralisation will weigh the procurement system down and create a new set of problems. Our agencies should retain sufficient flexibility and autonomy to perform their roles effectively and be regularly audited, as they are now, to preserve system integrity.",7,854,2015-08-17-T-017-S-00854

2015-08-17-T-017,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Firstly, the Member cast doubt on whether these lapses have compromised the interests of residents. Mdm Speaker, during the severe haze in 2013, a community hospital appealed to a GRO for air purifiers for patients in their non-airconditioned wards. The item was in great demand during this haze period and was out of stock across all major retail outlets in Singapore. The grassroots leaders and the volunteers went all around Singapore, and, finally, they found a store, a small store, which had a limited stock. They quickly purchased their air purifiers without asking for three quotes, as they were in a great hurry to purchase these air purifiers to help to alleviate the discomfort of the patients.",2,857,2015-08-17-T-017-S-00857

This was to promote healthy lifestyles, in particular counting on this organisation to reach out to the senior residents, with an annual outreach of 20,000 residents to help them to stay healthy. The CC did not seek the required approval of the People's Association (PA) HQ. So, it was certainly a case of non-compliance of financial rules.

It has been so and it will continue to be the case. What happened was that there was a change in the Statutory Board - Financial Reporting Standards. With that revision, PA was required to include the GROs' accounts into our financial statements.

So, the PA took four years, account by account, to consolidate these 1,800 GROs' accounts in the PA financial statements. The consolidation was completed by FY2013. And, for that year, the first year of consolidation, our financial statement received clean audit opinions for that year - 2013, first year of our consolidated account, and likewise FY2014. In other words, the moment the accounts were consolidated, 1,800 of them, in fact, the PA, together with GROs' financial statements, were certified by external auditors to be of clean audit opinions, meaning that the financial statement is reliable - the accounting system is sound.",8,863,2015-08-17-T-017-S-00863

The key drivers for the increase in the USC index were similar, with the unit labour cost and services cost contributing roughly equal shares to its increase.

The longer sentence under PD is to incarcerate recalcitrant offenders for a substantial period of time to protect the public.",1,886,2015-08-17-T-021-S-00886
2015-08-17-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"When serving their sentences, both CT and PD inmates go through rehabilitation and counselling programmes to deal with their offending behaviour and underlying criminal tendencies. They may also be selected to work in SCORE workshops where they receive vocational training to improve their employability upon release. Towards the end of their sentences, suitable CT and PD inmates may be considered for release on licence at either a Halfway House or their own homes with strict conditions. This is to facilitate their reintegration into society. Given the different profiles of CT and PD inmates, more CT inmates are released on licence.",2,887,2015-08-17-T-021-S-00887
2015-08-17-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,The repeat offenders sentenced to CT and PD are typically assessed as more likely to re-offend compared to other repeat offenders. The CT and PD regimes are therefore designed to reduce re-offending and recidivism through a combination of longer sentences and rehabilitation programmes for the inmates. The average recidivism rate for CT and PD inmates released from 2008 to 2012 is comparable to that of other repeat offenders.,3,888,2015-08-17-T-021-S-00888
2015-08-17-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The Singapore Prison Service is reviewing both regimes with a view to providing more structured supervision and aftercare support for CT and PD inmates upon their release from prison. This will help them reintegrate into society and prevent re-offending. However, even with more supervision and aftercare support, inmates must ultimately take personal responsibility not to re-offend upon release.",4,889,2015-08-17-T-021-S-00889
2015-08-17-T-022,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the form of assistance that is rendered by BCA to mediate disputes involving residents and developers especially in private housing projects where there are design or construction defects even though these comply with BCA's building regulations; and (b) whether BCA can tighten the issuance of the Temporary Occupation Permit or Certificate of Statutory Compliance to ensure building construction meets an acceptable standard.,1,890,2015-08-17-T-022-S-00890
2015-08-17-T-022,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The granting of the Temporary Occupation Permit and the Certificate of Statutory Completion is dependent on the building meeting the respective regulatory requirements of agencies, such as SCDF for fire safety, BCA for structural safety and PUB for drainage and sewerage provisions.",1,891,2015-08-17-T-022-S-00891
2015-08-17-T-022,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Disputes over defects, such as those related to design and workmanship, are governed by the terms of the Sale and Purchase (S&P) Agreement between the developer and the buyer. While BCA cannot intervene in private contractual disputes, BCA will facilitate meetings, where possible, between the parties concerned to resolve such disputes.",2,892,2015-08-17-T-022-S-00892
2015-08-17-T-022,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Additionally, buyers may also resolve their disputes with the developer through mediation. Currently, there are two organisations offering mediation services, namely, the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) and the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC). For example, the REDAS Conciliation Panel deals with disputes specifically concerning workmanship, quality of materials used and/or obligations under the S&P Agreement which arise during the defects liability period.",3,893,2015-08-17-T-022-S-00893
2015-08-17-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether NParks will review the policy of charging for car park usage at popular parks; and (b) whether it can consider a pilot scheme at Bedok Reservoir Park to allow free car park usage from 5am to 9am and 5pm to 9pm with a view to extending it to all parks, so as to incentivise the encouragement of a healthy lifestyle among all Singaporeans.",1,894,2015-08-17-T-023-S-00894
2015-08-17-T-023,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"NParks has been receiving feedback on the constant misuse of car parks in some of our parks, where parking lots were taken up for extended periods of time by non-park users. To minimise misuse and safeguard parking lots for genuine park users, NParks had to implement charged parking at parks with high demand. This is no different from many other car parks whereby charges are imposed to regulate usage.",1,895,2015-08-17-T-023-S-00895
2015-08-17-T-023,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,NParks has received some feedback that this may discourage some park users who are drivers from visiting our parks. NParks will monitor the situation and consider whether it is necessary to make any adjustments. Park users are encouraged to also consider using public transport when visiting parks that have good public transport connection.,2,896,2015-08-17-T-023-S-00896
2015-08-17-T-024,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of the Report of the Auditor-General for FY2014/15 on how NEA's contractor only treated rodent burrows found in the areas under NEA's purview (a) whether NEA will disregard these boundaries when carrying out its responsibilities that relate to public health issues; and (b) whether NEA has informed the other public agencies when the rodent burrows are discovered in these agencies' boundaries.,1,897,2015-08-17-T-024-S-00897
2015-08-17-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources):,"From September 2013 to January 2014, the National Environment Agency (NEA) detected close to 14,000 burrows in public areas, of which about 2,000 burrows were in areas under the purview of other agencies (excluding Town Councils). In the Auditor-General’s Office (AGO) review of NEA’s rodent control services over the same period, it found that 115 burrows detected at these areas remained untreated and 33 remained active or increased in numbers after two to six months. AGO observed that NEA’s approach of not treating the burrows in areas under other public agencies may have resulted in higher overall costs, and that it had not sufficiently followed up with the other public agencies to ensure that actions were taken to treat the active burrows detected.",1,898,2015-08-17-T-024-S-00898
2015-08-17-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources):,"NEA acknowledges AGO's observations. The main objective of NEA’s rodent surveillance and control programme is to detect active burrows in public areas to monitor the rodent situation, with treatment comprising a small part of NEA’s rodent contract as typically less than 10% of burrows are detected in NEA-managed land. Nonetheless, NEA will step up efforts to ensure that all detected burrows are treated, including considering streamlining and taking over the treatment of burrows in areas under the purview of other agencies and abutting NEA-managed areas. NEA will also take steps to further strengthen its coordination with stakeholders and facilitate collaborative efforts among stakeholders in the same locale. This includes ensuring detected burrows are treated and pooling resources to tackle infestation that straddles the borders of land under different stakeholders, so as to avoid duplicative work by multiple parties. NEA is also considering other measures to ensure upstream measures to tackle rat infestation are put in place by the respective stakeholders.",2,899,2015-08-17-T-024-S-00899
2015-08-17-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources):,The health and safety of the public remains our top priority. We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to keep the rat situation under control.,3,900,2015-08-17-T-024-S-00900
2015-08-17-T-025,David Ong,Mr David Ong,"asked the Minister for National Development over the last two years, what is the number of cases which the Ministry has received involving fraudulent foreign property transactions made by licensed estate agents.",1,901,2015-08-17-T-025-S-00901
2015-08-17-T-025,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"From January 2014 to July 2015, the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) received 12 complaints against five licensed estate agents which marketed foreign properties in Singapore. Three of the 12 complaints were found to be unsubstantiated as no fault or blame can be found on the part of the estate agents.",1,902,2015-08-17-T-025-S-00902
2015-08-17-T-025,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Investigations into the other nine complaints are on-going. Of these nine complaints, three involved the developers going into liquidation and the rest are related to contractual fees and investment returns issues. These complaints include the development not being carried out according to schedule, and consumers being unable to get their deposits back from the developers after deciding to withdraw from the purchase and alleged misrepresentation by the estate agent.",2,903,2015-08-17-T-025-S-00903
2015-08-17-T-026,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry can consider capping hospital bills based on the class of ward that the patient is admitted to instead of capping the maximum amount that they can claim from MediShield Life.,1,904,2015-08-17-T-026-S-00904
2015-08-17-T-026,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Hospital bill sizes vary depending on the severity and complexity of the patients’ conditions and type of treatment received. To help patients with their hospital bills, the Ministry has put in place a range of measures. These include significant government subsidies of up to 80% for those who choose subsidised C ward classes; MediShield coverage for large hospital bills; Medisave to help with patients’ share of the bill; and Medifund for the needy. Today, the majority of hospital bills in Class B2/C wards are almost fully covered by subsidies, MediShield and Medisave, with three quarters paying $100 or less in cash.",1,905,2015-08-17-T-026-S-00905
2015-08-17-T-026,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To better help Singaporeans with large subsidised hospital bills, MediShield Life will be introduced from 1 November 2015. We have raised the claim limits under MediShield Life and removed the lifetime limit. This means that MediShield Life will cover more and will be adequate for most class B2/C bills. Co-payment under Medishield life will also be lowered, ranging from 10% for the smaller bills to 3% for the larger bills above $10,000. This means that patients will pay a significantly lower share of the larger bills.",2,906,2015-08-17-T-026-S-00906
2015-08-17-T-026,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"While we ensure affordability, we also need to be mindful of the need to manage healthcare costs. Setting caps on hospital bills may inadvertently encourage wasteful consumption, like ordering more tests than necessary, because any expenses above the cap will be ""free"" to the patients. However, they have to be paid for ultimately by all of us, through higher taxes or premiums. Hence, it is better to have claim limits to help manage the cost of treatment, and instead, provide help to ensure that patients are able to pay for their bills.",3,907,2015-08-17-T-026-S-00907
2015-08-17-T-026,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Patients can tap on Medisave to pay for their share of the hospital bill, after subsidies and insurance payouts. For those with financial difficulties, they can approach the medical social workers to apply for assistance such as Medifund. This will ensure that health care will remain affordable.",4,908,2015-08-17-T-026-S-00908
2015-08-17-T-027,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) when was the last time the price of water was increased for households and how this compares with the frequency and quantum of the rise in electricity tariffs; (b) what are the governing principles used in determining the rates for water and electricity; (c) whether the price of water is currently set on the basis of price recovery; and (d) what is the long-term marginal cost of water.,1,909,2015-08-17-T-027-S-00909
2015-08-17-T-027,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The price of potable water in Singapore is pegged to the Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of producing desalinated water and NEWater. Desalination and recycling are the main source of the next available drop of water given our shortage of land. Consequently, the water tariff and Water Conservation Tax reflect the true scarcity value of water.",1,910,2015-08-17-T-027-S-00910
2015-08-17-T-027,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The price of water has remained unchanged since 2000. Although labour and equipment costs have risen during these 15 years, PUB has been able to keep the LRMC relatively stable because of improvements in membrane technology and productivity. We should bear in mind that desalination and recycling water are energy intensive processes. Hence, the key variable for the future is the price of energy. Nonetheless, given the current state of technology and energy prices, there is no need for an adjustment at this point.",2,911,2015-08-17-T-027-S-00911
2015-08-17-T-028,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Health in 2012, 2013 and 2014, how many eligible patients reached (i) the annual withdrawal cap of $400 from their own Medisave accounts (not that of their family members); or (ii) the annual CHAS subsidy limits of $320 or $480 for simple chronic (Tier 1) or complex chronic (Tier 2) conditions respectively, for treatment of conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP).",1,912,2015-08-17-T-028-S-00912
2015-08-17-T-028,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Subsidies at the specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics and participating General Practitioner (GP) clinics under the Community Health Assistance Scheme (CHAS) help to ensure that outpatient care is affordable. Medisave use is sized primarily to help Singaporeans pay for subsidised hospitalisation costs. Its use has been extended to outpatient treatment of chronic diseases under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) to help patients to defray their cash payment for such treatments.",1,913,2015-08-17-T-028-S-00913
2015-08-17-T-028,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Under the CDMP, up to $400 per year per Medisave account can be used for the treatment of 19 chronic conditions. The annual Medisave limit is reviewed regularly and was last increased in January 2012 from $300 to $400 per year. In 2014, about 5% of the 200,000 subsidised patients, or about 10,000 patients, fully utilised the annual $400 limit from their own Medisave accounts, up from 3% in 2012. This includes patients seeking care at the specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics and CHAS GP clinics.",2,914,2015-08-17-T-028-S-00914

Generally, patients can be expected to co-pay for part of their treatment, with the lower-income and Pioneers paying less. In 2014, less than 2% of the 1.2 million CHAS members used up to their annual cap of chronic subsidy, similar to that in 2012 and 2013.",3,915,2015-08-17-T-028-S-00915
2015-08-17-T-028,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Outpatient subsidies were enhanced recently, together with additional subsidies for Pioneers to help reduce the amount that patients need to pay using their own Medisave or cash. Pioneers also have a higher CHAS subsidy limit than other CHAS beneficiaries. In addition, since April 2015, elderly have been able to use an additional $200 of Medisave a year to pay for various outpatient treatment, under the Flexi-Medisave scheme. These measures will help to reduce the number of patients, especially the elderly patients, who will exhaust their limits. My Ministry will continue to review the Medisave and CHAS limits regularly to ensure that outpatient care remains affordable.",4,916,2015-08-17-T-028-S-00916

2015-08-17-T-059,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,MINDEF/SAF continually leverages technology to keep the SAF sharp and to modernise its capabilities. Ensuring that the SAF remains a credible force against all prospective threats to Singapore for the future goes beyond type-for-type platform replacements. We are developing new innovative fighting concepts to fully exploit the potential of emerging technologies.,1,1043,2015-08-17-T-059-S-01043
2015-08-17-T-059,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"New technologies such as unmanned systems and robotics can multiply the combat effectiveness of our soldiers, allowing the SAF to overcome our constraints of a limited population. Our Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems, which can stay airborne for more than 24 hours, can already provide persistent, near real-time situational awareness to our forces. This allows the SAF to see further, in greater resolution, and fight more effectively. Out at sea, we have been conducting trials of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs), and successfully tested their ability to patrol our congested waterways. In the future, our ships paired with USVs can efficiently and effectively protect a far larger area to secure our sea lines of communications. There is great potential for such technologies on land as well. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) may soon be used to conduct security patrols. With the UGVs, we could reduce the number of guards on patrol, yet protect larger areas. Moving forward, such UGVs could assist our soldiers in ensuring that key installations and infrastructure remain safe from the threat of attack.",2,1044,2015-08-17-T-059-S-01044
2015-08-17-T-059,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Threats are also evolving in non-traditional domains, like cyber, and the SAF has to remain vigilant to guard against threats to our military networks. New units for cyber defence are being raised and our Cyber Defence Operations Hub (CDOH) is also being enhanced. Better capabilities using infocomm technology, artificial intelligence and big data analytics are in the pipe-line to enhance existing systems. Taken together, these capabilities will ensure that our networks are resilient with robust defence systems.",3,1045,2015-08-17-T-059-S-01045

The Army will be more mobile and capable, with the number of units operating on wheeled or tracked platforms almost doubling in the next 10-15 years. These units can influence areas up to three times larger, thereby multiplying the potency of our Army. This will include more Terrex Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICVs) to deal with increasingly complex urban environments. Our first motorised infantry brigade, equipped with the Terrex ICVs, will achieve initial operating capability next year. The Army recently commissioned the new Peacekeeper Protected Response Vehicles. These vehicles will be networked with other SAF platforms so that they can collectively see more, see further and allow our soldiers to act more decisively.
