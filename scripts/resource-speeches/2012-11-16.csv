2012-11-16-T-001,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what are the Ministry's plans to keep industrial land affordable for SMEs in Singapore.,1,1,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00001
2012-11-16-T-001,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh,Page  1442,2,2,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00002
2012-11-16-T-001,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Mr Speaker, URA's rental index for industrial property rose by 1.2% in the third quarter of 2012, moderating from the 2.8% increase in the previous quarter. This likely reflects a moderation in underlying demand for industrial space relative to supply, which has increased in recent quarters.",1,3,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00003
2012-11-16-T-001,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"However, industrial property prices continued their upward trend in the third quarter of 2012. We will release sufficient land through the Industrial Government Land Sale (IGLS) Programme to meet the needs of industrialists and moderate prices and rentals. We have also started to release smaller IGLS land parcels with shorter tenure, targeted at SMEs that require customised land-based facilities at more affordable prices. In addition, we will continue with our enforcement efforts to ensure that industrial space is not misused by non-industrial users, which may also have contributed to the increase in industrial prices and rentals.",2,4,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00004
2012-11-16-T-001,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, last year, Singapore was rated as one of the top three most expensive places in terms of prime industrial land in the whole world, alongside Tokyo. This makes Singapore too expensive for companies, whether big or small, to remain competitive here. In this respect, I would like to ask the Minister the following questions.",1,5,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00005
2012-11-16-T-001,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"First, the price of industrial land in Singapore has increased by 60% in the past two years – 2011 and 2012 to date – driven probably by investors speculating in the market. Does the Minister think that the 60% is good or bad for the economy? Secondly, in the last two years, what proportion of industrial land is held by foreign investors and what proportion of industrial land has been converted for non-industrial uses? Thirdly, on the release of additional land, as the Minister announced, does the Minister agree that releasing more land alone is not the answer if the land is allowed for investment purposes, versus direct allocation to end-users? In this aspect, should the Government not regain its old role as the major industrial landlord rather than giving out to private developers to be the landlord for end-users?",2,6,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00006

2012-11-16-T-001,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Mr Speaker, as I mentioned in my reply just now, there are two things that we have to watch. One is industrial land rentals, and the other is industrial land prices. As Members can see, there seems to be a divergence. Land rentals have not increased as sharply as land prices. Land prices have gone up – as Mr Inderjit Singh said – very sharply over the last three years. But if we look at land rentals, they have gone up by 30% over the last three years. If we look at the longer period, land rentals have been very flat from 2002 to 2007. There has been a pick up since then.",1,8,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00008
2012-11-16-T-001,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"When we look at industrial land, which is where the majority of our SMEs rent their premises, then we are watching very carefully. I do recognise that industrial land prices have gone up sharply. For us, we track our competitiveness very closely, in terms of our land prices and rentals, vis-a-vis alternatives in the surrounding countries and a suite of competitive locations. So, we continue to track and we continue to feel that our land prices and rentals are competitive, based on these competitive locations that we are tracking.",2,9,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00009
2012-11-16-T-001,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Next, the question on industrial land use. Industrial land cannot be converted to non-industrial use. This is something that is very clear. We have very limited land zoned for industrial use, and URA and JTC do not allow the land to be converted to non-industrial use. What I referred to was infiltration of non-industrial uses in factory space. As Members know, sometimes, in a factory, we allow a 60-40 rule, meaning 60% industrial use, and 40% ancillary use. Ancillary use means supporting services or offices that are related to the industry. Sometimes, there could be infiltration in the ancillary uses being sublet to other non-industrial users. On this, we are taking enforcement action and deterring people from allowing such non-industrial uses to creep in.",3,10,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00010
2012-11-16-T-001,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh,"Sir, I also asked the Minister about the proportion of foreign investors who have invested in our industrial and commercial properties. As the Minister correctly pointed out, the land cost has gone up rapidly and maybe not rental. This seems to be driven by investors – foreign or local – who want to invest in industrial land for their own returns. They have moved from the residential property market to commercial and industrial. I think that is something that has to be controlled.",1,11,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00011
2012-11-16-T-001,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"We are monitoring this. We do not have specific data for people to declare when they purchase industrial land, whether they are foreigner or local. So, we would have to start collecting the data. But as we all know, from anecdotal evidence – and this is the answer that I will give to the Member for the second question that he has filed – 60% of factory space that is rented out is used by industrialists who rent the space; 40% is owner-occupied, which means SMEs who buy the premises and then use it for their own purposes. For the 60% who rent, 15% or more comes from JTC and HDB; another 17%-18% comes from small owners, and the remaining 27% comes from the big developers or REITs. So, the Member can see that even if the foreign investments come in, they would be classified under the bigger owners – either REITs or developers – it is not a very big percentage.",1,12,2012-11-16-T-001-S-00012

2012-11-16-T-002,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry will consider disallowing the purchase of industrial properties for investment purposes and allowing industrial properties to be bought only by users themselves.,1,16,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00016
2012-11-16-T-002,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh,Page  1444,2,17,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00017
2012-11-16-T-002,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Mr Speaker, Sir, there are currently no restrictions on the purchase of industrial properties by investors. Introducing such restrictions will have significant impact on businesses.",1,18,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00018
2012-11-16-T-002,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Not all industrialists want to buy industrial space. Some industrialists prefer a rental arrangement, which gives them greater business flexibility. Others may choose not to commit higher upfront financial resources to own their properties. MTI ensures that there is sufficient space for industrialists to either buy or rent industrial space.",2,19,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00019
2012-11-16-T-002,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Long-term investors play an important role in the business ecosystem. They rent out the space they buy to the users, the industrialists. Allowing investors to participate in the industrial property market provides options for our industrialists, reduces the upfront capital costs for businesses and keeps rentals competitive.",3,20,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00020
2012-11-16-T-002,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Minister mentioned that about 27% of the industrial land is bought by industrialists or private developers. Does the Ministry track what proportion of those that are sub-divided, strata-title factories that are developed by the private developers that are then sold as investment properties? Does the Minister track that level of data? If so, can we look at who are the buyers – are they the end-users or investors? Can we stop the investment portion of the whole process?",1,21,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00021
2012-11-16-T-002,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Sir, I wish to clarify that the data that I gave earlier is for multiple-user factory space. As the Member knows, the industrial space in Singapore is divided into several categories. One is the single-storey factory where JTC either sells or rents the land and the factory owner then builds his own factory. That constitutes 55% of our overall industrial land space. That is the bulk. Most of our big factories and some of our SMEs buy standalone, single unit factories. They can either rent or sell, and the price, as I mentioned earlier, is pegged to a competitive slate of international prices. So, we ensure that the land prices for space that JTC allocates are competitive.",1,22,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00022
2012-11-16-T-002,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,Page  1445,2,23,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00023
2012-11-16-T-002,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Of the overall industrial space, about one quarter is multi-storey factory space. That is the segment that JTC has decided that it would not own or rent out on its own. It would just sell the land, because there is a very thriving private sector market. As I mentioned in Parliament several times, even at the peak 10 years ago, JTC's market share of multi-storey, multiple-user factories is less than 20%. So there is no reason for JTC to be competing with the private sector. The data that I had given just now are for multi-storey, multiple-user factories, where REITS and developers constitute 27% of that segment.",3,24,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00024
2012-11-16-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Singh, last question.",1,25,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00025
2012-11-16-T-002,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh,"Thank you, Sir. If we look at it in the whole scheme of things, that 55% of industrial land is owned by owners. Most of them are probably big multi-national companies or big companies. So, if we narrow down to SMEs who are operating in the remaining 20% or 25% of space that they now sublet, it would make a big difference to our SME community. I am very interested to know whether the factories that are re-sold – where they bought the land from Government, developed it, and re-sold some of the units built on the land to investors – is that driving up the rentals of industrial land for SMEs? If we can stop that perhaps we can reverse the trend.",1,26,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00026
2012-11-16-T-002,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Sir, maybe I did not make it clear in my reply. If you stop anybody from renting, and say that SMEs can only avail themselves of factory space only if they own it, that would be a very severe requirement. It would mean all SME industrialists, whenever they want to start their businesses, must make sure they have the financial resources to buy and own their premises before they can start. Today, they can have the option of renting, which means they lower their upfront cost. They do not have to put money into such a big asset, as buying their own premises. That is a very serious implication.",1,27,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00027
2012-11-16-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Singh, one last question, please.",1,28,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00028
2012-11-16-T-002,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh,"Sir, I wish to clarify. What I meant was that owning is one of it. But the other portion that I am requesting is, JTC becomes a landlord that rents out. What the Minister mentioned was that JTC was only controlling about 20% of it that has then been given to the private sector. I am asking for JTC to take it back – be the industrial landlord, and then rent these factories out to SMEs. In addition to that, there is also the portion of the re-sold factories that are driving rental prices up, probably because of the investment nature of the whole process.",1,29,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00029

2012-11-16-T-002,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Sir, at the risk of repeating myself, we have gone through this debate several times. JTC has decided to take itself out of the market because 80% is done by the private sector, 20% by JTC. JTC tenants have a very unfair advantage in that they are getting subsidised rents from JTC. It is not a level playing field. By the Government's ""Yellow Pages"" rule, we had decided to get out. It has taken us several years to stage the divestment such that it has minimal impact on the sector.",1,31,2012-11-16-T-002-S-00031

2012-11-16-T-003,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"My clarification is  what is the reason for the change in decision from not allowing to allowing? The question I want to ask is  does it mean that this is actually a relaxation of the guidelines under the URA guidelines on the website which defines it as ""traditional hues""?

But by and large, the patrons and the community were supportive. URA came in and said, ""yes, you can continue"". Then, the KGBA came forward recently to say it wants to enhance it.

2012-11-16-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"URA is very keen to allow community ownership of spaces, at the same time, striking that balance between what is conservation and allowing for artistic expression. As we move forward, what is important is the ownership of the space, that is, the community takes ownership. In this case, for example, the Kampung Glam Business Association is taking ownership. They want to enhance the area. But because they want to do more, what is important is for us to then engage stakeholders. And when we engage stakeholders, we want the stakeholders to come forward and see what is useable, what is nice and, at the same time, not compromise the conservation and heritage nature of the area.",3,44,2012-11-16-T-003-S-00044

So, when we look at the ""community"", it is actually engaging people who are keen to make sure that the place thrives in every aspect for different stakeholders. Therein lies the challenge, because the more stakeholders there are, the more challenging it gets. What is useful is the engagement. URA is facilitating that engagement to ensure that different stakeholders bring to the table what their interests and concerns are. At the same time, the broad guideline is that we want to encourage artistic expressions, not compromising the original intent of the place.

2012-11-16-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Sir, we have, since May last year, largely stabilised our BTO prices, especially for flats in the non-mature estates. That is why overall BTO prices have increased by 12% since January 2009, despite a larger 34% increase in the HDB Resale Price Index (RPI) over the same period – 12% versus 34%.",1,51,2012-11-16-T-004-S-00051

HDB also offers housing loans at concessionary interest rates to help eligible households finance their flat purchase.",2,52,2012-11-16-T-004-S-00052

2012-11-16-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As I said, when we price BTO flats, we take fully into account the question, ""Can buyers afford it?"" This is a critical factor. If we judge by the figure that I have given, that is, 23% of their monthly income, I think that is affordable for BTO. A lot of the misunderstanding out there is that they are equating BTO price with resale price. The resale price is beyond my control. That is set by buyer and seller. But for first-timers buying BTO flats, that is within my control. It is my job to ensure that it will be affordable.",1,56,2012-11-16-T-004-S-00056
2012-11-16-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Please look carefully and study our BTO prices in recent months. If I may quote some figures just to illustrate the point. For non-mature estates – because that is our commitment – there will always be flats which newly-weds, first-timers can afford. Supposing they buy a 4-room flat, say, in Sengkang or Chua Chu Kang, the BTO price is $251,000. It starts from $250,000 and, at the highest floor, which is the maximum price, $310,000.",2,57,2012-11-16-T-004-S-00057
2012-11-16-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"That is a reasonable price. Of course, people would want it even cheaper. But looking at it from a situation that we are facing today, I find these figures very reasonable. That is for a 4-room flat. A 5-room flat starts from $320,000; maximum is $385,000. That is what we have been trying to do in the last few months, stabilising the BTO prices. Over time, I hope that the resale price will further moderate and then we can adjust our BTO prices again. But for the moment, I would regard the achievement that we have been able to bring about this cost increase of just 12% versus the 34% increase as quite an achievement. Not enough credit has been given to my Ministry. [Laughter.]",3,58,2012-11-16-T-004-S-00058

In accepting this CRC recommendation, we had recognised the need to provide adults with mature content while at the same time protecting our young. We also recognised that VOD on pay TV allows for a higher degree of parental oversight, with the availability of an easy-to-use parental lock mechanism to prevent unauthorised access by under-aged viewers.

All R21 VOD content are locked by default and can only be accessed through a PIN number. Existing VOD customers who request for the PIN number will need to have their identity verified over the phone using the name, age, NRIC number and date of birth. As an additional safeguard, pay TV operators will also ask the caller to provide information on  (a) date of last bill payment, (b) method of payment, and (c) location of payment. New customers are required to personally sign up and show proof of their age at retail shops.

But it is often better for the community to decide what these standards should be and that means that we would need input, we would need viewpoints and perspectives from the society. That is why, periodically, we have a Censorship Review Committee set up; it comprises representatives from a wide cross section of the society and they decide how far or how fast we should move or whether we should stay put or where the standards should be. In this case, the CRC had made a recommendation and we had looked at the recommendation, agreed to move, but we were very cautious.

Secondly, my understanding is that in a 2009 High Court ruling, many of the vehicles are not covered locally, in terms of insurance. Is there a particular requirement under MOM for foreign despatch riders to be able to be covered under a group insurance by their employers?

2012-11-16-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Let me take a step back and explain the principles behind which our plans for drainage are conducted in Singapore. First, it is about water catchment. Two-thirds of Singapore's land area today is water catchment and eventually it could go up to 80% or 90%. What that means is that every drop of water on the ground or in the drain has a very high chance – a 90% chance – of ending up in the glass of water that you would drink. The second point is that it is also about flood prevention and mitigation. So, it is in our interest to make sure our drainage system is well-maintained and functions accordingly. The third is that we do want community ownership. Because our drains are in the community, in our neighbourhoods, and the integrity and the cleanliness of drains is important, it is important therefore for our local neighbourhoods to feel a sense of ownership and participation in the maintenance and in the implementation of activities in and around our waterways. Fourthly, if our waterways are transformed into beautiful and scenic spots, that also enhances values for the properties in the vicinity.",2,114,2012-11-16-T-010-S-00114

However, during times of intense storms, the water can spread out very rapidly along the sides and that is why you see we have got various alarm systems and markings on the ground, in order to emphasise safety.

2012-11-16-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the concept of a set of Shared Values, which Singaporeans of all races and faiths can subscribe to and live by, was first mooted in 1988 and it was subsequently passed in Parliament in January 1991. The aim was to anchor an evolving Singapore identity on common threads in our varied cultural heritage, as well as the attitudes and values which have helped us to survive and succeed as a nation. And I am sure we all know what the Shared Values are but I will just reiterate them. The Shared Values are nation before community and society above self, family as the basic unit of society, community support and respect for the individual, consensus not conflict and racial and religious harmony.",1,133,2012-11-16-T-012-S-00133
2012-11-16-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"These Shared Values have served as an important point of reference for the Ministry of Education (MOE)'s Civics and Moral Education Curriculum since 1992 and the school curriculum today continues to be anchored on six core values – Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, Care and Harmony which are based on the original Shared Values. They provide a framework for students to discuss issues and they continue to underpin MOE's Character and Citizenship Education curriculum.",2,134,2012-11-16-T-012-S-00134
2012-11-16-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Each of the Shared Values is also championed by organisations in the public, people and private sectors. For example, the value of having the family as a basic unit of society is upheld not just by the Ministry of Social and Family Development but also by many civic groups in Singapore like the Centre for Fathering and the Family Life Society. Likewise, racial and religious harmony is strengthened through the work of the People's Association and its grassroots leaders as well as by the network of Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) and societies like OnePeople.sg.",3,135,2012-11-16-T-012-S-00135

These are broadly consistent with our Shared Values.",4,136,2012-11-16-T-012-S-00136

It is also why when we started this process of a National Conversation, we did not immediately go into policy issues and say, let us deal with policies A, B, C. But we deliberately designed the conversation so that it was more open ended, so that Singaporeans and participants in the dialogue can share with us what are aspirations and values that are important to them. I believe through this process and through the conversations that we will be having over the coming weeks and months, we will be able to come up with a set of a better understanding of what are the common values that are important to Singaporeans now. They may be similar to what we had before, there may be some changes, but the process is important. Through this National Conversation process, we hope that we would be able to give an update in that sense, to the Shared Values that were done earlier.",1,140,2012-11-16-T-012-S-00140

There was a resident who spoke line by line what the national pledge meant to him. Rather than have a review of the Shared Values, could we encourage those hosting the National Conversation to have, as part of the agenda, the values of the nation and also a reminder of what those Shared Values are? Not a review, if it is not necessary, but a reminder and to have that as part of the agenda.",1,141,2012-11-16-T-012-S-00141

So, that is something we can take on board but the way we are conducting the conversation is precisely to let Singaporeans give their views on what we should reaffirm – things that we are doing now today; it could be our values, it could be the items in the pledge which resonate very strongly with many Singaporeans, reaffirm the things that are going well and we continue doing to recalibrate things that need to be adjusted and to refresh, to do things that are new.",1,142,2012-11-16-T-012-S-00142

It may indeed be an update or it may be different from the Shared Values that we had in the past. We will then highlight that these are changes that have happened and we will make it clear that through the process of the conversations that we have had, these are the findings that we have obtained for the various dialogues sessions.

2012-11-16-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, flat owners affected by the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) are given a generous package. First, they are fully compensated for their existing flats and they are paid reasonable expenses for their relocation. Second, they are given an assured allocation of new replacement flats with a new 99-year lease, and at subsidised prices. Third, flat owners who are eligible for a subsidised flat in their own right are then given a further 20% price discount off the BTO prices. This further marks down the already subsidised price of the new HDB flat.",1,147,2012-11-16-T-013-S-00147
2012-11-16-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The price discount, at up to $30,000 for a family, is comparable to the CPF Housing Grant for first-timer families buying a resale flat. The discount cap ensures that the SERS flat owners enjoy consistent benefits, as those with the means to buy the bigger flat types will get the same discount as the other SERS flat owners who buy smaller flat types.",2,148,2012-11-16-T-013-S-00148

HDB also provides a concessionary housing loan to eligible SERS flat owners. HDB reviews its policies regularly to ensure that its policies remain relevant and meet the needs of our residents.",3,149,2012-11-16-T-013-S-00149

2012-11-16-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I thought I replied in my last sentence. We review our policies regularly and update them as necessary.

2012-11-16-T-013,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Sir, I thank the Minister. I understand that the grants have increased. Pegging the SERS discount formula with the basic CPF grant, that is aligned. I also understand that the additional grants over the years have increased especially to support the objectives of, for example, trying to incentivise people to live closer to their parents or grandparents and to assist the lower income families. These are all very noble and very necessary. But the basic grant has not increased very much over the years and from what I know – and that is why I need a confirmation – that SERS discount formula was last reviewed many years ago, probably 20 years ago.

2012-11-16-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"First, this complex issue of problem gambling requires and can only be managed through the combined efforts of personal responsibility, family support, community involvement and that includes the responsible gambling efforts on the part of the operators and our social safeguards. On its own, each effort will be limited in its impact and efficacy. On its own, each will be unable to holistically manage the complex issue of problem gambling. In the design of any social safeguards, we must not inadvertently erode the role of personal responsibility, family support or community involvement. Instead, we must make sure that all four pieces come together and work in concert. This is something that Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Ms Low Yen Ling had also expressed earlier yesterday.",5,165,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00165
2012-11-16-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Second, our measures must be calibrated and targeted. Too broad or too blunt a measure will be ineffective in providing preventive assistance to the areas of greatest concern. Too fine or too narrow a measure may be resource intensive in application, yet may not achieve results that commensurate with the efforts and resources expended. Broad-based measures help us reach a wider audience. These include public education initiatives to raise awareness of problem gambling and help services available; and entry levies to deter casual and impulse gambling. On the other hand, targeted measures like exclusion orders and the proposed visit limits help us to manage problem gamblers, those in financial distress, and the financially vulnerable frequent casino patrons.",6,166,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00166

For example, the Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) and the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) should not find it too onerous or complicated to implement any proposed measures. Neither should we have measures that are easily circumvented.",7,167,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00167

We should not be complacent just because our probable pathological and probable problem gambling rates today remain stable at 1.4% and 1.2% respectively. As Ms Jessica Tan said, there can never be enough safeguards against the harm of gambling and we need to stay vigilant even as we strengthen our social safeguards. We must stay alert to the evolving trends and be prepared to make the necessary changes in anticipation of new and emerging challenges. For example, Ms Denise Phua and Dr Lam Pin Min raised valid concerns on online gambling, which many jurisdictions are still learning to come to terms with. We too must study the issues and counter-measures carefully and stay ahead of the curve to safeguard our society.",8,168,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00168

This will be an extension of the existing Casino Exclusion system under NCPG. Under the proposed amendments, NCPG will be empowered to constitute a Committee of Assessors to consider issuing Third-Party Visit Limit or Casino Exclusion for those identified as financially vulnerable or at-risk, depending on individual circumstances. I would like to assure Mr Dhinakaran and Dr Intan that a due process will be put in place to assess an individual's financial vulnerability. The NCPG will consider a risk-based approach based on various risk factors such as the frequency of casino visits, credit history and financial situation. It will also take into account information provided by family members during the process.

Mr Zainal Sapari also sought clarification on the definition of ""financial vulnerability"". First, I would like to reiterate that this group of financially vulnerable persons differs from the groups that have been automatically excluded from the casinos such as the undischarged bankrupts or those who are dependent on Government social assistance. Unlike them, these gamblers may not necessarily be financially distressed to be excluded totally from the casinos now. That said, I would like to reassure Ms Mary Liew that NCPG's Committee of Assessors can issue a Casino Exclusion Order, instead of a Visit Limit, if the situation warrants it.",12,172,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00172

I agree with Ms Denise Phua that we should identify those at-risk early so as to proactively consider protective measures for these groups.",13,173,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00173

More pertinent than excluding a person from the casino or imposing a Visit Limit is to get him or her to seek help to curb his or her gambling habit. Research shows that it is most beneficial for the rehabilitation of problem gamblers if their families also support and attend therapy together with them. Thus, it is more beneficial if families are involved directly, rather than as an anonymous or third-party applicant for the Exclusion Order or Visit Limit. Stopping entry to the casinos may be necessary but insufficient to complete the rehabilitation process for the problem gambler. The families need to walk the journey together to heal and to recover.",14,174,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00174

I would like to assure him that the confidentiality of financial information or credit records will be maintained. NCPG will only approach, for example, credit bureaus with the consent of individuals. However, in cases where financially vulnerable gamblers or persons with poor credit record are brought to the attention of the Council for the purpose of an Exclusion Order or Visit Limit, the individual will be given an opportunity to provide evidence to the contrary.",16,176,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00176

With the proposed amendments, the NCPG may require those who wish to revoke their Casino Exclusion or Visit Limit to undergo a harm assessment conducted by an NCPG-appointed professional. The NCPG's Committee of Assessors can continue to impose a Third-Party Casino Exclusion or Visit Limit if the person is found to be financially distressed or vulnerable. Also, as suggested by Mr Hri Kumar, the Committee of Assessors will be empowered to refer respondents of Casino Exclusion or Visit Limit, or those who wish to revoke their Casino Exclusion or Visit Limit, to participate in a programme of counselling, rehabilitation or special education. In fact, a person subject to a Family Exclusion Order can be referred for counselling under the current Act.",17,177,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00177
2012-11-16-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Desmond Lee commented that sufficient flexibility should be given to the NCPG's Committee of Assessors to impose either a Casino Exclusion Order or Visit Limit for applications by family members, and that the Exclusion Order or Visit Limit should take effect immediately even if the order is not served on respondents. The proposed amendments will allow the Committee of Assessors to issue an Exclusion Order or Visit Limit in the absence of the respondents if they fail to respond to a notice served on them, have indicated that they do not wish to attend the hearing, or cannot be located. Mr Gerald Giam also expressed concern that families may opt for a Visit Limit as an alternative to an Exclusion Order. Indeed, the NCPG will work with family members during the application process to help them determine if an Exclusion Order or Visit Limit will be more appropriate, based on the unique circumstances of each case.",18,178,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00178
2012-11-16-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Dr Intan asked how the Visit Limit imposed by the Committee of Assessors would be checked or documented, and whether it would apply to overseas casinos or cruise ships. NCPG will work with the CRA and casino operators to monitor the visits made by those subject to the Visit Limit. Once the individual reaches his maximum number of visits per month specified in the Visit Limit, he will be excluded from the casinos for the rest of the month. The Visit Limit will only apply to the local Integrated Resorts casinos as our legislation does not extend to overseas jurisdictions.",19,179,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00179

The time taken from the point of application to hearing by the Committee of Assessors to determine a Family Exclusion Order application is less than two weeks. The Committee sits about twice a week to hear the applications, not once a month, as Mr Gerald Giam mentioned. Applications are based at Tanjong Pagar Family Service Centre so that counselling services can commence at the onset of the process. With the proposed amendments, a provisional Family Exclusion Order can be issued much earlier where necessary. I believe Mr Ang Wei Neng will be assured that, going forward, the Committee of Assessors can protect the family from further harm if there was an urgent need to issue such a provisional order.",21,181,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00181

The Committee will take into account all relevant information before the Committee, including information from family members, before deciding to impose a Family Exclusion Order or Family Visit Limit. Under section 163A, the Committee will consider if the individual has engaged, or is likely to engage, in gambling activities in disregard of the needs and welfare of his or her family members for the purpose of a Family Visit Limit, for example, whether the individual provides for the family financially, whether there are signs of trouble such as absenteeism from work, whether he engages in criminal activities, and whether there are demand letters from creditors.

While the NCPG Council may comprise only 13 members, it has expertise in pertinent gambling-related areas such as psychiatry, psychology, social services, counselling, legal, rehabilitative and religious services. It is supported by a full-time secretariat. NCPG's approach is consistent with our overall approach that includes community involvement. Instead of being a self-contained centre, NCPG works in partnership with community organisations such as family service centres, the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS), educational institutions and voluntary organisations such as the community services and YAH!

This is a valid concern. When it comes to gambling or problem gambling, frequency and intensity tend to go hand in hand. We will monitor the situation closely. We also urge families and friends of gamblers as well as the casino operators, who have a business interest in doing so, to alert NCPG when they encounter individuals who intensify their gambling after a Visit Limit is imposed.

Currently, persons with poor credit record can already be subjected to Third-Party Exclusion from the casinos. However, financial vulnerability transcends income level. Regardless of income, if you do not spend within your means, there is always a risk. We want to look at financial vulnerability in relation to frequent gambling and help those who need help, regardless of their income.

The upward trend is likely to be a result of efforts by NCPG and NAMS to raise awareness of problem gambling. The figures are encouraging as one of the biggest challenges in treating addiction is to get the affected parties to come forward and seek help. I assure Ms Mary Liew that we will continue to provide the necessary assistance to problem gamblers as well as their families as suggested by Dr Intan.

First, there is no panacea for problem gambling. Different jurisdictions have sought to address the social downsides of casinos and other forms of gambling in different ways. Some allow free access with robust Responsible Gaming obligations. Others ban locals from entry. But an entry ban simply displaces gambling – offshore, online or underground.

The order of magnitude is around 10%-20%, with some variations. This trend suggests that the novelty factor is wearing off and our local market is maturing. This downward trend is also reflected in the quantum of entry levies that have been collected. From 2010 to 2011, the total entry levies collected fell from $216 million to $195 million.

2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Ms Denise Phua, Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Png Eng Huat suggested that we should do away with the Annual Entry Levies. Their concern was that the Annual Levy may be a low cost, cheaper alternative to the Daily Levies for those who might be prone to problem gambling – a loophole in Mr Png Eng Huat's terms. But we must first consider the data and see whether this is in fact the case. Of the total number of entry levies, in other words the summation of Annual Entry Levies and Daily Entry Levies that have been purchased by locals in 2011, about 1% was from Annual Entry Levies. What it means is that the significant upfront cost of an Annual Entry Levy does deter people from procuring it, and 1% is hardly a loophole. Moreover, the entry levy system is just one part of our entire framework of social safeguard measures, which includes exclusion orders, targeted measures for the financially vulnerable and, soon, if the Bill is passed, visit limits. These will apply whether one pays an annual or daily levy.",18,230,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00230

Together with other Government agencies, my Ministry – the Ministry of Home Affairs – working with MSF and MOF has commenced a review of our regulatory framework and social safeguards for non-casino gambling, including gambling via online channels. Online gambling, including gambling on social media platforms and mobile devices, is growing in many countries. Many of the emerging online gambling products are also potentially more addictive. Minors may also fall prey easily given the convenient access to mobile devices. Some overseas gaming jurisdictions have started to draw up laws to regulate online gambling. The US, until recently, had adopted mostly a prohibitive approach. Nevada has just begun issuing licences for operators to offer online poker to persons in the state. In the UK, there are fewer restrictions imposed on the provision of gambling products, including those online, by licensed operators. On the other hand, the regimes in Australia and Norway tend to impose greater restriction on gambling products offered online. We will study the developments in these countries carefully as well as our own context as we draw up our framework to address online gambling. But our objective remains the same, which is to preserve our values of thrift and hard work, and to protect our society, especially the vulnerable, from the potential harms of gambling.",22,234,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00234

If they fall short, they will be subject to disciplinary action. The relationship is an arm's length one between the regulator and the operator.

We recognise that the casinos are vulnerable to criminal influence and activities. We have, therefore, from the very outset put in place a strict regime to mitigate these risks.

Unlicensed moneylending is an area that the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Police monitor and work on very closely. As the Member would be aware from previous discussions and questions on this in this House, there has been good progress in the Police's efforts. The number of loansharking cases has come down since 2010. In 2011, there were about 13,300 cases, which was a 20% drop compared to the previous year. In the first nine months of this year, there was a further 21% drop. The trend is down. It is significant but the numbers are still larger than we would be happy with, and the Police continues to work hard at this. The reasons why we have been able to arrest this are manifold. Police enforcement action is a key factor. Increased preventive education efforts are another important element, and Police-community partnership is critical to this.",34,246,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00246

Let me assure Members, first, that the Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) conducts extensive probity checks on IMA applicants to ensure that they are not linked to known criminal elements. Mr Giam expressed some scepticism about the process. The fact that we rejected 12 applicants and approved only two IMAs speak of the high standards of probity that we impose on these applicants. And I think the message is clear. If the CRA finds a particular IMA or their representatives potentially linked to criminal groups, this could form the basis for the CRA to then suspend or cancel their licence in the public interest.",36,248,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00248

While the Act allows us to grant licences to the IMAs for a period of up to three years, CRA has given shorter one-year licences to the two IMAs that were granted licences. I should clarify that our IMA regime is materially different and of a higher level of probity compared to models in other countries.

In fact, in the two IRs' recent quarterly reports, we have already seen that gaming revenues over the last two quarters have significantly declined compared to the previous reference points in the previous year, on a year-on-year basis. This is partly due to global economic uncertainty and also because of other factors, including perhaps some of the novelty wearing off.

Before joining MBS, Gwern helped out at his father's foodcourt stalls selling duck rice and wanton noodles since the age of 14. He also worked part-time as a casual banquet staff in a hotel. After discovering his interest in cooking, he went on to SHATEC to take a diploma in culinary skills before joining MBS. Today, Gwen has come a long way and has been identified by celebrity chef Tetsuya as a promising local culinary talent.",65,277,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00277

James is a former engineer who got bored after retiring for less than three months and wanted to return to the workforce. He decided to apply to USS. Described as a dedicated and fatherly figure to the team, James has displayed leadership qualities and is being recommended for career advancement in the USS team.",66,278,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00278
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Let me also give you an example of a local SME which has benefited from the IRs' business – Laundry Network. This picture shows Mr Chan Tai Pang, who is the 66-year-old owner of Laundry Network. His company designed a unique uniform management system that is being used by both IRs. This system allows IR employees to swipe their staff passes at the uniform kiosks and collect their uniforms via a special conveyor belt. The business from the IRs has allowed the company to move up the value chain and implement new technology. The company made a combined S$9 million when it implemented a uniform management system that utilises radio frequency identification to track laundry for both IRs. Maintenance contracts with both IRs for this system are worth a total of S$500,000 per annum. Laundry Network has since increased its staff count by over 50% to more than 300 workers today. These are specific examples and there are many others like them, and I want to use them just to illustrate the point that we are able to create new opportunities for our people and our businesses, and this is an important aspect that must not be disregarded in this debate.",67,279,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00279

It allows us to refine our system and processes, taking into account new developments in the gaming sector and overseas jurisdictions, and ensure that our casino regulatory regime remains effective.",68,280,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00280

2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Members have spoken passionately about the need to contain the social impact. This is something the Government is fully committed to do. We are already a jurisdiction with one of the most extensive social safeguards regime. We will stay vigilant on the social impact and ensure that vulnerable segments of society continue to be protected from the harms of gambling. Police and other law enforcement agencies will also continue their tough enforcement stance so that casinos remain free from criminal influence. Ultimately, we want to create more opportunities for the Gwern Khoos, James Tans and Laundry Networks amongst us. The Integrated Resorts are one means of doing so. So, I urge Members of the House to give your full support to the Casino Control (Amendment) Bill.",71,283,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00283
2012-11-16-T-014,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Before I take clarifications – we are going to have a few – I would like to remind Members to keep your clarifications short and concise.,1,284,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00284
2012-11-16-T-014,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Sir, I have three clarifications. One, on online gambling, I am heartened that there is a commission that is already commencing supervision on the non-casino operations. I wish to ask Minister – while we are taking the time to study the jurisdictions and enabling this commission to work – can there be some interim measures to, at least, have some semblance of an example of a responsible gaming regime, or even to block such sites, online casino sites, if possible, during this time? That is my first one.",1,285,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00285
2012-11-16-T-014,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"The second question is on annual fees – the request on scrapping the annual casino entry levy – if the amount is so small, may I ask the Minister if he would just scrap the annual levy, since the impact is small and the number of people buying such levies is small?",2,286,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00286
2012-11-16-T-014,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"The third clarification is the long-term options for Singapore. When the time comes for the current contracts with the casino operators to be negotiated or renewed, or when the time comes for them to be expired, I want to ask Minister on the options that Singapore has. Are the options only limited to terminate and grant a new one, or two, to renew? Is there a third serious option to exit from this industry, or is it a given in our country that casinos are here to stay? I want to remind Minister of comments that he made at the International Association of Gaming Regulators this year that casino operations are becoming complex and crime syndicates are becoming more and more sophisticated. I do believe in everything that he has said in this speech so I want to remind the Minister of that. Second, is also the updated information that there are various competing casinos —",3,287,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00287

2012-11-16-T-014,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Yes. There are various competing casinos coming up, so if that is the setting that we are operating in, will there be a serious option that Singapore can exit from this industry? Thank you for your patience.",1,290,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00290
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for believing what I said. Let me try and do some justice to the multiple questions here. On online gaming and whether we can do something in the interim, I think we have to look at it carefully because it is a question not just of the will but also the ability to follow through. But we are looking at it and we will take the necessary steps and, if we can do it effectively, then we will also look at some interim measures. I want to give the Member the assurance of that.",1,291,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00291
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, if the number of annual levies is proportionately small, then should we just scrap the annual levy? This is an interesting argument because if it was large, the Member would say, ""There you are, we have a problem"". If it is small, ""Why not do away with it?"" So, there must be a sweet spot zone that the Member is thinking of where it is permissible. But I think the short answer to her is this. You need these annual levies partly because the casinos do, as part of their business, have what they call premium players. And for premium players, if you subject them to a daily levy regime, it is cumbersome and these are people who, as you know, by our laws have to first put in a deposit of $100,000 and draw it down before they can pay. So, for them, they can afford it and we want to make sure that that is part of the arrangement. The Annual Entry Levy was part of the agreement we had with the IRs when we started and we would want to make sure that we stand by our obligations on that.",2,292,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00292
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Thirdly, on contracts and what are our options. It is a 30-year concession period. The licence is renewable depending on the period for which the licence is awarded. We have the first licence for a three-year period. The Casino Regulatory Authority has the option to vary, to terminate, to reduce the duration. There is a range of things we can do.",3,293,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00293
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The point about competition in the region, I think all the more we need to, therefore, be very careful in the way we go about doing this because to completely jettison, also has an implication for the reputation we have as a country. We have committed to this. The IR operators are here because we invited proposals. We have awarded those concessions. We have an obligation to see that through. However, they know that we have a specific set of expectations, not just economic but social and in terms of law and order, and we expect them to comply and meet those expectations.",4,294,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00294

2012-11-16-T-014,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"Mr Speaker, I have two very simple clarifications for the Minister. One is on the visit limits. First and foremost, I must admit that I am not very convinced that the visit limit will be effective. I would like to ask the Minister what is the purpose of imposing visit limits if it is not going to curb the gambling intensity. And why offer this intermediate option if the subject is assessed to be financially vulnerable? Is there any evidence from other jurisdictions that this is going to work? Would it not be better to impose exclusion orders altogether before the subject sinks further into more financial difficulties?",1,296,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00296
2012-11-16-T-014,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),The second is to better understand the casino gambling magnitude in Singapore. The Minister has shared with us that about 20% to 25% of patrons to casinos are Singaporeans and PRs. Can the Minister share with us what percentage of the casinos' revenue can be attributed to the expenses of Singaporeans and PRs?,2,297,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00297
2012-11-16-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Sir, I will answer the first clarification and leave Minister Iswaran to answer the second one. The visit limit is but one of the many tools in our arsenal to deal with problem gambling. The Member asked whether there is evidence from other jurisdictions. Yes, we have studied the models, like the casinos in Holland, and they have proven to be effective in their jurisdiction. We will continue to learn from other jurisdictions and also to improve upon it. As the Member mentioned, we are indeed concerned about the issue of intensification when we impose a visit limit. This is something that we will watch and we are also closely watching the other jurisdictions' practices, and whether there are other things that we can do to better our system.",1,298,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00298
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for the question. It is difficult to track the dollar flow within the casino and attribute it to the source by nationality. I think the Member would appreciate the difficulties in doing so. However, if I were to hazard a guess, what I would say is this. I think Singaporeans are making up 25% to 30% of visitorship, and the likelihood is that Singaporeans are more in the mass gaming areas than in the premium or high roller areas from a proportion point of view. Therefore, if anything, I would expect their contribution to the casino to be lower than that suggested by the percentage in visitorship.",1,299,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00299
2012-11-16-T-014,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I refer to Minister Iswaran's answer. I am glad that the Government is also considering the performance of operators in implementing social safeguards when renewing the licence. I would like to know, what is the Government's definition of poor performance in implementing social safeguards? After two years of operations, what is the Government's report card on these two operators? Have they done well, given that there have been various reports of violations and even charges that are being filed on some of the executives?",1,300,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00300

2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, this is a relatively new jurisdiction that we have so we have a certain set of rules that we have set out. We are evolving and we have now moved another set of amendments. The IR operators are also new to our jurisdiction and, therefore, they have also been adapting. So, have they complied, by and large, in terms of setting up the systems and observing our rules? I would say that, in general, they have made a good effort to comply. However, there have been – as reported in the media – instances where they have been found wanting and in those instances, we have been prepared to take the necessary disciplinary action.",1,302,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00302
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Now, I cannot really give you an overall report card because that is not how we approach this. The CRA has to look at individual instances or a set of instances where breaches have occurred, what are the causative factors, what are the implications and, on that basis, impose a proportionate penalty, which is also why, in this Bill, we have moved for a higher threshold of financial penalties where there have been serious breaches. Because we do think that we need that flexibility for the CRA to be able to prescribe penalties in proportion to various kinds of breaches.",2,303,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00303
2012-11-16-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, I have five questions, three clarifications for Minister Iswaran and two for the Acting Minister Chan. I promise I will make it quick. Regarding the annual entry levy, I understand the Minister's explanations about the premium players and the need to give them an annual entry levy. But surely, there are many people who are buying the annual entry levy who are not premium players. So, is there a way to exclude those people, for example, pairing the annual entry levy with the minimum deposit of $100,000 so that we exclude all those people who are not premium players?",1,304,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00304
2012-11-16-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, on his point about the evaluation panel. I did not say that the CRA does not take into consideration the social safeguards. What I was saying – specifically on the evaluation panel – whether or not that evaluation panel can include aspects of the social impact of the casinos, rather than just be focused on the economic impact. Because this is a panel that is instituted by law and presumably its views carry a lot of weight.",2,305,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00305
2012-11-16-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"The third question for Mr Iswaran is regarding the junkets or the IMAs. I did not say anywhere in my speech that the CRA does not conduct sufficient probity checks on the IMAs. I am glad that the CRA will continue to take a cautious approach. My question was, why is there a need to facilitate more junket operators, which is what the revised regulations seem to be preparing us for – more and larger junket operators.",3,306,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00306

2012-11-16-T-014,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"My two questions for Acting Minister Chan are, firstly, about the period in which the panel of assessors meet. I got this information from the NCPG website, which I just checked and it is still there that the panel of assessors convenes to decide on all family exclusion applications once a month. So, if this has actually been revised to two weeks, I suggest that the Ministry revises that website. Secondly, I do not think the Minister has explicitly responded to my point about the self-exclusions, and whether or not NCPG or the Ministry could promote self-exclusions as a norm so that more schools, more students and social organisations would be encouraged to encourage their members to apply for self-exclusions.",5,308,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00308
2012-11-16-T-014,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first question, I will convey your information to NCPG and get them to update the website. On the second question, yes, we are continuing to promote self-exclusion, but I must say that we do not want only more people to come on board, we want those that are most at-risk to come on board, and that is where we are focusing our efforts. For example, we know many people in the church groups are not in the at-risk group due to their spiritual belief; they do not go to the casinos. If they come on board, we welcome them, but they are not really the target group that we are going after as priority. We are going after those who are most at-risk and we will work with various community groups to ensure that we continue to promote these efforts.",1,309,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00309
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, I thank the Member for his questions. First, on the Annual Entry Levy and whether it can therefore be confined to premium players. My purpose in giving the 1% statistic was to illustrate the proportionality because there was an impression created, certainly by some Members that somehow this is a gaping loophole. It is not.",1,310,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00310
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly then, the question is – and it is implicit in the Member's question – we should not assume that just because someone buys an annual entry levy, he or she has problems with gambling. There are quite legitimate buyers of annual levies as well. So, I think the best way to go about this is, in the course of the more detailed social safeguards implementation that we envisaged, it will certainly emerge who are the people who have a problem with gambling or who are financially vulnerable. In those instances, we must seek to impose limits. If it becomes a systemic problem, then certainly we will have to consider some other measures, perhaps along the lines of what the Member has suggested. But I think it is a bit premature to think about that at this stage.",2,311,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00311
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Thirdly, I appreciate his verification on his point about the evaluation panel. I want to make it clear. The reason we set up this evaluation panel was precisely because this was one area which we need to think of, for the future. Because we are now approaching the end of the development phase of the IRs, and we need to think about how they are going to maintain and improve their facilities in the longer run. This evaluation panel was established expressly for that objective. The social safeguards element is well taken care of through the entire slew of measures and processes we have in place, embedded in the Act and enforced by the Ministry of Social and Family Development. All these trains converge in the CRA, and the CRA ultimately takes a total view in evaluating a casino operator and the operator's compliance to our rules and requirements.",3,312,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00312

2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The final point on the IMAs and I would urge the Member to use the term ""international marketing agent"" rather than junkets because it is not just nomenclature. It is a fundamental point of reference that we want to emphasise. Having said that, first, why is there a need for junket operators? Well, simply because it is part of the industry. I know that there are some pejoratives associated with that, but that is exactly why we have the standards of probity that we have, and we seek to keep it on the straight and narrow.",5,314,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00314
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, does this mean that we are preparing for more IMA licences? By no means. All we are saying is that we want to have a regime in place so that everybody understands, ""This is the deal if you want to come to Singapore"". Just as a casino operator has licensing requirements, the IMA operators will have their own licensing and other requirements.",6,315,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00315
2012-11-16-T-014,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I am glad to hear from the Minister that the loansharks are currently banned from entering the casinos. I would like to ask the Minister if the loanshark runners and those who borrow money are banned from the casinos currently. If not, will the Minister consider that?",1,316,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00316
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, in general, with respect to those who are committing crimes or suspected of committing crimes, the Commissioner of Police, as I have mentioned, has the authority under the Act to impose exclusion orders; in some instances, even on an interim basis whilst things are being investigated to conclusion. As far as borrowers are concerned, it is a bit trickier because it is not always clear how to establish who is a borrower. I think that is going to be a key consideration in deciding whether you exclude. So, I think the better approach in this is through the social safeguards method. If indeed someone is borrowing from loansharks, it means that they are in financial difficulty, which means they will fall within the category of the financially vulnerable and therefore, there will be a need to investigate further into his or her circumstances and appropriate action taken, with respect to casino entry.",1,317,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00317
2012-11-16-T-014,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I was very much heartened and encouraged by the Acting Minister's response on the social safeguards. But as the Second Minister went on about the economic challenges that faced the casinos, I got rather worried. Essentially, my point is that given this tension between the need to maintain social safeguards and to ensure that the casinos are a success – while I appreciate that it is not a false dichotomy – I think we cannot deny that there is that very keen tension. So, my question is, when it comes to the crunch, what gives? Can we have our cake and eat it?",1,318,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00318

2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, first, for the record, I did not go on about economic benefits. I was merely stating the facts as they are. Secondly, I think we have made this point quite clear in the course of the Second Reading speech, Mr Chan's response and my response. We attach great significance to the social safeguards and we want to make sure that the social costs of having casinos in Singapore are well-contained and mitigated. So, that will continue to be our objective.",1,320,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00320
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The point of emphasising the competition and the threats to the economic contribution of the IRs was simply to alert Members, because the predominant tone of the debate has been to presume that the IRs will continue to operate economically at these levels, and we need to, therefore, only focus on the social safeguards. I just wanted to put in a note of caution that we should also be mindful of the fact that the competition will intensify and that, in turn, will have an impact on the performance of the IRs.",2,321,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00321
2012-11-16-T-014,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Just a clarification. For the premium player, the Minister said that the annual levy is also, in a way, designed for them. The confusion is caused when on one side you have the day levy which is $100, on the other side, the annual levy – when you divide it by 365, it is about $5.50. So, it does not look like a safeguard actually. I mean, if the whole thing were to be separated, then it makes more sense. That is what I want to know. If the annual levy is meant for the premium player, then it should not be called a safeguard. Whether it is 1% or 5%, it is also a loophole. It is just a matter of how tolerant we are of the loophole.",1,322,2012-11-16-T-014-S-00322
2012-11-16-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I am not sure I fully understand the Member's point but let me just say this. In most regimes, they do not pay to go to their casinos.

Is the contract of 30 years for the IR or for the casinos? Is there no provision at all? If it is for 30 years for the casinos, is there no provision at all for Singapore to exit the casino industry until 24 years later? That is my first question. The second one is on annual review. I think the higher the frequency of visits, the higher the exposure to gambling and the higher possibility to perhaps problem gambling as well. I will not consider this annual levy a loophole, as Mr Png says – of course, hindsight is always perfect – so I do not want to blame the Minister for that. But the annual levy provision is actually a ""volume discount"", so-called, which is quite a typical marketing strategy.

May I first say that if the annual levy was intended as a volume discount, clearly, based on the outcomes, it is not working. So, my point is, we have debated this, this is the position we are at today. If there is a clear reason why we need to look at this in more detail because there are some specific social consequences that we are trying to mitigate, then I think we will certainly act on it. I am saying that – and it is the response I made earlier to Mr Gerald Giam as well – I think, let us not jump the gun, let us look at the facts, analyse the trends.

That was the proposal on the table. The licence for the casinos is awarded, in the first instance, for three years and it is renewable. What that means is the casino licence is subject to performance and compliance with our laws.

Sir, let me first deal with the changes in this Bill to facilitate the new Carbon Emissions-Based Vehicle (CEV) scheme which was announced earlier this year. For cars and taxis, the CEV scheme will replace the current Green Vehicle Rebate (GVR) scheme with effect from 1 January 2013. For all new and imported used cars with low carbon emissions, vehicle buyers will receive a rebate of between $5,000 and $20,000 off the Additional Registration Fee.

2012-11-16-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),I am glad that the new section 127B of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill empowers public transport officials to inspect and search any baggage or other things carried by a person on any omnibus or within any bus interchange for the purpose of ensuring the security and safety of the commuters. This section mirrors section 23A of the Rapid Transit System (RTS) Act.,2,364,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00364
2012-11-16-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The purpose of checking the bags of the commuters, I suppose, is to prevent the commuters from bringing dangerous goods into the transport system. Under the RTS Act, particularly section 9 of the RTS regulations, it states that no person, unless authorised, shall bring any dangerous goods into the railway premises. When an authorised officer of a train operator searches the bag of a passenger in the train system and finds a dangerous item, the holder of the dangerous item shall be guilty of an offence punishable under section 52 of the RTS regulations. He could be liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000.",3,365,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00365

The Minister for Transport shared with the audience during the annual Transport Gold Award Ceremony last month that he was pleasantly surprised to observe that the queueing culture, as shown in this picture in the Bishan MRT Station, is spreading to other MRT stations. However, the situation outside the Bishan MRT Station at the bus stop is that the people are not as gracious. This picture shows a white car parked near the bus hub and obstructing public buses from calling at the bus hub. The white car was waiting to pick up passengers at the cost of inconveniencing many passengers on the bus while waiting to alight. In addition, such an inconsiderate act would also pose a safety hazard. In fact, there is a car pick-up point just before this bus hub but the white car driver chose not to use it.",1,378,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00378

The next picture shows that both SBST and SMRT buses are affected by such inconsiderate acts. This picture was taken along Woodlands Road. In this picture, we can see that many private buses were using the bus hub, and, hence, competing with the public buses. Similar situations can be observed at the bus hubs outside Clementi, Lakeside, Sembawang MRT stations and many more. I can understand why these private buses need to pick up or alight their passengers at the bus stops near the MRT stations as these are natural transfer hubs. However, I urge the Minister to consider asking LTA to build dedicated private bus pick-up points, just like the one near the Jurong East MRT Station. I can foresee that the Ministry may use site constraints as the reason for not being able to accommodate such a request, but I urge LTA to try harder.",3,380,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00380

In the first 10 months of this year, SBS Transit alone had taken and sent more than 6,000 photographs of vehicles parking near the bus stops or illegally violating bus lanes during bus lane hours, to LTA for its enforcement. This is over and above the enforcement action by LTA and the Traffic Police.

Additionally, in view of workshop owners who may not be aware about the legality of certain modifications, seminars and publications can be made available to facilitate them to make the right and morally ethical conditions, and, in turn, pass on the information to their customers.

When he brought it for annual vehicle inspection, he was penalised as that part did not bear the original manufacturers' name and was deemed an illegal modification, though the car passed all relevant test stations. What he had not known was that he could have contacted LTA to get approval to change car parts with valid reason. Thus, the LTA should publicise this avenue for those who may have bought older cars where original parts are not available in the market.",10,393,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00393

At the other end of the spectrum, 20% of cars will be considered as having low emissions with rebates of up to $20,000. But this leaves the majority, the 60% in the middle, of cars unaffected. Even with the introduction of this new scheme, the majority of car buyers will not be affected. Their purchasing behaviour and their consumption behaviour will not be significantly influenced. One can make an argument that there is the carrot – the lure of the $20,000 rebate – at the low emission end. And maybe people who are within the standard emissions bracket will be persuaded to shift their behaviour downstream. However, with the rising cost of car ownership, this quantum of $20,000 is not a huge relative discount on the purchase price.

I put it that the group of purchasers at the high end – the 20% of high emission cars – is not going to have their purchasing behaviour significantly affected.

To give you an example, the EU's average carbon dioxide emission for cars is about 145 g/km. The average for EU is actually within our low band, not even our standard band. Our average – I do not have the data for our average − if I take the assumption that MOT has set the cut-offs on the basis of the majority of our current car population, and our cut-offs are between 160 g/km to 211 g/km, the mid range is about 180 g/km to 190 g/km.

In addition, there is no consideration in the current scheme, given the fact that real-world driving, much like what is being described in Yishun, does not produce the same amount of emissions as a car would in the laboratory or in a test facility. The phenomenon is known as ""cycle-beating"" by the manufacturers where, under laboratory conditions, the car can be demonstrated to have relatively low emissions because it is driven in an ideal way but, on the road, people can put the pedal to the metal, burn the rubber, race from one red light to the other, apart from generating a lot of noise, using up a lot of fuel, the emissions of the car will increase very, very significantly.

Public education should always be our first line of defence. I agree with my colleague, Er Dr Lee. In addition, all car workshops and their mechanics should be licensed by LTA to provide only approved modifications and parts for modifications or repairs or to assist the motorists to obtain relevant approval for modifications that do not conform to the approved list by LTA before modifications are done.

I am glad they agree that the detention of vehicles is needed as a strong deterrent against illegal modifications, given that we have seen increased incidences of violations. Er Dr Lee would like the penalty to be harsher, whereas Mr Gan received feedback that it is too harsh. I think we are taking a calibrated approach. It is not the intention to go after motorists for the sake of it, but we do need to send a message that illegal modifications are not acceptable. With regard to Mr Gan's concern, I should clarify that the intent is not to detain each and every illegally modified vehicle.

2012-11-16-T-015,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Er Dr Lee talked about the importance of looking at enforcement against workshops. I should say that not all types of modifications are illegal, and so workshops that undertake modification works are not necessarily breaking the law. For example, if the vehicle is going to be used off the road at specialised race tracks, it could be legal. Currently, our enforcement regime targets owners of these illegally modified vehicles. One reason is, as Er Dr Lee earlier pointed out, they did not necessarily do the modifications in a workshop in Singapore. They could go elsewhere to get the modification done, in which case, enforcement against the workshop will not be terribly effective. It is better to enforce against the vehicle owners themselves. That is one reason we have targeted the owners rather than the workshops. Nonetheless, we do agree that it is important to get the workshops on board, and so LTA is in the midst of reviewing the enforcement and legislation against workshops. I thank her for her suggestion. For example, closure of workshops may turn out to be an effective deterrent for them. I also take her feedback very positively that it is not just setting up a deterrent. It is useful to work with the association to promote awareness and also to educate the owners on illegal modifications. So, thank you very much for that.",4,430,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00430

As he has pointed out, the CEV scheme is a step forward in promoting the use of low emission cars. However, as he has also noted, this involves behavioural change. And so, it is not possible to know in advance the exact scale of the impact of the scheme. The scheme is designed such that the maximum price between a high and low emissions car can be up to $40,000, which is more than the open market value of a typical mid-sized car. Existing buying pattern is certainly a reference point. The hope and the expectation are that, certainly, at the margins, vehicle buyers will consider moving from the band which just causes them to be levied a surcharge, into the neutral band, and, for those who are contemplating a purchase of the car that currently falls into the neutral band, to be incentivised by the existence of a rebate and modify their buying behaviour accordingly.",5,431,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00431

We plan to monitor, particularly, motorists' purchasing decisions, before deciding whether to go further and, if so, by how much. For the emissions thresholds that qualify for rebates and taxes, we note Dr Janil's comparison with other jurisdictions. Indeed, we are playing catch-up. But when we think about the thresholds in the future, we will also look at advances in technology, as well as the progress in Singapore's overall mitigation efforts on climate change. I should add that we are introducing the CEV scheme for the first time.

Quite a bit of the difficulties that we face – whether it is illegal modifications, noise pollution, or driver behaviour near to bus hubs – have to do with a lack of consideration for the well-being of other people, other road users, and other public transport users. These types of inconsiderate behaviour – I am sure Members will agree with me – is not something that we can completely overcome by enforcement alone. We certainly need enforcement, and, where appropriate, we should certainly tighten the penalties or make them stiffer. However, I think it would not nearly be enough. It does call for a change of mindset. It does call for us to be more gracious in the way that we drive and we get about on the roads. I think if we can do that, then the enforcement will be more meaningful. On that note, Sir, I thank all Members for their support for the Bill.",12,438,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00438

2012-11-16-T-015,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, Sir, MOT and LTA are always looking at a range of suggestions – and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has just raised two more. We will certainly consider all of them together. Thank you.",1,441,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00441
2012-11-16-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to clarify that of the 6,000 photographs that have been taken by SBS Transit, only a very small proportion is made up of photographs taken by cameras sponsored by LTA. The second clarification that I have is  we would like to thank Minister of State who said that they are agreeable to building more dedicated bus pick-up points for private buses. I hope the Ministry can very soon announce a list of bus stops where there is a high volume of private buses calling, and that some concrete action can be taken. The third clarification is that we understand that LTA has installed some cameras at some of the bus stops and other problematic areas to take photographs of cars that are parked illegally. I would like Minister of State to give an update of that scheme.",1,442,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00442
2012-11-16-T-015,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for his clarifications. On finding appropriate locations to put those private bus bays or drop-off and pick-up points, one of the considerations is how close these are going to be located to various blocks of flats. I can imagine that the difficulty in finding the appropriate sites include some residents who are living closer to those drop-off and pick-up points being quite unwilling to see those drop-off and pick-up points. To them, it may seem as an intrusion into their privacy, and they do not want the vehicles to be stopping so close to where their windows are, for example. The site constraints are actually quite real, and I think, as Members on the ground, we all know it is always good to have a facility or amenity built up, as long as it is not outside my door! That is one challenge that we will have to overcome.",1,443,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00443
2012-11-16-T-015,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The third clarification  I am not sure I heard correctly. Could I ask the Member to repeat it?,2,444,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00444
2012-11-16-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,It is about the fact that LTA has installed cameras in some of the problematic spots to take photographs of the vehicles that are parked inconsiderately. That scheme has been implemented for quite a while. Could the Minister of State give us an update?,1,445,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00445
2012-11-16-T-015,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"May I ask the Member if he is referring to the CCTV scheme that we have started on a pilot basis? Yes. Well, it is a pilot and the purpose of a pilot project is to assess how effective it is. If you look at some of the drivers who have received summonses because of this CCTV monitoring, I have received quite a lot of appeals myself. So, I think it is taking some effect, but I also hesitate to promise that in a short time, we will have CCTV cameras all over the island. Speaking as a motorist myself, I think it is quite frightening that the only way we can enforce against poor driving habits and illegal parking is by having CCTVs islandwide. We will have to be quite circumspect in how to make use of this tool. It is a very good and useful productivity device, but let us take a look at the results of this pilot and then decide what to do henceforth.",1,446,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00446

2012-11-16-T-015,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would just like to seek one clarification. I can understand and appreciate the caution with respect to the tax and rebate quantum, given that car prices are a very emotive issue, and is something very hard to predict, as COEs fluctuate and supply and demand fluctuate with the economic uncertainty. I am questioning whether the same reasoning applies to emission cut-offs. My concern is that once we set a starting point, every time the revision comes up, a variance from that starting point will be something that people will resist. If we already know that other jurisdictions have chosen certain carbon dioxide emission levels or particulate levels as being appropriate, why do we need to start so far away from what is an internationally-accepted standard, given that we are not going to be able to make that leap in one jump the next time we revise this?",1,448,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00448
2012-11-16-T-015,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Secondly, given the life cycle of a car, even if in our next revision we make a substantial move towards this, the cars that are on the road will remain on the road for many, many years. So, if we really want to make an impact in terms of the local emissions and pollution, we need to not play catch-up and be aggressive about getting there ahead of the curve. So, I would like to seek clarification on the need for caution, and I believe the need for caution is different in the two arenas.",2,449,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00449
2012-11-16-T-015,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. Firstly, if we look at the rebates that we are offering, and compare them to some other countries that have similar ""fee-bate"" type of structure, in dollar terms, our rebates are generally more generous towards the motorists. As to the thresholds, because we are introducing the CEVs for the very first time, one consideration that we must always bear in mind is that for the motorists, they must have a reasonable selection of vehicles to choose from that are already imported into our market.",1,450,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00450
2012-11-16-T-015,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"And if we look at the range of vehicles that are made available in the market, that also takes time to adjust. So, whilst we are keen to try and reduce the emissions, we have to be realistic. We have to look at the existing buying patterns and that, if we go too far, we could also at the same time be introducing a big barrier for individuals. So, we will take it one step at a time. As the scheme is implemented and we have more information, at the appropriate juncture, we can make adjustments.",2,451,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00451

2012-11-16-T-015,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"Thank you, Sir. I just want to add one more point. The hon Member mentioned modifications done by workshops, but not all cases actually are done by workshops. In fact, there are cases that are Do-It-Yourself (DIY), and the parts are procured by the workshops. So, I think we should also look at that aspect, whether how far, or to what extent, the law should be applied. That is question one. Question two is whether the Ministry will consider public education, such as media education, to constantly educate the public. The public may not be aware that what they did is actually an offence.",1,453,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00453
2012-11-16-T-015,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, on the first question, yes, we agree with him. On the second question, the answer is yes as well.",1,454,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00454

2012-11-16-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"I will not ask any more after this. I just want to clarify that I anticipated that the Ministry will use the site constraints as the reason to say they may not be able to accommodate to build pick-up points dedicated to private buses. But I would like the Ministry to consider starting at those bus stops outside the MRT stations that are quite far away from the residential area. For example, the Harbourfront MRT Station, the Kranji MRT Station as well as Lakeside MRT Station for the moment are quite far away from the residential blocks.",1,458,2012-11-16-T-015-S-00458
