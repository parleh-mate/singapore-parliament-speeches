2018-02-05-T-001,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what is the Ministry's position on the dating platform TheSugarBook which targets young females and whether the Ministry will be taking steps to address the possible harm and exploitation that such young females could be subjected to.,1,1,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00001
2018-02-05-T-001,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what measures are in place to protect teenagers and young persons from online platforms such as TheSugarBook that aim to capitalise on their emotional or financial vulnerabilities and exploit them sexually.,1,2,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00002
2018-02-05-T-001,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether online platforms such as TheSugarBook are legal in Singapore and what actions will be taken to ensure vice activities do not proliferate through such a channel.,1,3,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00003

2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Speaker, Sir, sugar dating platforms like The SugarBook commoditise and devalue relationships under the cover of a ""mutually beneficial arrangement"". Relationships become transactional  an exchange of money and gifts in return for companionship and ""other"" services.",1,6,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00006
2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,,2,7,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00007
2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But what is of greater concern is that the site targets young people who are in their late teens and early 20s, even while they are still students at Polytechnics or Universities, exposing them to the risks of being exploited and abused. These transactions are fundamentally imbalanced, in the favour of older and wealthier people. Young women, for instance, may feel pressurised to comply with their wishes or demands, and risk physical or sexual harm if they reject them.",3,8,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00008

For instance, if there is any procurement of sexual services for payment, the Police will take enforcement action under the Women’s Charter, including possibly against the website and its owners.",5,10,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00010

2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"While we collectively object to such websites, the more effective and enduring solution lies in increasing the awareness of young people to such dangers, so that they exercise discretion and good judgement when navigating the online world. Students in MOE schools are taught to establish boundaries for personal safety, discern risks, and exercise sound judgement when going onto online platforms and managing relationships, both online and offline. In addition, during Cyber Wellness lessons, they learn about safe and responsible use of technology and cover topics such as danger with cyber contacts. They will also link up with our Universities and Polytechnics to help raise awareness of such risks. At the same time, parents play a critical role in guiding their children and helping them to stay away from undesirable online content.",7,12,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00012

2018-02-05-T-001,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I thank the Minister for his answer. I am very heartened by the Ministry's views. I just have two supplementary questions. First, building on what the Minister has said that the Police and the Ministry will take a closer look at these sites, I hope that this can be done very proactively and decisively, when it is very clear that what the Ministry is advocating is not adhered to. My second question is a broader question, which is how do we balance the need between freedom of young adults to do as they wish, whilst curbing the platforms of these activities which are not aligned to our social norms.",1,15,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00015
2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I thank Mr Seah for his concerns, well expressed. I give the Member the assurance that as we had responded to in the Parliamentary Question (PQ) answer, we will keep an eye on the site and other like sites, and take action if laws are violated. In terms of finding the right balance between the freedom of people, including young people to make moral choices within the realm of what is legally permissible, and acting as a regulator to curb sites both online and of course in the real world platforms to protect, I think we need to strike the right balance.",1,16,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00016

2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Certain sites, for example Ashley Madison, if the Member recalls, in 2013, the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA)'s predecessor, the Media Development Authority (MDA), acted decisively to ban the site because the site explicitly advocated through its portal extra-marital affairs and infidelity. They had proposed to set up the site in Singapore and for the founder to fly in and launch the site. That ran right up against our core values on protecting the family and preserving family values. So, we acted decisively then.",3,18,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00018

2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But the Member would know that in the online realm, it is very broad. There are many aspects of the online world that are very troubling. And yet, locking and banning every such site, whatever its subject matter may be, is not the most enduring way in which to protect Singaporeans, including young Singaporeans from such risks.",5,20,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00020

2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The key is to put in a lot of effort educating children from young and continuing well into the teenage years and beyond, so that they are aware of these risks. The key is that families, individuals, communities and society as a whole, need to continuously recognise the values that hold us together. With that kind of internalisation of values, we put each and every individual in as best a position as possible when making his or her moral decisions.",7,22,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00022
2018-02-05-T-001,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"I thank the Minister for clarifying the Ministry's position on this. I have two supplementary questions. The first is, I understand the Minister's point, but on this particular website TheSugarBook, it was featured in a mainstream teenager magazine just earlier this year. I would like to ask what is the Ministry's position on this. The concern is whether by being featured in such mainstream teenager magazines, the wrong signal will be sent that this is a mainstream channel or platform for teenagers to make use of. This is also taking into consideration that we collectively object to such websites.",1,23,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00023

2018-02-05-T-001,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"The second question is, I think the more important thing is to address the root cause. I would like to ask the Ministry whether there will be any effort to be taken to understand the reasons why young people are taking to such websites as one of the options to finance whatever their endeavours are, including studies. So, whether the Ministry will be taking a proactive effort to reach out and help these young people so that they become less susceptible to such lures?",3,25,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00025
2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Speaker, I agree with the Member that we need to work with all aspects of society, including the private sector, to see whether it is appropriate for them to be advocating or advertising for such platforms and activities. This is an on-going conversation. As I had said earlier in my reply, we will keep a very close eye on TheSugarBook and other like sites.",1,26,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00026
2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,,2,27,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00027
2018-02-05-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In terms of the root cause, this is something that we continually study. People, including young people, make moral choices based on the internal sense of what is right, what is wrong, what is white, what is black and what is grey. What is important is that from a young age and all through life, we give individuals the opportunity to be exposed to good moral values. The role of family is critical and that is why MSF provides programmes in which parents can pick up and strengthen parenting skills. We work very closely with schools on such curriculum. We have social networks such as Family Service Centres (FSCs) and other VWOs that partner us in supporting families that run into crisis. For example, when the children present certain behavioural issues, it is a whole of community effort.",3,28,2018-02-05-T-001-S-00028

Further, whether there is any scope of review of the role of TMP, perhaps in providing and enhancing services to the families, for example in counselling or allowing for financial planning classes for the families.",3,37,2018-02-05-T-002-S-00037
2018-02-05-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Sir, I thank Mdm Rahayu for the supplementary questions. Looking at the details and numbers, as I had said earlier, we cannot see any trend. Nevertheless, from 2013 to 2017, numbers have gone down. In 2013, it was 63 new applications; 2014 saw 55 new applications; 2015 saw 36 new applications; 2016 saw 70 new applications and 2017 saw 38 new applications. So, as a whole, we feel that the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents (CMP) has been able to help in facilitating to resolve the issues amicably. The number of applications at TMP has dropped since 2011. We feel that this can be attributed largely to the CMP's success in resolving maintenance disputes through conciliation.",1,38,2018-02-05-T-002-S-00038
2018-02-05-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,,2,39,2018-02-05-T-002-S-00039
2018-02-05-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Since 2011, CMP has resolved eight out of the 10 cases with 90% of these cases being resolved within three months. We feel that with better upfront conciliation, fewer applications are being filed at the TMP. The applications fell from 63 in 2013 to 38 in 2017. It is not only about conciliation or about how we can help them. If along the way, we find that there are efforts that we can carry out at the SSO level by community agencies, we will do our best to refer. We want to promote filial piety; we want families to be able to support one another; and the community can play a part in this.",3,40,2018-02-05-T-002-S-00040

We do know that there are strains for many families in this day and age, and every family that we can help first publicise this avenue and how conciliations can result in success.

This is standard international practice. However, with climate change, we can expect more intense rainfalls to be the norm in the future. A study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research found that flood risks from rainfall changes will increase in the next two to three decades, due to global warming from greenhouse gases already emitted into the atmosphere.

Let me just take one example. Bedok Canal, which serves some of the affected areas, is being widened at a cost of $128 million to expand its width from38m to 44m, wide enough to accommodate an expressway of 10 lanes, five lanes each way. Even with this widening, we cannot guarantee that there will be no floods in future, as rainfall events of even higher intensity could still occur that exceed the design capacity. This is especially so with climate change. To deal with the most extreme historical rainfall events, the Bedok Canal would need to be widened to at least 62m, displacing the Bedok Park Connector and community spaces adjacent to the Canal, and possibly even affecting the surrounding residential areas.",19,70,2018-02-05-T-003-S-00070

2018-02-05-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This will look like a 16-lane expressway. Given competing needs for other land uses such as housing, parks and roadsides, we have to be practical in our drainage expansion in Singapore. We have to design with practical considerations and not for extreme conditions all the time for all places. Building our drains for extreme conditions would mean that much of the capacity would be extremely costly, but not needed most of the time. We will, however, ensure our critical infrastructure is well-protected from such extreme rainfalls. This is achieved through the ""source-pathway-receptor"" approach which was developed based on the recommendation of the Drainage Expert Panel to implement a holistic range of interventions.",21,72,2018-02-05-T-003-S-00072

Under this approach, other than improving the pathways, or the drains, we also manage the source, which refers to where the rain falls. Measures include detention tanks to slow down surface runoff and reduce the amount of storm water entering the drains during peak rainfall. For instance, the Stamford Detention Tank and the Stamford Diversion Canal are constructed to protect Orchard Road against floods. These are still under construction. Built beneath a nursery and coach bay of the Tyersall Learning Forest, the Stamford Detention Tank will temporarily hold excess storm water from the drains. After the rain subsides, the storm water will be pumped back into the drains for subsequent discharge into Marina Reservoir.",23,74,2018-02-05-T-003-S-00074

Now, together with the drain and the receptor, source and completion of all the projects there, we will have a better chance of avoiding the flash floods.

Would the Senior of State not agree with me that we would be better able to shape user behaviour if we impose a fine on those users who park their bicycles in a manner that obstruct fire exits and wheelchair ramps?",1,140,2018-02-05-T-004-S-00140
2018-02-05-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I totally agree with Mr Lim. In fact, that is the intention. With the new legislative framework, we do want the BSOs to impose some form of disincentive with regard to renting out of the bicycles. I would just like to remind all Members of the House that while there may be interim inconveniences and disamenities, I would like to reiterate that there are actually many benefits of the bike-sharing scheme, not just the disamenities that we are currently facing, which may be transient in nature. Benefits include transport flexibility in terms of first and last mile connectivity. There will be reductions in vehicle emissions if we are able to bring the population of car ownership down. In addition to that, there are also health benefits of cycling. It will also reduce congestion and fuel consumption. More importantly, it complements our vision of a car-lite society.",1,141,2018-02-05-T-004-S-00141

Senior citizens and persons with disabilities enjoy this discount on top of their regular 25% discounts. The new scheme was launched with wide publicity. PTC, LTA and the public transport operators have placed posters at all MRT stations and buses since the middle of December last year.

I do not have the data that Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has asked for, except to say that when we design a public scheme, it must benefit as wide a number of people as possible. After all, we are spending taxpayers' money. When the scheme was formulated, I suppose we were optimistic that there would be many who will benefit and make the switch. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be so. I think it is the right decision on the part of PTC to recommend disbanding this but, instead, bring out a new scheme, which is what we are enjoying today, which will benefit hundreds and thousands of commuters.",1,156,2018-02-05-T-005-S-00156

There has been feedback from parents, especially in schools whereby there are younger parents and more children, that some schools have to prioritise the after-school student care for the lower Primary students. This has caused some inconvenience, especially when they have two or more children in school and one of them has to go into the private space. Can I check with the Minister if the plan is to cater capacity for all levels of Primary school students?",1,173,2018-02-05-T-006-S-00173

2018-02-05-T-015,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. First and foremost, I want to thank HDB for extending the Goodwill Repair Scheme to flats up to 15 years. In all fairness, this is a generous goodwill offer.",1,273,2018-02-05-T-015-S-00273
2018-02-05-T-015,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),,2,274,2018-02-05-T-015-S-00274
2018-02-05-T-015,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I have two further questions for the Second Minister. I do have higher reported cases as well in the first two weeks of January. In fact, it was more than 30 cases reported. I do notice that certain clusters of flats have more cases. I want to ask the Second Minister if indeed it is a batch problem, whether it is a problem with quality or workmanship. Therefore if that is the case, would HDB be flexible to extend that goodwill repair to those cases, even though it is after 15 years?",3,275,2018-02-05-T-015-S-00275
2018-02-05-T-015,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),,4,276,2018-02-05-T-015-S-00276
2018-02-05-T-015,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, I hope the Second Minister can understand that when residents see the tiles popping up on the floor, it can be quite a traumatic experience. And the next shocking truth is, of course, to know the costs of repair, which can range from $5,000 to $10,000. For a three- to four-room flat, with a household income of $2,000 to $4,000 a month, I think that is a major outlay. If they are not lucky enough to have the tiles pop up before 15 years, they have to go and find ways to find cash to pay for it.",5,277,2018-02-05-T-015-S-00277

2018-02-05-T-015,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, would the HDB look at other ways to assist residents who are faced with such problems, because we do not want them to resort to licensed or unlicensed moneylending to fix the tiles. Can HDB facilitate some kind of financing scheme, very much like how other agencies have done, the SME financing or the Study Loan where we work with the Financial Institutions to do it.",7,279,2018-02-05-T-015-S-00279

2018-02-05-T-015,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"Given that HDB does have the flat as a collateral, would the Second Minister consider this?",1,281,2018-02-05-T-015-S-00281
2018-02-05-T-015,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Speaker, Sir, for the first question if the Member can flag out the specific blocks, we will get HDB to look at the causes, or look at the popping tiles and see what might have caused it and we will then follow up appropriately.",1,282,2018-02-05-T-015-S-00282

2018-02-05-T-015,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"On second question, as I said earlier, if local residents face financial difficulties in dealing with popping tiles beyond the 15-year period, then they can approach their local CDCs and their local Grassroots Advisors to see if there are schemes that can assist them. There are some CDCs that already have such schemes in place and these have been of great help to residents.",3,284,2018-02-05-T-015-S-00284

2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The key question is related to the liability of company directors, governing board members, key officers of charities and officers of societies.

2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Court of Appeal also ruled that these officers do not come within the term, the meaning of a professional “agent”, and therefore, they were not liable for the more serious penalties under section 409 of the Penal Code for criminal breach of trust. Section 409 provides for a maximum of life imprisonment.",6,292,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00292
2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Government's policy is clear. If you are a senior officer, director in the organisation, you are in a position of greater trust. You have considerable authority to make decisions in relation to the organisation’s assets. If you abuse that trust, you should be more culpable and should be liable for more severe punishments, compared with an ordinary employee. That is really common sense and there can be no question about that.",7,293,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00293
2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"For the last 40 years, the law, as applied by the courts, reflected this principle. In 1976, the High Court ruled so in the case of Tay Choo Wah. It said that directors are liable for the aggravated offence provided under section 409. After that decision, the position was clear, settled law. The law was applied in that way for over 40 years, by courts in other cases. There are at least 16 decisions – reported – applying this principle and there must be many other unreported decisions.",8,294,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00294
2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"In April last year, however, the position changed. The High Court ruled that directors cannot be liable under section 409. That was contrary to the decision in 1976, and the way the courts have applied section 409 over these 40 years.",9,295,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00295
2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Government asked AGC what should be done, what further steps ought to be taken after the High Court's ruling. AGC advised that a clarification should be sought from the Court of Appeal by way of a Reference. We now have two conflicting positions from the High Court. One, Tay Choo Wah and the line of cases that applied Tay Choo Wah. And second, the City Harvest Church case where the Court disagreed with Tay Choo Wah. The Court of Appeal gave its decision, as I said earlier, last Thursday in response to the two questions of law submitted by AGC.",10,296,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00296
2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Court of Appeal's decision means that there is now a lacuna in the law. As it stands today, ordinary employees can be charged under section 408 of the Penal Code. That provides for more serious penalties for criminal breach of trust compared with section 408. It is punishable by mandatory imprisonment for up to 15 years, and an optional fine. Directors, however, can only be charged under section 406 – which provides for a lesser punishment up to seven years’ jail or fine or both. The Court of Appeal itself acknowledged this gap in the law and it said that there was no ""good policy reason"" to ignore the “heightened culpability” of directors and key officers of charities, societies and companies who commit criminal breach of trust. The Court of Appeal also pointed out that the obligation of the court is to set out the legal position correctly on what the law says, and to leave it to Parliament to amend the law as it deems fit.",11,297,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00297

2018-02-05-T-016,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Minister for the clarifications. As rightly pointed out, I also personally received a lot of feedback. On the ground, people are commenting that the court let those who are rich go lightly and also those who can get off for religious reasons. The worst is they also commented that for this particular case, it was handled by a so-called lawyer who is also a Member of Parliament from PAP. So, may I know what is the Minister's stand on this and a clarification on his comments. Also, what can the Government do about all these comments and also how should we proceed from here?",1,303,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00303
2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank the Member for the question. I think Mr Edwin Tong would not be entirely happy to be called ""a so-called lawyer and MP"". I think he is a qualified lawyer and a Senior Counsel. I said earlier that it is entirely legitimate to express one's unhappiness about court decisions. But some statements have, indeed, gone too far – abusing the judges personally; ascribing improper ulterior motives to their decision. And it is, really, a clear case of abusing the anonymity of the Net or anonymity to the extent that it exists. Just because you do not agree with the judges does not mean that you have the right to abuse them and challenge their integrity. People who abuse judges, challenge their integrity will be prosecuted if a case for contempt can be made out. I will set out later some factors which will be relevant in this context.",1,304,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00304
2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The courts should not be pressured by public opinion. They should be free to decide in accordance with what they believe the law to be. Criminal cases must be tried in a court of law, not in the court of public opinion.",2,305,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00305
2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A few years ago, I already expected that there would be more and more of such scurrilous attacks on the judiciary. If left alone, they will become the norm. That is why we legislated into law the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act. One of those opposing it, I think, it was Mr Perera asked me in this House why the need for this law. This is one relatively small illustration. If we do nothing, it will get much worse and become unsolvable. We do not want to end up like the United Kingdom where the press freely attacks the judiciary. You get newspaper headlines screaming banner headlines labelling judges as ""enemies of the people"", ""you fools"" because the courts have the temerity to decide in a way that the media did not like. If we are not careful, we will easily go down that route.",3,306,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00306
2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me give Members a current example. There is a public Facebook group with a Chinese name which I understand can be translated as a ""policy discussion forum"". I was informed that a copy of a news article was posted on 2 February, last week, on this Facebook. The article had appeared in the Chinese news daily Wanbao on the same day. It was a report on the City Harvest Church matter. The title of the news article, the banner headlines had, however, been faked in the Facebook post. The original title translated was and I quote, ""Outdated laws saved the accused from harsher penalties"". Someone appeared to have faked the title into and I quote, ""PAP lawyer saved the accused from harsher penalties"", making it look as if a mass circulation newspaper had done so, probably to give more credence to the headline.",4,307,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00307
2018-02-05-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"AGC takes the view that the suggestion from the fake title is that the PAP MP was responsible for an unfair, unjust outcome and the courts have let off the defendants lightly because of him. AGC's view is that this is a case of contempt by scandalising the courts. I do not want to go into the meanings of the fake title because the matter is with AGC and it will be dealt with in accordance with the law. Whatever the meaning of the statement and regardless of whether or not it is in contempt, one can see that this sort of attack based on deliberate faking is quite unacceptable. I cannot see how any reasonable person will justify such faking as a legitimate expression of free speech.",5,308,2018-02-05-T-016-S-00308

Rule of law, a civilised system of having trials in court depend, amongst other things, on lawyers being able to act for defendants whatever offences the defendants are accused of. As I have said before several times, even a child rapist is entitled to his day in court and to be defended. It does not mean that we or the lawyer defending the person approves of child rape.

I am probably in the unique position in Singapore of someone who has both acted for the three Prime Ministers of Singapore and also of having acted against all three of them. In 1995, Prime Minister Goh, Senior Minister Lee and Deputy Prime Minister Lee, as they were then, sued the International Herald Tribune (IHT) for libel. The IHT came to me. The conversation as to whether I would act for them took about two minutes. I told them they must know I was a PAP Member of Parliament, and were they comfortable that they would get the best possible advice from me, given my position? They knew that I was a PAP Member of Parliament. They said it was okay with them, if it was okay with me. It was okay with me.

He said that I was close to the three of them, meaning the Prime Minister, Senior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. I was a PAP Member of Parliament.

It is quite shameful. Supposing no action is taken when public Facebook pages do this, then what is there to prevent the media itself from publishing such articles in the future? By action here, I do not necessarily just mean contempt action, if we accept such faking as normal, then you can see that the line between that and the current position of the UK almost disappears.

If there are any charges to be brought in respect of actions that have taken place before any legislative changes, I am sure AGC will take into account what the appropriate charge is.

It could not have been the intention of the drafters to deal with the directors, because Company Law had not been developed to the extent that it has now. And therefore, it could not have been within the minds and the drafting intention. Therefore, you would need new provisions which deal with it. There are different approaches to interpretation.

2018-02-05-T-017,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"The first change is to exclude Intellectual Property Income from Pioneer Service Companies, and Development and Expansion Incentive",4,335,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00335

Accordingly, IP income will be removed from the scope of the Pioneer Service Companies (PSC) and Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) schemes, which currently provide for tax exemption or concessionary tax rates respectively on income from qualifying activities, which may include IP income.",5,336,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00336

2018-02-05-T-017,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),The second change is to enhance the Integrated Investment Allowance (IIA).

2018-02-05-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"MNCs and local enterprises are the two large engines which steer Singapore’s economic development. MNCs which come to Singapore, besides directly creating employment opportunities, also spur the development of related industries. Some local companies have leveraged on the opportunities of collaborating with MNCs to improve the technology content of their products and services, and have gradually become world-class companies. This win-win collaborative model is the outcome businesses look forward to most.",3,347,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00347
2018-02-05-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"After going through the Bill, I would like to focus on one new content in particular  the new section 97ZHA states that after companies have successfully applied for the Integrated Investment Allowance, in the event that they fail to comply with any term or condition as specified, or the outcome indicators, not only will the tax incentive be terminated, the Government can also recover this particular investment allowance already given. This amendment is very timely.",4,348,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00348

2018-02-05-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),One of the ways is to strengthen the supervision of tax incentives and guard against abuse. The amended Bill would enable stronger auditing and oversight of the tax incentives. This is good for our taxpayers.,6,350,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00350
2018-02-05-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Also, I would like to ask the Minister if the current amendment to the Bill was spurred by an increase in the number of errant cases in recent years.",7,351,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00351
2018-02-05-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Of greater concern to businesses is that the value-add effect on local companies brought about by such tax incentives to attract foreign investment seems to have waned. Quite a number of businesses have told me that they miss the Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP) which was phased out in 2010. The programme, extremely useful then in promoting win-win collaboration between foreign investors and local enterprises, continues to be well-regarded today.",8,352,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00352
2018-02-05-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"In the earlier years, foreign companies which invested in the traditional sectors here could generate significant opportunities and value-add for related or supporting local companies both downstream and upstream, and create direct and indirect employment opportunities for Singaporeans.",9,353,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00353
2018-02-05-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"However, in recent years, most of the MNCs attracted to Singapore are in the emerging sectors which establish their regional headquarters or R&D centres here. The activities which can create value-add for local companies, such as product design, manufacturing, industry supply chain, and distribution are however located in other countries in the region. It is no longer easy for local enterprises to take the local advantage in becoming service providers for the MNCs like before.",10,354,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00354
2018-02-05-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Therefore, our SMEs should step up venturing overseas in line with the government policy to encourage businesses to internationalise.

2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I stand in support of this Bill. It is encouraging that the Government continues to support companies through tax reliefs. However, I would like to seek some clarifications and offer some suggestions.",1,357,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00357
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, clause 2 of the Bill amends section 3 of the Act by inserting a new definition of ""Intellectual Property Income"". This is defined as ""any intellectual property income prescribed by the Minister under section 102"". Section 102 of the Act, amongst other things, empowers the Minister to make regulations that may be necessary or expedient for purposes of carrying out provisions of the Act.",2,358,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00358
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister clarify why the meaning of Intellectual Property Income is not specifically defined within the Bill? What are the assessment criteria that will be considered by the Minister in prescribing a particular income as Intellectual Property Income? Will this be based on quantitative or qualitative data?,3,359,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00359
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The reason I am asking is because greater transparency and less ambiguity in the legislation itself will only enable Pioneer Service Companies and Development and Expansion Companies to better understand what constitutes Intellectual Property Income, and correspondingly whether their activities will fall under the tax incentive scheme.",4,360,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00360
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I understand that EDB does publish guidelines from time to time on its website, such as guidelines related to the Pioneer Certificate Incentive (PC) and Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI). However, if the principle behind the Act and this Bill, is to encourage companies to grow capabilities, develop high-value and substantive economic activities, through tax reliefs, then it is crucial for companies to have a clear understanding what the parameters are for them to qualify for tax reliefs. A clear understanding will allow companies to better plan their business and growth strategies.",5,361,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00361
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I raised a related point in 2016 during the previous iteration of the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill on the need to have clearer qualifying criteria for PC and DEI. Then, Minister Lim replied that it is a balance between clarity, transparency and ensuring we remain flexible and responsive to the increasingly complex economic environment.",6,362,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00362
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I understand the Minister's point, but I have two follow-up queries.",7,363,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00363
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"One, I think responsiveness can be achieved through the mechanism of legislative amendments, which allows the Government to continually review the incentives and schemes to maintain its relevance. This possibly explains why we are legislating amendments to the Act via this Bill within a relatively short period of time from the last amendment in March 2016.",8,364,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00364
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Two, flexibility may also be achieved through the actual operative provisions in the Act, instead of relying on broad definitions of a key term. To my mind, it is a tenuous argument to rely on flexibility to justify why the definition of an important term, such as Intellectual Property Income, should be left to the Minister to prescribe. Hence, will the Minister consider including a specific clear definition of Intellectual Property Income within the Bill?",9,365,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00365
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, can the Minister clarify how the amendments relating to the exclusion of IP income as stated in clause 5 of the Bill fit into the new IP regime administered by EDB, named the IP Development Incentive (IDI) announced during the 2017 Singapore Budget?",10,366,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00366
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I note that IRAS published a table stating that IDI incorporates the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reports (BEPS)-compliant modified nexus approach and it is meant to encourage the exploitation of IP arising from research and development activities. Can the Minister clarify how the IDI works in practice with the legislative amendments in this Bill?,11,367,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00367
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"On the point of BEPS, I understand from a Facebook feedback by Mr Gregg Fong that as a result of the BEPS framework, tax authorities globally have put in place more stringent rules to ensure taxpayers pay their fair share of taxes. Therefore, it is unwise to assume that tax incentives remain attractive for MNCs in this post-BEPS era, and now more so than ever, tax incentives need to make business sense for MNCs and economic sense for Singapore.",12,368,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00368
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In this context, the queries raised by Mr Fong are  how do these Bill amendments and the existing broader tax incentive schemes fit in with Singapore's broader strategic goals?",13,369,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00369
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Mr Fong pointed out that historically, the initial intention of tax incentives was to attract top MNCs to invest in Singapore, and this worked very well. The tax incentives were then gradually tweaked as Singapore’s economy grew.",14,370,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00370
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister explain how the current amendments adjust the tax incentives such that they remain relevant and are aligned with Singapore's current strategic goals? And can the Minister clarify what these amendments will mean for companies who did invest and are continually investing in Singapore?,15,371,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00371
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Also, do the existing tax incentives schemes and these amendments ensure fair employment opportunities for Singaporeans in managerial positions? Can the Minister provide data over the past three years on the relationship between the number of foreign MNCs, with a regional office in Singapore, who are enjoying such tax incentives, and the percentage of Singaporeans in managerial positions in these MNCs?",16,372,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00372
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Mr Fong clarified that this query is not coming from a place of an anti-foreigner sentiment, but it is taking a practical approach as logically, MNCs would enjoy significant costs savings, from such tax incentive schemes and general manpower costs savings, if they are able to upskill Singaporeans over a period of time, and transfer these skills from expatriate foreigners to Singaporeans.",17,373,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00373
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Third, on a broader practical level, how do these legislative amendments and various schemes and incentives from Government agencies such as EDB and SPRING all work together from the perspective of an SME who wishes to take advantage of these available tools?",18,374,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00374
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"From the Minister's reply in 2016, I understand that for the current PC Incentive scheme, between 2011 and 2015, only two out of 71 PCs were awarded to SMEs, of which only one was a local SME. The explanation then was that PC application requires companies to commit to economic contributions of substantive scale. Hence, it is natural that bigger companies qualify.",19,375,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00375
2018-02-05-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Keeping in mind that the principle behind this Bill and the Act is to put in place tax incentives to encourage innovation, I wish to ask whether there are ways in which our SMEs can benefit from these amendments. Smaller companies are able to respond and react to market conditions, and remain agile and flexible. Thus, it appears that SMEs by their very nature are better placed to embrace innovation and position their businesses to adapt to changes rapidly, in line with the principles of the Act. If we are structuring the tax incentives to largely allow for bigger companies to meet the criteria, can the Minister clarify how this is in line with the principles of the Act?",20,376,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00376

This symbiotic relationship between the industry and the Government is highly commendable.,5,382,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00382
2018-02-05-T-017,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"The proposed six amendments to the Economic Expansion Act are reasonable in my opinion. The removal of the prescribed Intellectual Property, or in short, IP, Income from the tax incentives scheme of both Pioneer Service Companies and Development and Expansion Companies under Part III section 19A and Part IIIB section 19M are questionable. However, I believe it is apt as Singapore's economic landscape has moved from a labour-intensive to a knowledge, with high skills-based platform.",6,383,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00383
2018-02-05-T-017,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Thus, after many years of investing and working with the industry, it is reasonable to expect that in IP, it should be one of the main activities of the affected companies. Thus, it is also reasonable to consider income from IP as a source of revenue in the current context in Singapore.",7,384,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00384
2018-02-05-T-017,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"While this change may be able to get absorbed by larger companies like the Pioneer Service Companies and larger-sized SMEs, I am very concerned over smaller ones which have not been able to capitalise on incentive scheme. I believe there are pockets of local SMEs who are stuck in their business activities in the old and traditional way. While they may not be seen as high-tech but they do serve the need of the larger Singapore labour workforce by providing jobs. Thus, I would like to suggest that the incentive as previously prescribed should be extended to the smaller SMEs and perhaps, more should be done to assist them to move up the ladder in implementing technology in the business activities. As an example, I would like to highlight the cleaning industry and the small public works contractor industry.",8,385,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00385

Smaller SMES are hardest hit with the constant disruption which is prevailing at smaller intervals, from fintech to augment the reality, smaller SMEs find it harder to cope as they do not have the muscle and capacity to spend in research and development work, less IP work. And when they do, it will be a strain to their business operations. Hence, the extension of the prevailing scheme to smaller SMEs will go a long way.

In this regard, the Government has pro-actively reached out to the companies and consulted them on the draft legislations. This, among other things, include the definition of IP income, which will be made clear in the subsidiary legislations. As I mentioned in the earlier debate in 2016, it is better for us and it is more effective for us to define IP income in the subsidiary legislation than in the main legislation so that the objective is still achieved – you have transparency, clarity and at the same time you have more responsiveness and flexibility by doing so in subsidiary legislation.",5,393,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00393
2018-02-05-T-017,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"So, these amendments in this Bill will help to provide our companies that have invested in or are continuing to invest in Singapore with more certainty. This is because our incentives have been reviewed by the international community and they meet international tax standards ahead of many other countries and jurisdictions, which are still in the midst of reviewing their tax regimes. We remain committed to being a competitive location for anchoring substantive economic activities, and will continue to monitor global developments.",6,394,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00394

This is because by hiring fairly and based on merit, companies would have access to a wider talent pool and reap the benefits from increased productivity. The Singapore Government, of course, helps our companies to develop the career of the Singaporeans in their employment. In our engagements with companies, we work with them to develop training and career development programmes for their employees, for example, the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative (LDI) is one such scheme that employers registered or incorporated in Singapore can leverage on to create and enhance in-house leadership development programmes. These programmes, which are company-centric and sector-specific, can also be implemented through collaborations with external training providers.",7,395,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00395

Mr Louis Ng and Mr Azmoon Ahmad have asked how small and medium enterprises can benefit from these amendments. In general, our tax incentives, including the ones in the EEIA, are open to application by all companies, regardless of size, as long as they are able to commit to making significant contributions to our economy. In this instance, with the liberalisation of the Integrated Investment Allowance (IIA), SMEs can enjoy more flexibility in their business arrangements with their foreign counterparts.",8,396,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00396
2018-02-05-T-017,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"I would also like to clarify one of the points that Mr Thomas Chua mentioned regarding the Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP). I would like to clarify that LIUP was not phased out, but rather subsumed under the Partnerships for Capability Transformation (PACT) scheme. As Members would remember, the LIUP scheme essentially caters to the relationship of our local SMEs who are suppliers to the multinational or the large companies. But we think the relationship can go beyond that of just a supplier relationship, and therefore we have expanded the LIUP scheme to the PACT scheme which encompasses different forms of collaborations and partnerships, beyond just a supplier relationship.",9,397,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00397
2018-02-05-T-017,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"The second point that Mr Chua mentioned about the new section 97ZHA, it has always been our practice that if the companies do not adequately meet up to their commitments set out in the incentives, we will withdraw the incentives and recover the incentives made to them. So, this is nothing new. This section is just to regularise our practice. The Government will continue to recover the IIA awarded if the company fails any conditions or breaches the legislative amendments. I would like to highlight that there are no errant cases in the last five years for IIA and the current amendments are therefore not reactionary in nature, but are being made for legislative clarity.",10,398,2018-02-05-T-017-S-00398

2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, the Cybersecurity Bill is timely, given its focus to strengthen the defences of our essential services and critical information infrastructure (CII) from cybersecurity threats – from both private and state players.",2,460,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00460
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We see a growing evidence of how countries are being threatened by digital sabotage which targets essential services to cause disruption to the economy, as well as to confuse and demoralise citizens.",3,461,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00461
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The Ukraine experience, as Minister has shared earlier on, was one that is almost becoming a cyber-hacking ""testbed"" for other foreign state actors. On December 23, 2015, the control centres of three Ukrainian electricity distribution companies were taken control, where malicious hackers opened breakers which caused more than 200,000 households to lose power. Nearly a year later, on 17 December 2016, a single transmission substation in northern Kiev lost power. These instances of sabotage took place on the tail of a political revolution in Kiev and the annexation of Crimea.",4,462,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00462
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"While similar attacks have not shown to be highly-motivated acts of sabotage in Singapore, in September last year, the Cyber-Security Agency had reported that several critical sectors were subjected to cyber-attacks, and that the Singapore Government had been subjected to a malware attack by state-sponsored hackers. We have been fortunate that the recent Wannacry, Meltdown and Spectre malware attacks have not disrupted our essential services.",5,463,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00463
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Nonetheless, these attacks are a clear and present danger to a compact nation like Singapore, where a politically or militarily-motived actor can use cyber-warfare to sabotage our critical infrastructure and economy.

2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),I welcome that this Bill looks into proactive measures to have owners of CIIs to be more accountable for reporting and the security readiness of their CIIs. It is important that relevant stake players provide timely reports of attacks and I fully support that the CSA drive industry-wide knowledge sharing and push for effective cyber defence measures.,8,466,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00466
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Countries such as Germany, Japan and the US have already enacted cybersecurity legislation.

2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"a) It will be ideal if Cybersecurity Agency (CSA) can take lead, together with the sector regulators, to set industry-wide leading practices, shared services and threat intelligence, so that CII players can achieve security readiness in a cost-efficient manner, and yet be effective in deterring and responding to security threats.",13,471,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00471
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"b) This Bill will drive greater accountability from the CII owners, and failure to comply with this new law will be criminal in nature. I support the need to make the owners of the CIIs accountable, but I hope that the CSA be very clear on the benchmarks, or if appropriate, security architectures that CII owners need to comply to, upfront. This will also help the relevant CIIs to plan their security roadmap effectively, and better understand the investments they need to make. Otherwise, the industry risks putting in piecemeal measures that could be costly. It would also not be good if CII owners take a reactive approach to only wait for audit results and taking action only when told that they need to comply to them from time to time. Under the law, they will only be criminally penalised when they have not complied with a directive from the Commissioner. This may be too late if an incident happens. So, will the Ministry be providing the CIIs with specific benchmarks they need to achieve, or a checklist of cybersecurity measures that need to be in place?",14,472,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00472
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),c) I would like also suggest that the Ministry and the sector regulators consider funding R&D for cybersecurity technology and operations centrally or within sectors. The involvement of the CSA and sector regulators can catalyse CII operators to share findings and insights to accelerate cybersecurity enhancements. There are many common insights that could be derived from research and leading practices within specific sectors. This will help CII operators develop quicker and more effectively.,15,473,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00473
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, since 2015, the Ministry has been doing public and closed door consultations. I would like to ask the Minister, through the consultation exercises, whether the Ministry has performed an assessment of the readiness of the current CIIs in the various essential services sectors to comply with CSA's security requirements. Has the Ministry estimated how much it will cost for the CIIs to comply with the Cybersecurity Bill's requirements? What is the timeline that CIIs have come back that they need to get fully ready and compliant?",16,474,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00474
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Under the Cybersecurity Bill, the Minister, the Commissioner and his deputies are given the authority to investigate and get CIIs to disclose information to assist with investigations. Citizens will be concerned that as part of investigations, the authorities may need to access data residing within the CIIs and this may breach the privacy of individuals. What are the safeguards put in place to ensure that the broad investigation powers under this Bill do not invade the privacy of individuals and consumers?",17,475,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00475
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, under this regime, the Cybersecurity Bill will complement the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, which will be renamed the Computer Misuse Act. What is the rationale of keeping the Acts separate as they both deal with essentially cyber-crime? How would enforcement operations be divided across the two legislations to deal with cybercriminals involved in attacks such as Ransomware, Malware or Distributed Denial of Services (DDOS) attacks? The same crime can technically be applied across both critical infrastructure and non-critical, and common IT system. So, is here a duplication of effort or duplication of resources? What features under the new Bill, will enable our agencies to better address as well crimes arising from overseas actors?",18,476,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00476
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Currently, the CIIs are defined based on systems located here in Singapore. Given that some CIIs operators may use technologies such as cloud services or outsourced managed services based overseas, how does the regulator plan to designate these systems as CII, as the data and application may not reside – wholly or in part, in Singapore?",19,477,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00477
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, the Bill will put in place a licensing regime to providers of penetration testing and managed SOC monitoring services. I support this initiative as it will put in place a credible eco-system to support our CIIs. This will also promote our service providers to be better trained and specialised to meet the standards required by the regulators. However, I would like to seek clarity from the Minister, why does the CSA only register companies and not allow for the licensing or registration of individuals. In this emerging field of cybersecurity, there are many global experts, or even white-hat hackers whose expertise may be useful as freelancers to advise CII owners. Why does the Ministry not consider allowing individuals to be contracted by the CII owners?",20,478,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00478
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"From a manpower perspective, Mr Speaker, cybersecurity resources are in demand today. How is the Ministry planning to uplift the capabilities that we have to fulfil demand, once the Bill comes into force? Do we have a significant capability gap today and how long does the Ministry estimate for us to fulfil this gap?",21,479,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00479
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I would like to suggest that the Ministry put in more resources to build up cybersecurity capability that will help CIIs fund training and international exposure for their personnel for security training. The Ministry may also wish to facilitate manpower exchanges to leading technology research labs or CIIs overseas with leading practices. Some of the CIIs named are in sectors that are facing slowdown, and may find it difficult to prioritise funds for this in the short term. Such a capability fund can help adoption, especially within the immediate future.",22,480,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00480
2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, the defence of our nation, our people and its economy needs a new approach in this digital age.

2018-02-05-T-018,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"This Bill is timely to stress the importance of strengthening our CIIs in the interest of national security. We have been developing our Total Defence capabilities across five pillars – military, civil, economic, social and psychological defence. It has worked for us for several decades. In this digital era and considering the emerging threat of hybrid warfare, it may be time for the Government to update our approach. Perhaps, it may be time to add a sixth pillar to our Total Defence framework in the area of cybersecurity or digital defence to counter the new threats in this digital era. Mr Speaker, I support this Bill.",24,482,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00482
2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, this is a significant Bill which establishes a framework for the oversight and maintenance of cybersecurity in Singapore.

2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I understand the Bill has received significant feedback from industry with an excess of 60 companies, many of them large corporates, and separately, a healthy number of industry associations – not forgetting civic-conscious and interested individuals – providing feedback to the Ministry on this Bill.

2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The first clarification pertains to clause 7 of the Bill covering companies and entities that host Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) that are partly located overseas for business reasons or simply logistical convenience. As a part of a Singaporean entity's CII eco-system may be located overseas, how does the Bill ensure that this bifurcation does not render a particular CII susceptible to compromise or cyber-attacks since CII computers and computer systems based overseas are not covered by this Bill?",4,486,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00486
2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Separately, in light of the feedback received, how common are such hybrid arrangements amongst public and private sector CII owners and is the Ministry concerned that some entities may seek to locate some elements of their CII overseas to hedge against the reach of the Act and as a consequence, compromise its regulatory reach?",5,487,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00487
2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I have similar clarification with regard to ownership of a CII, particularly if the owner is an offshore entity or individual. What regulatory oversight will the Bill realistically have over CII owners who operate outside our jurisdiction, and would this not represent a loophole?",6,488,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00488
2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Secondly, I seek some clarity on the compliance costs that are likely to result for both public and private sector entities as a result of this Bill. Feedback on such costs were received by the Ministry and there was a suggestion that grants should be extended to help organisations offset these costs. Can the Minister give us some sense or an estimate of the dollar value of the compliance costs of the Cybersecurity Bill with regard to, for example, CIIs in sectors referred to in Schedule 1 of the Bill – perhaps those covering the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, the Public Utilities Board and some public hospitals? Finally, how much would be set aside in the budget for grants arising out of an increase in such compliance costs?",7,489,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00489
2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thirdly, I understand from feedback to the Ministry there was some concern about what constituted a significant security incident. The language of the Bill in clause 14 focuses on prescribed incidents suggesting that subsidiary legislation will clarify such words and terms. As the Bill imposes a duty on owners of CII to report incidents, can the Minister give the House a general sense, with examples of the specific thresholds of hypothetical incidents which may require reporting under the Act.",8,490,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00490
2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"With this as a backdrop, can the Minister also share with Parliament what punishment would be effected by this Bill against a company like Uber – assuming it is a CII – which caused the compromise of personal information such as names, email addresses and personal contact numbers of close to 380,000 Singaporeans and tried to conceal the same, as reported in November last year. How far does this Bill go to take a CII owner to task for non-reporting should a similar Uber-like episode occur after this Bill becomes law?",9,491,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00491

2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Fourthly, clause 19 of the Bill gives extraordinarily broad powers to the Commissioner of Cybersecurity and his officers to investigate cybersecurity threats and incidents against companies, entities and even individuals with respect to any computer or computer system in Singapore, not just CIIs.",11,493,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00493
2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The ambit of these powers is best exemplified by clause 19(1)(a) of the Bill, which gives the Commissioner and any authorised officer the power to remove or make copies of a hard disk, for example, even if it is only to assess the impact or potential impact of a cybersecurity threat. Non-compliance carries with it a fine of up to $5,000 and/or an imprisonment term of up to six months.",12,494,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00494

2018-02-05-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To conclude, Mr Speaker, I am concerned about how much Singaporeans are actually aware of their online signature and the importance of cybersecurity. While we seek to protect key infrastructure against cyber-attack, every Singaporean, who uses his or her smartphone to pay for goods and services or uses it as a social engagement tool, is susceptible to cyber-attack or hacking.

First, it was reported that the NUS and NTU both suffered separate cyberattacks in April last year. It appeared to be the work, not of casual hackers but of carefully planned, sophisticated cyberattacks that might be aimed at stealing information related to Government and research. This is an extreme cyberattack scenario which this Bill is aimed at defending against. If our top public universities are being targeted by organised hackers, who could not be named by the CSA for operational security reasons, and they were going after some precious information, which again the CSA could not reveal for security reasons, then there must be critical information residing in our universities and research institutions.",13,542,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00542

I am, however, inclined to argue that there is a lot of research that is going on in our universities and other associated research institutions that have to do with the continuous delivery of essential services.

It is in the vision that each of the six universities would become a ""cybersecurity centre of excellence"" developing its own area of specialisation. The training of our cybersecurity workforce is also entrusted to the universities. The SIT and the SUTD offer bachelor and master programmes in cybersecurity. What this means is that there is a lot of meta-information on cybersecurity residing in our universities.

What if the secondary computer system interconnected to the CII is not under the control of the CII owner? Does it mean that such a computer system would not pose a risk to the CII? If a secondary computer system not under the control of the CII would still pose a risk to the CII, then why limit reporting to secondary computer systems under the CII owner’s control? If the risk is the same regardless, then why not remove the need to report cybersecurity incidents in secondary computer systems altogether?",21,550,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00550
2018-02-05-T-018,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"My final point has to do with the reporting of cybersecurity incidents beyond the CIIs. Threat reports issued by cybersecurity firms often point to the problem of underreporting, as many companies and organisations often choose not to report or to reveal the full extent of cyberattacks and data thefts.

2018-02-05-T-018,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"On the other hand, vendors, some of which are SMEs, may find it difficult to cope with added costs, for example, third party costs, should they be bound by contractual cybersecurity obligations. Although reporting is compulsory, vendors, especially small ones, may not want to report as that means taking staff away from work to attend to investigations. Small companies are most vulnerable and their vulnerability may impact the CIIs which engaged them due to the sharing of data.",7,562,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00562
2018-02-05-T-018,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),I would like to suggest that the Ministry assist such small companies upstream by providing a pool of trained personnel to look at how their systems can be strengthened.

2018-02-05-T-018,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"I now move on to the point on licensing of individual cybersecurity professionals. Due to concerns that this will pose practical difficulties for global cybersecurity service providers since they deploy employees from different parts of the world to deliver urgent services at short notice, the CSA has decided to work with industry and professional association partners to establish voluntary accreditation regimes instead. But, I am worried that without licensing, we may be exposing ourselves to greater risks in the future.

2018-02-05-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"First, how about the companies we are entrusting to protect the cyber world here? While we have certification regimes to manage such companies and ensure that they meet desirable quality standards, do we know enough about the people who are working in these companies? Do these professionals, who are certified, have a vested interest in Singapore? And what if they have interests that contradictory to Singapore's?",6,622,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00622

2018-02-05-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"One, more thorough due diligence checks by our cybersecurity agencies on professionals. Two, re-examine the penalties for misuse of access to data, especially if the perpetrators are members of the cybersecurity industry who are supposed to guard the industry. Three, create a certification system that favours cyber professionals who have a vested interest in Singapore – people who have some real roots and deep roots in Singapore, rather than fly-by-night experts who drop by for ad-hoc projects whom our laws have difficulty to reach and deter.",8,624,2018-02-05-T-018-S-00624

2018-02-05-T-019,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"In Singapore, there has been a reported increase in the proportion of cybercrimes to overall crimes from 79% in 2014 to 14% in 2016. Cases reported under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA) more than doubled from 280 in 2015 to almost 700 in 2016, with ransomware, hacking and the compromise of online accounts such as Facebook, SingPass and Internet banking accounts figuring most prominently amongst these. In 2016, the National Cyber Security Command (NCSC) saw cyber-attacks of varying impacts across many sectors, including the defence, Government, banking and finance, and healthcare sectors. I, therefore, welcome this Bill, Mr Speaker.",2,635,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00635

2018-02-05-T-019,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"There have been tweaks, Mr Speaker, since an early draft of this Bill was first released in July last year for consultation. Conducted between the10 July 2017 to 24 August 2017, the public consultation exercise garnered close to a hundred submissions from a diverse range of stakeholders. I must disclose at this point that I was together with other scholars and students of Singapore Management University, one of the respondents of this consultation exercise. I am, therefore, pleased, Mr Speaker, with what has followed, with the refinements that have been made to this draft Bill and now the Bill before us. In particular, I think I am pleased in relation to the regime that now governs cybersecurity licensees.",4,637,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00637

2018-02-05-T-019,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Importantly, Mr Speaker, the Bill acknowledges that a compliance driven approach to cybersecurity should not only be focused on a box ticking exercise, of getting all the boxes ticked but one that solves cybersecurity problems creatively and proactively, thereby instilling a risk-management culture. Behind laws, Mr Speaker, it is this creative approach that will be our shield against cybersecurity threats and incidents; it is this this risk-management culture that will see CII owners taking swift and appropriate measures to prevent, manage and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents.",6,639,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00639

If these processes are not properly managed in Singapore, considerable sums could be unproductively spent.",9,642,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00642
2018-02-05-T-019,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"In relation to Part IV of the Bill which deals with responses to threats and incidents, can we have some examples of what might variously qualify as a “cybersecurity threat or incident of a severe nature” on one hand, a “serious threat” on the other, and still on the third hand, which we do not have, an emergency level “serious and imminent threat”. They are terms apart which I would say judges and lawyers would be very keenly looking at. Can we have some guidance as to what this would be?",10,643,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00643
2018-02-05-T-019,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Third, will cloud services be impacted by this new regulatory framework? The Bill’s explanatory statement admits that that the Commissioner’s wide-ranging powers of access to data in clause 20 is “intrusive”. Will this be seen as going against, perhaps, established data privacy and protection principles and potentially expose the data of the cloud service provider’s clients? This is particularly so in a public cloud environment.",11,644,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00644
2018-02-05-T-019,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Could the Bill have a chilling effect on the adoption of cloud services in Singapore, as cloud customers in both Singapore and elsewhere become increasingly concerned about the level of Government access to private data and, perhaps, may withdraw from such cloud services in time to come – even though these cloud services arguably claim to provide better cybersecurity than what we have beyond the cloud services? This would be a pity as the cloud could enable new innovations such as artificial intelligence, and big data analytics which will likely become the basis of future developments in technology and that, by all accounts, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office wishes to support.",12,645,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00645

Are there plans, Mr Speaker, to adopt the best practices, specifically from the US and UK in this regard? I note that the US has a Cybersecurity Disclosure Act of 2015, which adopts a ""comply or explain"" procedure in certain circumstances? Will we be following that route or studying it at least? Or the UK’s Cybersecurity Information Sharing Partnership, a structure for incident disclosure and collection which, among other things, allows business organisations to work in collaboration of the regulators, to collaboratively and voluntarily report incidents to UK national computer emergency response team.",13,646,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00646

I fear when I read that the Ministry of Defence, quite rightly, is looking at how even fitness trackers could become a portal for CII threat or incident.",14,647,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00647
2018-02-05-T-019,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Allow me to end by noting that the Economist Intelligence Unit's most recent report notes that cyber criminals are seeking out points of least resistance in the Asia-Pacific region. Jurisdictions without cybercrime legislation – so now we are going to have cybercrime legislation in addition to the CMCA – but jurisdictions, perhaps, as in our neighbouring jurisdictions, without this legislation or with weak enforcement, are attracting cyber criminals as vantage points from which to conduct attacks into the networks of more advanced countries. So, if I can end by just asking, Mr Speaker, if the Minister could share anything that is going to be done regionally and, perhaps, internationally to prevent this.

With the proliferation of Internet devices and the growing scale of worldwide cyber-attacks, such as the widespread WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, the proposed provisions in this Bill are a much-needed step towards safeguarding of our cyberspace and everyday security.

2018-02-05-T-019,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"With the proliferation of smart devices, flash drives and devices connected to the Internet, these can all be points of entry for a hacker to cause damage if the user does not have a good basic understanding of digital security. I would like to urge the Ministry to design and roll out awareness programmes to educate our citizens – both young and old – on digital security, to ensure that the weakest link in our cybersecurity chain is secured.",6,654,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00654
2018-02-05-T-019,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),Another possible weak link in the chain is the outsourcing of cybersecurity services to companies that are based overseas. How does the Ministry intend to ensure the compliance of such companies?,7,655,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00655
2018-02-05-T-019,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"A third possible weak link is the use of third-party vendors. As seen from overseas hacking incidents and data breaches, such as the data breach suffered by Netflix in 2017, poor cybersecurity by third-party vendors has been a consistent problem for years. In 2013, hackers gained access to the network of retail giant Target by first stealing passwords from a third-party vendor dealing with their heating and ventilation systems. Often, these vendors, also known as network-connected outsiders, are small-sized companies who do not invest much in proper cybersecurity practices – even less so investing in best practices. This has been a problem plaguing many industries. How does the Ministry plan to ensure that such third-party vendors, beyond the 11 identified critical sectors, are also well regulated?",8,656,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00656

2018-02-05-T-019,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),Can the Minister provide some insights on the number of cybersecurity professionals needed for the next five to 10 years?

2018-02-05-T-019,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Perhaps, a short-term solution in ensuring that our cybersecurity defences are working as intended, while current batches of cybersecurity professionals are still being trained in schools, would be through the use of “white hat” hackers. I have read with interest that MINDEF has recently invited 300 international and local hackers to hunt for vulnerabilities in its Internet-connected systems. Harnessing the enthusiasm of the “white hat” hacker community is a step in the right direction and I would like to propose for the Ministry to consider grooming a local community of “white hat” hackers in Singapore. However, clear boundaries and protocols would need to be drawn and the Ministry would need to think about how to best support and manage the group.

With the extent, speed, increasing sophistication and trend of high profile cyber-attacks, this Bill is timely. We are seeing an increasing trend of ransomware.

2018-02-05-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"To meet these requirements for cybersecurity, one constraint that we all must recognise is that of the availability of skills and knowledgeable cybersecurity specialists. There has been a lot of discussion on costs. The reason for that high cost that everyone is envisaging is because of this lack of skills or the need to build this base of deep skills.

2018-02-05-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The Bill also recognises that for cybersecurity to be effective, it must start at the top, with owners or leaders of the critical information infrastructures. Building cybersecurity awareness and culture across an organisation requires a strong tone from the top. So, it is interesting to see Part 3 of the Bill clearly outlining the accountability of owners of critical information infrastructures. Failure of owners to comply with the regulations carries with it heavy penalties, including imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. Clause 7(8) puts the same emphasis on critical information infrastructure owned by the Government, stating that when the critical information infrastructure is owned and operated by the Government, the Permanent Secretary allocated to the Ministry who has the responsibility for the critical information infrastructure is treated as the owner. This sends a strong message that leaders own and are accountable for cybersecurity in the organisation. This will keep cybersecurity top of mind in the organisation.",7,666,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00666

To achieve cybersecurity, we must not only ensure compliance but, more importantly, an understanding of a mindset change of all stakeholders of Singapore’s critical information infrastructure. While measures are put in place for compliance, people are one of our weakest links. Employees must understand the impact of their actions on cybersecurity. With the increasing sophistication and social engineering, targeted phishing emails are not as easily detected. It is becoming more difficult to tell a malicious email from a legitimate email. Hence, cybersecurity awareness and keeping cybersecurity top of mind are key. Apart from cybersecurity professionals, training and building resilience of all employees and users of critical information infrastructure is as essential. This is not a trivial task and organisations will need support to achieve this. Can the Minister share what will be done to support organisations in this aspect?",8,667,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00667
2018-02-05-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"We must also recognise that it is not a matter of “if” but “when” there will be a breach. In fact, statistics and information tell us that many oganisations that have been breached take about 12 months on average to actually discover that they are breached.

For SMEs already struggling to stay afloat, this will create additional financial stress. With more cross-company collaboration and outsourcing occurring these days, it is crucial that this becomes a nation-wide effort. It would be just like how suppliers for the banking industry would have to adhere to the Banking Secrecy Act. Data sharing and exchange will be compromised if even just one organisation is careless with their approach on data security.

But some businesses may not realise this. Moreover, as cybersecurity is still unfamiliar territory, some companies may under-invest or over-invest in the wrong systems. I have heard from business operators who think they are adequately covered with an anti-virus software, for example. I hope the Government can look into the estimated costs that will be incurred in cybersecurity investments, and consider financial incentives to alleviate the financial burden of implementing enhanced cybersecurity measures.

This could mean plenty of administrative work back and forth, when the time, effort and other resources may be better spent on constantly shoring up cybersecurity defences instead. Perhaps, for high-risk CIIs, the Commission could work more closely with the owners to improve prevention measures.",5,675,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00675
2018-02-05-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I also note that with the decision to simplify the licensing framework, the Bill will do away with the licensing of individual cybersecurity professionals. At this point, only penetration testing and managed security operations centre (SOC) monitoring service providers will require licensing. With the gig economy blooming, there will be no doubt cybersecurity professionals who provide their services as freelancers will increase. Cybersecurity professionals deal with sensitive information in large quantities. So, is there a need for this be better-regulated? Is it not vital to ensure that they are adequately skilled and possess the right disposition to provide services of such delicate nature?",6,676,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00676
2018-02-05-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"On the topic of handling sensitive information, some hold reservations that the authorities, while conducting their investigations, would intrude on personal privacy. Are there safeguards in place for the broad investigation powers to ensure that there is no misuse of authority, whether unintentional or not? Can the public be assured that their information is in safe hands?",7,677,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00677
2018-02-05-T-019,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, this is a comprehensive Bill that adequately covers many areas concerning cybersecurity. Meanwhile, we also have the Computer Misuse Act (CMA), formerly the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, as well as existing legislations like the Banking Secrecy Act which also address cybersecurity and data protection issues. Are there overlapping policies, and how would the new Bill interact and complement with the existing legislations that we have now? Enhancing our cybersecurity defences is the next logical move in the face of an increasingly digitalised society. I support the Bill.",8,678,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00678
2018-02-05-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr. Speaker, cyber-attacks are almost commonplace in recent years. In fact, in May 2017, billionaire businessman Warren Buffet said to his investors that cybersecurity could be the number one problem for mankind.",1,679,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00679
2018-02-05-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The numbers confirm this. In the first six months of 2017, globally, there were more than 900 data breaches in the first six months of last year. Analysts say that the damage caused by cybercrimes globally could hit US$6 trillion annually by 2021. No country has been spared. Singapore has been targeted by cybercriminals. We must put in place laws to safeguard our critical cyber systems and infrastructure.",2,680,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00680
2018-02-05-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I have three points of concern, namely on costs, processes and manpower needs.",3,681,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00681
2018-02-05-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"In meeting the requirements, critical information infrastructure (CII) sectors will have to impose more stringent requirements on their systems or require their vendors to do so. This will inevitably lead to higher costs, as pointed out by Members of this House. In the Report on the Consultation Outcome paper released by MCI, it was stated that MCI will not be providing grants to offset the costs of audits and risk assessments because they are regulatory requirements. However, it will work with the sectors to streamline requirements so that they can minimise compliance costs incurred because of the Bill. May I ask, what is the estimated compliance costs involved for the various sectors? For sectors that face greater complications in meeting the requirements, are there existing schemes that they can tap on for this purpose? What is the timeline for the implementation of these compliance measures? Companies might not only need time to ramp up their compliance capabilities but also need technical guidance from MCI.",4,682,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00682
2018-02-05-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"My next point is on processes. While we must not compromise on security, we must ensure that the reporting processes are not unnecessarily onerous. Companies and their staff already face substantial reporting requirements to other Government bodies. We must seek to rationalise compliance for ease of operations without compromising on security.",5,683,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00683
2018-02-05-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"While a strong Cyber Security Agency (CSA) is necessary for our cyber security, it must not also intrude upon privacy unnecessarily. The Ministry has assured that there are safeguards in place. And it will adopt a calibrated approach depending on the severity of attacks. Can the Ministry also share more if it will adopt a tiered or classification system that would spell out the scope or limits of investigation depending on the level of severity of the incident or attacks? For example, the security agencies have used threat-level systems to decide on the intensity of preparation and fortification that needs to be done. Could a similar system be put in place so that stakeholders and parties involved will have a clearer picture of what is required of them, should a cyber-attack or breach of systems happen? And more importantly, the requirements needed of them during peace-time as it affects business costs and manpower requirements.",6,684,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00684
2018-02-05-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to know if the cybersecurity manpower is sufficient to achieve the aims of this Bill. While our IHLs have been training more students and MOM has introduced Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP) for the IT sector, and they have been in place for some time now, would the supply be sufficient? How can the Ministry work with MOE, MOM and even NTUC to ensure that there will be sufficient manpower to meet our future needs?",7,685,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00685
2018-02-05-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"On a separate but related matter, in 2017, data security firm Check Point Software Technologies ranked Singapore as the world's top spot to launch global cyber-attacks from. While the attacks may originate somewhere, being a technology hub in Southeast Asia means that we have a high amount of Internet traffic from other countries going through us. We are a hub with high inter-trade and data connectivity. It is inevitable that some attacks will originate from Singapore and other similar hubs. Yet, it is also our global responsibility to stop attacks where possible. It is also an opportunity to provide a trusted gateway for countries and businesses. It establishes Singapore as a secure business node. We must not stop at exploring and developing ways for us to be used as a gateway for global cybersecurity.",8,686,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00686

2018-02-05-T-019,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"First, the cybersecurity services providers and licensees. How does the Government plan to ensure the integrity and reliability of these companies? Are their track records studied, and are the employees all screened? How sure can the Government be in ensuring security and privacy of matters, pertaining to the Government, with these third party cybersecurity services providers and licensees having access to such privileged and information?",3,690,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00690
2018-02-05-T-019,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, we know that cyber hackers and attackers are always, at least, two steps ahead. While I appreciate the focus of the Bill to put in place, a penetration testing service to search for vulnerabilities and compromises in the computing system of our public sector and civil service outfits, how do we stay ahead of the curve and stay relevant and secure? How do cybersecurity services providers and licensees ensure that the personnel who are helping them to search for this vulnerabilities and compromises, are up to speed with what potential cyber hackers or attackers are or will be doing?",4,691,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00691
2018-02-05-T-019,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Third, while this Bill aims to address the various measures and counter-measures to prevent, manage and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents that may afflict our public sector and civil service, it must be accompanied by non-legislative approaches as well. Sustained efforts to ensure awareness in cybersecurity training of a public and civil service officers, so that they are able to recognise potential and actual cybersecurity threats, need to be carried out as well. In fact, this approach has to be nationwide, even to users of public services such as students and the general public.",5,692,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00692
2018-02-05-T-019,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Public education to increase awareness and identification of potential and actual cybersecurity threats must also be done to support the provisions of this Bill. Public and civil service officers as well as students in our public education institutions, need to understand and recognise when certain emails, hyperlinks or even mobile applications could risk the integrity and compromises the safety of connected computing systems in our various public offices, institutions or schools. Our cybersecurity public awareness programmes, must continue and be further enhanced. In addition, to what extent is data shared among our public sector officers, currently, in designing and implementing better policies or programmes for the public? And with this new cybersecurity legislation, how will that sharing of data and information be impacted? Notwithstanding my concerns above, I support this Bill, Mr Speaker.",6,693,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00693

2018-02-05-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The risks that regular people face online are increasing. As many have mentioned, last year thousands were affected when WannaCry ransomware hit our shores. But the threat can come from within Singapore too. Singapore hosts 1.6% of all the malware in the world, which is an astronomical amount considering that our island holds only a very small fraction of the world's population. The very fact that we are a connected and smart country means that we are more at-risk to cyber-attacks.",7,700,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00700
2018-02-05-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"An idea to start with is with our young ones. The UK, for example, has set aside 20 million pounds to fund CCA clubs in schools that focus on cybersecurity training. This not only teaches children how to be good online citizens, but it also creates a pipeline of future cybersecurity specialists. Would MCI and CSA consider working with MOE on this?",8,701,2018-02-05-T-019-S-00701
2018-02-05-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Another possibility would be to provide grants to SMEs to beef up their cybersecurity awareness. Many businessmen may be unaware that being hacked could ruin their company.

2018-02-05-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Smaller companies do not have large IT footprints but will face serious operational risks if their systems were down. Precision engineering firms would not be able to continue to manufacture if they were attacked by ransomware. Others would lose customers if customer data was to be hacked.

2018-02-05-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Next, we can explore ways to do more for our most vulnerable residents – the older generation. I have residents that are 90-year-old grandparents who check their email and WhatsApp constantly. To them, technology is no longer just a novelty, but an integral part of daily life. Unfortunately, these residents are the most vulnerable to hacking.

The Cybersecurity Bill provides for investigation powers in clauses 19 and 20. These investigation powers apply only to the assessment of the impact of cybersecurity threats and incidents, and to the prevention of further harm and further incidents from arising. The investigation of cybercrimes and the prosecution of their perpetrators are different issues covered by the CMA.

The Enterprise Singapore Board Bill will give effect to the new Statutory Board, and replace the International Enterprise Singapore Board Act and the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board Act.",3,858,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00858
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Sir, enterprise development has always been an important component of our economic strategy, and, indeed, it is an essential complement to our efforts to attract foreign investments. In 1973, then-Minister for Finance Hon Sui Sen emphasised that “our industrialisation can best be brought about through broadening our international connections and through an unrelenting striving for quality in all aspects of our activities… our own national enterprises too, must make a greater contribution to our future industrial development.”",4,859,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00859
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Those wise words from 45 years ago remain as relevant today. We have been resolute through the decades in our commitment to developing our enterprises, but our approach has evolved in tandem with our economy, the needs of industry and the external environment.",5,860,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00860
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"In our formative years, we established the Department of Trade under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, which in 1983 became the Trade Development Board. We also formed the National Productivity Board in 1972 which, together with the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR), became the Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) in 1996. These agencies subsequently became IE Singapore and SPRING in 2002. Collectively, IE Singapore, SPRING and their predecessor agencies have rendered consistent and strong support to the growth of Singapore enterprises in trade, internationalisation and capability development.",6,861,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00861
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"In 2017, SPRING supported the capability upgrading of close to 40,000 companies, almost three times the number supported in 2010. Similarly, IE supported more than 45,000 companies in their overseas ventures last year, more than double the number supported five years ago. About 36,000 of these companies were SMEs.",7,862,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00862
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Over the years, IE and SPRING have developed deep expertise and extensive networks in support of their mission. However, there have been significant changes in the nature and pace of change in the global economy which have profound implications for Singapore.",8,863,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00863
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"First, the weight of global growth is shifting to Asia, which is projected to grow at about 5.8% in 2018, compared to 2.1% in advanced economies. Our companies have recognised that the rise of Asia is a major opportunity to internationalise quickly. Overseas expansion ranks among the top five business priorities for SMEs, and 60% of participants in the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Annual Business Survey had plans to internationalise over the next three years. So, the message has been hoisted in and it is being acted upon.",9,864,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00864
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Second, the advent of e-commerce and digital technology is making it easier than ever before to access overseas markets. Scaling up and growing beyond our borders is now possible at a much earlier stage in an enterprise’s evolution, and indeed has become even more important to success.",10,865,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00865
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Finally, to expand into international markets, our companies must have deep capabilities so that they can compete globally.

2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"The confluence of these trends necessitates a different approach towards the development of our enterprises and their ability to seize the opportunities around us. In this new environment, companies need to integrate capability building, innovation and internationalisation. These areas of pursuit are deeply intertwined and they reinforce each other. They are mutually reinforcing. A company must innovate and deepen its capabilities if it is to successfully expand into overseas markets. But, equally, venturing overseas will itself create the scale and the impetus and opportunity for businesses to gain new capabilities and expertise.",12,867,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00867
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"As highlighted by the Committee on the Future Economy, Singapore enterprises must adapt equally to these changes and quickly to remain competitive.

2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"So, it is necessary and timely to merge the functions and operations of IE and SPRING to form Enterprise Singapore (ESG).

2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"To succeed, it is important that ESG work closely with private and public sector partners and have their full support. Sir, the agency will deepen its partnership with trade associations and chambers, unions and other stakeholders to reach out to our broad and diverse base of enterprises. It will also work closely with other Government agencies to promote public-private partnerships, as well as collaboration between multi-national corporations (MNCs), Large Local Enterprises (LLEs), SMEs and start-ups to enhance the collective competitiveness of our industries.",19,874,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00874
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"I want to cite the precision engineering sector as an example of how such partnerships can be valuable.

2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"IE worked with SPRING and a group of precision engineering SMEs to form the Singapore Manufacturing Innovation Centre (SMIC) in Guangzhou Knowledge City; a platform that helps our SMEs venture into a major international market and allows them to co-create innovative technology solutions with Chinese enterprises. SPETA worked with IE and SPRING to set up a group of industry veterans to advise SMEs on business and technology strategies. So, by leveraging on each other's strengths, public agencies and TACs can help our companies compete internationally. The formation of ESG will give greater impetus to such partnerships.",21,876,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00876
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"As the national standards and accreditation body, ESG will build on SPRING's efforts to develop internationally-recognised standards and quality assurance, which have burnished Singapore's reputation for high-quality and trustworthy products and services. The agency will continue this important work, which is key to promoting innovation, and strengthening the capabilities and competitiveness of our companies.",22,877,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00877

This includes strengthening Singapore's trade infrastructure in areas of product development and liquidity-building initiatives for sectors such as commodity derivatives.

2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Sir, in this entire process to establish ESG and make other consequential adjustments, a smooth transition has been the utmost priority. This means ensuring that the competencies, knowledge, experience and networks developed by IE and SPRING are preserved. Also, that ESG will retain and build on the relationships that IE and SPRING have developed with enterprises and partners both here in Singapore and overseas. And that current programmes and schemes, such as the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) Scheme, continue to be administered even as they are streamlined, and new programmes developed to better support enterprises.

2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill provide for the key concepts used in the Bill and to establish ESG. Part 2 also sets out ESG's functions and powers, which are drawn and streamlined from existing provisions in the SPRING and IE Board Acts. These cover the enterprise development, internationalisation, wholesale and commodity trading, and productivity, innovation and standards functions that SPRING and IE currently perform. The consumer protection fair trading function has been excluded in view of the transfer to CCCS.",27,882,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00882

2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Part 7 of the Bill sets out the administration and enforcement powers of ESG. In particular, this Part will allow ESG to request and verify information in relation to its incentive schemes. It will also protect against improper use of certification and accreditation marks that are administered by ESG. These provisions will facilitate the effective administration of incentives and grants, and better support ESG in its role as the national standards and accreditation body.",29,884,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00884

2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Finally, Part 10 of the Bill makes consequential and related amendments to other Acts. In particular, the Competition Act will be amended to update CCS' statutory functions to include the promotion of fair trading, prevention of unfair practices among suppliers in Singapore, advising relevant organisations on consumer protection matters generally, and the enforcement of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. As mentioned earlier, CCS will be renamed CCCS to reflect its new statutory consumer protection function. This Part also provides for the transfer to the new CCCS of SPRING's assets, employees, liabilities and records relating to the fair trading functions.",31,886,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00886
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Sir, as a single enterprise development agency, ESG will be able to provide the holistic support that our businesses need to develop deep capabilities, robust internationalisation strategies and strong partnership with industry stakeholders.

2018-02-05-T-020,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),This is so true both in substance and in the spirit of it. We need to restructure to stay relevant and to up the game; and this applies to all stakeholders.,2,891,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00891

But in reality, we also know that the ITMs are essentially driven by one of key economic agencies such as ESG, going forward, which are like the work horse facilitating the transformations. Therefore, it is critical to the success of ITMs that economic agencies like ESG have the deep industry knowledge, a good ground sense of the prevailing competitive landscape, a good knowledge of the sectoral strengths and gaps as well as the enough business acumen to design meaningful policies and schemes to incentivise and help capability build up.",20,909,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00909

In last year’s DP Information Group SME Development Survey, more than a third of SMEs surveyed also cited finance related issues as their immediate business challenge. This has more than doubled compared to the survey done in 2014. Most of the issues relate to delays in payments from customers, although high interest rates for bank loans and tighter suppliers’ credit are also cited among the business issues faced.",26,915,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00915
2018-02-05-T-020,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I know that there are various useful SME financing schemes available to assist enterprises to finance their businesses. From the survey, I believe the other help that SMEs need is to improve their financial management capabilities such as cash management and credit management for both their customers and suppliers. As more businesses internationalise, such cash and credit management become more complex when they are cross border. It requires deeper understanding of the in-country business practices and its legal framework. We should help SMEs shorten the learning curve and minimise the chances of them paying the ""tuition fee"" in unfamiliar territories. Here, the ESG and the TACs can help pool and share experiences from businesses who are already overseas and learn from each other's practices and experiences.",27,916,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00916
2018-02-05-T-020,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Also, from the survey, it is encouraging to note that more SMEs are making fresh investments in technology and innovation.

2018-02-05-T-020,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Increasingly, data technology is seen as critical enabler for business successes. For smaller enterprises, to build their own data mining and analytical capabilities may not be economical. ESG can also help in this regard. For example as a source of data aggregator on industry trends and insights, and harnessing on information already collected by other Government agencies. Specialised functionality within the new Statutory Board can be set up to extract and manage data, distilling them into sufficient sectoral granularity that will be of help and usefulness to various business sectors. We could start with the building up of deep data resources for sectors of the 23 ITMs that are already launched.",29,918,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00918
2018-02-05-T-020,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Finally, as an organisation gets bigger, we should avoid the pitfalls of it becoming too hierarchical and less responsive. In an increasingly fast changing business landscape, the enlarged organisation would need to gear up its quick-response ability to keep up with changing business needs, in addition to developing its breadth and depth. The new operating framework would also require sufficient empowerment to officers at the various levels to carry out their mission of transforming the economy.",30,919,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00919

This merger will allow for an integrated support network for businesses to build capability and access to both local and overseas markets.",1,922,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00922
2018-02-05-T-020,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"We must not underestimate the changes that businesses both large and small face with the technological advances we are witnessing today. Growing connectivity has led to the defining of a new economy with evolving business models, how products and services are delivered and consumed. There is also a trend of sharing and partnerships. Even in the area of manpower, employment models are changing with access to different sources of skills. There is a greater use of independent and freelance workers.",2,923,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00923
2018-02-05-T-020,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"As Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat recently said, global and technological changes are causing the blurring of industry boundaries. He stressed the importance to consider ""the convergence of sectors"". There will be an increasing need for Enterprise Singapore to partner across several agencies to deliver the appropriate help to businesses. Against this backdrop of change and the pace of change, can the Minister share, how the new Enterprise Singapore will be organised and restructured to work with companies to be responsive to helping them − both large and small − transform, grow and go global?",3,924,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00924
2018-02-05-T-020,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"SPRING and IE are already connecting and enabling the sharing amongst businesses to improve productivity and helping them internationalise. The food manufacturing industry is one good example of this. With digitalisation and the new economy, I see an opportunity for the new Enterprise Singapore to play an even bigger and somewhat different role in connecting businesses to build capability, grow and go global. As the Minister had shared in his speech earlier, the approach has to evolve in tandem with the change the industry is facing and also with the needs of businesses.",4,925,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00925
2018-02-05-T-020,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Let me give just a very simple example to help explain my point. Last week, in a pre-Budget dialogue that I had with SMEs, an SME leader shared the challenges she is facing with regards to addressing some of her customer needs because of her limited delivery capability. She was looking at how she could tap the excess capacity of other small businesses. There was another business leader in the room, and she quickly said that she had excess capacity in her off-peak periods and would be able to support this.",5,926,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00926
2018-02-05-T-020,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),I know this is a very simple example but I hope it demonstrates the need and potential for an eco-system that connects companies for greater effectiveness and efficiencies to leverage their capabilities and capacities locally and even overseas. And providing them also relevant information and insights.,6,927,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00927
2018-02-05-T-020,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Yes, you could say that businesses could do this themselves but this peer-to-peer approach may not be as effective especially in a world where businesses need to move faster and be a lot more responsive to the market. For eco-systems to cooperate effectively, you need support to enable efficient collaboration and information sharing both within and amongst businesses. Enterprise Singapore can and should play that role both for SMEs and larger businesses albeit how the support is structured will differ. It is not about providing more infrastructure or more grants but rather connecting and enabling businesses to collaborate effectively for joint success. As Minister so rightly put it, building business capability, innovating and internationalisation are so much more intertwined now. There also could be more done across different industries, and not just within industries.",7,928,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00928
2018-02-05-T-020,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"This brings me to my final and related point. With changing business models, instead of working alone, more companies will partner to deliver products or services. So, can the Minister share how Enterprise Singapore will structure the various assistance schemes and eligibility criteria for these schemes in such circumstances? Because what a business is, who your employees are, where your resources come from will really differ as we move forward. With that Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.",8,929,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00929

2018-02-05-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The move to integrate the functions of SPRING and IES would facilitate the provision of domestic and international state support to enterprises in a coordinated fashion, in a manner of a one-stop shop.

2018-02-05-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, there is a strong case for ESG to differentiate the account management approach it takes to enterprises according to whether an enterprise has limited growth potential and aspirations versus those with strong potential and ambitions.",5,934,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00934
2018-02-05-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The term SME is a convenient shorthand which we all use. However, there are often big differences between the S and the M. Aside from just size, there are differences in terms of the mind-set of the entrepreneur. Some SMEs are more focused on stability, have modest ambitions and may not want to become the next Facebook. But others are more focused on growth and should be encouraged and supported to become dynamic job creation and value creation engines for our economy.",6,935,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00935
2018-02-05-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"For those enterprises may be small or mid-sized, not in a hurry to grow radically, largely domestically-oriented and/or are more focused on stability rather than growth, there is a case for supporting such enterprises with challenges like productivity, internationalisation and business succession planning, so as to maintain jobs and grow wages. The approach taken to support these SMEs could be more oriented towards programme administration. But on top of that, some of those enterprises could be nudged using incentive schemes towards sunrise sectors within their own broad industry or in adjacent industries where they have core competences that can be leveraged.",7,936,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00936
2018-02-05-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"On the other hand, there are enterprises that have the potential to become regional or global champions, those with the ambition, drive and ability to become engines for job creation and value creation for our economy. These would need support in a much more open-ended way.",8,937,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00937
2018-02-05-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The appropriate approach to support such enterprises would be to provide more aggressive support in a more holistic, responsive and creative way. Such enterprises may need support in terms of human capital, recruiting management and expert talent. They may need support to obtain financing, where at some stages of growth some SMEs continue to experience an inability to raise sufficient financing from capital markets, VCs or banks. And they would need support in terms of internationalisation and overseas market penetration, or even foreign direct investment to locate parts of their global business supply chain abroad while keeping critical headquarters and other functions in Singapore. The optimal approach for such enterprises would perhaps involve tapping on whole-of-Government resources to enable them to resolve problems in their overseas operations or to introduce them to sources of funding or potential partners, to cite two examples.",9,938,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00938
2018-02-05-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Will ESG therefore provide different approaches in this manner to support local enterprises based on their needs, abilities and aspirations?

2018-02-05-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thirdly and to take this a little further, does the Government try to arrange a single account manager for each company for Government support, across all agencies? That account manager could reside in different agencies, for example STB for tourism-related companies. Anecdotally, it would appear that some companies sometimes may not be completely clear about whether there is a single Government account manager currently along these lines.",12,941,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00941

2018-02-05-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Lastly, I trust that one area the new ESG will actively look into is how to catalyse links between Singapore companies when they operate in international markets. We do see such links between some companies from foreign countries when they move abroad, whereby such companies cluster into specific areas or even buildings and business centres, share learnings and networks, and thus, shorten the learning curve and lessen the risk for one another. This is especially important in difficult markets, like Africa, which is probably the next and last frontier in emerging market region. I would like know what ESG plans to do on this issue.",14,943,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00943

Right now their share of value-added is much smaller than their share of jobs, implying that we need to move those capable and aspirational SMEs up the productivity ladder.

2018-02-05-T-020,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Indeed, it is prudent to ensure that while the merger is in execution, all successful claims for grants under both Boards before the merger would first be validated by an externally-appointed auditing company before disbursement. This will ensure that any fraudulent claim can be identified and disallowed before the merger takes place, as not doing so could complicate matters. It would be difficult to trace the fraud after the merger, or determine which party is responsible.

This worried them as they felt that their plans would be hampered.",4,950,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00950

2018-02-05-T-020,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Following the merger, I hope that the consolidated resources will enable the ESG to work more closely with businesses. Previously, officers from SPRING would usually conduct one or two follow-up sessions after businesses have implemented the acquired systems and upgrades. And if no anomaly is detected during the follow-up sessions, it is considered case-closed and the businesses are then left to fend for themselves. I believe the frequency of officers following up with the companies could be looked into to ensure that the implemented system is indeed aiding the company’s growth and progression as initially projected.",6,952,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00952

2018-02-05-T-020,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Next, I think the ESG would want to look carefully into the grant applications to ensure that the submissions for upgrades are justifiable. The most expensive is not always the best, but for some applicants they may adopt this mantra. The key to achieving greater effectiveness is to tailor solutions and assistance schemes to each company. Every company faces unique challenges and the differences in the challenges would vary even more greatly across different industries.",8,954,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00954

Appoint solution providers who have been pre-vetted for suitability, to assist with the implementation of solutions. Pre-vet the cost of implementation and negotiate better pricing where possible to ensure that the grants can help companies to achieve even more. If shortage of manpower is a concern, freelancing consultants, auditors and other professionals can be engaged to help perform the relevant follow-ups to ensure that each implementation achieves the desired results.",9,955,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00955

As EDB attracts foreign investors, it could also provide opportunities for local enterprises to be part of the industry supply chain and collaborate with MNCs. I hope that the merger of these two Government agencies could lead to a more effective operation, creating a “one plus one, greater than two” effect, helping local enterprises to grow, and creating even more quality job opportunities for Singaporeans.",14,975,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00975

The SME would have to submit documents to both agencies and maintain relations with officers from each agency. With the merger, the SME need only approach Enterprise Singapore for support for both their capability development and internationalisation needs. This will not only reduce the administrative burden on the SME but also allow the officer-in-charge to have a more holistic overview of the strategic direction and growth trajectory of the SME to better enable the provision of more efficient and effective support as the SME evolves.",2,977,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00977

2018-02-05-T-020,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Second, in every merger, the challenge lies in integrating the cultures of the merging organisations and co-creating the new culture of the merged organisation.

2018-02-05-T-020,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Fourth, with the consolidation of SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore, will there be a streamlining of grants and schemes currently offered by the two sector agencies? There are many grants and schemes offered by both SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore respectively and, currently, SMEs already require assistance in identifying which grants and schemes are more suitable for them. Given that Enterprise Singapore will be a one-stop support for SMEs, it may be timely to review the grants and schemes available and assess if it would be useful to tier them to cater to the different developmental needs and stages of the SME.",9,984,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00984
2018-02-05-T-020,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Lastly, with the coming together of SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore, Enterprise Singapore will be connected to a larger pool of SMEs. Are there plans to leverage on this expanded network of SMEs to build stronger interlinks within our SME community? For example, in the first half of 2017, IE Singapore helped 24,000 enterprises with overseas expansion. The success stories of these SMEs can serve as guides for smaller SMEs to emulate. Through this network, smaller SMEs can also build business links with the larger SMEs to create mutual business value by leveraging on each other’s strengths and value propositions. I also urge Enterprise Singapore to work closely with our labour movement’s U SME to address the issues and challenges faced by our SMEs and make every SME workplace a better workplace, every SME job a better job, and every SME worker a better worker.",10,985,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00985

2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Our economy grew well last year. But many SMEs continue to face many challenges. SME owners know that they have to respond swiftly, or risk being irrelevant.

2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Hence, many businesses want closer collaboration within the industry and for the Government to be more involved. The Government recognises this need. Therefore, we set up coordination bodies like the National Productivity Council and the Future Economy Committee. The Government also established SME Centres under the supervision of the new Enterprise Singapore to bring policies to the doorsteps of companies.",3,993,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00993
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"However, I am very concerned about our SMEs, especially the micro-SMEs, as they need to change fast.

Despite all these efforts, we have yet to see deep participation of many SMEs and micro-SMEs in the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs).",4,994,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00994
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"We need to understand why this may be so. From my understanding, I think there are two common factors that help industries be successful in following through the transformation spelt out in their respective ITMs.",5,995,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00995
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Firstly, they have to have industry leaders who have worked successfully with the Government and then managed to seek a buy-in from the rest of the industry.",6,996,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00996
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Secondly, they have to have Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) who also have strong and focused leadership that is able to steer the industry to a clear path of adoption. Driving and catalysing industry transformation will be a very important part of Enterprise Singapore. As such, I would like to propose three points for Enterprise Singapore’s consideration.",7,997,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00997
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"My first point is to professionalise the TACs. The accounting and law sectors are prime examples of how TACs have been professionalised. For one, they are staffed by relevant industry professionals who then bring with them the domain expertise in the industry-promotion or transformational work. Having people with the relevant knowledge and experience in the TACs also means that they can help the TACs develop industry code of conduct, standards, benchmarking and development programmes. There is great value in getting each TAC to be staffed by people of their respective industry.",8,998,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00998
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Effective TACs are not just limited to firms practising professional services. The Singapore Business Federation (SBF) is another good example. Today, all Singapore-registered companies with a share capital of $500,000 and above have to join SBF. SBF thus has the capital, legitimacy and professionals who have the clout to fulfil their mandate to help the larger companies.",9,999,2018-02-05-T-020-S-00999
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Beyond the general business chambers, the real leadership and drive for ITM transformation must come from the specific trade associations, who have a more intimate knowledge of the industry and experience. Thus, we can look to get the trade associations to have greater ownership.",10,1000,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01000
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),We can also see how we can better resource these associations and industry bodies to have relevant professionals so that they can provide effective leadership. This can come through mandatory participation and affordable membership fees.,11,1001,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01001
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"That brings me to my second point ‒ the role of the SME Centres. It will be difficult to ensure that every sector has an effective TAC. Within any sector, there are also many smaller industries. Hence, SME Centres can help. For now, SME Centres spend a large proportion of their time in bringing the Government grants and incentive schemes to companies, and they have been effective in reaching out to more than 200,000 companies annually.",12,1002,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01002
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"However, with the launch of the Business Grant Portal (BGP), companies here, especially those who are savvy, will be able to self-help for Government schemes. As such, there is scope for SME Centres to play a dual role, which is to drive the ITMs.",13,1003,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01003
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"They can drive ITMs by encouraging geographical or industry collaborations. For example, the SME Centres can provide the industries within the same location with the advantage of the use of common facilities, shared services and shared marketing resources. This will especially help the smaller companies and industries. The SME Centres can also develop industry-specific knowledge by hiring existing staff with relevant knowledge.",14,1004,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01004
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Alternatively, Enterprise Singapore can also consider co-opting staff, preferably with industry experience, to a SME Centre so that the SME Centre can be a focal point to help specific industry ITMs.",15,1005,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01005
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"My last point is to tap on additional media channels. While we are doing all that, there is still a danger of some companies falling through the cracks. After all, we cannot force some companies to come up to the SME Centre if they are not aware of the initiatives or the drive the transformation. This is a real problem.",16,1006,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01006
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Our Singapore SME landscape is such that many of their owners may not be English-educated and may not be very familiar with many Government schemes or incentives. While I know that agencies like SPRING have made an effort in recent years to reach out to the non-English media, there is scope to do more. Take the Chinese media, for instance. Reaching out to SMEs through Lianhe Zaobao may not be sufficient. Some of them read evening dailies, like Shin Min Daily or Wanbao. The problem is that many of our SME leaders are not plugged into the national newspapers and simply do not have the luxury of time to flip through the newspapers every day.",17,1007,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01007
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Hence, we should encourage and explore all forms of media communication, including radio and the media from the Malay and Tamil languages.",18,1008,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01008
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"We could discuss on industry-specific transformation on these news channels and do so in the language of the everyday Singaporean. For example, we can have a programme talking about the fate of the prata makers, something that will gel with the everyday Singaporean and make people aware of the issues. This is important because many SME owners and workers, especially from micro-SMEs, are everyday Singaporeans.",19,1009,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01009
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"One might wonder whether it is possible to capture the imagination of everyday Singaporeans, especially on this seemingly technical subject of industry transformation. But I would argue otherwise. Many Singaporeans, especially those above 45 who consume these news channels, are deeply aware of the implication of the ongoing business transformation, because they live through it every day. And many of them have a deep anxiety about what is next and how to adjust to the changing world.",20,1010,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01010
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Therefore, using the mass communication channel to talk about the fate of different industries will not just focus everybody on these industries, but getting everyday Singaporeans to think about how to do things differently.",21,1011,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01011
2018-02-05-T-020,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"When we talk about industry 4.0, technical terms get thrown around liberally. Digital, data, disruptions are big words. But all it means is trying to do things differently. Therefore, we must get as many Singaporeans who are staffing our SMEs, who are business owners, to think about doing things differently all the time.",22,1012,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01012

2018-02-05-T-020,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"As a single agency, ESG will be able to pool together resources and expertise across a wider spectrum of corporate strategies. This would facilitate the provision of more holistic support for enterprises to succeed in both domestic and overseas markets and better respond to the challenges presented in these markets. But as with all mergers, it is to rise to concerns about continuity. The Minister has mentioned this in his opening speech. However, I would just like to focus a bit on the details.",2,1015,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01015
2018-02-05-T-020,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Having a different account manager is a concern shared by some companies.

2018-02-05-T-020,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"If a new account manager is to be deployed, frequent follow-ups would help to build relationships, create assurance and familiarity. Certainly, as long as the new manager is committed to the success and welfare of the business, his/her identity should not be of grave concern. Ultimately, there is not a single solution, or even specific formulae that could apply across the board as no one enterprise is different, and this goes even for those in the same industry. It would be more productive to craft strategies and implementation together with each enterprise.",4,1017,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01017

I would like to ask the Minister how the ESG and its new structure intends to continue to prioritise them. With the synergies of the new entity, will the form-filling procedures, for example, required by SMEs be streamlined or reduced? Embedding technology and digitalisation in the form-filling procedures could save a lot of time and manpower, which is valuable to SMEs with a small headcount.

These areas are brand building, overseas growth, and technology adoption. It is a positive sign that companies recognise the value of brand-building.

In fact, some of these SMEs are already getting assistance and support rendered by IE and SPRING to SMEs, which in essence is part of the ITM, I believe.

2018-02-05-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Beyond large listed companies, we can do more to increase uptake of sustainable business practices by SMEs who are the biggest employers and contribute to the bulk of growth.

2018-02-05-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"To be sure, there are moves in that direction. SMEs are part of the supply chain for listed companies and would be impacted by SGX regulations. I also applaud initiatives by BCA, such as increasing funding for SMEs to green their premises, providing free feasibility assessments against BCA Green Mark standards, and piloting the Behavioural Change Programme to encourage building users to adopt sustainable behaviours. Another initiative is the Energy Efficiency fund, which supports businesses including SMEs in identifying, and undertaking energy efficiency retrofits.",14,1040,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01040

2018-02-05-T-020,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fast-changing economic landscape demands that our businesses sees the global markets as a continuum with the domestic market. Changes in financing structures and supply chains, and ease of doing business overseas have opened up business opportunities beyond Singapore. There is a consequent need to support our local businesses to seize such opportunities. The new Enterprise Singapore can play such an important role.",1,1046,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01046
2018-02-05-T-020,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"With the formation of the new agency, it should not simply be an amalgamation of two current separate approaches to helping our companies. The chances to tap on overseas opportunities and best practices should influence how we help SMEs to grow. I will like to ask how will the support and assistance for SMEs to grow be different than what it was before? What new strategies will be taken to assist them in building capacity and remaining relevant in Singapore, or in expanding their businesses abroad? Yet, because many of the SMEs might not be ready for overseas expansion, how can we still ensure that these SMEs are not neglected as we help the potential winners? They still face many pressing issues such as improving productivity, manpower shortages and business process re-engineering. We must ensure that efforts to help them continue unabated.",2,1047,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01047
2018-02-05-T-020,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The new agency with its new integrated mandate of helping businesses to grow can also develop new ways in operationalising the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). There are two separate facets  one, from Singapore-to-overseas and two, outside-and-into Singapore. I will take them in turn.",3,1048,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01048
2018-02-05-T-020,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, many of the ITMs were developed while the two agencies were still separate entities. How would the ITMs change now that the local-overseas nexus is much stronger? For example, in the retail and F&B sector where SPRING Singapore has been a major player and lead agency of the ITM, how would the merger change its approach to helping the F&B businesses? There are opportunities in getting local businesses to benefit from global supply chains and expansion opportunities. For example, in the SC VivoCity project in Ho Chi Minh City, we can find familiar names such as NTUC Fairprice via its CoopXtra venture, Breadtalk, and also Xiao Ban which is linked to the famous Lao Ban Dou Hua. In the case of CoopXtra, the overseas venture has allowed new food supplies to be established for Singapore. I hope that with the new agency, we can accelerate such growth and expansion of our local businesses.",4,1049,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01049
2018-02-05-T-020,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Two, from an outside-and-into Singapore perspective, there are also opportunities for the new agency to work with EDB to explore synergies in operationalising our ITMs, especially in cluster transformation. In attracting investments into Singapore, our SMEs can benefit in providing strategic partnerships and ancillary services to the MNCs. Bringing in the right MNCs can catalyse transformation in many industries, especially through horizontal competencies such as ICT and supply chain management.",5,1050,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01050
2018-02-05-T-020,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"As with any merger, there is lingering concern on the deployment of manpower. I would like to ask the Minister if the employees of IE Singapore and SPRING Singapore will be absorbed entirely into this new agency. Will there be any redundancies and if so, what will happen to the staff who are made redundant due to this merger and will they be redeployed?",6,1051,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01051

2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Thank you. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank all 11 speakers for their unambiguous support of the Bill. And let me now address the key points that have been raised and I would try to give some clarifications on the issues that have been brought up.",1,1071,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01071
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I want to start by saying that generally, the fact that the Members have supported the Bill, and I think, in general, also reflecting the mood and the opinion in the broader business community, are welcomed signs because it means that we are moving in the right direction. Many of the questions are around the details in terms of how and what we intend to do in execution and I would endeavour to address them as much as I can.",2,1072,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01072
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Firstly, I think there is a set of questions around how ESG will proceed with its task, its mission. Various Members – Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Leon Perera, Mr Thomas Chua, Mr Louis Ng and Mr Saktiandi and Mr Desmond Choo – have asked whether ESG will, in fact, support enterprises of different sizes and from different industries.",3,1073,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01073
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, I want to reiterate that ESG's mission is to build a thriving community of Singapore-based enterprises. However, the fact is their needs are varied based on their stages of growth, the sectors within which they operated and also to some extent, the markets in which they are venturing into, beyond Singapore. And this variation is also accentuated by the fact that there are different types of growth opportunities, digitalisation and technology change, which have a differential impact on the various sectors.",4,1074,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01074
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, for all these reasons, it is important that our businesses have to adapt, t innovate and build new capabilities according to their circumstances, as has been pointed out by several Members in the course of this debate. And ESG itself, and I want to again stress this, will adopt an enterprise-centric approach and its programmes will take into account this diversity of needs while rendering support to enterprises in all sectors – to address Mr Thomas Chua's point – regardless of whether they are covered by ITMs or not. The fact is the programmes and schemes are available to all enterprises. The ITMs bring them together in particular sectors because there are certain objectives around that, but in general, the accessibility is opened to all.",5,1075,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01075
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I also want to address the point about micro SMEs because they are an important segment of the economy and they have much potential. And I want to share with Members that SPRING has already been working with the Federation of Merchants' Associations, Singapore, for example, to drive the growth and transformation of heartland enterprises. So, similarly, ESG will continue to support micro SMEs through Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) and the SME centres as well as through – and this is important – private sector initiatives, such as the 99% SME campaign which is jointly organised by Singtel and DBS Bank to drive capability upgrading.",6,1076,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01076
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"ESG will build on IE Singapore's network of over 35 overseas centres covering regional, developed and emerging markets and it will continue to organise trade missions for our SMEs to explore opportunities in new markets. I think Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and also Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Desmond Choo highlighted this.",7,1077,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01077
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Louis Ng cited survey findings indicating that few SMEs want to venture overseas due to concerns over insufficient funding, unfamiliarity and heightened competition in foreign markets. However, as I highlighted earlier, there are also surveys by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and DP Information Group (SME Development Survey), which found that a significant proportion of our enterprises have, in fact, prioritised internationalisation and have plans to do so in the next few years. This becomes then a battle of the surveys,and which is right, and which is wrong. The reality of what it shows is that the terrain is uneven. We should recognise and acknowledge that. In other words, whilst we are making the best of efforts to reach out to all our companies, some, depending on their stage of development, their sector and so on, will have a differential response. Some might even not have addressed these issues because they are so used to some other aspects of their business.",8,1078,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01078
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,I also want to say that it is quite understandable that SMEs have concerns when venturing abroad because that is not without risks. Our economic agencies have sought to mitigate some of those risks through support schemes to evaluate the opportunities like the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) Scheme and also to build their manpower and capability such as the Global Company Partnership (GCP) scheme.,9,1079,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01079
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And on ESG's part, it will sustain and, where necessary, step up efforts to help companies that are facing challenges in financial management, brand building and product promotions, points Mr Liang and Mr Saktiandi have highlighted. And we have also worked with the TACs and companies to encourage greater collaboration in sharing of experiences so that they can enter markets more effectively, perhaps in partnership or at least learning from each other's experience so that the pathway is a bit less difficult.",10,1080,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01080
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But I do want to make one point. Ultimately, each entrepreneur has to weigh the risk reward balance of any new venture before making a decision. This is the very essence of entrepreneurship and it is not something that can be supplanted by any Government agency or support programme. And so, it is important that whilst we have this architecture of schemes and programmes to support our enterprises, our entrepreneurs have to step up, make the assessments and take the decision.",11,1081,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01081
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Leon Perera made a good point which is that, at the end of the day, the levels of ambition may be different and also the appetite for risks, and we respect that. So, it is more about individual companies and their leaders making the choice and then, benefiting from the appropriate schemes that are available from our economic agencies.",12,1082,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01082
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I want to turn next to a set of questions around the programmes and schemes. Various Members have raised these questions and they have asked whether the Government schemes will be streamlined, if not now, then in the future, and in the process of the transition.",13,1083,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01083
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Generally, the streamlining of Government grants is an on-going process because we want to ensure policy efficacy, meaning that it is achieving its desired or stated objective; and also to ensure accessibility for businesses and importantly, staying relevant in the context of the different circumstances. So, for example, there have been changes made to some of the processes. The Business Grant Portal (BGP) was launched in January last year to provide a one-stop portal for businesses to apply for grants without having to approach multiple agencies. This is an important step. And it includes grants administered not just by MTI agencies but also others like BCA's Building Information Model Fund. The plan is to add more grants to this portal progressively. And we share the objective of wanting to make things simpler for our companies. ESG will continue the review of its touch points processes and schemes for that purpose.",14,1084,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01084
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But at the same time, I agree with the point made by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah that whilst that we have a quest for ease of access and efficiency in the administration of Government grants, they should not come at the expense of efficient and effective safeguards. The Government takes a strong stance against any case of fraud or abuse and will take stern enforcement action after investigations. Internal control systems are reviewed regularly and the lessons learnt, especially from some incidents of abuse, are incorporated to prevent future irregularities. It is not fool-proof but it is an important part of the process of continuing to ensure that safeguards are in place.",15,1085,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01085
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the specific point about the transition, because the schemes are being administered by SPRING and IE Singapore today, and after 1 April, by ESG, the important element here is not so much to have an audit today but ensuring that there is a clear audit trail because all the officers will be working in the new organisation in one form or another, and it is important that we have the data, the analysis and the audit trails so that if there is a need for verification, it can be done, regardless of when that need arises.",16,1086,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01086
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I want to assure Mr Louis Ng that ESG will continue SPRING's close collaboration with our agencies such as NEA in order to encourage the SMEs to adopt efficient energy practices in their businesses, as well also to support the adoption of standards to ensure the sustainability. These practices, and I want to echo the point that Mr Louis Ng made and also others have made, they are not relevant just for the reason of sustainability of the environment but also because they make good business sense. And, in fact, many enterprises today differentiate themselves on the basis of their sustainable practices. So, we encourage it.",17,1087,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01087
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh's query was whether there has been a good take-up rate of the programmes that support our local enterprises. As I said in the Second Reading speech earlier, both SPRING and IE Singapore have been able to reach out to more and more enterprises over the years and there has been a good traction. And I think this is something that will continue under the ESG and it will reach out to more companies. We will share more details on any changes to the suite of schemes and grants at the upcoming Budget and Committee of Supply debates.",18,1088,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01088
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Before I move on, I did want to highlight one thing. As we listen to the comments and ideas made by many of the Members who spoke today, I think the inherent tensions in some of our aspirations become quite apparent. On the one hand, we want one organisation because that would make it easy for everyone to know where to go to get what kind of help; on the other hand, we want the nimbleness and flexibility of small organisations because they can move around and be more quick in their response. On the one hand, we want customised programmes to help companies who have got specific needs and they have got higher ambitions or greater risk appetite; on the other hand, we want broad-based, easy schemes so that companies do not have to go through a major exercise of providing information in order to benefit from them. On the one hand we want easy access, on the other hand we want effective safeguards.",19,1089,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01089
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"These are the tensions in the administration of any Government programme. This is something that ESG will have to wrestle with. The last I checked, ESG officers, or today's IE and SPRING officers are not caped crusaders. They are people like you and me. They are making an effort to reach out and do the best that they can. What we will find as we go forward is that they will try to find this balance, adjusting their programmes and schemes according to the needs of the companies on the ground but also with an eye to Singapore's long-term economic objectives and future.",20,1090,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01090
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"There were a series of questions on transition issues. First, on the resources. ESG will draw on the combined resources of IE and SPRING, except for the head count and budget that goes with the consumer protection role which will be transferred to the Competition Commission of Singapore.",21,1091,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01091
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To ensure business continuity, companies will have the same account managers as far as possible. I want to stress that because many Members have raised this and it is an important point. So, whether they have been served by SPRING or by IE, the commitment is to try and ensure that they have the same account manager.",22,1092,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01092
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In the unlikely event that it is not possible for certain operational reasons, the ESG management is committed to ensuring a seamless handover. And this is important because it is not just the officer who is on the frontline, but also the team that supports him or her in the relationship with the companies. So, I think we have enough bench strength in the system to deal with the transition issues if in fact there is a change of account management.",23,1093,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01093
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But in establishing ESG, we also have taken care to preserve the competencies, networks and culture that SPRING and IE have built over the years. So, I want to assure Members, especially Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Desmond Choo, that all IE and SPRING officers can look forward to augmented roles and opportunities and in some cases new assignments in ESG.",24,1094,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01094
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As part of any move, whether it is an enlarged role or a new, there will be training and mentorship that is relevant that will be provided. ESG will also continue to recruit officers from both the public and the private sectors because you need that blend of capabilities and they need the relevant industry and international business experience in order to support the mission. This will include tapping on industry experts to support the enterprises through counsel advice, which is something that Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has talked about.",25,1095,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01095
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Patrick Tay has also asked about the integration of the cultures and workflows of the two organisations. This is the perennial challenge of any merger. The key is to get the mission clear and the leadership correct. In the case of ESG, the mission is clear, and importantly it builds on the work that has already been done by IE and SPRING. In terms of leadership, the Chairman designate, Mr Peter Ong, is the former Head of Civil Service and also has served in Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). The CEO designate Mr Png Cheong Boon, is the Second Permanent Secretary atMTI, and has helmed several economic agencies. Together, they bring extensive leadership experience in the public service and in working with the business community. I am confident that they, and the senior management, will build a strong culture of the organisation and the mission orientation in ESG.",26,1096,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01096
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Let me now move on to the point on partnerships and collaborations, which several Members have stressed. Even as we strengthen ESG in terms of its capabilities and its programmes and so on, we have to ensure that the partnership and co-ownership of initiatives is something that is emphasised in the relationship with companies and industry stakeholders. That is the key to success. We have to collectively own this and work together on it. So, I agree with Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Henry Kwek that all stakeholders must work closely together to understand the challenges and also to identify the opportunities. Broadly, we are doing this in three ways.",27,1097,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01097
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First is collaboration within the public sector. With the merger, ESG and EDB will form two critical and complementary Government agencies that will help formulate and implement strategies for the development of industry clusters and enterprises in Singapore. These agencies with also work closely with A*STAR and JTC, among other Government organisations. So, we bring first a public sector, holistic perspective to the engagement and the policies.",28,1098,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01098
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Second, EDB and ESG will promote partnerships within the private sector – a point that has been raised by several Members. Through the Partnerships for Capabilities Transformation (PACT) programme, they will drive greater collaboration between multinational corporations, large local enterprises, our SMEs and also our startups so that they can reinforce each other's strengths and in the process, we end up with a competitive industry and one that is able to compete globally.",29,1099,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01099
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Third, it is the collaboration that we have with other industry stakeholders like TACs who are important agents of change within industries. Mr Henry Kwek spoke on the need to professionalise our TACs which SPRING and IE have already been doing and supporting through the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) programme. We had a further evolution of that through LEAD Plus, that was introduced in Budget 2016 to strengthen the leadership and secretariat teams at the TACs and also to improve their organisational processes and deliver new value-added services.",30,1100,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01100
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In 2017, SPRING and IE committed a $100 million from FY2016 to FY2020 to encourage industries to drive impactful cross-industry projects. We are supporting our TACs, in terms of their people, their capabilities, and their ability to run programme that affects the entire industry. I think there is scope here. The points that have been raised by Mr Saktiandi Supaat in the context of the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SMCCI) – these are the areas where they can form the agenda for engagement between the ESG and SMCCI, for example.",31,1101,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01101
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,The point that Ms Jessica Tan made about sharing amongst SMEs – again it is something where you can get these collaborations going in order to see how SMEs can rely on each other and perhaps pool some of their resources.,32,1102,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01102
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Mr Henry Kwek talked about the SME Centres as a first stop. They are important nodes to provide customised business advice and to help our SMEs better understand our Government initiatives. It is a two-way thing. It is not just about them going to SME Centres to apply for grants; it is also for SME Centres to convey and cascade information on Government programmes and initiatives.,33,1103,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01103
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In 2016, we enhanced our SME Centres to provide business diagnosis, run upgrading projects and solve common business challenges. There are also plans for more of such group-based upgrading projects with other SME Centres, TACs and merchant associations so that more of our SMEs can benefit from them.",34,1104,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01104
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, ultimately, it is important to recognise that if we are to achieve a vibrant and thriving community of Singapore-based enterprises, all our stakeholders have to be co-owners of the mission and equal partners in the various change initiatives. It is critical that the message reaches the entire spectrum of enterprises and I thank Mr Kwek and Mr Saktiandi Supaat for their comments on public communications and strengthening outreach to SMEs and the broader public.",35,1105,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01105
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To promote the message of industry transformation, our agencies have engaged the target audience not only through the mainstream media but also through social media, and other methods like dialogues and seminars. They have also stepped up efforts to work with the vernacular media like Lianhe Zaobao and Berita Harian. From October to December last year, the Ministry of Communications and Information worked with our economic agencies and Lianhe Wanbao to organise a series of dialogues to target the Mandarin-speaking SME business owners in sectors such as wholesale trade, logistics, retail and F&B.",36,1106,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01106

We are working on various initiatives and we are working with the TACs and NTUC to help disseminate the message to a wider audience through their communication channels.",37,1107,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01107
2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The TACs have organised events such as the Singapore Business Federation's Future Economy conference and exhibition last year, and NTUC helps amplify messages on transformation to its network of workers through dialogues, seminars and marketing collaterals.

2018-02-05-T-020,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Moving forward, ESG will work closely with the media, the trade associations and chambers, and unions to propagate the transformation message to ensure greater outreach and awareness among employees. But again, it is important that our enterprises and workers also take the initiative to find out what is happening in their industry, what the changes are, and what they need to do in order to adapt themselves to these changes and be prepared for the next phase in the development of their sectors. This is an important responsibility that we cannot ignore.",39,1109,2018-02-05-T-020-S-01109

2018-02-05-T-022,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to declare my interest as a disputes lawyer in private practice. In last year’s Budget, SMEs were described in some materials published by MOF as being at the heart of the Singapore's economy. They make up 99% of our enterprises, employ two-thirds of our workforce and account for half of Singapore’s GDP. This is a positive sign which demonstrates the entrepreneurial spirit of Singapore.",1,1123,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01123
2018-02-05-T-022,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The 2017 Annual Business Survey conducted by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that business sentiment among Singapore SMEs has risen. However, SMEs continue to face a number of challenges. The same business survey also revealed that SMEs continue to face rising business costs, with 72.3% of respondents saying that they face higher business costs, compared with 62.3% the year before. Rising business cost is also cited as the biggest challenge by 68.4% of those polled, ranking ahead of competition in the Singapore market and manpower shortage. The Government continues to help SMEs through various means, for example, through the SME working capital, and we just heard today's debate on the Enterprise Singapore Board Bill to support enterprise development ‒ yet another example of helping SMEs. SMEs themselves would have to continually evolve ways to deliver more productivity gains, for example, by leveraging on technology.",2,1124,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01124
2018-02-05-T-022,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"One area that we could look closer at and where small businesses are particularly disadvantaged, is in respect of contractual dealings with large suppliers who dominate the market. These dominant players’ usage of market power to drive the use of one-sided and unfair terms has the effect of increasing business risks and costs on the part of small businesses. I respectfully suggest that the time has come for regulatory and legislative solutions to be offered to protect the interests of small businesses from such domineering practices.",3,1125,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01125

2018-02-05-T-022,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"In the Budget debate last year, I raised the issue of large players taking advantage of their size in commercial dealings with small businesses. This persists in the rental markets which involved, on the one hand, landlords with muscle, such as REITs, and, on the other hand, tenants which are small businesses. This imbalance in power has allowed tenancy agreements to contain onerous clauses for tenants. For example, a “demolition clause” allows the landlord to recover the premises for redevelopment purposes initiated by the landlord itself without any compensation to the tenant, who may have spent a significant sum to retrofit the premises and who may not have had the benefit of most of the terms of the tenancy. An example of such a clause may be found in the handout.",2,1129,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01129
2018-02-05-T-022,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"I dealt with such a case some years back. I acted for my aunt who ran a beauty parlour at a shopping mall for an initial period of three years. The mall owner extended her lease for another three years. My aunt decided to spend money to renovate her premises. About 10 months later, she was served with a Notice to yield premises on the basis that the owner decided to renovate the floor in which her beauty parlour was located. My aunt was in tears as she had ploughed most of her savings into renovating the premises. She was facing a certain financial ruin. Not only that, she was upset that her staff who have been loyal and been with her for years would have to be let go, too. Thankfully for my aunt, the High Court, in a reported decision, ruled that the owners exercised the demolition clause in bad faith. This is rare. For the vast majority of tenants in my aunt’s shoes, they have to yield their premises without any compensation.",3,1130,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01130
2018-02-05-T-022,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"Additionally, commercial lease contracts include provisions stating that the tenant is responsible for any additional property tax that is payable on the leased premises above the base property tax payable by the landlord. However, if the shoe was on the other foot and the landlord subsequently receives tax savings through tax rebates, reliefs or exemptions, there is no contractual provision requiring the landlord to pass these tax savings to the tenant.",4,1131,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01131
2018-02-05-T-022,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"It is also common for commercial leases to contain what I term as ""illusory options"". What do I mean by this? There are leases that provide that options to renew are granted on the basis of rent to be decided by the landlord at the time of the renewal. Another variation is the provision in the leases that the revised rent is to be determined by the landlord, whose determination is final and conclusive. In both cases, the contractual provision giving the tenant the right of an option to renew is effectively illusory and non-enforceable as the essential terms for the renewed lease have not been agreed on and the tenant can potentially be provided with the Hobson's choice by the landlord at the point of renewal.",5,1132,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01132

The first is that small businesses, who may not be as sophisticated and have the same level of resources as large companies, need protection to make effective purchasing decisions relative to larger businesses. Second, as a matter of policy coherence, if small businesses behave more like individual consumers than they behave like large businesses, then it would be coherent to treat them the same under the law.",9,1136,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01136

However, unlike Singapore, for consumers, which by definition excludes small businesses, there is also recourse to the Hong Kong Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance (UCO). The UCO provides that with respect to a contract for the sale of goods or supply of services in which one party deals as a consumer, where the court finds any part of the contract to have been unconscionable in the circumstances when the contract was made, the court may refuse to enforce that part of the contract, or limit the application of the unconscionable part.",10,1137,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01137

Article 138 of the German Civil Code known as BGB renders a legal transaction where a person exploiting the counterparty's weakness grants to himself a pecuniary advantage which exceeds the value of performance to such an extent that under the circumstances, the pecuniary advantage is an obvious disproportion to the performance void. Section 2-302(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code of United States provides that if a court, as a matter of law, finds a sale contract or any clause of a sale contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the contract, amongst other options. This provision has been judicially interpreted to apply outside the arena of sale contracts to lease of chattels, insurance contracts and other areas.

Consistent with this, the UK telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, provides such small businesses with the same protection as domestic customers throughout its general conditions. For example, both types of customers are covered by Ofcom rules relating to information to be provided at the point of sale, the ban on automatic rollover contracts (ARCs), and restrictions on misleading or aggressive selling. Each supplier is required to develop and publish a Code of Practice for both individual and small business consumers that should, at a minimum, specify where such customers can avail themselves of necessary information. Access to the Alternative Dispute Resolution scheme is also available for both domestic and small business customers.",14,1141,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01141

The ACL provides for a national unfair contract terms law covering standard form consumer and small business contracts. The ACL provides that a term is unfair when it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract, and it is not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the supplier, and it would cause financial or non-financial detriment to a party. Terms that are determined by a court to be unfair are void.",15,1142,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01142

For example, the Act prohibits the landlord from engaging in conduct that is unconscionable in connection with the lease. The relevant factors to be taken into consideration to determine whether the landlord has contravened this section include the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the landlord and tenant; whether the tenant was required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the landlord; and whether any unfair tactics were used against the tenant.",17,1144,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01144

It is open for other regulators in Singapore, such as IMDA or EMA, to adopt MAS’ practice and require the big players to provide fair dealing outcomes to their customers.",19,1146,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01146

Even when we do intervene, we try as far as possible to have the right regulatory touch, and avoid heavy-handed interventions that could lead to distortion or unintended consequences. This philosophy has ensured that our businesses, big and small, can respond quickly to market signals, and adjust their business strategies accordingly.

But that may not solve the problem as the tenant and the landlord may disagree on what the market rate is. If they cannot agree, the tenancy will either not be renewed, in which case the tenant will still have to find new premises (which is the same position that the tenant would have been in if he had rejected the landlord's revision under the sample clause); or the tenant can continue with the lease, while both parties litigate the market rate, which will sour the relationship, and likely rule out a further lease beyond the option term, which may not be in the tenant's interest.",6,1154,2018-02-05-T-022-S-01154

The recent study by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) on Social Capital in Singapore, supported by my ministry, asked respondents to name different kinds of people who make up their social network. The results are encouraging and show a good deal of social mixing. The study found a fair amount of racial and religious diversity in people's social networks. It noted that respondents and their neighbours helped each other with house matters, while workplace ties were an important source of social companionship, inter-ethnic contact, and inter-nationality ties. Although respondents tended to have social networks that were relatively less diverse in terms of educational status and type of housing, the study also found that respondents were able to name people in occupations ranging from low to medium to high status and prestige.1 As this study is the first of its kind in Singapore, it can be built upon to track the trend over time.",1,1194,2018-02-05-T-027-S-01194

2018-02-05-T-029,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The employment outcomes for our university graduates have been good; over the past ten years, around nine in 10 university graduates who entered the labour market each year found employment within six months after their final examinations. This is achieved by ensuring that university courses are relevant and of good quality, and produce graduates with degrees valued by the market. In addition, and also most importantly, we have to ensure that the Singapore economy remains diverse and dynamic.",1,1205,2018-02-05-T-029-S-01205

We have enhanced our Education and Career Guidance (ECG) system, opened up more educational pathways, and introduced more opportunities for internships and overseas attachments. Students can also use the MySkillsFuture portal to help them make informed education and career choices. We have also launched new SkillsFuture Work-Study Degree Programmes, where Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and industry collaborate to deliver undergraduate courses.

The SRS members came from all income brackets, with a larger proportion from higher-income brackets. This is a natural result as the SRS is intended to encourage supplementary savings beyond what individuals save in CPF.",2,1211,2018-02-05-T-030-S-01211

2018-02-05-T-035,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In the last five years, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (or TAFEP) received about 1,500 complaints on workplace issues. Among them six cases were related to allegations of workplace harassment. TAFEP had looked into all the six cases. In four of them, with the employees' consent, we engaged the employer and advised them to take corrective actions. For the two cases where the employees did not wish for TAFEP to engage the employer, we advised the employees on their options.

2018-02-05-T-036,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To minimise the need for maintenance, HDB's sheltered walkways are designed to be self-cleansing and for rainwater to drain off directly from the roof wherever possible. The design avoids the use of roof gutters which would trap leaves and other debris, thus requiring regular cleaning and maintenance to avoid any blockage and water stagnation that could lead to mosquito breeding.",3,1238,2018-02-05-T-036-S-01238
2018-02-05-T-036,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In recent years, sheltered walkways built by HDB and LTA also have roof designs such that they are sloped to one side, so that discharge of water during heavy rain only occurs on the side where pedestrians are less expected to cross.

To enable the CVs to perform their role more effectively, they are empowered to request the particulars of offenders who fail to heed their advice. The particulars are sent to the National Environment Agency (NEA) for follow-up action. Given that the vast majority of the offenders had responded positively to the advice of CVs such as by picking up their litter and no further action was taken against them, there are currently no plans to equip CVs with body-worn cameras.

2018-02-05-T-043,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what the number of Singaporeans who have been subject to Casino Exclusion Orders over the past five years is; (b) whether programmes in place to guard against problem gambling are adequate; and (c) whether the Ministry intends to increase the casino entry levy of $100 for Singaporeans.,1,1264,2018-02-05-T-043-S-01264
2018-02-05-T-043,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are three types of Casino Exclusion, namely, (a) Voluntary Self-Exclusion, (b) Family Exclusion, and (c) Automatic Exclusion for Singapore residents who are bankrupts, receiving financial assistance from the Government, receiving legal aid, or residing in HDB rental flats with rental arrears. As at 31 December 2017, approximately 24,000 Singapore residents are under Voluntary Self-Exclusion. Some 2,200 had Family Exclusion Orders and 44,000 had Automatic Exclusion Orders imposed on them. These numbers have remained stable over the last five years.",1,1265,2018-02-05-T-043-S-01265
2018-02-05-T-043,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have put in place a robust and comprehensive set of social safeguards to combat problem gambling. This includes casino entry levies, exclusion and visit limits, not permitting credit for Singapore residents who are not premium players, age restrictions, as well as advertising and promotions restrictions. Additionally, there are ongoing public education programmes to raise awareness of gambling disorders.",2,1266,2018-02-05-T-043-S-01266
2018-02-05-T-043,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The various social safeguards have helped to minimise the social ills of casino gambling. The latest published Gambling Participation Survey (GPS) in 2014 showed that the overall probable pathological and problem gambling (PPG) rates among Singapore residents was 0.7%. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these social safeguards, work closely with our community partners who are helping to tackle gambling addiction, and make changes when necessary.",3,1267,2018-02-05-T-043-S-01267
2018-02-05-T-044,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider requiring all buses to be fitted with steps that are lower or can be lowered so that the distance between the last step and the bus stop curb can be closer for the safety of alighting commuters.,1,1268,2018-02-05-T-044-S-01268
2018-02-05-T-044,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"For the safety of commuters, our public buses have low floors with a maximum height of 32 cm above the ground. To ease boarding and alighting, our bus captains are trained to pull up within half a meter of the kerb, and to ensure commuters have boarded or alighted safely before moving off. LTA has been exploring the installation of bus steps which can be lowered but has yet to come across a system that can ensure the safe movement of commuters on and off the bus when passenger flow is heavy.",1,1269,2018-02-05-T-044-S-01269
2018-02-05-T-045,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are any plans to manage the large number of heavy vehicles travelling along Fort Road; and (b) what are the measures to improve safety for other road users on this road.,1,1270,2018-02-05-T-045-S-01270
2018-02-05-T-045,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Most of the heavy vehicles plying along Fort Road are going to and from the construction sites for the Thomson East-Coast Line and the Marina East Staging Ground, where excavated materials are transferred to barges for reuse or disposal at offshore sites.",1,1271,2018-02-05-T-045-S-01271
2018-02-05-T-045,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) works closely with the developers and contractors to develop localised traffic control plans to improve safety and minimise inconvenience to other road users. These plans include managing the time and route of the heavy vehicles to avoid peak hour traffic and residential areas where possible. There are signs to alert motorists to slow down and watch out for heavy vehicles. There is regular monitoring to ensure that heavy vehicles adhere to the control plans. In addition, LTA has also installed surveillance cameras at Fort Road to monitor the traffic situation, and deploys enforcement officers when necessary.",2,1272,2018-02-05-T-045-S-01272

2018-02-05-T-046,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,asked the Prime Minister (a) what key projects are being carried out to cut inefficiency across Ministries; and (b) whether the Smart Nation office has a timeframe for getting inter-agency work to be reduced in time and effort by using technology.,1,1274,2018-02-05-T-046-S-01274
2018-02-05-T-046,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung (for the Prime Minister),"Since the 1980s, the Government has been using automation technology to do our work more efficiently and serve Singaporeans better. Our national libraries use RFID tags to track the borrowing, return and sorting of books, and provide access to a wide range of e-resources on-line; checkpoints at Woodlands and Tuas have automated capabilities to clear motorcyclists and pillion riders; and our hospitals use automated medication dispensing systems.",1,1275,2018-02-05-T-046-S-01275

2018-02-05-T-046,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung (for the Prime Minister),"One important task of many agencies is to respond to public feedback and queries. They can be voluminous. We want to address simple queries quickly, while paying more attention to difficult cases. To help us do this, we have deployed chatbots to handle calls and queries from the public. We are also using Natural Language Processing to spot patterns in feedback and make upstream process changes. For example, the Government Technology Agency ran textual analysis on feedback emails sent by the public to the Housing & Development Board (HDB). This generated the insight that key collection was a major issue. As a result, HDB changed its key collection process from assigning dates to homeowners to allowing them to select a date to collect their keys.",3,1277,2018-02-05-T-046-S-01277
2018-02-05-T-046,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung (for the Prime Minister),"Digital technology also enables the integration of government functions across agencies. The OneService App allows citizens to report municipal issues involving multiple agencies on a single portal, without having to access individual agencies’ websites and call centres. But the app is just the front end. It needs to be accompanied by policy and process changes in order for efficiencies to be reaped and services to the citizen improved. We are taking a similar approach to build citizen-centric services around ""Moments of Life"" (MoL), delivering relevant government digital services to individuals based on specific moments in their lives such as the birth of a child. The first phase of the MoL app, centered around parents with young children, will be rolled out by mid-2018. We are also exploring other life moments to cluster services around, and will provide more information on this in due course.",4,1278,2018-02-05-T-046-S-01278

2018-02-05-T-047,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"For non-citizen students with at least one SC parent who need help with paying their fees, they can approach their schools for assistance and MOE will assess their situation and exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis.",2,1282,2018-02-05-T-047-S-01282
2018-02-05-T-048,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) from 2010 to 2016, how many students have been diagnosed with dyslexia before formal schooling age; (b) what percentage of these students continue to be educated in mainstream schools; and (c) what are the factors taken into consideration when deciding whether to exempt students with dyslexia from taking a second language as a subject.",1,1283,2018-02-05-T-048-S-01283
2018-02-05-T-048,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Dyslexia is characterised by difficulties in learning how to read despite adequate language exposure and good reading instruction. It is therefore more commonly diagnosed after the child has started formal schooling and has received sufficient reading instruction in the primary school. In our multi-lingual society, children grow up in varied home-language environments. Children who appear to have initial difficulties reading in the pre-school years may catch up with their peers as they mature and receive greater exposure when they start primary education where literacy support programmes are available. Many preschools thus focus on providing a language- and print-rich environment to prepare the child for formal reading instruction in Primary 1.",1,1284,2018-02-05-T-048-S-01284
2018-02-05-T-048,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"All children with dyslexia are in mainstream schools and will receive additional literacy support if necessary. Exceptions are made for children with dyslexia who have additional co-occurring conditions (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorder, cerebral palsy) as they are better supported in Special Education Schools.",2,1285,2018-02-05-T-048-S-01285
2018-02-05-T-048,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Students with certified Special Educational Needs (SEN), including dyslexia, may be considered for exemption from Mother Tongue Language (MTL) if their SEN severely affects their ability to cope with MTL and with overall learning. In evaluating such applications, MOE takes into account not just their diagnosed SEN but also how these students are managing in their learning and responding in the classroom.",3,1286,2018-02-05-T-048-S-01286
2018-02-05-T-048,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Students who have difficulties coping with the standard MTL curriculum can consider the option of offering MTL at a lower level.

2018-02-05-T-049,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Office will seek to help retiring officers. Some officers will be suitable to be re-employed within the Home Team, depending on the nature of their work, and manpower needs. The Office will also help the other retiring officers. This will include assisting them in finding new employment. MHA has now set up a structured framework for this. The retiring officers will be engaged early to consider their options.",2,1290,2018-02-05-T-049-S-01290
2018-02-05-T-049,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,A number of initiatives have been launched,3,1291,2018-02-05-T-049-S-01291

2018-02-05-T-049,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"b. We organise workshops to help officers identify the occupations that would suit them, and to guide them on re-skilling or up-skilling to improve their employment prospects.",5,1293,2018-02-05-T-049-S-01293
2018-02-05-T-049,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"c. We have begun a secondment and job attachment programme to help officers transit into their post-retirement career. Officers may apply for secondment to another public agency or to take up a job attachment in a private sector company prior to their retirement, to try out potential job opportunities. This will help both the officer and the prospective employer assess the fit before formal employment. During this period of secondment or job attachment, which can extend up to three months, officers would continue to receive their salaries from their Home Team Departments.",6,1294,2018-02-05-T-049-S-01294

2018-02-05-T-050,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,AVA started tracking dog abandonment data since 2015 and does not have data from the previous Lunar Year of the Dog in 2006. But we understand from anecdotal feedback that some Animal Welfare Groups or AWGs observed an increased in the number of dogs taken into their shelters shortly after 2006.,1,1301,2018-02-05-T-050-S-01301
2018-02-05-T-050,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Hence, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) is stepping its outreach efforts with AWGs and industry partners to promote responsible adoption and pet ownership. The key message is not to acquire pets on impulse, as keeping them is a lifelong commitment. This year, AVA is working on a social media campaign to promote responsible ownership and to encourage potential dog owners to consider adoption first. AVA will also continue to work with AWGs, schools, and other partners to organise road shows, adoption drives, school talks, and community events to create awareness about animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.",2,1302,2018-02-05-T-050-S-01302
2018-02-05-T-050,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Aside from public outreach, AVA has tightened the dog licensing regime as an upstream measure to deter abandonment. As of 1 March 2017, all dogs have to be licensed to the new owner at the point of sale or adoption. This improves traceability and ensures that owners can be held accountable for their pet dogs.",3,1303,2018-02-05-T-050-S-01303

2018-02-05-T-051,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Hence, the Government has been designing public housing developments that can provide care and support for our seniors within the community. Over the years, we have been placing more eldercare facilities such as Senior Activity and Senior Care Centres in our HDB estates. We have taken this one step further with Kampung Admiralty, where senior residents can access a continuum of social and health services at the Active Ageing Hub to support them as their needs evolve. These include active ageing programmes, assisted living services such as housekeeping and grocery delivery for seniors requiring assistance with their daily activities, and rehabilitation, home medical care and home nursing for seniors who require more care. Residents at Kampung Admiralty also have amenities such as a supermarket, hawker centre and medical centre, all within walking distance.",3,1308,2018-02-05-T-051-S-01308

2018-02-05-T-053,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Schools do not promote the use of dialects. Our bilingual policy has enabled a growing proportion of Singaporeans to be proficient in English and their Mother Tongue Language. With our Chinese Language students in schools, our focus is on helping them to learn Mandarin to as high a level as their interests and ability take them. As dialects have differing vocabulary and grammar structure from Mandarin, the learning of dialects may not necessarily ease the learning of Mandarin among students.",1,1315,2018-02-05-T-053-S-01315
2018-02-05-T-053,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"MOE monitors the performance of students at national examinations closely to assess their level of mastery of the different disciplines.

At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks without 100% lift access. Among them, more than 1,000 blocks were initially found to be unfeasible for LUP due to prohibitive cost or technical constraints.",1,1318,2018-02-05-T-054-S-01318
2018-02-05-T-054,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions such as lifts that do not have a machine room at the top of the shafts (i.e. machine room-less lifts) and the use of smaller ""home lifts"" to help such blocks to have direct lift access. Through these efforts, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks are now able to benefit from LUP. There remains only about 150 blocks where it is still not possible to implement LUP due to prohibitive cost, or existing technical or site constraints. On a flat basis, less than 1% of our sold flats do not have direct lift access.",2,1319,2018-02-05-T-054-S-01319

They have to submit relevant documents, such as the doctor's certification of their medical condition. Over the past five years, HDB has received 23 such appeals, and has acceded to 22% of them. HDB will continue to assess such requests on a case-by-case basis, and see how best to render help.",3,1320,2018-02-05-T-054-S-01320
2018-02-05-T-054,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The Member also asked whether blocks with lifts approaching 28 years of age could be granted LUP. I would like to clarify that LUP is not intended to assist Town Councils with their statutory duty to carry out renewal or replacement of common property such as lifts.

Its use in making payments is small, and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies in Singapore are also not high – they are much smaller than in countries like the US, Japan and South Korea. Further, connections between cryptocurrency trading and Singapore’s financial system are also not significant at present. Singapore’s banking system does not have any significant exposure to global and local entities dealing in cryptocurrencies.

2018-02-05-T-060,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The Public Service strives to adopt a customer-centric approach in dealing with feedback and requests from members of the public. The No Wrong Door (NWD) policy and the First Responder Protocol (FRP) were introduced as part of many efforts to ensure that feedback from the public are addressed quickly and effectively. Under NWD, the agency that receives feedback on an issue not under its purview should identify the agency responsible and ensure that the agency will take up the case, before putting that agency in touch with the person who provided the feedback. If the issue has no clear owner, the agency that receives the feedback will apply FRP and identify an agency with some domain expertise. This latter agency, also known as the First Responder, will promptly resolve the inter-agency request, while the back-end policy and operational issues are being sorted out.",1,1358,2018-02-05-T-060-S-01358
2018-02-05-T-060,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"Public officers at the frontline are trained on these protocols. The Civil Service College conducts regular case simulation workshops for frontline teams, to familiarise officers with the procedures and standards. Many large agencies include these requirements as part of their service training programmes, and have also developed innovations to enhance seamlessness. For example, the CPF Board has an internal virtual assistant to help officers provide accurate answers to members' CPF queries and identify the right contacts to help them. Agencies are audited on a regular basis on their compliance with the procedures and service standards.",2,1359,2018-02-05-T-060-S-01359
2018-02-05-T-060,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The Municipal Services Office (MSO), established in 2014 to coordinate municipal issues that span across multiple agencies, is an example of how the Public Service has moved from ""No Wrong Door"" to ""Just One Door"". Its OneService app allows members of the public to provide feedback on all municipal issues without having to know which agency is in charge. This is made possible by a backend routing system that allows seamless case referral between agencies based on parameters such as land, issue and asset ownership.",3,1360,2018-02-05-T-060-S-01360
2018-02-05-T-060,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"MSO has also worked with partner agencies to establish First Responders in different domains. For example, MSO has brought PUB and the Town Councils together to determine who should serve as the First Responder in different types of water-related issues, so that residents no longer have to face multiple site inspections from both PUB and their Town Council. Other First Responders include LTA for the maintenance of connectivity-related infrastructure like park connectors, footpaths, and footbridges, NParks for public greenery maintenance, AVA for animal-related issues, and NEA for public cleanliness. There are also escalation mechanisms to ensure complex cases or cases with unclear ownership are escalated to the appropriate authorities for prompt action.

2018-02-05-T-085,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Land subsidence refers to the loss of surface elevation when soil gradually settles and compacts over time. Some degree of land subsidence happens in all countries, due to natural phenomena such as tectonic motion, as well as human action, such as building and construction. Singapore lies away from the margins of tectonic plates, and our ground predominantly consists of stable geological materials. Hence, we have not seen evidence of land subsidence in Singapore that would raise cause for concern.",1,1452,2018-02-05-T-085-S-01452
