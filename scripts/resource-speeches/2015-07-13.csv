2015-07-13-T-001,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Mdm Speaker, with your permission, I would like to take Question Nos 1 and 2 together.",1,3,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00003
2015-07-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,4,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00004
2015-07-13-T-001,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Mdm Speaker, the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) was formed two months ago. I have asked the Committee in its review to",1,5,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00005
2015-07-13-T-001,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,a) consider the population shifts and housing developments since the last boundary delineation exercise;,2,6,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00006
2015-07-13-T-001,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"b) have smaller Group Representation Constituencies, so as to reduce the average size of the Group Representation Constituencies below five; and",3,7,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00007
2015-07-13-T-001,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,c) have at least 12 Single Member Constituencies.,4,8,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00008
2015-07-13-T-001,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"As per past practice, the Committee is chaired by the Secretary to the Prime Minister. It is now in the midst of its deliberations and will make its recommendations to me when it is ready.",5,9,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00009
2015-07-13-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Prime Minister for the answer. I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether he is prepared to commit a minimum time period, say, at least six months from the publishing of the EBRC report to the calling of elections. I believe that it had been as short as one day from the report to the calling of elections in the past. A longer period would allow residents being moved out of their constituencies to be able to adjust to the changes.",1,10,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00010
2015-07-13-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question I have is on the composition of the EBRC for future Committees. Prior to Singapore's Independence, the members have comprised of people that are outside of the Government, including representatives from various political parties. So, I would like to check with the Prime Minister whether in subsequent EBRCs, we can change the composition of the EBRC to involve non-Government representatives or for it to be chaired by a High Court Judge, like in the case of the UK.",2,11,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00011
2015-07-13-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Finally, I would like to ask the Prime Minister  the completeness of the EBRC report seems to have been shrinking from the 1960s to the early 1970s. So, will the Prime Minister direct the Committee to provide better justifications for the changes because many of these changes do not seem to make sense to political observers and to the residents? Can the minutes of meetings of the EBRC be published so that they will be open for all to understand the decisions that have been made? Thank you.",3,12,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00012
2015-07-13-T-001,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Mdm Speaker, I think that the Committee will publish its report and to the maximum extent possible, we will make sure that there is enough time to elapse so that everybody can read the report, understand it and know where they stand before elections are called. But I do not think it is possible to say that we promise a certain minimum period, such as six months, because it depends very much on the exigencies of the situation and on when elections become necessary.",1,13,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00013
2015-07-13-T-001,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Secondly, on the composition of the EBRC, the EBRC has for many years comprised civil servants who have domain knowledge which enable them to make considered decisions on how to divide up the constituencies, taking into account, as I have said, population shifts, housing developments and also to do this in a practical sort of way so that you do not have a complete upheaval each time you have re-demarcation. If there is a need for outside expertise, I think that can be considered and they will have no hesitation to look for outside expertise. As for bringing political parties in, I am not sure that is an entirely good idea. The Americans do it with political parties, and the way it is done is that the sitting members – this is for the House of Representatives – decide on the demarcations. Usually, what happens is that they carve it up amongst themselves. It is a political deal. I think that is not a good arrangement. I think it is best we leave it to the civil servants to work at.",2,14,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00014
2015-07-13-T-001,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"As for the completeness of the report and of the minutes, I think I have to leave it to the Committee. I do not believe that it is helpful to have every twist and turn in the minutes reported and published. I think the Committee's report is the final word.",3,15,2015-07-13-T-001-S-00015
2015-07-13-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked	 the Minister for Manpower whether the Employment Pass (EP) and Jobs Bank schemes can be further tightened to ensure that employers are required to give due consideration to applications from qualified Singaporeans first and that EP applications must be accompanied by evidence that the hiring of foreigners is only after unsuccessful sourcing from local talent pool.,1,16,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00016
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Mdm Speaker, to ensure that companies give fair consideration to Singaporeans when hiring, the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) and Jobs Bank were introduced. So far, almost 20,000 employers have registered more than 72,000 active job postings with the Jobs Bank, drawing 110,000 local job seekers to register as well.",1,17,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00017
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"On the whole, it has led to a fairer hiring process and easier access to job opportunities. Notwithstanding this, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is making further enhancements to send a clearer and stronger signal about fair consideration for Singaporeans. As announced last week, we are making further refinements to take effect from 1 October 2015. This includes publishing the salary ranges of job vacancies, closer scrutiny of EP applications for companies with a weaker Singaporean Core relative to others in their industry, and more stringent quality assessment of EP and S Pass applicants.",2,18,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00018
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"For example, companies with weaker Singaporean Core will be required to provide additional information, such as the number of applications from Singaporeans, how many were shortlisted, and the interview outcomes. We may also require some of them – what I call the ""double weak"", weak Singaporean Core and weak commitment to fair consideration for Singaporeans – to commit to plans to strengthen their Singaporean Core.",3,19,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00019
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Working together in partnership with the industry, agencies and the Labour Movement, our four core priorities are (a) to strengthen our competitiveness and sustainability, (b) by becoming more manpower lean, (c) with a stronger Singaporean core, and (e) better quality foreign manpower. These are important priorities as we reposition our economy for future growth.",4,20,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00020
2015-07-13-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for the slew of enhanced measures announced last week to strengthen the Singaporean Core amongst PMEs, especially the Career Support scheme. Madam, I have two supplementary questions for the Minister.",1,21,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00021
2015-07-13-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"One, with the intention to scrutinise EP applications for whether or not Singaporeans were fairly considered, would the Minister please elaborate how the Ministry will ensure qualified Singaporeans are not passed over for jobs just because foreigners are willing to accept a lower salary and employers do not need to contribute to their CPF?",2,22,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00022
2015-07-13-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Two, in MOM's announcement, it mentioned an expectation for firms to systematically develop their Singaporean PMEs. So, that was a statement. That was great. Would the Minister please elaborate how MOM intends to achieve this and whether the Minister would consider a system where the approval of selected EPs are tied to a localisation plan, with clear commitments from the firms to invest in the training and development of Singaporeans to fill these jobs in the future? This scheme will be especially helpful in sectors currently dominated by foreigners.",3,23,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00023
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, I was at Geneva last month to attend the International Labour Organization Conference. The Director-General of the ILO Mr Guy Ryder hosted a dinner for the manpower representatives of the G20 countries. We are not a G20 country but I was invited because Singapore is an observing country for this year's G20 Meeting to be held in Turkey.",1,24,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00024
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The manpower representatives from these countries discussed the challenges faced in the areas of jobs and employment. My conclusion is that countries all over the world, including the G20 countries, the more developed countries, will all face three challenges. Firstly, jobs deficit – not enough jobs in many countries, leading to high unemployment, including youth unemployment. Secondly, skills deficit – not enough skills in the workforce, leading to structural unemployment; structural mismatch, again in many countries. Last but not least, quality deficit – jobs are being created but not of good enough quality; as a result, many PMEs are being under-employed. These are the three key challenges facing all countries, including Singapore.",2,25,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00025
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"I would say that if you look at today's situation, we are doing much better, compared to many other countries. We do not have a severe youth unemployment challenge. Unemployment rate among our PMEs is one of the lowest in the world, at about 2.6% to 2.7%. Under-employment, we have been able to create good paying jobs in sufficient number for our people. For example, if you come to our Jobs Bank, of the 72,000 vacancies I talked about, more than half of them are PMET jobs; in fact, about 50,000 of them. In other words, we do not really have the three deficits as faced by many of these countries.",3,26,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00026
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"As we move forward, as I had mentioned earlier, we do want to strengthen the Singaporean Core to ensure that all sectors of the economy can sustain growth into the future. Therefore, whatever measures that we introduce, we must bear in mind, firstly, it must not weaken our competitiveness so that we can continue to create enough good paying jobs; secondly, continue to strengthen the capability, the skill profile of our local workforce so that we do not have the structural unemployment challenge.",4,27,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00027
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In other words, as we move forward, we are identifying, in particular, two target groups. The first would be companies with a weak Singaporean Core relative to the rest of the industry. As I had mentioned earlier, for this type of companies, I have no choice but to make the employment of EP holders for these companies more difficult. Because if they have a weak Singaporean Core relative to the rest of industry, and at the same time, they do not demonstrate stronger commitment towards fairer consideration, I would have no choice but to make the process more difficult until they are prepared to work together with us to find ways to strengthen the Singaporean Core.",5,28,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00028
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"There is another consideration. We noticed that in some sectors, the overall Singaporean Core is relatively weaker than in other sectors. For those sectors, MOM will work very closely with the relevant economic agencies to understand better why is it that for these sectors, the Singaporean Core, on the whole, is relatively weaker than the other sectors. We will work with the economic agencies to see what more can we do under the SkillsFuture initiative led by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman to enhance the skills upgrading of the manpower, sector by sector. Hopefully, over time, while with one hand we strengthen the supply of local Singaporean Core through SkillsFuture, at the same time, through the Fair Consideration Framework to strengthen the demand for a Singaporean Core. We believe this is the best way forward.",6,29,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00029
2015-07-13-T-002,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Madam, I wish to ask the Minister to clarify how successful has the Fair Consideration Framework been in having Singaporeans considered fairly for PME jobs since its implementation a year ago.",1,30,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00030
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, the requirement to advertise jobs with the Jobs Bank was introduced in August last year. So, it has been implemented for almost a year. The MOM has looked at the overall picture. We are happy to say that, by and large, most employers do show enough commitment, in terms of giving Singaporean job applicants fair consideration.",1,31,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00031
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"However, we have noticed that there is a small group of employers, as I had mentioned earlier, whose current Singaporean Core is not as strong, relative to the rest of the industry. Of greater concern to us is that they do not seem to demonstrate enough commitment to fair consideration. For example, some of them, the moment they fulfil the 14 days' commitment, within a week, they will come to MOM to submit their EP applications. So, these are the cases which we wonder whether they have really gone through the proper process because we do not believe that they can clear the queue of applications and interviews all within a few days.",2,32,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00032
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Another very common feedback that we receive is that many of the Singaporean PMEs have this feeling that some organisations, because the HR directors are foreigners, as a result, they are giving preferential consideration to foreign PMEs especially those coming from the same countries. MOM takes this seriously. In fact, this is an area I am looking into as well, trying to identify companies where the Directors of HR are foreigners and, at the same time, there is a high concentration of EPs from the same country sources. I am not accusing them of being biased, but I would just like to convince myself whether this concern by many PMEs is founded or unfounded. If they are founded, then obviously, as I had mentioned earlier, this will be companies that we would like to work with closely to ensure that they exercise fairer and more progressive HR policies and practices.",3,33,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00033
2015-07-13-T-002,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Madam, a clarification. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Singaporean Core in a company will now be a factor in considering applications for Employment Passes.",1,34,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00034
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, the answer is yes. As I had mentioned earlier, we are now targeting companies with this ""double weak""  weak in Singaporean Core relative to industry and, at the same time, do not demonstrate a strong enough commitment to give Singaporean workers fair consideration.",1,35,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00035
2015-07-13-T-002,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Thank you, Madam.  Madam, I welcome this new initiative by MOM to consider the Singaporean Core in the company. I would like to ask how MOM determines whether a company has a weak or strong Singaporean Core and how does the new factor or framework of Singaporean Core in a company work into the application for Employment Pass and in consideration of approval by MOM.",1,36,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00036
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, as I had mentioned earlier, the strength or weakness of a Singaporean Core in a particular company, on the part of MOM, we will look at it within the context of the industry. For example, if in the industry, the Singaporean Core is ""x"" percent, but for companies where the Singaporean Core is a lot lower than ""x"" percent, those will be the ones that we perceive as having a weak Singaporean Core.",1,37,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00037
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Secondly, as I had mentioned earlier, before they can apply for an EP under the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), the company will have to advertise the job and, now, including the salary as well, in our Jobs Bank. After the 14 days, Singaporean job applicants who are interested in those jobs would have applied for the jobs. What we are doing, moving forward, is that for companies with a weak Singaporean Core, we will be asking them questions like, for example, ""How many job applications did you receive?"" For example, if they do not receive enough job applicants, it could mean that either the jobs are not attractive or maybe there is a shortage of skills in Singapore. That is where, under the Sectoral Manpower Development Plan, we will find ways to strengthen the Singaporean Core. So, that is the answer.",2,38,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00038
2015-07-13-T-002,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Madam. I would like to ask the Minister on the point that he made about being able now to identify situations where there is this ""double weak"". The Minister mentioned earlier that for companies with a weak Singaporean Core, MOM will monitor them and then they may be required to impose tighter EP hiring restrictions. I agree that that sounds like a very good system.",1,39,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00039
2015-07-13-T-002,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"What it sounds like to me is that MOM is beginning to exploit the potential for using the Jobs Bank as an early warning kind of monitoring system so that you can see areas where there may be issues with hiring in future. One of the key challenges the Minister mentioned earlier was skills deficit. Would it be possible, do you foresee using this system to identify where a skills deficit may develop in time, even though there is not a skills deficit currently at this point in time?",2,40,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00040
2015-07-13-T-002,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Secondly, if you are able to accurately develop a system so that it can capture this kind of information for your own use, would you be expecting companies to find this information helpful in the future?",3,41,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00041
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, the answer is yes. In fact, we believe that by a closer analysis of the Jobs Bank as well as the response rate, we would be able to identify any early signs of a skills deficit. When those are identified, firstly, we will share the information with the sector. We do have more than 20 Sectoral Tripartite Committees set up to look into the manpower development plan, sector by sector. So, those information will be shared with the tripartite partners.",1,42,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00042
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"At the same time, MOM will also be looking into how we can support those companies that are able to help us to transfer the know-how, the capabilities, to our workforce over the near term. For example, if we have identified that certain areas of skills are in significant deficit, and if we feel those sources of expertise are available out there somewhere in the world, we would like to work with companies to bring those expertise to Singapore and put in place a know-how transfer programme so that, over time, this skills deficit can be narrowed.",2,43,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00043
2015-07-13-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Mdm Speaker, I applaud the measures that the Minister has introduced. I am equally sure that there several companies or corporations which have developed a strong Singaporean Core. So, I wonder whether the Minister could also find ways to recognise and publicise them, and also get them to share the stories of how a strong Singaporean-core has helped them in their business. I am looking more at the more positive parts as well. I think this will be useful.",1,44,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00044
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for this suggestion. In fact, what MOM intends to do is to, on the one hand, take firmer action against the ""double weak"" employers and, at the same time, exactly as mentioned by the Member, to profile companies that are adopting the more progressive, not just fair, but progressive employment practices. We do intend to conduct a series of what we call ""Learning Journeys"", so that the agencies, companies from the same industry, can learn from the progressive practices of the good employers, so to speak.",1,45,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00045

2015-07-13-T-002,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Madam, I am very supportive of the Singaporean Core initiative. But on the other hand, I would just like to understand better if all these efforts of getting the EP are making the employers' job more onerous and more difficult, and whether there is a change in image about Singapore being a friendly country for investments, and also, in the long term, whether it will have an impact on us being a more competitive economy, compared to the regional countries which are also developing.",1,47,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00047
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for pointing this out. It is a very important point. Let me emphasise again, I mentioned earlier about making the application for EP more difficult, but it is only for the ""double weak"" employers. Based on MOM's observations, the vast majority of the employers are progressive and they do give fair consideration to Singaporeans. Therefore, only a small group of employers will be affected. We are also engaging them in a positive way. So far, in the last 10 months or so, we have identified about 150 employers belonging to this category of either ""single weak"" or ""double weak"", and we are working very closely with them, in some cases, through the relevant economic agencies and, in others, between MOM and these companies.",1,48,2015-07-13-T-002-S-00048
2015-07-13-T-002,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"I fully agree that it is important that we continue to maintain the competitiveness and attractiveness of Singapore because, otherwise, we are going to have a jobs deficit challenge.

This is due to seasonal declines and sharper moderation in employment growth in the manufacturing and construction sectors, as well as parts of the services sector  retail, real estate services, accommodation and food services.",1,56,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00056
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"The moderation in employment growth needs to be seen in the context of our labour market and the repositioning of our economy. First, we have seen a sustained increase in our employment rate, to a high of 79.7% last year. In fact, at 79.7%, we are now among the highest, together with Japan. Our unemployment rate has remained low in the last few year, and, in fact, continues to be among the lowest in the world. Local workforce growth, going forward, will be slower, given that we have one of the highest employment rates and lowest unemployment rate in the world.",2,57,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00057
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Secondly, job vacancies remain high and outnumber jobseekers. The seasonally adjusted ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons remains stable at 143 openings per 100 jobseekers in March this year, compared to 142 in December 2014. In other words, we have more job vacancies than the number of people looking for jobs.",3,58,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00058
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Thirdly, to sustain growth, we are moving forward towards a more manpower-lean economy. We will continue to encourage businesses to reduce their reliance on labour, especially low-skilled foreign workers. We will also focus more on upgrading the skills of our local manpower, and improving productivity and increasing the pace of innovation as the source of future growth and competitiveness.",4,59,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00059
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),Employment data for the second quarter of 2015 is not yet available. We are monitoring the employment trends closely in the coming quarters.,5,60,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00060
2015-07-13-T-004,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, I thank the Minister for the answers. I have three supplementary questions. Firstly, the Minister mentioned that this is due to seasonal drops in job creation. But this is a 99% drop from the same period a year ago. So, how does the Minister explain this drastic drop, assuming that it is the same season a year ago? Secondly, does the situation of high vacancies, coupled with low unemployment and low job creation, indicate that many companies are not restructuring fast enough to become less labour-intensive and more productive, or what other explanations could account for this situation? Thirdly, is most of the employment creation occurring in the tradable or the non-tradable sectors? What are the proportions of job vacancies in the tradable and the non-tradable sectors?",1,61,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00061
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Madam, the first point I want to emphasise is that there is a saying that a point is a point, two points make a line, three points make a trend. Therefore, I would not draw any conclusion just based on one point. At the same time, I would emphasise that even though with a decline of 6,100 jobs in the first quarter of 2015, compared to a year ago, there are still many more jobs available in the first quarter of 2015, compared to a year ago, in the first quarter of 2014. In fact, the increase over this year-on-year was about 2.7%, almost 90,000 jobs. Therefore, jobs deficit is not the issue facing us today. The job market is still growing on the year-to-year basis.",1,62,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00062
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Secondly, the Member asked whether this is a sign that the industry is not restructuring fast enough. There is a contradiction. On the one hand, we are concerned that the job growth has slowed down and yet at the same time, we are concerned that the restructuring is not fast enough. In fact, with a faster pace of restructuring, we can expect job growth to slow even further.",2,63,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00063
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Therefore, I would not adopt just one point and draw any conclusion. But over the next quarter, and over a few quarters, we will be monitoring very closely the job growth trend. From there, I would be able to draw a better conclusion regarding the pace of restructuring. But I am happy to say that having tightened the foreign manpower growth and at the same time with the high employment rate and low unemployment rate, I must say that on the ground, we have seen more sectors, more companies embarking on this journey of restructuring.",3,64,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00064
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Thirdly, the question about whether these are tradable or non-tradable sectors, I would say that it cuts across all sectors. We do notice that for the manufacturing sector, which is a mainly export-oriented sector, the pace of restructuring is a lot faster. As a result, the manufacturing sector has become a lot more manpower lean, compared to the services sector. But for the service sector, both the tradable and non-tradable sectors, are taking in more manpower on the whole, not on quarterly basis; but if you look at it, over the past one year.",4,65,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00065
2015-07-13-T-004,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Madam. I want to thank the Minister for those clarifications. I think one of the reasons why there has been so much interest surrounding those figures – a sudden drop in employment – is that it had been so sharp. One of the concerns with interested observers is whether this is a sign that we may have overdone the manpower tightening. Can I ask Minister whether he thinks that there will be enough warning signs if the overtightening has been overdone?",1,66,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00066
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, as I have mentioned, I will not jump to any particular conclusion just based on one quarter's outcome. We must look at it over a period of a few quarters. The job growth in Singapore indeed was strong. As I had said, compare the first quarter 2015, compared to a year ago, there are now another 90,000 jobs available. Our manpower growth was 2.7%.",1,67,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00067
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Now, is a 2.7% growth over one year overdone? I do not think so. I still remember that, in fact, as we tightened the foreign manpower quota, there was a call in this House that we should go for a complete stop in terms of the importation of work permit holders. I think that would be overdone. But what we have done was to slow down the growth but yet at the same time, manage the process of transition, in a way that, hopefully, will enable more and more companies, especially the SMEs, to adapt and to grow. It is not to our interest to see a sudden drop and to see a sudden decline in our economic activity in Singapore.",2,68,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00068
2015-07-13-T-004,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Thank you, Madam. I have just two more supplementary questions. I agree with the Minister's point that one point should not be used to measure a trend. So, in line with what I asked in my question, what would be the job growth figures in quarter two of 2015? Are those numbers available yet?",1,69,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00069
2015-07-13-T-004,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Secondly, regarding the tradable and non-tradable sectors, if I understand the Minister right, he was saying that the productivity growth has been more successful in the manufacturing and other export sectors. Can I conclude that vacancies are growing more in the non-tradable sectors? And if so, if there is a high number of vacancies in the non-tradable sector, how would the shortage of foreign labour damage the economy because of the shortage and the vacancies in the non-tradable sector? Because for the non-tradable sector, the demand is domestic, the demand is not going anywhere. So, for non-productive companies in the non-tradable sectors, they will be forced to restructure or they would be replaced by others who can meet that demand. So, in some ways, the disruption for the non-tradable sector, due to foreign labour shortfalls, would be self- correcting, would it not be?",2,70,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00070
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, the flash estimate for employment in the second quarter of 2015 will come out by the end of this month. Right now, I do not have any information to share.",1,71,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00071
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Secondly, in terms of vacancies, I think the Member is correct, that the non-tradable sectors are the ones facing greater constraints with manpower. For example, many of our F&B, many of our SMEs are involved in non-tradable sector. For these sectors, I have been in close contact with them, because to go back to the old growth formula of heavy dependency on more work permit holders is not a solution. At the end of the day, we do need to find ways to sustain our economic growth, our workforce growth in a more sustainable manner.",2,72,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00072
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"MOM is working with them to help them to look at where they are today, and where they think they ought to be three years from now. In other words, as we go through this economic repositioning, it should apply to all sectors, whether they are tradable or non-tradable. I am happy to say that a number of these non-tradable sectors have responded positively. Some of them have given us a proposal to say this is where we are today and this is where I want to be three years from now; and in between from here to there, what kind of support would be needed, whether it is the various financial grants and so on. MOM is working very closely with SPRING and the relevant agencies to look for ways to help them to go through this transition.",3,73,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00073
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"So, in other words, to go back to the past is not a solution because it just pushes back in our push for repositioning. Looking forward, certainly, we are going to continue to be creative, continue to find win-win outcomes for the agencies, for the companies and for the unions as well.",4,74,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00074
2015-07-13-T-004,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mdm Speaker, there have been some proposals made by some quarters to freeze foreign manpower growth. So, I would like to ask the Minister what would had been the impact on companies and the economy if such proposals to freeze manpower growth had been implemented?",1,75,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00075
2015-07-13-T-004,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, I would not be able to give a quantitative response. But in the course of my interaction with many companies, especially SMEs, I would say that even though we have continued to allow the work permit holders to continue to grow at a slower pace, I think already, many of them are facing a lot of constraints. Therefore, on reflection, we did the right thing. We did the right thing by not freezing, not suddenly freezing the importation of Work Permit holders.",1,76,2015-07-13-T-004-S-00076
2015-07-13-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,asked	 the Minister for Health whether the public using cards issued under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) and Pioneer Generation programme could be kept informed of the subsidy that they have enjoyed and the balance of subsidies for the year as a means to check against any fraudulent claims.,1,77,2015-07-13-T-005-S-00077

2015-07-13-T-005,Lam Pin Min,The Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Each of us – MOM, CHAS clinics as well as the patients – has a role to play to ensure accountability and prevent fraudulent claims. MOH encourages patients to check with their clinics on any queries they may have on the treatment and charges and to request for itemised receipts, so that they are more informed. MOH also closely monitors the CHAS subsidy claims submitted by clinics and takes feedback on potential cases of abuse seriously. We will continue to improve the access to relevant information and strengthen our audit system.",2,79,2015-07-13-T-005-S-00079
2015-07-13-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"I would like to ask the Minister of State, given the profile of the CHAS members and PG members, checking the website or even calling the hotline may not be something that is very accessible or something that they are used to. Is it possible, to minimise wastage or a lot of admin work, for the Ministry to provide yearly updates, consolidated accounts of the subsidy the members have enjoyed and the treatments that have been taken, so that they are kept abreast of what subsidy they have?",1,80,2015-07-13-T-005-S-00080
2015-07-13-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"And in the other scenario where there are general practitioners (GPs) who put in bogus additional treatments on top of a genuine consultation, for example, there needs to be a better way to check against this and prevent abuse of the two schemes.",2,81,2015-07-13-T-005-S-00081
2015-07-13-T-005,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Baey Yam Keng for his suggestion. MOH is aware that there is a growing suggestion and request for other modalities to check the balances. In our review, we will take into considerations some of these suggestions that have been given to us and we will try our best to make it seamless and easy, especially for the elderly.",1,82,2015-07-13-T-005-S-00082
2015-07-13-T-005,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),I would just like to ask the Minister of State  there has been a suggestion that perhaps because of a good guideline to CHAS participant clinics to add in the remaining balance on the CHAS accounts as part of the itemised bills. I note that some clinics do give some information to the patients but this is not across the board. And I was wondering whether MOH could consider giving some sort of advisory to this effect.,1,83,2015-07-13-T-005-S-00083
2015-07-13-T-005,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Dr Chia Shi-Lu for that suggestion as well. There are other measures being explored to enhance the pricing transparency to patients and accountability of the clinics for their charges. While it is currently not mandatory for clinics to issue itemised receipts, MOH is looking at these suggestions to make this mandatory for all licensed clinics as part of our review of the Private Hospitals & Medical Clinics (PHMC) Act and Regulations.",1,84,2015-07-13-T-005-S-00084
2015-07-13-T-006,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan,asked	 the Minister for Health whether there are plans for a nationwide emergency preparedness exercise to strengthen Singapore's capacity to manage the disruption that MERS will pose should the contagion reach our shores.,1,85,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00085
2015-07-13-T-006,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked	 the Minister for Health whether adequate measures have been taken by the health authorities to ensure that all visitors from countries affected by MERS are properly screened before they are allowed entry into Singapore.,1,86,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00086

2015-07-13-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been closely monitoring the global situation of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) since the disease emerged in 2012. WHO's current assessment is that the transmission of the disease is mainly among households and hospital contacts, and there is no evidence of sustained community transmission. Nevertheless, we must remain vigilant to the possibility and the impact of an imported case from the Middle East, South Korea or elsewhere.",1,89,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00089
2015-07-13-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"There has been very close inter-Ministry coordination and planning to prepare for such an incident. An Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), co-chaired by Minister Chan Chun Sing and myself, has been formed since late last year to oversee whole-of-Government preparedness against dangerous infectious diseases, including MERS and Ebola.",2,90,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00090
2015-07-13-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We have taken a multi-pronged approach and have put in place various measures to detect imported MERS-CoV cases and contain any further transmission in Singapore.

2015-07-13-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Let me elaborate on some of the measures. As part of public education efforts, MOH has a dedicated webpage on MERS-CoV and has published a set of FAQs to help Singaporeans understand the disease and advise them on the precautionary measures they can take to protect themselves.",4,92,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00092
2015-07-13-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"At our borders, MOH has been issuing health advisories to travellers going to countries with active transmission of MERS-CoV including the Middle East and South Korea. In addition, travellers arriving from MERS-affected countries are given individual health advisories on the symptoms of the illness they should look out for and they are advised to seek immediate medical treatment if they have such symptoms. They are also reminded to inform the healthcare professionals of their travel history, so that proper infection control measures can be taken while they are being tested for MERS-CoV.",5,93,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00093
2015-07-13-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Temperature screening at the air checkpoints has been implemented to screen direct flights from the Middle East and South Korea. However, as MERS-CoV has an incubation period of up to 14 days, infected travellers may not have any fever when they pass through temperature screening and, therefore, they may not be picked up or detected at entry. Hence, our doctors and hospitals have been reminded to remain vigilant to the threat of MERS-CoV among travellers from the affected areas. Persons with symptoms of severe respiratory illness upon return from the Middle East or South Korea, and those with any respiratory symptoms and had visited a healthcare facility in South Korea or the Middle East, will be subjected to further investigations to rule out the possibility of MERS-CoV infection. They will be isolated until this investigation is completed. This year, up to 10 July 2015, a total of 62 such suspected cases have been investigated locally and all have tested negative for MERS-CoV.",6,94,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00094
2015-07-13-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"However, it is a matter of time that the contagion will reach our shores. Therefore, beyond the preventive measures that I mentioned, Government agencies have contingency response plans in place should there be an imported case. Confirmed cases will be treated in isolation rooms and our healthcare workers taking care of them will wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and they have been trained to minimise the risk of contagion. In parallel, MOH will conduct contact tracing and quarantine all close contacts, to prevent further spread. We will update and exercise our response plans regularly. Recently, we conducted such an exercise at the Changi Airport and the simulated patient was conveyed in a portable medical isolation unit (PMIU) to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. We will continue to carry out similar exercises from time to time involving not only MOH but also other agencies as well.",7,95,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00095

What has happened to South Korea has been very difficult and very tragic. It is not possible to ignore the fact that South Korea, together with Singapore, is affected by SARS about a decade ago, so you cannot ignore the concerns. Just looking at South Korea's experience, it appeared to have been too laggard in its response. There was some initial confusion. That is what appeared to have led to an explosion of cases, which has led to a significant number of fatalities. Subsequently, as we see now, it appears to have imposed quite good control over the situation and the spread is now constrained.",1,98,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00098
2015-07-13-T-006,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"The reason why I ask about an emergency preparedness exercise is because the danger is that, regardless of how many systems we have, the population may not recall how difficult it is and how confusing it may be, when the initial signs first appear.

Therefore, we regularly remind members of the public and Singaporeans that MERS-CoV and Ebola, are real threats and we must take these threats seriously. We have also been sharing information as much as we possibly could with our Singaporeans as well as visitors who are coming to Singapore. That is why at the Airport, you would also see posters that are put up, for passengers who do not come from affected areas. We also want to remind them that should they have any difficulties, do consult our medical professionals. It is an area that we will continue to look at and we will consider various forms of exercises.",1,100,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00100

Before that, you may find that the threat of infectious diseases may come and go, and it happens from time to time.",2,101,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00101
2015-07-13-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Going forward, I am afraid that it is going to be quite a constant feature because of the increased international connectivity. We are going to see that different forms of infectious diseases will threaten Singapore from time to time. An example is that MERS-CoV emerged in 2012. Before MERS was over, Ebola emerged. And now both Ebola and MERS are threats to Singapore. Bird flu, on the other hand, is also not totally eliminated either.",3,102,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00102

It is a matter of practice that all our doctors, when they see respiratory symptoms displayed among their patients, will ask about their travel history. It is something that we have always been reminding our doctors.

They might have stayed a few days in other countries and, therefore, while it is important to have border screening, it is not the only measure that we should rely on. What is more important is to ensure that our healthcare facilities are on high alert, they are vigilant, they are aware of this threat, and they are looking out for these symptoms and the travel history of their patients.",3,109,2015-07-13-T-006-S-00109

2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, most of our new flats are sold under the Build-To-Order (BTO) programme where HDB directly influences design, construction and pricing. BTO flats are sold directly by HDB to flat buyers and HDB is fully responsible for the timely delivery and quality of the flats sold.",1,116,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00116
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Despite a significant ramp up in our BTO programme over the last four years, the quality of BTO flats has not been compromised. On average, about a third of all new residents approach the Building Service Centre (BSC) for assistance after collecting their keys. Some of these requests for assistance – about a quarter of them – relate to issues, such as low water pressure due to the implementation of water saving measures, as well as paint stains that need to be cleaned up in their units. Other requests, about 75%, relate to defects that residents come across. The vast majority of the reported defects are surface imperfections, such as hairline cracks on walls, scratches on timber floor or uneven tile joints.",2,117,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00117
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The number of defects reported has not changed significantly over the years. Such imperfections are mostly within acceptable industry norms and are also common in private developments.

It is assessed independently by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and is known as Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) score. Over the years, the quality of BTO flats has improved from a score of 79 in 2003 to 89 in 2014. It continues to rise and is comparable to that in private developments.",4,119,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00119
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB takes the quality of its homes seriously, not just because it is a major long-term investment of Singaporeans but, more importantly, because these are people's homes and, therefore, people's expectations are rising. HDB has a system of checks in place to ensure that its flats are free of major defects. However, due to the high dependency on workmanship of individual workers, we can expect that there will be some defects. Sometimes, this could be due to differences in the understanding of what constitutes a defect. For example, some owners have given feedback on colour inconsistencies for floor with timber finishes. As timber is a natural product, it is not possible to achieve a completely homogenous look.",5,120,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00120

HDB sets the buyer's eligibility requirements and provides broad planning parameters such as the mix of flat types, flat sizes and the range of social and community facilities to be provided. Within this framework, the private developer of the DBSS project is responsible for the design, pricing and construction quality of the flat. Prospective buyers, in turn, decide if the price set by the developer is acceptable for the design and furnishings provided.",8,123,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00123

Nonetheless, residents who face issues with the quality of the flats should report them to BSC managed by the developer during the DLP. If the developer fails to address them, the buyers will have legal recourse against the developer as provided for under the S&P Agreement. Although HDB is not a party to this agreement, HDB plays an active role in ensuring a fair and satisfactory outcome. When DBSS flat buyers raise concerns or feedback about DBSS units, HDB will approach and ask the developer to take the appropriate action under the circumstances.",11,126,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00126
2015-07-13-T-007,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Madam, I would like to thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have three supplementary questions. With the sizeable complaints of recent DBSS projects arising from an apparent mismatch of expectations, poor workmanship and accountability, can I ask the Minister of State on the roles which should be played in overseeing the DBSS scheme from design and construction to handing over of keys? What more can be done to ensure greater accountability of developers?",1,127,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00127
2015-07-13-T-007,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"With prices between private and HDB units, and the price gap between BTO and DBSS flats narrowing, what is the Ministry's direction on such premium HDB flats moving forward?",2,128,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00128

2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, the Member asked three questions  first, on the role of HDB in DBSS. As I said earlier, HDB sets the broad parameters, such as eligibility, provides grants, decides on size and community services, and then with that, allows the private developer to build, finance, construct and sell. Nonetheless, as I said earlier, HDB will refer complaints to the developer and will work with the developer to ensure that residents' concerns are addressed. HDB upstream does actively engage DBSS developers by sharing HDB's experiences and lessons learned from previous DBSS projects and provides feedback in the areas of safety, security, durability and ease of maintenance. For example, during the early upstream stage in design, HDB will arrange for a meeting with the developer to share with them and their consultants HDB's experience on the above issues, like safety, durability, security and ease of maintenance and civil and structural design considerations, including lessons learned from DBSS' projects upstream and further measures.",1,130,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00130
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for DBSS as a scheme, MND has suspended DBSS scheme in 2011, as Members would know, and there is no plan to launch new DBSS projects in the immediate future. As the scheme is already suspended, we need not rush into deciding whether to abolish the scheme or not. We should take time to consider and review this as market conditions could be different and there may well be reasons to bring back the DBSS scheme in some form.",2,131,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00131
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member also asked about the width of some corridors in recent DBSS projects that had been completed. That developer has chosen to restrict the width of the corridor to the safety limits as required by BCA and SCDF. Residents are concerned about this. It means that they may not be able to put anything outside the corridor. Everything has to be in the home or stored downstairs, for instance, bicycles. HDB is working with the advisers concerned and approaching the developer, along with the residents, to see how these concerns can be addressed.",3,132,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00132
2015-07-13-T-007,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I have four supplementary questions for the Minister of State. First, I am not sure if the Minister of State had answered my question about the rate of complaints on the DBSS scheme for the flats that were completed over the last two years. I want to know also whether the complaints have been rising and, given the wide public backlash over many of the DBSS flats that came up recently, would the Minister of State say how DBSS has fulfilled its intent. And, I quote, the intent is ""to meet the housing aspirations of higher income flat buyers for better design and finishes"". So, do all these complaints signify that the DBSS has actually failed in its intent?",1,133,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00133
2015-07-13-T-007,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Nominated Member),"Second, I want to know what is the comparison of the number of complaints for BTO versus DBSS flats, in terms of, say, per 100 or 1,000 flats that are completed.",2,134,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00134
2015-07-13-T-007,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Nominated Member),"Third supplementary question is this  the 2007 and 2013 BCA Accessibility Code has guidelines for doors, especially manoeuvring spaces at doors. For the term ""doors"", I am not sure if it also includes gates, because one of the complaints, for example, at Pasir Ris ONE is that the gates at the opposite ends can almost touch one another when they are all opened.",3,135,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00135
2015-07-13-T-007,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr Yee, can you please keep your supplementary question short?",1,136,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00136
2015-07-13-T-007,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"So, can the Minister of State confirm whether the gates are considered as doors and whether they meet the BCA Code? Finally, the residents that I have communicated with in this DBSS, have complained that when they took up the design issues with the developers, they were told, and I quote, ""Everything approved by HDB"". I would like to understand what HDB does or does not approve. So, what are the areas that are approved by HDB?",1,137,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00137
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, let me try to deal with the questions, in turn. As for the rate, the data that the Member has asked, I do not have these figures. In any event, when we talk about the rate of defect and DBSS units, between DBSS projects, they differ significantly, because they are not standardised models. They differ in terms of their attributes; finish and the fittings that are available. So, that is not a meaningful comparison.",1,138,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00138
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The second question – and this is more critical – is about whether, as the Member says, the scheme has failed in its intent. I am not quite sure what the Member means by ""failed"". Does it mean that it is not taken up by residents? Does it mean that all residents reject what they see after they moved into their units? It is important to also recognise in that respect that there have been 13 DBSS projects since 2005, and many, many residents have moved into these units and purchased them. They have seen it, they liked it, they moved in, and certainly like all developments, both HDB, BTO, private, as well as office and commercial, there will be defects, there will be concerns. This is not to trivialise the defects and the concerns that first-time home buyers in particular feel when they see scratches or paint marks on their units, or more serious defects. But I think we should not, as Minister Lim talked about in the context of another Parliamentary Question (PQ) on MOM, use these current few points that have been in the public eye, to condemn the entire scheme as a failure. Many people have, indeed, lived and made homes with their families in these projects.",2,139,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00139
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for whether my view is that a gate is a door as specified under the 2007 and 2013 BCA accessibility guidelines, also a technicality of the nature of this query, please allow me to go back and have a check; perhaps the Member can communicate his concerns with me. But if it is in relation to the Pasir Ris ONE project, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Member for Parliament of the constituency has visited the site. Residents have taken this issue up with him, the developer and HDB. Let us allow these negotiations to take place.",3,140,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00140
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for the claim that he heard that the DBSS developer had given approval for something or other, I think it is a bit too ambiguous as to what this is about. I think if there is some specificity about what he says has been approved by HDB, allow us to check with the background that he can provide us. As I said earlier, HDB provides a broad parameter on eligibility and so on, and within that, the private developer has a broad flexibility to design, build, finance and to sell.",4,141,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00141
2015-07-13-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for answering the Parliamentary Question that I submitted. I have one point to add. While the number of defects may probably be the same as the Minister of State had highlighted earlier, in some countries, as my residents highlighted to me, their practice is the monies to be paid to the developers or one main contractor are held back until all defects are cleared.",1,142,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00142
2015-07-13-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"At the same time, for the homeowners, they also do joint inspections with the developer. So, in that sense, there is some incentive for the developer or the main contractor to close off the defects as soon as possible. This is what I noticed for two BTOs in my estate – one was three years ago and one is now. The number of defects, as compared to your studies, is probably the same, but I think the reactions to the latest one are much more severe, largely because I think the developers tend to push back some of these defect complaints or they delay the repairs and so forth, and this frustrates many homeowners.",2,143,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00143
2015-07-13-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The second question is, when you have cases where developers or contractors delay repairs or they are not able to work on them on time, would HDB consider extending the DLP or postponing the start of the payment scheme for homeowners? Basically, they start paying their mortgages later, and once repairs are completed, they can move in. When they see delays, they are frustrated, as it affects the time they get to move in, because these repairs are not done on time.",3,144,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00144
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Perhaps, Mdm Speaker, may I just ask the Member to clarify. Is he asking in the context of BTO or DBSS?",1,145,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00145
2015-07-13-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Yes, BTO. Just for clarification, both estates I spoke about are BTOs.",1,146,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00146
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Thank you. Madam, the Member has also spoken about an idea that was provided to him by residents about some schemes overseas.",1,147,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00147
2015-07-13-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Yes, it is in Australia. When you take over a home, you do joint inspections and the money is held in escrow until the defects are all completed before the money is released to the developer or contractor.",1,148,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00148
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In the context of delays and concerns that residents get affected when repairs and rectifications are delayed, under the Sales and Purchase Agreement for BTOs, and I believe it is also the case for DBSS, these have to be reported and resolved within the one-year defect liability period. But, specifically, I believe under the S&P Agreement, there is a requirement for the developer to address the issue and rectify within a month, and if he needs more time for whatever reason, like gathering of materials, doing more checks, then that needs to be agreed with or informed to the buyer. If the developer or the contractor, in that case, does not resolve this within one month, then the buyer can give adequate notice to the contractor or developer to rectify, and then make a claim or reimbursement.",1,149,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00149
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, in a way, we should not have delays in rectification. Sometimes, it is because the rectification is not up to the expectation of the resident, or there may be problems along the way that need to be resolved; so, there may be some time that is needed. But, by and large, our understanding is that most rectifications, particularly hairline cracks, stains, scratches, ought to be resolved and should be resolved by the contractors expeditiously, so as not to cause inconvenience to residents.",2,150,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00150

2015-07-13-T-007,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Thank you, Madam. I would like to ask the Minister of State questions in three areas. First, he talked about the briefing sessions that HDB holds for DBSS developers about experience from past DBSS projects. May I ask, is there advisory given based on years of public housing experience that HDB has in terms of good design, so that the DBSS developers can refer to at the planning stage? Does HDB endorse, or is HDB even informed or briefed on the design before the project launch by the developer? So, this is question one.",1,152,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00152
2015-07-13-T-007,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"The second question is about the statistics about the reported defects. The Minister of State has shared about BTO projects. Are there similar statistics about the defects received by the DBSS BSCs over these 13 projects? And is that a trend that reflects flat quality or is it just a matter of changing buyer expectations? Is there a CONQUAS score for DBSS projects as well, on top of what the Minister of State shared for BTO projects?",2,153,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00153
2015-07-13-T-007,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"My last question is about HDB's role. If buyers have questions whether the DBSS developers have met the standards set by the various authorities, can HDB help to check and advise the buyers accordingly, or do we expect the buyers to pursue the matter at their own time, own effort and own cost?",3,154,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00154
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, the first question, I think the answer should be yes as to whether or not HDB shares its experience, built on many years of public housing with these DBSS developers. It will share its experience not in relation to past DBSS' projects, but also its experience on maintenance and the like.",1,155,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00155
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The second question is on CONQUAS scores, whether that is also for DBSS, happily the answer is yes. I do not have the scores available.",2,156,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00156
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The third as to whether it is comparable, as I had said earlier, it is very difficult in the first place to compare one DBSS project with another, because one project may have different configuration, different size. It may have different finishings, and certainly, different range, type and number of fittings. So, it will be very hard for there to be comparisons. And, more importantly, the comparison with BTO is hard to draw. As I had said earlier, for BTO projects, in the last four years, about a third of the new residents moving in have approached the BSCs so we have the data for the average number of people approaching to raise concerns. And some of it, 25%, relate to questions like ""There are stain marks, can you clear it up? Water pressure is low, why is it so?"" So, the answer will be, it is a water-saving measure that has to be implemented. Seventy-five percent relate to defects that are perceived by these residents, because they move in, and when they look and see these scratches or these paint marks that are on the wall, the surface imperfections, and they then raised it to the BSCs.",3,157,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00157
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,These kinds of surface imperfections and defects constitute the vast majority of the feedback given by the residents. And this can and should be resolved quickly by the contractors. I hope that addresses the questions raised.,4,158,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00158
2015-07-13-T-007,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit,"I agree with the Minister of State that we do have cases of surface imperfections. But increasingly, I am getting cases of real defects where there are wall cracks that come with water seepages, doors unable to be closed properly or unable to fit nicely, or tiles which are easily stained but not easily cleaned. So, these cause a lot of frustration to residents and they have to take leave to resolve, and these have caused damages to the fixtures and so on.",1,159,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00159
2015-07-13-T-007,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit,"So, I would like to ask the Minister of State, why is it the case that there are so many of such defects  wall cracks, seepages and tiles staining? Is it an issue of supervision during construction or the sourcing of suppliers? And also, the Minister of State mentioned that about one-third, or 30% of the residents now to go BSCs but in some cases, in some of the blocks that I encountered, it is more than that. And whether the BSCs have the resources to cope with those cases and to turn around fast enough, and whether HDB comes in to push this along so that some of these defects can be rectified soonest?",2,160,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00160

So, please, perhaps the Member can provide me the details as to which specific blocks or precincts, and then we can follow up. As to what is the issue with the development, whether it is tiles, whether it is doors, or whether it is the tap, toilet or whatever, and we will then follow up on that concern.",1,163,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00163
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As to whether the BSCs have the capacity to deal with these concerns, HDB requires sufficient staff to man the BSC. If a BSC is found to be inadequate in terms of staffing, then it is something that the Branch Office has to provide feedback for and then we will then make sure that the staffing is adequate.",2,164,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00164

2015-07-13-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"I am asking for DBSS. In the case of DBSS, does the HDB take the same responsibility like BTO projects to make sure that the defects are rectified? In his response to Mr Yee Jenn Jong's question, he said let us not trivialise the defects and complaints. Is he saying that the complaints by residents on the defects are trivial and not important?",2,167,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00167
2015-07-13-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),He also spoke about imperfection of works and the defects. Can he clarify what is imperfection and what is considered a defect? Hairline crack vis-a-vis a hole somewhere? I think that will make it clear so that residents can understand what is imperfection and what is a real defect.,3,168,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00168
2015-07-13-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Madam, I understand that there is a CONQUAS score for DBSS flats. Would the Minister of State make public the CONQUAS score for DBSS flats and also for the cluster or development so that residents would know what is the CONQUAS score for DBSS and for the specific DBSS developments.",4,169,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00169
2015-07-13-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"It seems that the HDB takes the approach that for DBSS flats, it is between the resident and the developer. And thereby, the resident deals with developer, whether to take legal recourse. If the developer fails to follow up with the defect complaint or take certain action to rectify it, then, claim against the developer. But, Madam, it is not that simple. It concerns legal matters. It concerns legal costs. We would like to know specifically what role is HDB playing in terms of residents' complaints of defects.",5,170,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00170
2015-07-13-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"And, lastly, I understand that within the defect liability period, residents can make claims. But in actual fact, there are problems that residents cannot solve themselves. So, could HDB consider asking the developer of DBSS projects to extend the liability period for another year so that residents can be have more time to get the developer to rectify the problems?",6,171,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00171

2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I think Mr Low have five or six questions. First, I will deal with question two, as to whether I said I trivialised residents' concerns. I think the Member might want to review the transcript. I made it very clear that we should not trivialise residents' concerns, far from trivialising their concerns. Perhaps, there is a misunderstanding there. I hope to make it very clear that it is, indeed, not the case.",1,175,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00175
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As to what the responsibility of HDB is in respect of DBSS vis-a-vis BTO, I have said it in my first reply and subsequent responses to various Members. For BTO projects, HDB is the developer. In DBSS, the developer is a private developer. HDB sets the broad parameters within which the private developer is given the flexibility and because of that, it takes responsibility for its private development works as a DBSS project. The Sale and Purchase Agreement is black and white. It is with the resident and the developer. But having said that, that is not to say that HDB entirely takes no responsibility whatsoever, does not do anything at all. That is clearly not the experience.",2,176,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00176
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For example, when Minister of State Sim Ann had some issues with the Trivelis – and certainly, I am sure Mr Low had followed that with keen interest – HDB, although it is not party to the agreement, followed up with the developer, approached it, worked behind the scenes, worked closely with the advisor to make sure that as between the developer running the DBSS project and the residents, there is some resolution in sight. For example, in Trivelis, it is public knowledge that the developer has made an offer to residents. This is a matter of negotiation that is on-going.",3,177,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00177
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As to whether the CONQUAS scores for all the DBSS projects can be disclosed, I have to check; I think they may be already public for each of the 13 DBSS projects. Let me check and follow up with the hon Member.",4,178,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00178
2015-07-13-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As to whether the DLP needs to be extended, I think we do not talk about it in a vacuum or about general concerns about whether residents are able to resolve the issues expeditiously. As I said earlier to this House, the issues need to be surfaced and resolved within the one-year DLP. The developer has certain timelines that it must meet or the contractors have certain timelines that they must meet. If for some reason, any particular development is of particular concern, a particular reason for delay and if there is any basis at all for asking for the DLP to be extended, then let us look at it specifically and not in abstract.",5,179,2015-07-13-T-007-S-00179

Past incidents in the Middle East involving the use of car bombs have resulted in heavy death tolls. In 2001, the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network had planned to use truck bombs against embassies, MRT stations and military installations in Singapore.

The ""Via Ferrata"" activity required the participants to walk or climb a route that ran along the slope of the mountain, using a system of harnesses connected to a metal cable to secure them and prevent any risk of a fall. There are three ""Via Ferrata"" routes and TKPS chose the simplest and shortest route; which spanned 280 metres, was suitable for 10-year-olds and required about an hour or slightly more to complete.",1,219,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00219
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, if you look at this slide, the one in which the TKPS students attempted is the one in red; it is the shortest and simplest. You might have seen also pictures of this ""Via Ferrata"" which were on the other parts of the circuit and these were not what the students attempted. Thirty-one TKPS participants, comprising 23 students and eight school staff, attempted the ""Via Ferrata"" activity. Six students did not take part in this activity and were resting at a nearby hut. Those who participated were organised into five groups; each led by a trainer provided by the operator of the ""Via Ferrata"", Mountain Torq. To ensure proper supervision and control, each group was sent out a few minutes apart to avoid bunching up. Each group had up to five students and three adults, making the adult-to-student ratio approximately 1  2.",2,220,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00220
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"At 7.15 am when the earthquake struck, the first three groups had already started out on the ""Via Ferrata"", while the last two groups were still at the start line waiting for their turn. From the accounts we had gathered, the first three groups that were on the mountain slope, were in the path of a very heavy rockfall. The last two groups that were at the starting point were less badly hit by the falling rocks and stones, perhaps the rockfall there was less heavy or because there were some trees in the vicinity that offered some protection.",3,221,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00221
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Some of the boulders dislodged by the earthquake were as large as a house or a car, as Members can see from the slide. This was one of the pieces that were dislodged.",4,222,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00222
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The casualties amongst the first three groups included both children and adults. Seven students and five adults, including two Mountain Torq trainers who were experienced and familiar with the terrain and safety procedures, lost their lives. For the other two groups that were waiting at the start point, they all survived, with the majority of them unhurt. Whether a participant perished or survived depended on where he or she happened to be at that time. It made no difference whether the participant was a child or adult, novice or experienced climber.",5,223,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00223
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"When the earthquake struck, many of the TKPS students recounted that the teachers near them used their bodies to protect and shield them from harm. Once the initial tremors subsided, the adults accompanying the students were able to quickly work together to give instructions for the students to evacuate. As far as possible, the students who were unhurt or only slightly injured were organised into groups to be led down the mountain. The evacuation was made more difficult because the paths had been damaged by the quake and there were many aftershocks that morning. Some of the adults, including those who were themselves injured, stayed on to help the students who were more seriously injured or required greater assistance.",6,224,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00224
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On the same day, the Singapore Government Crisis Team responded, first with an immediate Crisis Response Team from MFA that reached Kota Kinabalu by 8.00 pm, to help coordinate the needs of the Singaporeans in Kota Kinabalu affected by the earthquake.",7,225,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00225
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"By the end of the first day, my Ministry had already made plans for those family members who wanted to be in Kota Kinabalu to be flown up early the next morning. I conveyed this to the parents who were waiting at the school. We sent a multi-agency delegation, together with several counsellors and TKPS teachers, who flew together in an SAF C130 aircraft to directly support the family members. Concurrently, plans were put in place to fly home the students who were physically able to do so. By the next day after the quake, on 6 June afternoon, 19 TKPS students had returned to Singapore. Three students with more serious injuries remained in Kota Kinabalu to receive treatment. Two were evacuated back the next day and the third by 8 June.",8,226,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00226
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Over in Kota Kinabalu, the MOE-led delegation supported the family members through this difficult period and worked to ensure that all the bodies that were recovered were flown back at the earliest possible moment so that last rites could be performed and the deceased laid to rest. A tribute site was set up at TKPS for the public to pay their tribute. In the days that followed, TKPS teachers and over 100 counsellors and psychologists rallied to support the participants and their family members. We witnessed the courage and resilience of the affected students, teachers and their family members as they did their best to come to terms with what had happened.",9,227,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00227
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In our review of this incident, it is clear that in the planning and execution of any overseas learning journey, our schools must continue to conduct risk assessments and take all the necessary safety measures and precautions. Nevertheless, natural disasters are impossible to predict or exclude entirely. Indeed, seismologists considered the probability of such a destructive earthquake happening in the area around Mount Kinabalu to be unknown. There was no prior warning. No matter how careful our schools may be in planning their overseas trips, events that are beyond our control and prediction may still occur, whether natural disasters or otherwise.",10,228,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00228
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We are all deeply saddened by the sudden and unexpected earthquake that claimed the lives of our students and some of the adults who were accompanying them. Their families, as well as their friends and colleagues, will need time to recover from this. We will therefore continue to give our utmost support to them, through counselling and other appropriate support measures.",11,229,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00229
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"At the same time, let us honour the spirit which our students and teachers have shown in undertaking this trip, to stretch and challenge themselves to achieve their personal best. Several parents who lost children told me, we must continue to provide high quality learning programmes for our students, including such overseas adventure learning. I am deeply moved and inspired by their conviction and encouragement.",12,230,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00230
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Like many parents, MOE is convinced of the value of outdoor adventure learning, whether conducted in Singapore or overseas. We will continue to enhance the quality of such learning opportunities, while ensuring that schools continue to emphasise safety when planning these trips and programmes. It is important that we provide effective learning platforms for our students to build their confidence, adaptability and resilience, qualities that will stand them in good stead in life.",13,231,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00231
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"MOE regularly looks for ways to enhance the quality of all our learning programmes, including outdoor adventure learning programmes. As part of this effort, my Ministry will form an Advisory Panel comprising local and international experts. This panel will provide MOE with additional inputs on enhancing the quality and safety of outdoor adventure learning programmes that are conducted locally and overseas.",14,232,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00232
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"MOE conducts annual audits of schools' overseas learning journeys. In conducting these annual audits, we look for good practices that can be shared, and provide support and guidance in areas identified for improvement. In this year's audit, MOE will look at how to improve contingency plans for events, such as natural disasters. We also note that the Malaysian government has indicated that in view of the recent unexpected earthquake, it will assess and monitor seismic movements in Sabah and review safety measures for all climbers. Until the safety of Mount Kinabalu is ascertained by the Malaysian authorities, no schools will be allowed to take students there.",15,233,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00233
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The incident on the slopes of Mount Kinabalu has also highlighted the courage and devotion of the school staff and instructors who accompanied the students, as well as the efforts by the Mountain Torq trainers and Sabah mountain guides who helped evacuate our students to safety. As I mentioned earlier, we have heard accounts of selfless acts of adults who accompanied the students to Mount Kinabalu. We also know that all the teachers who accompanied the students had trained with the students for many months, and devoted much of their time and energy to carefully plan for this trip. What they did at Mount Kinabalu was a continuation of their care and devotion to our students. Their selfless acts and devotion to duty have drawn tributes from many Singaporeans and have given rise to calls for formal recognition, including calls from Members of this House.",16,234,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00234
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,We will honour the staff and instructors who accompanied our students to Mount Kinabalu in a manner that is befitting of their courage and sacrifice.

2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In addition, MOE has also launched the Sabah Earthquake Fund to help rebuild the lives that were affected by this earthquake. The donations will be a tangible way to provide financial assistance to the dependants of the two Singaporean teachers and one instructor who had lost their lives. Part of the Fund will also be passed to the Mountain Torq trainers and Sabah guides, as some had lost their lives and the rest have to worry about their livelihood in the aftermath of the damage caused by the earthquake. This is a meaningful way for us to show our care for those affected by the Sabah earthquake, to whom we are indebted.",18,236,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00236

2015-07-13-T-009,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),The Minister mentioned that he will announce at an appropriate time the details on how to honour those who had sacrificed and showed courage during the incident. It has been more than a month since the Sabah quake disaster. Can I ask the Minister when will be the appropriate time and why is this Parliament sitting not a good time for this news to be announced?,2,242,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00242
2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Ms Irene Ng for her question. In fact, ever since the quake occurred, my Ministry's priority has been to provide as much comfort as possible to the families of those who lost their loved ones, as well as to focus on helping the students and teachers of the school who are affected by this incident to recover and to recover as quickly as possible. There are many pieces of work that we were embarking on and it also took us some time to ascertain the facts of the case. As you would imagine, an incident like this was chaotic, it was completely unexpected and, therefore, we were very careful in going through the details of what had happened, so that we could have a full picture of the sequence of activities and the role played by the different people who were involved.",1,243,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00243

2015-07-13-T-009,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, I join the Minister to express my deepest condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in this unfortunate tragedy. I want to thank the Minister for clarifying the safety considerations taken by the school as well as MOE to ensure that every student's welfare, every student's safety is paramount regardless of the kind of learning journey or programme undertaken by the students. So, I thank the Minister as well as MOE for that assurance.",1,245,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00245

I visited the school, I attended the wakes of some of the children, as well as the teacher who passed away in this misfortune. From the conversations with several of the students, what came out were some stories about the heroic behaviour of some of the teachers who went up and down the mountain to help the students and some who shielded the students from the falling rocks.",2,246,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00246
2015-07-13-T-009,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Whilst I appreciate what the Minister had said about the recognition, I hope that the recognition would not just be in monetary terms. I think we must go beyond monetary compensation to recognise the heroic behaviour of the teachers. And some of these teachers are survivors as well. So, may I ask the Minister to clarify that the awards that we are planning would not be purely monetary but also a kind of award to recognise that effort?",3,247,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00247
2015-07-13-T-009,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The other thing that I would like to ask the Minister to clarify is for the students and teachers who survived the tragedy, what kind of counselling would they be given because what was reported in the newspapers was that some of the children had witnessed scenes which they should not have seen as young children. For some of the survivors, there may be a period where they will undergo this guilt trip that they survived the incident. I hope the Minister can clarify what kind of counselling they would be given and for what time period because some of these may have long-lasting impact.",4,248,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00248

2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On his first question on the form of recognition, I would like to assure Mr Lim that no, it would not be monetary award. We have kept it separate.

2015-07-13-T-009,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"As to the second question about the needs of the students, from the moment the quake occurred, MOE activated a very large team of counsellors from all parts of Government, not only from MOE, but also from MOH, MSF and our hospitals and KKH. There is a very large team of psychologists and counsellors who responded immediately. Many of them volunteered. I am very touched by the spirit of our people in that everybody came forward to provide support and volunteered. On the day itself, we already had many counsellors who had been counselling the students, the teachers as well as family members. As for the students and teachers, we will continue to provide the counselling. We have deployed an additional counsellor and an additional Vice Principal to TKPS so that we can look after the students and teachers well.",3,251,2015-07-13-T-009-S-00251

However, as our democracy develops, the question should also be asked as to whether there could come a time when the decision we make today becomes a burden on Temasek to deliver results. Given that Temasek's investment strategy is already challenging, will there come a time when Temasek could feel pressure, no matter how slight, to meet the demands of the growing Budget?",6,340,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00340
2015-07-13-T-018,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"As Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned on more than one occasion, Temasek's returns tend to be more volatile and can be quite high when times are good. For instance, the latest Temasek Review reports a one-year return to shareholder of 19.2%. The Review also tells us that the exposure to growth economies is 45%. In terms of geographical region, 42% is invested in Asia, excluding Singapore. In terms of sector, 28% is invested in Financial Services. These exposures are clearly borne out in the fluctuations of Temasek's net portfolio over the last 20 years. The record shows that while the over performance in terms of net portfolio value has been steadily improving, the dips caused by SARS and the Global Financial Crisis were both sharp.",7,341,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00341

For 2013, a cross-country comparison shows that among those economies for which data is available from the World Bank, Singapore ranked 46 out of 163 in terms of Government spending when measured by the General Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE). It is also true that depending on which year you choose, the growth rate in such spending could be very low for Singapore − 2014 was a case in point. But a very different picture emerges, Mdm Speaker, when we consider how this has been changing over time. In particular, I would like to point to two aspects of the change  first, the change in the ratio of Singapore's GFCE compared to those of other economies; and second, the growth rate of such spending.",12,346,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00346

Among Nordic countries, the highest cumulative annual growth rate in constant local currency terms during this period was seen in Norway at 2.9%. This is less than half of the 6.6% increase in average annual terms that Singapore achieved. Where others spend more, they have taken time to reach a level which I believe we should not be in haste to match in much less time. Incidentally, the comparisons I had mentioned produce essentially the same result regardless of whether you carried them out using expenditures measured in constant local currency units or current US dollar. So, we should ask ourselves how much faster we want expenditures to grow and whether an even more rapid pace of growth than we have seen will really bring us closer to our objective.",13,347,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00347

So, we will get a lift in resources, roughly speaking of about 3% of GDP, but the framework – because of its checks and balances and its safeguards – will give us a reasonable chance of sustaining this stream of income in the Budget for many years to come, rather than seeing a dwindling stream over time because we draw too much for spending today.",11,386,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00386

It is a fair question because there is no assurance that actual returns over the long term will match expected returns. And I would like to emphasise that when we thought through the NIR system in 2008, we paid particular attention to ensuring that the system will be sustainable, and that there is no bias in favour of over-optimism in expected returns and thus the likelihood of facing a situation where actual returns are, in fact, much lower than expected returns.",12,387,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00387

2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Second, ensuring that it is real returns and not nominal returns that we look at, so that we do not get a situation where you have high inflation globally and high nominal returns, and you spend on the basis of the nominal returns, when really what you are doing is depleting the real value of the reserves. So, that is the second safeguard.",14,389,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00389
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The third safeguard, which is important, is that the spending is based on investment returns on net assets, not total assets. In other words, it is based on the excess of assets over the liabilities of the Government, which includes borrowings such as SGS and SSGS. The net assets are basically the unencumbered assets and the spending rule is based on these unencumbered assets rather than the full gross amount of the assets. We do not spend any of the returns earned on the encumbered assets, in other words, the assets that provide backing for our liabilities. And what this means is that we ensure that the full investment returns on the encumbered assets are available to cover the debt servicing costs on the liabilities.",15,390,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00390
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The fourth safeguard is the smoothing of the asset base − the asset base on which we apply expected long-term returns. This means that the temporary booms and busts in the market that lead to changes in the value of our asset base are smoothed. A sudden boom in asset prices, which will happen from time to time, does not mean that we can immediately spend more through NIRC. So, that is the fourth safeguard − the smoothing of the asset base.",16,391,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00391
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The fifth safeguard is very important. The four safeguards I have spoken about are in the design of the NIR framework. But there is an important fifth safeguard, which is in the governance processes in the NIR framework, that also ensure that we do not spend on the basis of over-optimistic assumptions about expected returns. The process by which expected long-term real rate of returns are decided has checks and balances, and is shaped by a sense of realism about the risks in the investment world.",17,392,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00392
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The process involves annual review within each of our investment entities so that the Boards can make a proposal to the Government. It is not just about the Boards coming up with a number, Government ratifying the number and the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA) and the President agreeing to the number.",18,393,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00393
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,It involves detailed deliberation at each stage of the process.,19,394,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00394
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"First, within the organisations themselves, within the investment entities – Temasek, GIC, MAS. It is a rigorous process, to project the expected rate of return over the long term, based on the views of seasoned professionals and experts. They take a long-term view, based on history as well as an assessment of the future environment and seek not to be swayed by short-term sentiments. That is an extremely important part of the culture – not being swayed by the short-term sentiments of the markets.",20,395,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00395
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Government then decides whether to accept the Boards' proposals. We consult independent experts when necessary. And where there is significant uncertainty in the outlook, the Government will err on the conservative side when it recommends the expected rate of return to the President and the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA). The President and the members of the CPA themselves are experienced people. The CPA comprises people with very serious, proven track records in their professions and businesses. They are people who can question Government on the assumptions we are making, or the judgements we make. They can question the Government as well as the investment entities themselves.",21,396,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00396
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"So, the process that I have described has features which mitigate the risk of over-spending, particularly the risk of having expected returns that are above what can be realistically achieved in the markets.",22,397,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00397
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"What if there are persistently low actual returns, lower than expected? Well, this will in fact be reflected in the asset base, because the asset base is not based on expected returns. The asset base is based on actual returns. And if you have persistently low or negative actual returns, it will mean that the asset base grows more slowly, and that affects how much spending we can have because the expected returns are applied to that asset base. So, that is another check on the system and it constrains how much we can spend.",23,398,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00398
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"So, the system that I have described involves several layers, not just one layer, that amount to a strong structural safeguard in how we spend our reserves. The system helps to safeguard against over-spending based on over-optimistic expected returns.",24,399,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00399
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Ms Foo Mee Har pointed out that the Temasek portfolio, in particular,was a more volatile one. I think there were some useful questions. Let me first say that when we designed the NIR framework, we designed it for all three entities. The 50% rule and the other features of the framework were designed for all three entities, although we first proceeded with GIC and MAS.",25,400,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00400
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Assoc Prof Randolph Tan had a couple of questions and suggestions. One was whether we should apply a different spending cap to Temasek compared to GIC and MAS because Temasek has a higher risk portfolio. It is a meaningful question. We have a range of investment entities with quite different risk profiles. MAS at one end, the most conservative; Temasek at the other, which takes more concentrated stakes and is basically an equity investor, which has higher risk compared to an investor with a balanced portfolio. We can, in theory, apply different caps to each of them but I think there are merits in keeping the system simple and applying a common 50% cap to all the sources of investment income under the NIR framework and being conservative in the way we go about operating the system. I am satisfied that with the safeguards we have, that conservatism will be maintained.",26,401,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00401
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"I should add, in relation to Assoc Prof Randolph Tan's suggestion, that we do not look at projected values of the asset base, whether it is based on value at risk or any other way of drawing a cone of possibilities. We actually use the asset base that is based on historical values. That itself is a form of conservatism. Smoothed historical values are the asset base on which we apply our expected returns to determine spending. So, there, too, is some conservatism built into the system.",27,402,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00402
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Next, the impact on the investment entities themselves. Will their investment strategies be influenced by the NIR framework? Ms Foo Mee Har, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Assoc Prof Randolph Tan had asked this question. I had mentioned this during the Budget debate and I will have to emphasise it again. Being included in the NIR framework does not change the investment strategies of GIC, Temasek or MAS. It leaves their strategies unaltered.",28,403,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00403
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The NIR framework does not set a target rate of return for the investment entities. They have to be faithful to their mandates. Their mandates, particularly in the case of Temasek and GIC, are to invest for the long term, to aim to grow the value of their assets over the long term and to ride out short-term market cycles. They determine how much risk they can accommodate, and within that amount of risk they aim to maximise their returns over the long term.",29,404,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00404
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Why are we able to take that approach of letting them focus on their mandates of investing for the long term? The reason is because our NIR framework is purely about the unencumbered assets − I explained this earlier − assets that are not matched by liabilities. And this allows both GIC and Temasek to adopt an endowment mindset − of investing for the long term and growing the value of their assets by taking advantage of opportunities that short-term investors or those who are liquidity-constrained cannot take advantage of. Overall, this approach has enabled both GIC and Temasek to perform creditably in relation to the market indices and they are both extremely well regarded amongst their peers.",30,405,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00405
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"What if future returns are expected to be structurally lower because of a deterioration in the investment environment? It is possible. It is entirely possible given the problems in the world today – the fiscal challenges, low productivity growth, and the possibility of disruptions in the international environment. It is possible that we have to settle for a structurally lower rate of return over the long term. If that is the case, then the Government has to adjust its spending. We will have to accept that as a reality that there will be lower expected returns, lower NIRC and we have to adjust our spending, or we have to find alternative forms of revenue through domestic sources. That is the right approach, rather than asking the investment entities to take more risks in the search for yield so that we can still get the same amount of NIRC. And that is the approach we must stick to.",31,406,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00406
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Ms Foo Mee Har has asked whether we have learnt any lessons coming out of the Global Financial Crisis. I think it has been a very useful episode. The main lesson is that spending based on expected returns instead of actual returns was the right decision. We made our amendment to the Constitution in good time. Spending based on expected returns rather than actual returns turned out to be a wise decision. It helped us to avoid going through a ""feast and famine"" in NIRC and in Government spending.",32,407,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00407
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"We all know what happened during the crisis. If we look at equity indices, say, we take the MSCI World index, it declined by almost 40% in 2008 and recovered by 31% the next year – a big crash and then a big recovery. And we would not have wanted Government spending to be shaped by those sharp gyrations in world markets. We have instead been able to avoid pro-cyclical Budgets. If you spend based on actual returns and actual returns are highly volatile, it will typically mean that you are pro-cyclical; in other words, during good times, you spend more, and during bad times, you spend less. That would not be wise from an economic policy perspective.",33,408,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00408
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Liquidity is an important issue. I think Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Pritam Singh had asked about how we manage liquidity within this framework. The essential issue is this − if we are spending on the basis of expected returns, and expected returns are not matched by actual returns year-to-year, where do we get the cash in order to spend? Expected returns is the basis on which the spending rule is defined, but if actual returns vary from expected returns and, in particular, may fall well short of expected returns, where do we get the cash? And that is an important question. I had addressed it in 2008 when we introduced the NIR framework and I touched on it briefly in this year's Budget debate as well, but I will explain it again.",34,409,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00409
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"First, to be very clear, this is not an issue about the spending cap. It is not an issue about investment strategies. It is purely a cashflow management issue. It does not have to do with the size of our Government Budget surplus or deficits. It is a cashflow management issue. The spending rule caps how much we can spend based on the expected returns of our investment entities. Having determined the maximum amount that we can spend, the question is whether we have got sufficient cash for that spending.",35,410,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00410
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Government has a variety of sources of cashflow from which it can meet its cash needs. These include our tax revenues which are coming in at different times during the year. It also includes funds raised outside the Budget, such as the proceeds from land sales. These land sales proceeds cannot, under our constitutional rules, contribute to the Budget and they do not count as Government revenues. But they are part of the cashflow that the Government receives.",36,411,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00411
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"There is also a healthy level of Government deposits placed with MAS. A substantial amount of Government deposits placed with MAS that we can draw on when we need it, if we need it, for cashflow purposes.",37,412,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00412
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Government basically pools all its sources of cashflow, all its sources of liquidity together and manages its cashflows as a whole through a disciplined procedure.",38,413,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00413
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"We have more than sufficient cash to ensure that NIRC spending based on expected returns can be met. There is, hence, no need, even when actual returns are weak or negative, to require the investment entities to divest existing investments in order to provide cash to the Government.",39,414,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00414
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Finally, let me move on to a broader theme that came up in Members' comments, which is the whole issue of fiscal conservatism. I am glad that it was raised. Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Ms Foo Mee Har, Assoc Prof Randolph Tan, in particular, raised valid questions over how we should shape our spending priorities and how we ensure that we are getting value out of our spending.",40,415,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00415
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Our aim is not and cannot be to spend all the revenues we have. Our aim is, first and foremost, to ensure that we are spending wisely, in the interest of Singaporeans today and tomorrow. And as Assoc Prof Randolph Tan pointed out, we have got to guard against an inexorable rise in spending. He noted, and I think you will see this if you were to look at the history of social spending in many countries, that social spending only goes up, it does not come down. Unless you are forced to bring it down in a deep crisis, which is what Greece and some European countries are going through in a very painful way. Not just painful adjustments in crisis but also quite inequitable, I would say, because the people who are taking the pain of budget cuts are typically the young and the poor.",41,416,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00416
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"So, we must avoid in normal times, an inexorable increase in spending, where promises today are layered upon promises yesterday. It is what has happened in so many countries and it is a natural tendency in society, a very human tendency for that to take place. We should guard against that and Assoc Prof Tan sounded a useful caution.",42,417,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00417
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Our spending is increasing. Why is it increasing? First, because we are engaging in a major new cycle of investment in Singapore's future. In our healthcare capacity, our transport infrastructure and our human capital. It is a major new cycle of investment that I spoke about in this year's Budget, and those are the big three drivers.",43,418,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00418
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"We are also recalibrating and rebalancing between collective and individual responsibility, in various areas of social support – from the early years all the way to the retirement years. But the big drivers of increased spending on the Budget are healthcare capacity − because of an ageing population – transport infrastructure, and, thirdly, investing in our human capital, in Singaporeans themselves, because that is the ultimate source of strength in our society and our economy. Those are the big drivers.",44,419,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00419
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"We have essentially followed the life cycle of our society. Many other countries, during their younger and rapid growth years, spent the larger revenues that came up. We saved surplus revenues when there were Budget surpluses in good times and during the years of rapid growth. We saved Budget surpluses and did not spend them simply because they were there. This now puts us in a very strong position today. Because now, as our society goes through the second half of the life cycle – gradually getting older and our economy is slowing down – we are now in the position of having this endowment, which we can draw on in a disciplined fashion.",45,420,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00420
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Following the lifecycle of our society has been a sensible and prudent policy that we have through the years. We should never see our aim as that of looking for new spending needs and then looking for the revenues in order to meet that spending. Our aim should be, first and foremost, focused on outcomes. The real outcomes we want are  a vibrant economy that provides good jobs and careers for Singaporeans; a low tax burden on the middle-income group – and it is, in fact, much lower than in most other countries; and a fair and equitable distribution of taxes and benefits in our society. That is what we focus on, rather than looking for new spending and then looking for revenues to be able to meet these needs.",46,421,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00421
2015-07-13-T-018,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"And I would like to assure Ms Foo Mee Har that we do take very seriously the assessment of spending effectiveness even after we have started. Our healthcare infrastructure is a very important area, where we are putting a lot of emphasis on this – MOH and MOF – on assessing the effectiveness of spending and where it should be spent. Should it be in the acute hospitals, or should we be spending more on step-down care and primary care; how do we spend in a way that truly enhances benefits for citizens, and a critical issue - how do we ensure that future treatments, particularly as technology advances, provide real value rather than just higher costs? How do you ensure that SkillsFuture, which is a major new investment in the future, will be money well spent and not just money chasing after educational programmes? Important issue. We have got to assess our spending as we go along and ensure that they are providing value for money.",47,422,2015-07-13-T-018-S-00422

However, the EnterpriseOne portal lists much detailed content on Government assistance schemes, including the programmes of many Government agencies. SMEs would need more time to digest all the information and select schemes deemed more applicable.

And a 2014 survey shows that only a quarter of Singaporeans are following a retirement plan for financial needs, another quarter are working out their plans, while the rest have no concrete ideas at all.

We can, of course, read the fine print or do our own research, but most of us will not. So, while this Bill seeks to give more protection to the consumer, we must continue to remind them that this Bill will not eliminate risks or bad practices and that they need to protect themselves by either asking questions or finding out more about the investments they enter into.",5,500,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00500

In this regard, I have a concern that the intent of the Bill may be undermined by exclusion clauses. The Bill prescribes minimum standards for non-sales key performance indicators, the fulfilment of which affects the FA representatives' remuneration. However, these minimum standards can be contracted out of. For example, a FA representative may ask his client to sign a document stating that he only wants to receive product advice or that the transaction is ""execution only"". In such a case, it would seem that the representative cannot be taken to task for unsuitable recommendations or for poor after-sales service.",6,501,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00501
2015-07-13-T-019,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next, I wish to clarify the scope of section 23B, which makes Financial Advisory a dedicated profession. Section 23B introduces a new requirement that a representative must work exclusively as a FA representative unless the conditions prescribed under section 104 are fulfilled. A breach of this and related provisions is an offence. It is not clear on the face of the Bill what the purpose of this restriction is. One likely reason is to prevent a conflict of interest. An example is where a FA representative cum property agent improperly recommends that a client purchase an investment property instead of for further insurance because the former gives him a higher commission. But in other situations, the conflict may be less clear or less probable. I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate on the requirements that will be prescribed under section 104. Will there be a blanket ban on FA representatives holding another job? And what other mischief does the provision target?",7,502,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00502
2015-07-13-T-019,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),My last point is a broader one on the FA industry in Singapore. The Bill tackles the problem from one angle  that of the financial advisers and their representatives. The Bill realigns incentives by improving the remuneration structure to promote fair dealing. It extends its reach to supervisors and also makes financial advisory a dedicated profession. But the best protection is really a well-informed consumer.,8,503,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00503
2015-07-13-T-019,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The question, therefore, is whether we should do more to improve the financial literacy of Singaporeans. Singaporeans must be alert to the need for insurance and retirement planning, and able to sniff out deals which are too good to be true. One danger is that once we have these regulations in place, people will assume that all FAs are regulated and that they, therefore, have nothing to fear. That will certainly not be the case. I wonder if the Minister has plans to tackle this aspect of the problem.",9,504,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00504

In this regard, consumers may turn to the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC) to resolve their disputes. FIDReC deals with insurance claims up to a sum of $100,000 and with claims against banks, capital market disputes and other claims up to a sum of $50,000. I would like to ask the Minister how many cases FIDReC handles each year and, more importantly, if there are plans to expand FIDReC's jurisdiction so that disputes can be handled quickly and with lower costs.

I also agree with him that compensation models do shape behaviour and that is the key reason why MAS is introducing its new remuneration framework that incorporates non-sales KPIs so that the focus of financial advisory representatives will not be solely on sales.",1,506,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00506
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I would also like to thank Mr Hri Kumar for supporting the Bill and I will address the questions he has raised.,2,507,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00507
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, on the point about consumers having the option to request only product advice or ""execution-only"" services from the FA representatives. This flexibility is, indeed, available today. It caters to customers who are more sophisticated or who want to opt out of receiving financial advice. Nevertheless, MAS will take regulatory actions against any FA representatives found to have abused this flexibility to influence unsophisticated customers to purchase unsuitable products.",3,508,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00508
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There are also a few safeguards to deter and detect such behaviours by FA representatives. First of all, under the new remuneration framework, the checks to be conducted on FA representatives will include an assessment of whether they have undertaken the necessary due diligence to understand their customers' investment objectives, financial condition and personal needs. FA representatives who fail to conduct such due diligence, could suffer cuts in their remuneration.",4,509,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00509
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, for the more unsophisticated or vulnerable customers, supervisors of FA representatives are required to call such customers after each transaction to ensure they have not been unduly influenced by their FA representatives to purchase unsuitable products.",5,510,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00510
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Third, such abuses may be detected through mystery shopping exercises which are conducted regularly and the Financial Advisers are expected to do so. These safeguards are all subject to MAS' supervisory oversight and MAS will work closely with the FA industry and consumer bodies to assess if further safeguards are necessary.",6,511,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00511
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Member also asked about the scope of section 23B of the FA Act. I would like to clarify that MAS has no intention of imposing a ""blanket ban"" on FA representatives holding another job. FA representatives may hold another job, provided the job does not conflict with their financial advisory roles, result in the neglect of their financial advisory duties or bring disrepute to the industry.",7,512,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00512
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In consultation with the industry and consumer bodies, MAS has identified four specific jobs that FA representatives are not allowed to engage in. These are  selling real estate, moneylending, promoting junkets for casinos and marketing products that are not regulated under the FA Act. These jobs are clearly in conflict with financial advisory activities. For example, MAS has received complaints against FA representatives who use their regulatory status to market questionable schemes in products which do not accord safeguards to customers under the FA Act. So, MAS will monitor the situation and expand the list of prohibited jobs where appropriate.",8,513,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00513
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Hri Kumar also asked about the annual caseload handled by the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC) and whether there are any plans to expand FIDReC's jurisdiction. Since the launch of FIDReC's operations 10 years ago, it has handled an average of 855 complaints each year. FIDReC's jurisdictional claims limits were set to cover the majority of retail transactions. FIDReC can already take on cases that exceed its jurisdictional limits if the financial institution agrees to allow FIDReC to hear the claim. Nevertheless, I would like to assure the Member that MAS and FIDReC will keep the jurisdictional limits under review to ensure that FIDReC continues to provide an affordable alternative dispute resolution scheme that covers the majority of retail transactions.",9,514,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00514
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the amendments to the FA Act will raise the standards and professionalism of the financial advisory industry to better serve the changing needs of customers. But, ultimately, customers must take responsibility for their financial decisions. I fully agree with the Member that the best protection is a well-informed customer.",10,515,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00515
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MAS has been and will continue to work with the industry and other Government agencies to enhance financial literacy among Singaporeans.

2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, to reach out to Singaporeans in the heartlands, MoneySENSE has been organising road shows at public libraries and community centres using games, talks and info-displays to disseminate financial messages. These programmes provide guidance, tools and checklists to help customers and consumers assess their financial needs, including insurance and investment needs.",12,517,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00517
2015-07-13-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In addition, we will be launching an education campaign soon, to remind Singaporeans about the importance of saving and investing for the future, and to introduce low-cost options like Exchange Traded Funds and the upcoming Singapore Savings Bonds. So, campaigns like these also have a role to play in encouraging consumers to learn more about their financial choices and plan ahead for their financial well-being.",13,518,2015-07-13-T-019-S-00518

2015-07-13-T-021,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),Bankruptcy refers to the legal process whereby the debts that a person is unable to pay are resolved. The bankruptcy regime serves a number of objectives.,2,537,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00537

2015-07-13-T-021,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"A debtor, or his creditors, may apply for a bankruptcy order. In either case, it must be shown that the debtor is unable to pay his debts as they fall due and that such debts amount to at least $10,000.

2015-07-13-T-021,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Presently, a bankruptcy application can only be made if the debtor owes at least $10,000 in debts. This threshold was introduced in 1999. It is timely to review the threshold given the rate of inflation over the past years. The Bill, therefore, raises the debt threshold to $15,000.",23,558,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00558
2015-07-13-T-021,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),The second key amendment is to introduce an expedited bankruptcy procedure.,24,559,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00559

Presently, a creditor must wait until the end of the 21-day period before he can make a bankruptcy application. Clauses 14 and 15 of the Bill allow a creditor to make an expedited bankruptcy application after the statutory demand has been served, but before the 21-day period has expired. However, the creditor must show a serious possibility that the debtor's property, or the value of all or any of the debtor's property, will be significantly diminished before the 21-day period ends.",25,560,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00560
2015-07-13-T-021,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The amendments are being introduced because, currently, a creditor can only appoint an interim receiver or prevent the bankrupt's property from being transferred after a bankruptcy application has been filed, which can only be done after the 21-day period has expired. There is a risk that the debtor could dissipate his assets during this 21-day period. The amendments will, therefore, allow the creditor to take steps to preserve assets available for distribution to the creditors at an earlier stage, although the bankruptcy order will only be made upon the expiry of the 21-day period. This is to ensure that the debtor will still have the full 21-day period to settle or set aside the statutory demand.",26,561,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00561

2015-07-13-T-021,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Currently, it is not mandatory to appoint a private trustee to act as the trustee in bankruptcy. As a result, private trustees are seldom appointed and the OA acts as the trustee in over 99% of bankruptcies.

2015-07-13-T-021,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The new framework provides bankrupts with clear goals and timelines to meet, in order to become eligible for a discharge. Whether a bankrupt is eligible for discharge depends on whether he has paid the target contribution, which refers to the total amount contributed to the estate from the bankrupt's income or from third parties.

2015-07-13-T-021,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"One potential issue I wish to raise relates to the costs of private trustees.

2015-07-13-T-021,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Will the additional burden of high private trustees' fees delay or hinder the bankrupts' rehabilitation and discharge? I am thinking of certain scenarios, for example, where a bankrupt owes a small debt of say, $20,000, how much additional fees would be added for him to pay by way of private trustee's charges? High trustee's charges could also come at the expense of creditors' recovery, since the trustee's charges will be paid in priority to creditors' claims.",7,626,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00626
2015-07-13-T-021,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Furthermore, it is foreseeable that institutional creditors, such as banks, may appoint larger law firms or accounting firms as private trustees.

In addition, according to a MinLaw explanatory note on the Bill, once a bankruptcy exceeds its five-year mark or seven-year mark in the case of repeat bankruptcies, a private trustee will have to submit reports to the OA every year. I would like the Ministry to confirm that a bankrupt does not need to wait for the five- or seven-year mark respectively before making a complaint to the OA.",10,629,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00629

If such residents were to come to see their Members of Parliament for assistance, should Members write to the private trustee directly, or should such correspondences be channelled through the OA's office? Is the private trustee expected to reply to Members' letters?",11,630,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00630
2015-07-13-T-021,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Sir, timeframes for discharge. The Bill sets out a differentiated discharge framework, with timeframes for discharge of bankruptcy  for first-time bankrupts, they are generally eligible for discharge in five to seven years, while repeat bankrupts are generally eligible for discharge in seven to nine years. Under this framework, bankrupts are told that they should keep up their monthly contributions to reach the Target Contribution, so as to be discharged earlier rather than later. However, bankrupts who have not paid their Target Contributions in full may still be discharged after seven years for first-time bankrupts and nine years for repeat bankrupts.",12,631,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00631
2015-07-13-T-021,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I see the benefit of this framework of injecting more certainty for bankrupts to work towards their discharge. Nevertheless, I note that the periods of time proposed are long compared with some countries. One example at the other end of the spectrum is the United Kingdom, where bankrupts are automatically discharged after one year to promote rehabilitation of bankrupts and to encourage entrepreneurs to try again. While having a regime of one year automatic discharge is probably too drastic a change and unfair to creditors, how did the Government arrive at the timeframes it decided upon?",13,632,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00632

A total of 550 parents participated in this survey which was mainly to find out how parents could prepare their children for employment. Results showed that the capability parents valued most is to cultivate their children's specialised skills and knowledge learning capacity.

Hence, he used his wife's name to re-register a business and started to sell fish soup. As he learned from his previous experience, the business became better and better, and he opened another stall at a nearby hawker centre. Because he has already mastered the specialised skill of slicing fish, of late, Mr Tan hopes to expand his business through opening a chain, but because he was still an undischarged bankrupt, he faced hindrances at every turn – rejections in discussing projects, getting bank loans, and applying for Government assistance schemes. He really hopes that the Government could show more leniency towards bankrupts.",5,639,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00639

If our society is unable to tolerate failure, and not accepting mistakes, fears taking risks and dodges from it; if parents are unwilling to let children take risks, or are not used to the idea of letting children take risks and responsibilities, then Singapore would lack the social environment to groom entrepreneurship. Without the nurturing soil, big trees can never grow.",6,640,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00640
2015-07-13-T-021,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member):,"Allow me to share the insights from our late Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in his book ""The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States and the World"". Mr Lee felt that the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship is even more important than technological ability. In an era of technological revolution, only talented entrepreneurs would be able to seize new opportunities, create new ideas, establish new enterprises and make great strides forward. The ordinary businessmen only need to learn from others' experiences to have a fairly comfortable life, but those businessmen who possess the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit can reap rich rewards.",7,641,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00641
2015-07-13-T-021,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member):,"These statements show that our late Founding Prime Minister values the importance of grooming the entrepreneurial spirit. However, from CDAC's survey results, parents certainly have neglected the importance of the entrepreneurial spirit. This gap makes us think hard about whether we should create a more conducive social environment for entrepreneurs. After all, failure is the mother of success. Though we can tolerate failures, we should not indulge failures. There is no conflict of interest between the Government legislation of protecting creditors' interests and grooming the entrepreneurial spirit. Successful entrepreneurs have a responsibility to their shareholders, employees and customers, and are able to gain the trust of interested parties.",8,642,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00642

However, as we followed the Games closely those few days, the sports we banked on for gold medals turned out to disappoint us, while those sports that were not on the radar suddenly produced many dark horses. In the future, the business environment can be expected to be full of uncertainties, just as in the SEA Games. Past glories may be overtaken by others, while past failures could also be the foundation for a comeback.",9,643,2015-07-13-T-021-S-00643

This is extremely good news for would-be entrepreneurs. I hope this is a signal for the whole society to view the business cycle with greater magnanimity.

2015-07-13-T-024,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Person-in-Custody, or PIC, who requires medical attention may be escorted out of secured Police facilities to a hospital for treatment. The Police have an established set of procedures to guard against the risk of PICs escaping while in hospital. These procedures are benchmarked against international best practices. For example, Police studied the PIC management system of the Victoria Police in Australia in 2006 and the UK Police in 2009 and 2011.",1,655,2015-07-13-T-024-S-00655

One belt is placed around the PIC’s waist, and has two wrist restraints which are used to lock the PIC’s hands in position at the sides of his waist. The other belt has two ankle restraints which are fastened around the ankles of the PIC to restrict his movement. The grip restraints have been used by the Police since 2005 and are also used by the US Department of Homeland Security and many correctional facilities and law enforcement agencies around the world.",2,656,2015-07-13-T-024-S-00656

While in the room, he attacked one of the Police officers and attempted to escape. The Police officer tried to prevent the PIC from doing so. A struggle ensued during which the PIC grabbed the Police officer’s revolver. Shots were fired from the officer’s revolver. The PIC sustained superficial injuries while the Police officer suffered gunshot wounds to his left thumb and right foot. The PIC was subsequently subdued and the situation brought under control.",8,662,2015-07-13-T-024-S-00662

These features are environmentally sustainable green features integrated with the urban development. The waterways and water bodies are also enhanced aesthetically, creating new community, social and recreational spaces near water and encouraging new lifestyle activities and attractions to flourish at these spaces. As Singaporeans enjoy our waters, they will cultivate and develop a sense of shared ownership towards our water resource. The ABC Waters Programme enhances our quality of life, and brings us closer to the vision of transforming Singapore into a ""City of Gardens and Water"".",2,668,2015-07-13-T-025-S-00668
2015-07-13-T-025,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"As of end May 2015, PUB has completed 27 ABC Waters projects across Singapore at a total cost of approximately $134 million. Under the Programme, PUB has also opened 974 ha of reservoirs and 94.6 km of waterways to the public for recreation. The Programme has been very well-received by the public. So far, more than 1,800 community events have been held at various completed ABC Waters projects. The Programme has also been successful at encouraging communities to take ownership of our waterways. Under PUB’s Friends of Water Programme, 316 community groups have adopted Singapore’s waterways, with 275 taking ownership of ABC Waters projects. These groups care for our waters by conducting clean-ups, carrying out learning trials to facilitate experiential learning about water management and encouraging people to enjoy water responsibly.",3,669,2015-07-13-T-025-S-00669
2015-07-13-T-025,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Arising from various measures taken by PUB and stakeholders’ involvement, our waterways are cleaner than before. That said, it is unavoidable that some debris will end up in the water. Most of the debris consists of fallen leaves. To keep our waterways clean, the Department of Public Cleanliness (DPC) from NEA deploys contractors to clean public drains regularly under its integrated public cleaning contracts. About $37 million a year is allocated to the cleaning of public drains.",4,670,2015-07-13-T-025-S-00670

MOE decided to proceed early so as to allow more students, starting in 2013, to benefit fully from the programme. While facilities are important, the essence of the programme lies in the innovative curriculum and teaching approach. If we had waited till all the physical facilities are ready, the students who are currently benefiting from the IP would have lost an opportunity.

With the existing tenancy, initial estimates were that the construction of the permanent site could only be completed by mid-2018. Late last year, MOE was informed that there were substantial changes to the alignment of the Cross Island Line. It would now run underneath a much larger part of the permanent site. The high-rise nature of the JC also required more pre-construction works, such as extensive soil investigation. These works can only be carried out when the current lessee vacates in December 2015.

This trend is not sustainable given our labour constraints. In addition, sales volume in the F&B sector is slowing down and companies are facing greater competition. It is, therefore, important for the F&B sector to improve its productivity and become more manpower-efficient.",1,695,2015-07-13-T-029-S-00695
2015-07-13-T-029,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Under the Food Services Productivity Roadmap, SPRING has implemented strategies to drive sector transformation through mass adoption of productivity initiatives. These include kitchen automation, workflow redesign, centralised dishwashing, vending machine formats, grab-and-go formats and digital services.

2015-07-13-T-030,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has completed a series of road improvements works in Jurong East since 2011. These include the widening of Jurong Town Hall Road and Jurong East Street 11, and the construction of new roads, such as Jurong Gateway Road and Gateway Drive. With the completion of the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Jurong East Street 21 will also be widened from a dual one-lane road to a dual two-lane road. To minimise localised crowding due to chartered bus pick-ups and drop-offs, and parking queues at JEM and Westgate, LTA is introducing more alighting points for buses and more information on availability of parking in the vicinity.",1,698,2015-07-13-T-030-S-00698

2015-07-13-T-030,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Public transport services serving Jurong East are also being improved significantly. Apart from additional trains for the North-South and East-West MRT Lines and the upgrading of the signalling system, crowding at the Jurong East station should be reduced when Downtown Line Stage 2 opens by the end of this year. Jurong East will also be served by the Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line in the longer term.",3,700,2015-07-13-T-030-S-00700

2015-07-13-T-031,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The number of illegal parking violations has fallen sharply since the introduction of CCTV enforcement in April 2014, from a monthly average of 915 per location to 131. This is less than 15% of the original number of violations and testifies to the effectiveness of the CCTVs in deterring illegal parking. All 70 locations where the CCTVs have been installed have seen significant improvements in traffic flow and public bus operations.",1,702,2015-07-13-T-031-S-00702
2015-07-13-T-031,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"About one in six illegal parking summonses was issued to taxi drivers. We adopt the same enforcement approach for taxis and other vehicle types. This means that aside from controlled areas indicated by double yellow zig-zag lines or a single white zig-zag line, where any stopping is an offence that carries demerit points, at other locations, taxis are allowed a reasonable time to stop by the roadside to pick up or alight passengers.",2,703,2015-07-13-T-031-S-00703

It is not always possible to be 100% sure how the breach occurred, as the event might have taken place a long time ago and essential forensic evidence lost. However, our agencies will strive to arrive at the best possible assessment, using all available information and facts. We also recognise that as more facts come to light over time, the original assessments may have to be further revised.",3,707,2015-07-13-T-032-S-00707

We have to adopt a ""security-by-design"" approach so that security considerations are integrated upfront when new IT systems are being developed. The Cyber Security Agency is working with relevant stakeholders to promote this concept not just in the Government sector, but across all sectors. We also need agencies to have effective real-time monitoring of their IT systems, so that if any attack occurs, they can be detected at the earliest possible opportunity.",6,710,2015-07-13-T-032-S-00710
2015-07-13-T-033,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what are the considerations for Singapore to be a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB); (b) how will Singapore contribute to the capital of AIIB; and (c) what are the risks and opportunities for Singapore companies arising from Singapore's membership in AIIB.,1,711,2015-07-13-T-033-S-00711
2015-07-13-T-033,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance what is the difference between our membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and our existing membership in the Asian Development Bank given that both are multilateral financial institutions focused on infrastructure development in Asia.,1,712,2015-07-13-T-033-S-00712
2015-07-13-T-033,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The scale of infrastructure needs in Asia is large, with some US$8 trillion needed by 2020. As part of the region, Singapore views the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or the AIIB, as a timely initiative that can help close this infrastructure gap.",1,713,2015-07-13-T-033-S-00713
2015-07-13-T-033,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Singapore has itself benefited from the assistance of institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

Singapore played an active role in hosting and co-chairing the negotiations of the AIIB Articles of Agreement here, which were concluded in May this year.",3,715,2015-07-13-T-033-S-00715
2015-07-13-T-033,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Singapore, as a global financial centre and a base for major infrastructure companies, is well placed to collaborate with the AIIB and facilitate new opportunities for businesses here. In fact, the World Bank partners many Singapore-based companies along the infrastructure value chain, and uses Singapore as a base from which to provide urban and infrastructure solutions to countries regionally and globally. With the AIIB, companies can similarly bid for infrastructure projects, or provide advisory services for project structuring, among other opportunities. While businesses have to conduct their risk assessment for deals with the AIIB, we expect that the risk would be comparable to that of partnerships with other multilateral development institutions.",4,716,2015-07-13-T-033-S-00716

The Singapore Government plans to subscribe to US$250 million, or 0.25%, of the AIIB’s total authorised capital. Of this US$250 million, 20% or US$50 million is to be paid-in over five annual installments, in other words US$10 million a year. The other 80% or US$200 million of our capital subscription does not need to be paid in, except when called by the AIIB in extraordinary circumstances.

2015-07-13-T-034,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We have to ask Myanmar to treat its minorities in a way consistent with international norms. That is the way ASEAN approaches discussions with member states. The question also is what can be done to help the Rohingyas. The process of human trafficking involves many criminal groups and takes places across multiple countries. Resolving the matter requires the cooperation of all countries concerned – whether they are source, transit or destination countries. Therefore, while we urge the Myanmar government to be mindful of the plight of all people within its borders, other countries in which these traffickers operate also need to take action against such criminal syndicates.",3,724,2015-07-13-T-034-S-00724

Singapore has committed US$200,000 to this ASEAN trust fund. ASEAN is also considering setting up a Task Force to respond to crisis and emergency situations arising from the irregular movement of persons. Beyond ASEAN, there is a need to involve wider forums. For example, the Bali Process, which is a regional Ministerial-level conference involving ASEAN and non-ASEAN countries.

For example, they may be liable to criminal sanctions under the Penal Code if hurt or threatening behaviour is involved. The Protection from Harassment Act 2014 (the Act) also provides for criminal sanctions and civil remedies against harassing behaviour. Some debtors have obtained Court orders against harassing debt collectors under the Act.",1,728,2015-07-13-T-035-S-00728

2015-07-13-T-041,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,The Caregivers Training Grant was introduced in 2007 to support caregivers of seniors and those with disability with up to $200 each year to attend caregiver training courses.,1,751,2015-07-13-T-041-S-00751
2015-07-13-T-041,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We do not have plans to increase the annual cap for the grant at the moment, as the current grant quantum is generally adequate. Today, about 80% of all approved caregiver training courses cost $200 or less. Over the last four years, the average annual utilisation of the grant was about $160 per caregiver.",2,752,2015-07-13-T-041-S-00752

2015-07-13-T-041,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We will, however, continue to monitor the utilisation and adequacy of the Caregivers Training Grant.",5,755,2015-07-13-T-041-S-00755
2015-07-13-T-042,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan,"asked the Minister for Health whether there are attempts by the Ministry to reduce the long continuous working hours for housemen on night shifts and, if so, what are the measures considered.",1,756,2015-07-13-T-042-S-00756
2015-07-13-T-042,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"From May 2014, all house officers came under a national framework for training and assessment renamed the Postgraduate Year 1 (PGY1) training. For the PGY1 year, the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) stipulates that work should not exceed 80 hours per week, including night call hours. However, the SMC also stipulates at least four night calls per month for PGY1 doctors to learn how to manage acute conditions, under supervision, with the medical team at night. In addition, there should be at least 10 hours of rest between duty periods and an off day each week.",1,757,2015-07-13-T-042-S-00757
2015-07-13-T-042,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"PGY1 doctors cannot be scheduled for more than 24 hours of continuous active duty managing patients. For those who have completed a 24-hour duty period duty period, their hand-overs to colleagues or other activities, for example, educational activities, should not take more than an additional six hours. Hospitals, generally, comply with these guidelines.",2,758,2015-07-13-T-042-S-00758
2015-07-13-T-042,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"With regard to the frequency and duration of night calls, some hospitals have started to implement a shift system thereby reducing long working hours in clinical departments where such work patterns are suitable. For example the half call is an extension of another five to six hours to the 8-hour day and the night float is a 10-hour overlapping night shift together with this. This avoids the more tiring 24-hour continuous duty type call. These overlapping shifts, together with the steady increase in the number of house officers over the years, have lessened the work hours and frequency of night calls.",3,759,2015-07-13-T-042-S-00759
2015-07-13-T-043,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government will consider creating more job opportunities for PMETs through place-and-train programmes that facilitate mid-career switches which may be particularly helpful to those affected by industry restructuring.,1,760,2015-07-13-T-043-S-00760
2015-07-13-T-043,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Our economy is restructuring towards one where growth is driven by innovation and skills. As businesses restructure, mature PMEs may be more vulnerable to being retrenched and face greater difficulties in securing their next jobs. We understand the challenges that they face. The Government has put in place various measures to help them reskill and find new jobs. One of these measures is the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP), which enables PMEs, including those who have been made redundant, to undergo skills conversion and take on new jobs in a different industry. More than 6,000 PMEs have benefited from the programme since its launch in 2007.",1,761,2015-07-13-T-043-S-00761
2015-07-13-T-043,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"We are committed to doing more to further enhance employment and career opportunities for PMEs. As announced on 8 July 2015, the new Career Support Programme (CSP) will provide mature Singaporean PMEs greater opportunities to access mid-level and above jobs. Starting from 1 October 2015, employers who employ mature PMEs, who have been looking for jobs for at least six months, in mid-level jobs that pay at least $4,000, will be given wage support. The Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) will also collaborate with and provide incentives to private search and placement firms to help this group of PMEs access more job opportunities.",2,762,2015-07-13-T-043-S-00762
2015-07-13-T-043,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Both employers and Singaporean PMEs have important roles to play. Employers should tap on the wealth of experience of mature PMEs and consider them fairly for career opportunities. Singaporean PMEs need to be adaptable in the fast-changing economy and take ownership of their own career development, upskilling and upgrading to take on quality jobs and careers.",3,763,2015-07-13-T-043-S-00763
2015-07-13-T-044,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan,"asked the Minister for Manpower from 2011 to 2014, what is the number of employers found to have paid CPF contributions for phantom local workers so as to inflate their foreign worker quota.",1,764,2015-07-13-T-044-S-00764
2015-07-13-T-044,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"It is against the law for employers to inflate their foreign worker quota and employ more foreign workers than they are rightfully allowed to. From 2011 to 2014, MOM took enforcement action against 90 such employers. They inflated their foreign worker quota by making CPF contributions to locals who were not working for their companies to hire additional foreign workers.",1,765,2015-07-13-T-044-S-00765
2015-07-13-T-044,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"MOM takes a serious view on employers who falsely inflate their foreign worker quota. Errant employers face a financial penalty of up to $20,000 for every work pass application made using the inflated quota. They may also be debarred from hiring foreign workers for a period of 12 months or more, depending on the severity of the case.",2,766,2015-07-13-T-044-S-00766

2015-07-13-T-046,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider removing the income eligibility criteria for married couples who purchase a HDB resale flat close to their parents so as to allow more of such couples to qualify for the CPF Housing Grant for Families.,1,772,2015-07-13-T-046-S-00772
2015-07-13-T-046,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"First-timer families buying a resale flat to live with or near their parents or married child are eligible for the Higher-Tier CPF Housing Grant for Family of $40,000. The income ceiling of $10,000 is in place to ensure that housing subsidies are given to those who need more help. A higher income ceiling of $15,000 is set for extended families who buy a flat to live together. For families whose incomes have exceeded the limit but are in need of subsidised housing, we exercise flexibility and help them on a case-by-case basis.",1,773,2015-07-13-T-046-S-00773

2015-07-13-T-047,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The noise levels from train operations are generally consistent throughout the day. The perception of high noise levels in early morning and at night may be due to the low ambient noise during these times. We try to minimise such noise by ensuring that the operator maintains train wheels and tracks well. Where train noise goes above a certain level, we will consider installing noise barriers.",1,777,2015-07-13-T-047-S-00777

2015-07-13-T-048,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"It is not practical to install noise barriers along roads and traffic junctions. Gaps will be needed in the noise barriers for bus stops, and for vehicular and pedestrian access. These gaps would render noise barriers ineffective. Pedestrian safety would also be compromised as their view of on-coming traffic could be blocked.",1,780,2015-07-13-T-048-S-00780
2015-07-13-T-048,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The Estuary meets the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)’s setback guideline of 15 metres from the road.

2015-07-13-T-054,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The likelihood of a major earthquake occurring in Singapore is extremely low. Most earthquakes tend to occur at the active margins of tectonic plates, such as in Sumatra, Java, the Philippines, Japan, New Zealand and South America. Singapore is situated about 400 km from the nearest plate margin. The crust underlying Singapore is considered stable by experts in geology, and the records from our seismic stations and global positioning instruments show no evidence of active faults within Singapore.",1,803,2015-07-13-T-054-S-00803

Some high-rise buildings may sway as a result of such tremors. However, few events release enough seismic energy for tremors to be felt here and even then much of the energy is lost by the time it reaches Singapore. Hence, such tremors are unlikely to be significant enough to cause structural damage to our buildings. Buildings in Singapore are designed to established building codes and are, therefore, sufficiently robust to resist the tremors arising from distant earthquakes. For example, tremors were felt in Singapore in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009; and there was no structural damage to our buildings.",2,804,2015-07-13-T-054-S-00804

Upon graduation, international students work in Singapore to supplement our labour force.",1,809,2015-07-13-T-055-S-00809
2015-07-13-T-055,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Faculty-level employment information for international students is not readily available. However, on average, eight in ten international students who received tuition grant in our polytechnics and autonomous universities are either working in Singapore after graduation, or have been granted approval by MOE to defer their service obligation to pursue further studies. For the remaining international students, some are in the midst of seeking deferment approval and some are still seeking employment.",2,810,2015-07-13-T-055-S-00810

2015-07-13-T-056,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Freelance workers are persons who operate their own business or trade. This means that they are their own employers. They decide which service contracts to enter into. There is no employer-employee relationship between them and their clients. For this reason, they are not covered by the Employment Act (EA).",2,815,2015-07-13-T-056-S-00815

2015-07-13-T-058,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"There are about 44,000 heavy vehicle parking lots for 35,000 heavy vehicles. Businesses use these heavy vehicles to transport goods, machinery and people. That is why most of the parking lots are found in industrial estates at premises where businesses operate. Naturally, these parking spaces are managed by the private sector.",1,821,2015-07-13-T-058-S-00821
2015-07-13-T-059,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what measures can the Ministry embark on to mitigate the excessive noise generated by low-flying commercial and military aircraft and helicopters near Seletar Airport which happens daily in both day and night; and (b) whether another noise impact study can be done this year.,1,822,2015-07-13-T-059-S-00822
2015-07-13-T-059,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Aircraft arriving and departing Seletar Airport follow flight paths designed to minimise the noise impact on surrounding residential estates such as Yishun and Yio Chu Kang. Whenever the wind conditions permit, CAAS will direct aircraft to land from, and take off towards the north, in which case the aircraft would not fly over any residential estates. However, there are instances whereby aircraft have to land from or take off towards the south due to the direction and speed of the wind. This could result in some noise to residents living along the flight path.",1,823,2015-07-13-T-059-S-00823
2015-07-13-T-059,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"CAAS has put in place various noise abatement measures. For example, aircraft are required to fly at an altitude of at least 1,500 feet (about 450 metres) over residential areas around Seletar Airport to reduce the noise impact on the ground. Training flights and cargo flights are prohibited from operating at Seletar Airport between 10.00 pm and 7.00 am daily.",2,824,2015-07-13-T-059-S-00824
2015-07-13-T-059,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,CAAS and the operator of Seletar Airport (Changi Airport Group) regularly review the extent of aircraft noise around Seletar Airport and assess if the measures to mitigate noise are sufficient. The most recent study was concluded in November 2014. The study found that current and future anticipated noise levels over residential areas around Seletar Airport are within the noise parameters of land-use planning guidelines for residential developments around the airport.,3,825,2015-07-13-T-059-S-00825
2015-07-13-T-060,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Government will take the lead to ensure that existing and future unarmed security contracts entered into by Ministries and Statutory Boards will adopt the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) recommended by the Security Tripartite Cluster before PWM becomes a licensing condition on 1 September 2016.,1,826,2015-07-13-T-060-S-00826
2015-07-13-T-060,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Government has accepted the Security Tripartite Cluster’s recommendations for the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) to be introduced to the security industry and fully supports implementing the PWM in public sector security contracts, even before PWM becomes a licensing condition on 1 September 2016.",1,827,2015-07-13-T-060-S-00827
2015-07-13-T-060,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,We have started discussions with our Tripartite partners on ways to identify early adopters of PWM in the security sector and to give them due recognition when awarding contracts.,2,828,2015-07-13-T-060-S-00828
2015-07-13-T-061,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs whether the SCDF can dedicate an ambulance on a standby basis for Jurong Island.,1,829,2015-07-13-T-061-S-00829
2015-07-13-T-061,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"At any one time, SCDF deploys a fleet of 50 emergency ambulances across Singapore to ensure prompt response to emergency medical calls. SCDF considers demand factors like population density and case load when deciding on its deployment strategy. In 2014, SCDF responded to more than 155,000 ambulance calls, or about 427 calls per day. Of these, 73 calls over the whole year, or one call every five days, were from Jurong Island.",1,830,2015-07-13-T-061-S-00830
2015-07-13-T-061,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Given this case load, it is not practical for the SCDF to assign one ambulance to standby just for Jurong Island. However, to ensure swift response to emergency medical calls on Jurong Island, an emergency ambulance is deployed at the Jurong Pier Fire Post, located at the Jurong Island Checkpoint, from 7.00 am to 11.00 pm daily. This covers the period when industrial activity on Jurong Island is the busiest. However for optimal use of our limited ambulance resources, this ambulance is also dispatched to emergency medical cases in the vicinity, such as Boon Lay, Tuas and Jurong Industrial Estate.",2,831,2015-07-13-T-061-S-00831
2015-07-13-T-061,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"SCDF’s deployment of its emergency ambulance fleet is not static. SCDF closely monitors the population changes, its response times and adjusts the deployment of its emergency ambulances as necessary to ensure prompt and effective response.",3,832,2015-07-13-T-061-S-00832
2015-07-13-T-062,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs how does the Ministry ensure that homes in residential estates remain accessible to larger emergency vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances, especially homes situated on narrow roads that allow kerbside parking of vehicles.",1,833,2015-07-13-T-062-S-00833
2015-07-13-T-062,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether there is detailed area-based planning by SCDF to ensure that large emergency vehicles like fire engines and ambulances can gain physical access and egress when responding to emergencies in residential estates where roads may be narrow and not passable to large vehicles; and (b) whether SCDF emergency vehicles have encountered access difficulties in responding to calls in residential estates due to physical constraints such as narrow roads or obstruction from parked vehicles and, if so, what protocols exist to guide officers on overcoming these difficulties and to facilitate working with stakeholders to prevent a recurrence.",1,834,2015-07-13-T-062-S-00834
2015-07-13-T-062,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Public roads in Singapore are designed according to strict standards to ensure that there is a minimum clearance for emergency vehicles to pass through. This minimum clearance requirement also applies to narrow roads, including those that allow kerbside vehicular parking, so that homes adjacent to such roads remain accessible to all emergency vehicles. The SCDF maintains a fleet of smaller, more maneuverable emergency vehicles, such as the Light Fire Attack Vehicle, Class 3 Emergency Ambulances and Fire Bikes, which could be deployed with ease on roads with narrow access ways.",1,835,2015-07-13-T-062-S-00835
2015-07-13-T-062,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The SCDF also conducts regular ground surveys to familiarise SCDF responders with the specific operational challenges of the geographical area covered by each fire station. As part of these surveys, the SCDF identifies areas with rampant illegal parking which could potentially impact its emergency vehicle access. The SCDF will notify LTA who will then undertake regular enforcement action against the illegally parked vehicles in these areas to ensure that the access of emergency vehicles is not impeded. Errant vehicle owners may be fined or awarded demerit points to deter recurrent offences.",2,836,2015-07-13-T-062-S-00836
2015-07-13-T-062,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"When there is obstruction of access in an emergency situation, the SCDF ground commander will assess the ground situation and consider alternative options to overcome the obstruction. The options include the deployment of the Light Fire Attack Vehicle and the Fire Bikes, which are dispatched together with the larger fire engines for emergencies in residential estates. The ground commander can also deploy fire-fighting equipment and SCDF officers on foot to the scene to support the smaller emergency vehicles which are already at scene. This will be done concurrently while the SCDF officers engage the building management or residents to remove the obstructing vehicles. The Fire Safety Act also empowers SCDF officers to forcibly remove any vehicle that is impeding its fire-fighting operation.",3,837,2015-07-13-T-062-S-00837
2015-07-13-T-063,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the principles behind the decision on whether to provide for single working mothers the same 16 weeks of paid maternity leave as accorded to married working mothers; and (b) how does the policy balance the principle of equalisation of opportunities for all Singaporean children with the principle of supporting the social value of parenthood within the context of marriage.,1,838,2015-07-13-T-063-S-00838
2015-07-13-T-063,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,There are three objectives that guide our approach towards providing benefits and incentives to children and parents. We seek a balance among these objectives.,1,839,2015-07-13-T-063-S-00839
2015-07-13-T-063,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"First, we are committed to providing all children with equal opportunities to fulfil their potential. For this reason, we extend education and healthcare benefits to all Singaporean children, regardless of the marital status of their parents.",2,840,2015-07-13-T-063-S-00840
2015-07-13-T-063,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Second, we want to continue to promote parenthood within marriage. This is the desired and prevailing societal norm in Singapore. We have some benefits to incentivise births within marriages and these are available only to married parents.",3,841,2015-07-13-T-063-S-00841
2015-07-13-T-063,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Third, we recognise that some families, including some single parents and their children, face greater challenges. We have support programmes to help these vulnerable families.",4,842,2015-07-13-T-063-S-00842
2015-07-13-T-063,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"However, I fully understand that some single unwed working mothers require greater social support. This help encompasses education, healthcare, work and financial support. The support provided and needed clearly goes beyond maternity leave and some of these differences in benefits. Help is provided on many fronts in order to support the mother and child. Single mothers may approach any Family Service Centre or Social Service Office and we will follow up. Single expectant mothers are also supported through programmes in the community that provide hotlines, counselling and residential services. The Government will continue to work with the community to support single unwed parents and their children.",5,843,2015-07-13-T-063-S-00843
2015-07-13-T-063,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I recognise that there are some areas of difference in terms of what single unwed mothers receive as compared to married mothers. This is not cast in stone. I am sympathetic to the challenges faced by single unwed parents. I am reviewing some of these and will make adjustments, where possible.",6,844,2015-07-13-T-063-S-00844
2015-07-13-T-064,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what are the considerations when the Ministry looks into the installation of CCTVs to identify high-rise litterers.,1,845,2015-07-13-T-064-S-00845
2015-07-13-T-064,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"High-rise littering is an anti-social and serious offence that poses both hygiene problems and safety hazards to the public.

It is also higher than the overall percentage of students graduating with second upper class honours or better, which is about 38%.",1,849,2015-07-13-T-065-S-00849
2015-07-13-T-065,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Yee asked how these figures compare with that of PSC scholars. There is no good basis for comparing as the number of PSC scholars is extremely small and they undertake their studies in a variety of top-tier universities, both local and overseas.",2,850,2015-07-13-T-065-S-00850
2015-07-13-T-065,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The basic grade that the international scholars have to meet in order to maintain their scholarships is a cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.5 out of 5 for NUS, NTU and SUTD, and 3.4 out of four for SMU. This is commensurate with what is required of Singaporean scholarship holders studying at these universities. These criteria strike a careful balance between encouraging students to achieve certain standards in academic work, while giving them the time and space to learn deeply and widely through a variety of activities",3,851,2015-07-13-T-065-S-00851

2015-07-13-T-068,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the Ministry's assessment of the amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act made in 2012 in the gathering of information and intelligence against the masterminds behind the drug trafficking syndicates; and (b) how effective has it been in disrupting their drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore.,1,858,2015-07-13-T-068-S-00858
2015-07-13-T-068,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act in 2012 on the application of the death penalty to the offence of drug trafficking gave the court the discretion to decide whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment and caning, or the death sentence for drug couriers who have provided substantive assistance to the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. The “substantive assistance” condition is meant to enhance the operational effectiveness of the CNB in taking action against drug syndicates. It enables CNB investigations to reach higher into the hierarchy of such syndicates.",1,859,2015-07-13-T-068-S-00859
2015-07-13-T-068,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Since the changes were implemented, the information provided by drug couriers and joint collaboration with regional counterparts have led to the arrest of more than 40 drug traffickers and disrupted the operations of drug trafficking syndicates.",2,860,2015-07-13-T-068-S-00860
2015-07-13-T-068,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"However, we recognise that the drug trafficking syndicates are constantly evolving their mode of operations to circumvent our laws. The new law has thus brought some successes, which have assisted CNB to maintain its tough and vigilant enforcement approach. We have a zero-tolerance approach against drugs and the measures we have taken – tough laws, robust enforcement and preventive drug education seek to tackle both the supply and demand for drugs. In doing so, we are able to keep the drug situation under control.",3,861,2015-07-13-T-068-S-00861
2015-07-13-T-069,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is AVA doing to solve the pigeon problem in the vicinity of Sembawang Drive; (b) how many complaints of bird nuisance have been received on the AVA hotline in the past 12 months and what action has been taken; (c) whether AVA has carried out any study to understand the habits of these birds so as to find a long-term solution to the problem; and (d) whether AVA is working with any non-government organisation to find ways to keep these birds away from urban built-up areas.,1,862,2015-07-13-T-069-S-00862
2015-07-13-T-069,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In the past 12 months, AVA received 6,694 feedback on bird nuisance.

2015-07-13-T-069,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"AVA is the First Responder for animal-related feedback, and will then work with the relevant agencies on an appropriate and coordinated response. Specifically for the pigeon nuisance at Sembawang Drive, a successful response requires the pigeon feeders to cease their pigeon feeding activities. This requires public education and effective enforcement both by AVA and the Town Council. Separately, the Town Council will need to manage and control the pigeon population. We also require NEA to ensure proper food waste management at the food establishments and enforce against littering offences. Community and grassroots leaders can help by educating residents not to feed the birds.",2,864,2015-07-13-T-069-S-00864

The study was concluded in June 2013 and AVA is currently doing trials on the various recommendations in the report. For example, AVA worked with the Choa Chu Kang Town Council in February 2015 to install a bird deterrent gel as a trial. The preliminary results were promising as the gel deterred birds from roosting, reducing incidences of bird nuisance.

2015-07-13-T-070,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Tree pruning is done primarily to maintain the health of the trees and remove weak branches for public safety. Trees along roadsides are also pruned for vehicular clearance. It is not advisable to prune trees excessively as it can affect their health and reduce their ability to withstand strong winds. When NParks receives requests from the public for trees to be pruned, trained officers will assess if this is needed, and if so, work with their contractors on what needs to be done.",1,868,2015-07-13-T-070-S-00868

2015-07-13-T-084,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether Singapore will slide into a longer period of deflation after the headline inflation has slipped into negative territory for the seventh consecutive month in May 2015 and what will be the implications of prolonged deflation for Singapore.,1,928,2015-07-13-T-084-S-00928
2015-07-13-T-084,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"In the first five months of 2015, CPI-All Items inflation averaged -0.4% on a year-on-year basis. However, the negative inflation rates are not an indication that the Singapore economy is experiencing deflation, as the price declines are not broad-based nor are they expected to persist.",1,929,2015-07-13-T-084-S-00929
2015-07-13-T-084,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"First, the negative rates of inflation experienced were primarily due to price declines in specific categories of the consumption basket, rather than broad-based price declines which would have been symptomatic of a general weakness in demand in the economy. In particular, the negative inflation rates largely reflected the impact of three factors.",2,930,2015-07-13-T-084-S-00930
2015-07-13-T-084,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"One, lower car prices and housing rentals, which contributed to a 0.7 percentage-point drop in CPI-All Items inflation on average in the first five months of the year. These price declines were, in turn, the result of a deliberate effort by the Government to cool the property market, following the sharp run-up in housing costs over the past few years, as well as lower Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums this year due to an increase in the supply of COEs. Excluding the costs of private road transport and accommodation, MAS Core Inflation, which is a better measure of underlying price pressures, was positive at 0.8% from January to May 2015.",3,931,2015-07-13-T-084-S-00931
2015-07-13-T-084,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Two, the sharp fall in global oil prices since late 2014, which has dampened the domestic prices of oil-related items, including petrol, electricity and gas. In all, the decline in the prices of oil-related items contributed to a 0.6 percentage-point drop in CPI-All Items inflation on average in the first five months of the year.",4,932,2015-07-13-T-084-S-00932
2015-07-13-T-084,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Three, the disinflationary impact of a suite of budgetary measures introduced by the Government to help households cope with the cost of living. These include measures like enhancements to medical subsidies and waiver of national examination fees, which have lowered the prices of consumption items, such as healthcare services, medication and education.",5,933,2015-07-13-T-084-S-00933
2015-07-13-T-084,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Second, the dampening effects of lower oil prices and budgetary measures are expected to dissipate. Specifically, the Brent benchmark oil price recently rose from a trough of US$49 to around US$64, and market expectations are for prices to edge up gradually into 2016. As such, the drag posed by oil-related items on overall inflation on a year-on-year basis should dissipate towards the end of the year and into 2016. Similarly, the impact of the budgetary measures on year-on-year inflation is expected to start to dissipate towards the end of the year.",6,934,2015-07-13-T-084-S-00934
2015-07-13-T-084,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Reflecting these factors, the MAS Core Inflation is expected to stay subdued at around the current rate over the next few months, while CPI-All Items inflation could ease further due to the drag from car prices and housing rentals. However, both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are projected to rise towards the end of the year and into 2016, on account of higher global oil prices and as the effects of the budgetary measures dissipate. For 2015 as a whole, MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are expected to average 0.5% to 1.5% and -0.5% to 0.5%, respectively.",7,935,2015-07-13-T-084-S-00935
2015-07-13-T-084,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"In sum, MTI's and MAS' assessment is that the Singapore economy is not experiencing deflation nor is it likely to slip into deflation. MTI and MAS will continue to closely monitor price developments in the economy.",8,936,2015-07-13-T-084-S-00936
2015-07-13-T-085,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry can consider allowing foreign workers under the services sector quota to be housed at approved purpose-built dormitories similar to the provision for foreign workers in the construction and marine sectors.,1,937,2015-07-13-T-085-S-00937

Employers convicted under the CPF Act could face a fine of up to $5,000 per offence and/or jail term of up to six months. Repeat offenders could be subject to a fine of up to $10,000 per offence and/or jail term of up to 12 months.",2,941,2015-07-13-T-086-S-00941
2015-07-13-T-086,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"MOM and CPF Board jointly launched the “WorkRight” initiative in 2012 to improve compliance with the Employment Act and the CPF Act through public education and enforcement. Outreach campaigns were conducted to raise awareness among employees of their employment rights and among employers of their statutory obligations to their employees, including their CPF obligations. The number of onsite inspections was also stepped up by more than ten times to more than 5,000 inspections annually. We also receive complaints/enquiries from employees and members of the public.

2015-07-13-T-088,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can consider providing common public waste collection points in future urban planning instead of the present collection of single waste bins from individual houses at landed properties.,1,950,2015-07-13-T-088-S-00950
2015-07-13-T-088,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,The present system of refuse bins placed outside individual homes is a practical method of waste collection. It is convenient for residents and does not require land to be set aside for centralised collection points.,1,951,2015-07-13-T-088-S-00951
2015-07-13-T-088,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As for local disamenities which may arise from this system, the National Environment Agency's licensing framework for waste collectors contains regulations, such as on collection timings, which minimise disruption to residents and ensure a satisfactory standard of waste collection.",2,952,2015-07-13-T-088-S-00952
2015-07-13-T-088,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"However, some precincts have unique characteristics which may favour centralised waste collection.

2015-07-13-T-089,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider allowing private property owners to buy a resale HDB flat given the current situation in the resale market.,1,954,2015-07-13-T-089-S-00954
2015-07-13-T-089,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Private residential property owners (PPOs) are allowed to buy a resale HDB flat, but they are required to dispose of their private property within six months from the date of the resale flat purchase. This is to reinforce the principle that HDB flats are for long-term owner-occupation. This is also to dampen the demand for resale flats from buyers with no urgent need of housing.",1,955,2015-07-13-T-089-S-00955
2015-07-13-T-090,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for National Development how much Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) funding has been extended to each Town Council through their respective Citizens' Consultative Committee (CCC) from 7 May 2011.,1,956,2015-07-13-T-090-S-00956

2015-07-13-T-092,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,Rooftop gardens at HDB multi-storey car parks (MSCP) provide greenery and recreational space for residents.

NEWater and desalinated water, which are weather-resilient sources, were introduced to supplement our local catchment and imported water sources. Today, these weather-resilient sources are able to provide 55% of Singapore’s water demand and will provide a safety margin during dry periods. Thus, despite experiencing the longest dry spell in 149 years in 2014, as well as the dry weather earlier this year, we did not have to put in place mandatory water restriction measures or water rationing.",1,968,2015-07-13-T-093-S-00968

2015-07-13-T-096,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"MEWR and NEA are supportive of the efforts taken by various retailers and supermarkets to reduce the excessive use of plastic bags. For example, since 2007, NTUC’s FairPrice Green Rewards scheme has provided a 10-cent rebate for customers who bring their own bags and spend a minimum of $10. In 2014, more than nine million plastic bags were saved through this scheme. Another example is that of IKEA Singapore, which started charging for disposal plastic bags in 2007 and stopped providing them altogether in 2013. We also encourage households to re-use their plastic bags, such as in using them to bag their refuse to ensure good public hygiene.",6,987,2015-07-13-T-096-S-00987

2015-07-13-T-098,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Speculative invoicing is a term commonly used in the context of copyright infringement on the Internet to refer to the practice where rights-holders send letters of demand to a large number of account holders who are alleged to be copyright infringers. The letter will typically indicate the sender’s willingness to settle the matter upon the recipient paying a sum of money, and imply that otherwise, legal action may be commenced.",1,993,2015-07-13-T-098-S-00993
2015-07-13-T-098,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The act of sending a letter of demand is not wrongful by itself, unless it contravenes a lawyer's professional obligations. Letters of demand containing an offer to settle or stating a willingness to settle are common as they allow parties to resolve disputes amicably and quickly. Lawyers who send letters of demand are bound by professional obligations to behave in an ethical manner. The Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules state that a lawyer shall not demand anything other than that recoverable by due process of law and the Law Society's Practice Directions prohibit lawyers from threatening criminal proceedings to coerce other parties, or from using offensive or acrimonious language. Any person who believes that a lawyer is guilty of professional misconduct can lodge a complaint with the Law Society.",2,994,2015-07-13-T-098-S-00994

2015-07-13-T-099,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"So far, heat-induced illnesses do not seem to be a major problem in Singapore. The number of hospital admissions for heat-induced illness has decreased over the years. This could be due to the preventive measures taken by the population against heat exposure. Currently, the risk of heat-induced illnesses is highest among those who are physically active outdoors. Few elderly are hospitalised for heat-induced illnesses.",3,1000,2015-07-13-T-099-S-01000

Details of enforcement action taken are now published directly under the PEI’s profile page on CPE’s website, in addition to the separate section on enforcement actions.
