2018-01-10-T-001-S-00001,2018-01-10-T-001,1,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Deputy Speaker, may I seek your consent and the general assent of Members present to move that Question Time at this day's sitting be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No 22(1) so as to enable Questions for Oral Answer to be taken till 3.00 pm today."
2018-01-10-T-001-S-00002,2018-01-10-T-001,2,Deputy Speaker,I give my consent. Does the Leader of the House have the general assent of hon Member to so move?
2018-01-10-T-001-S-00003,2018-01-10-T-001,3,Deputy Speaker,[(proc text) Hon Members indicated assent. (proc text)]
2018-01-10-T-001-S-00004,2018-01-10-T-001,4,Deputy Speaker,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2018-01-10-T-001-S-00005,2018-01-10-T-001,5,Deputy Speaker,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That notwithstanding Standing Order 22(1), Questions for Oral Answer set down on the Order Paper for today be taken till 3.00 pm at this day's sitting."" (proc text)]"
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00006,2018-01-10-T-002,6,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) in respect of the collision at Joo Koon station on 15 November 2017, what were the control options available to the driver of the second train to stop the train before it collided into the rear of the first train; and (b) what are the usual control options available to drivers of trains on North-South and East-West Lines for manual or emergency braking."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00007,2018-01-10-T-002,7,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) before the collision at Joo Koon station on 15 November 2017, whether the operations control centre and the driver of the second train were aware that the protective bubbles of the first train had malfunctioned; (b) if so, whether there were other options that could have been taken to ensure that the second train remained stationary; and (c) whether there was any previous occasion when a train had continued to operate when its protective bubbles had malfunctioned."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00008,2018-01-10-T-002,8,Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, may I take Question Nos 1 and 2 together, please."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00009,2018-01-10-T-002,9,Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00010,2018-01-10-T-002,10,Khaw Boon Wan,"The cause of the collision was a software logic issue with the new signalling system. As a result, the first train at Joo Koon station was operating without a protective bubble that ensures safe distances between trains."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00011,2018-01-10-T-002,11,Khaw Boon Wan,"Subsequent tests and re-enactments confirmed that the failure conditions must occur in a specific sequence for the protective bubble to be deactivated. Thales, the supplier of the system, had not anticipated such a scenario. This was an isolated case with no precedent, even for Thales. The Operations Control Centre staff and the train captains did not know that the protective bubble could be deactivated. Had they been aware of this, the train captain on the second train could have switched from Automatic to Restricted Manual Mode to drive the train manually or, as a last resort, engaged the emergency stop button to keep the train from moving."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00012,2018-01-10-T-002,12,Khaw Boon Wan,"All North-South and East-West Line trains, including those involved in the collision at Joo Koon station, are equipped with an emergency stop button for the train captain to apply the brakes manually. Based on train logs, the train captain in the second train was unable to engage these emergency brakes in time to avert a collision."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00013,2018-01-10-T-002,13,Khaw Boon Wan,"Thales has since rectified the system to address the failure condition which led to the collision. In addition, Thales is setting up a simulation facility, a simulator, in Singapore to strengthen the testing process. The facility will enable LTA and SMRT to perform additional simulation tests in a controlled setting which is tailored to our local environment and the infrastructural conditions of our rail network before deploying on our train services."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00014,2018-01-10-T-002,14,Khaw Boon Wan,"As an added precautionary measure, we decided to separate the operations on the Tuas West Extension from the rest of the East-West Line. The separation will continue until the rest of the East-West Line has fully transitioned to the new signalling system. Meanwhile, we are speeding up the re-signalling project, and the extended engineering hours on the MRT early closures and late openings will enable us to complete this transition by the middle of this year."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00015,2018-01-10-T-002,15,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I thank the Minister for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. One, I understand from media reports and correct me if I am wrong here, that because of the failure conditions, the bubbles did not take place. I think there was a fixed distance of about 36 m between the first and second trains. I just heard from the Minister that the driver apparently applied the emergency brakes or did he apply the brakes, and they did not work. Is my understanding correct? So, can I just clarify with the Minister on this point, whether or not the driver applied the emergency brakes or the automatic brakes to be used in emergency circumstances like what is available on the East-West and North-South Lines? If that is the case, subject to the Minister's answer, will LTA look into the condition of why the brakes did not come into effect, despite there being a braking distance of 36 m?"
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00016,2018-01-10-T-002,16,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"My second question is, in light of what has just happened, which I agree could be quite unique, but nevertheless, for safety purposes, will SMRT be required to review its SOPs in contingency situations like what we saw at Joo Koon, so that the OCC or the driver will be alerted to and will be required to apply the brakes when trains start to move in unforeseeable circumstances in order to prevent collisions from happening?"
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00017,2018-01-10-T-002,17,Khaw Boon Wan,"I thank the Member. As I had explained, this situation was never anticipated by Thales themselves. I did engineering but that was many years ago. One of my favourite subjects was computer programming. I enjoy writing software."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00018,2018-01-10-T-002,18,Khaw Boon Wan,"Of course, many things have happened during the last 40-odd years. Computer languages have improved and there are many more new languages and more efficiency tools. But the basic principle of writing computer programme, I think, has not changed. Which is you start off by anticipating ""what ifs"", all kinds of possible scenarios and therefore, you compose logic, diagrams and decision trees before you start coding and converting each of the steps into a programme, so that the computer knows what to do. A good computer programme is one that robustly and comprehensively thought of all possibilities so that computers or the robot would know how to react."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00019,2018-01-10-T-002,19,Khaw Boon Wan,"Unfortunately, in this instance, Thales had not anticipated such a possibility and, therefore, the assumption, both by Thales and the operator – the operators were trained by Thales – was that the deactivating of the bubble could not have happened. Had we known, as I had explained in my answer, the driver would have converted it into manual mode, instead of leaving the train to be run by the computer. If it was in manual mode, there would have been an adequate reaction time."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00020,2018-01-10-T-002,20,Khaw Boon Wan,"In hindsight, one can blame the captain, but I do not. Because he was mentally not prepared and never trained to react under that kind of scenario. Whatever it is, the flaw, Thales has accepted full responsibility and has apologised, and the flaw has been rectified. But as an added precaution, I took a decision  let us not complicate our lives both for the software programmer as well as the operator; just separate the two systems."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00021,2018-01-10-T-002,21,Khaw Boon Wan,"If I may just describe a little, though highly simplified, what kind of complications we have introduced prior to this incident. East-West Line is a complete line but we were doing the most complicated by requiring the signalling system to run on most part of the Line, on the old system, and then at some point, switch to a new system. Therefore, the trains were being operated by two signalling systems – the old system and the new system. They were required to know when to do what."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00022,2018-01-10-T-002,22,Khaw Boon Wan,"So, based on the location at the track, the new signalling system could be on ""passive"" mode or ""active"" mode. For the stretch of the East-West Line which is still on the old signalling system, the system is on passive mode. It is collecting and reporting information but not acting. But after clearing a particular station, when it enters the Tuas West Extension, it switched into active mode. These are the complications we introduced."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00023,2018-01-10-T-002,23,Khaw Boon Wan,"For the deactivation of the bubble to take place, several things must happen. Unfortunately, on that day, all three things happened. First, the train must have developed some problem. Trains carry a lot of computers and the computers' signalling equipment have to communicate with the track-side equipment of the new system. For that particular train that day, it was not able to communicate. When it is not able to communicate, the system, as a safety procedure, activate this bubble so that the trains would comply with the safety distances between trains. That was the first step and in this case, it happened."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00024,2018-01-10-T-002,24,Khaw Boon Wan,"Secondly, this train must pass a stretch of track which is still on the old signalling system and the track-side equipment had not yet been configured to the new train system. Unfortunately, this was the sort of scenario where the programmer had not anticipated. When it occurred, the bubble got deactivated. When it was deactivated, well, the rest is history."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00025,2018-01-10-T-002,25,Khaw Boon Wan,"Now, the flaw has been rectified and corrected. In fact, we could have run this complicated, double system on the East-West Line, plus the Tuas West Extension, but I decided ""no"". Let us separate the two stretches; we run shuttle buses and the service is not too highly compromised and this way, we ensure maximum safety for our commuters."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00026,2018-01-10-T-002,26,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I thank the Minister. I understand the explanation about the problem which is created by the software logic issue. But my two questions today focused on the driver's access to the braking system of the train. This is important because whether it is a software logic issue that creates any situation or any other kind of glitch, software or otherwise, I would like to ask the Minister, whether in that accident or in ordinary circumstances, whether the train is operating on automatic mode or controlled manual mode, what is the access the driver or the OCC has to apply emergency braking, and what would be that expected reaction time?"
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00027,2018-01-10-T-002,27,Khaw Boon Wan,"I would not know enough to know what sort of reaction time is reasonable. But based on the logs and review by the experts, they felt that the train operator was just not able to react in time. Because the driver might have to switch from the automatic to manual mode, and from the manual mode, he could have activated the emergency button."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00028,2018-01-10-T-002,28,Khaw Boon Wan,"On hindsight, it is easy to say, ""Why did you not do this and why did you not do that?"""
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00029,2018-01-10-T-002,29,Khaw Boon Wan,"A few months ago, I had a friend, a corporate lawyer, who called me frantically. He is a very safe, responsible driver. He was driving in Singapore. As he approached a pedestrian crossing, he was quite clear that there was nobody. He slowed down but he did not stop. We do not normally stop in front of the pedestrian crossing unless we know that there is a pedestrian. But the next second, he saw somebody on an e-scooter flung onto his windscreen. The rider must have been speeding right through. But that was when my friend stopped, came down, assisted and called the ambulance. The rider was admitted to the hospital."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00030,2018-01-10-T-002,30,Khaw Boon Wan,"A few days later, he was informed by the hospital that the victim died. My friend was totally traumatised. He knew he would be charged, he expected to be punished but he was very worried that he would be jailed. Being a lawyer, he checked up the law and asked me for advice. I am not a lawyer; I cannot advise him much. But as a layman, I wonder  when you do not have sufficient reaction time, are you responsible? To what extent are you responsible?"
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00031,2018-01-10-T-002,31,Khaw Boon Wan,"I asked him to get a lawyer and a proper forensic to see whether it could ascertain the speed of the e-scooter. I think the Joo Koon situation is something like this, too. At that moment, was the train driver able to respond in time? Thirty-six metres, yes, it is not a short distance, but the speed was 18 km per hour."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00032,2018-01-10-T-002,32,Deputy Speaker,I think we move on to the next Parliamentary Question.
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00033,2018-01-10-T-002,33,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,I have just one more clarification.
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00034,2018-01-10-T-002,34,Deputy Speaker,"Alright, I will just allow the last question."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00035,2018-01-10-T-002,35,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I appreciate that."
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00036,2018-01-10-T-002,36,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I thank the Minister for his answer. Just one clarification on what he just said. Perhaps the Minister could clarify to the public  when a train is on automatic mode, is each driver required to switch to control manual mode, before he can apply the brakes, or he has access to emergency brakes, even in automatic mode?"
2018-01-10-T-002-S-00037,2018-01-10-T-002,37,Khaw Boon Wan,"I think it would depend on the design. I am not perfectly sure of the answer, but I will check. Let me check."
2018-01-10-T-003-S-00038,2018-01-10-T-003,38,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry monitors the number of young children injured through accidental burns each year; and (b) what measures are being taken to increase awareness among parents and caregivers of burn risks and how to prevent burns in the home.
2018-01-10-T-003-S-00039,2018-01-10-T-003,39,Amrin Amin,"The MOH monitors the number of young children with burn injuries through the National Trauma Registry. The incidence of notified cases of burns in children below the age of 16 years between 2011 and 2015, averaged 70 cases per 100,000 population. This adds to 580 cases per year, on average. Approximately half of the cases occurred among children under three years old and more than three-quarters of the cases occurred at home. Of the cases occurring at home, half happened in the kitchens."
2018-01-10-T-003-S-00040,2018-01-10-T-003,40,Amrin Amin,"Information on burns prevention are included in the child safety checklist in the HPB's Child Health Booklet, which is issued to every child born in Singapore. In addition, burns prevention and first aid tips for care-givers are available at HPB’s Health Hub."
2018-01-10-T-003-S-00041,2018-01-10-T-003,41,Amrin Amin,"Hospitals also conduct community education programmes to raise awareness of burns and scalds, which include talks to childcare teachers on child safety, information pamphlets to parents, as well as educational videos which are hosted on their websites and played at hospital clinics."
2018-01-10-T-003-S-00042,2018-01-10-T-003,42,Amrin Amin,"Parents and care-givers play an important role, and they have to take the necessary precautions to protect their children from burns. Most critically, parents should avoid allowing young children in kitchens where the risk of getting burns or scalds are high, due to the presence of hot objects."
2018-01-10-T-003-S-00043,2018-01-10-T-003,43,Tan Wu Meng,"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his answer. I was just wondering to what extent does HPB's advice to parents of young children, include the specific reference to burns prevention at home?"
2018-01-10-T-003-S-00044,2018-01-10-T-003,44,Amrin Amin,"The materials are very comprehensive in the Health Booklets Children Safety Checklist. It provides guidelines and it also includes advice on preparing water for child's bath, as well as ensuring that hot drinks are out of reach of children, and ensuring that electrical outlets are not within children's reach."
2018-01-10-T-003-S-00045,2018-01-10-T-003,45,Amrin Amin,"In short, the answer to the Member's question is, yes, it is very focused on places where such burn incidents happen, and that includes kitchen, living room and other places."
2018-01-10-T-003-S-00046,2018-01-10-T-003,46,Chia Shi-Lu,"I am not sure whether there is data on this. But of those cases that the Parliamentary Secretary cited, does he have any data on how many are non-accidental in nature? That means is it related to abuse or suspected abuse?"
2018-01-10-T-004-S-00047,2018-01-10-T-004,47,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he can provide an update on the review of Singapore's laws deterring online child pornography and what will be done to restrict, deter and punish access to and the hosting of child pornography websites in Singapore."
2018-01-10-T-004-S-00048,2018-01-10-T-004,48,K Shanmugam,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Internet content providers (ICPs) include web-hosting services, and they are all class-licensed under the Broadcasting Act. So, they are required to comply with the Internet Code of Practice and ensure that prohibited material, such as child sexual abuse content, is not hosted on their websites."
2018-01-10-T-004-S-00049,2018-01-10-T-004,49,K Shanmugam,"If child sexual abuse websites are verified to be hosted in Singapore, the IMDA can  (i) direct the ICPs to take down the content; (ii) issue directions to the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block access to the websites; and (iii) suspend or cancel the class licences of the ICPs."
2018-01-10-T-004-S-00050,2018-01-10-T-004,50,K Shanmugam,"Where there is child sexual abuse content, the Police will also investigate, as appropriate. I mentioned yesterday that there is a major review of the Penal Code. We are looking at whether there should be dedicated laws dealing with activities related to child pornography – from the making of pornographic material involving children, to possession and distribution of such material, and also whether such laws should carry higher penalties to send a stronger deterrent message. Those review proposals will be tabled for public consultation later this year."
2018-01-10-T-004-S-00051,2018-01-10-T-004,51,Christopher de Souza,"I thank the Minister for his reply. I would like to ask the Minister, in light of the highly heinous nature of this crime of child pornography, would the Ministry prioritise the deterrence against the crimes in its review of any relevant penal laws? And if the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) can form any feedback mechanism or support the Ministry in its work, we would be very happy to work with the Ministry in this review."
2018-01-10-T-004-S-00052,2018-01-10-T-004,52,K Shanmugam,I will ask my Ministries to liaise with the GPC. Thank you.
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00053,2018-01-10-T-005,53,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs how did the two brands of aluminium composite panel used as external cladding that were recently found to pose potential fire risk come to possess Class ""0"" certificates and how did the SCDF discover that they could pose fire risks."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00054,2018-01-10-T-005,54,K Shanmugam,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I think on 24 August 2017, we announced the facts relating to the non-compliant Alubond cladding. I need to know from the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament, he said there were two brands of aluminium composite panel, is he referring to the Bolliya and Bolli-Core FR?"
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00055,2018-01-10-T-005,55,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Yes.
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00056,2018-01-10-T-005,56,K Shanmugam,"Thank you. Sir, after we issued our statement, we advised our industry partners to approach SCDF if they had reason to suspect that the cladding used for their building projects were in any way not compliant with Fire Code requirements. Industry partners meaning building owners, qualified persons (QPs) and so on."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00057,2018-01-10-T-005,57,K Shanmugam,"A building owner proactively submitted samples of two models of composite panel that were used in its building project for tests. They submitted it for tests – Bolliya and Bolli-Core FR. Those two models had been issued Certificates of Conformity (CoCs) by local certification bodies, which had certified them to be compliant with Fire Code requirements for use as cladding. The tests, however, found the samples to be non-compliant. The building owner then informed the SCDF about the matter."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00058,2018-01-10-T-005,58,K Shanmugam,"SCDF had made a further announcement on 8 December 2017. It has identified six other buildings that could have used these two models of composite panel, and investigations on how this came about are still on-going."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00059,2018-01-10-T-005,59,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,I thank the Minister. A few supplementary questions. I would like to ask the Minister  whether the integrity of the certification system has been compromised; when the review of the system to tighten the processes would be completed; and what remedial steps would be taken in the meantime to ensure public safety? And this is referring to the certification system.
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00060,2018-01-10-T-005,60,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Another set of questions is  whether SCDF will be extending the retesting to all brands of cladding? And if so, when will this be completed?"
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00061,2018-01-10-T-005,61,K Shanmugam,"May I have the last question again, please?"
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00062,2018-01-10-T-005,62,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Whether SCDF will be extending the retesting to all brands of cladding? And if so, when will this be completed?"
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00063,2018-01-10-T-005,63,K Shanmugam,"On whether the integrity of certification systems been compromised, I think that will be too quick a conclusion. Let me explain why."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00064,2018-01-10-T-005,64,K Shanmugam,"I said investigations are on-going. For example, Alubond. Again, I need to be careful about what I say because the matter is under, not just SCDF investigations, but also Police investigations. SCDF has issued a public statement as to how it believes non-compliant panels came to be put up on the structures. If we go back to MHA's public statement, there was one type of cladding which complied with the certification requirements, another that could not be used on the façade. SCDF believes they had been mixed up in the warehouse."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00065,2018-01-10-T-005,65,K Shanmugam,"So, it is not a question of integrity of the testing system. But if you had asked me to speculate in August as to how this came about, I think it would have been difficult for me to have speculated that it is because there was a mixture in the warehouse. One has got to be careful about jumping to conclusions, at this point, as to whether the entire certification system has been compromised. The certification system relies on identifying international institutions of repute, which are recognised worldwide, and also institutions in Singapore, which can either rely on those certificates and make sure that the testing has been done, or test themselves."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00066,2018-01-10-T-005,66,K Shanmugam,"At this stage, we have no evidence, no reason to suspect that any of them has been suborned. But I think we will obviously be investigating all possibilities, including whether there could be manufacturing defects, and differences between samples and actual material."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00067,2018-01-10-T-005,67,K Shanmugam,"I have answered the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament previously, sampling is the method worldwide. The way of testing is to burn the material. And by definition, if you want to do a 100% testing, there will be no material left. So, you have to do sample testing."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00068,2018-01-10-T-005,68,K Shanmugam,"As to how this will be reviewed in the context of public safety – in all the things that we do, I think that is front and centre. Everything else has got to work around public safety, which is why, for example, let us take this issue of cladding. In contrast with what happened at Grenfell Tower, Cladding is one aspect. How does it compromise public safety depends on a variety of factors."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00069,2018-01-10-T-005,69,K Shanmugam,"For example, is the entire building clad with this material? If we say 5% of the building façade is clad with this material, obviously, the risk is very different from 100% cladding. Some of the buildings identified have less than 5%, less than 8%. So, that is one factor – how much of the building has been clad with such a cladding?"
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00070,2018-01-10-T-005,70,K Shanmugam,"Second, what sort of fire sprinkler system is there? The Member would know the contrast with Grenfell Tower again. In Singapore, the requirements for, for example, the fire escape routes are very stringent, and they have to be fire protected as well. What is the height of the building? How much of the building is occupied?"
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00071,2018-01-10-T-005,71,K Shanmugam,"These are composite factors and then there are other aspects of safety like how much training do the staff have in commercial buildings. What sort of fire drills were done? So, SCDF, in respect of these buildings, has gone down to look at all these aspects together and worked with the management, while they are taking down the cladding. Because even for buildings with 5% or 8% of cladding, we require them to take down, and at the same time, we are making sure that these other, what I call the human safety factors, are being practised. Fire safety is absolutely important, which is why SCDF makes that assessment first, while the testing is going on, because testing takes some time. But they make an assessment as to whether the building is safe or not safe and announce it publicly."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00072,2018-01-10-T-005,72,K Shanmugam,"Where there is no unrestricted public access to the buildings, SCDF requires the building owners to inform all their tenants of the nature of the cladding and the issues surrounding it, so that the tenants can make a considered assessment. Even though we say it is safe, we believe it is safe, but we think the tenants ought to know. Where there is unrestricted public access, we think that should be made public and it is up on the SCDF's website."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00073,2018-01-10-T-005,73,K Shanmugam,"That is the approach that is taken, and regardless of whether it is 5%, 8%, 10% or 50% cladding, we require them to take it down. For example, on Alubond, I think 17 have taken down, 18 are in the process of taking down. In respect of Bolliya and Bolli-Core, I think three have taken down. The other four are in the process of taking down. Another building, a church, has been identified more recently. We are in the process of talking to them. So, all of them are in the process of being taken down."
2018-01-10-T-005-S-00074,2018-01-10-T-005,74,K Shanmugam,"In respect of other brands of cladding, what is doable has been done, in the sense that we have contacted industry partners, we have required QPs to give us returns to explain and relook at their buildings, make second round of checks. We have identified these brands as being problematic, and they better check, which is how it, for example, Bolliya and Bolli-Core came up. We have also asked for the annual audits to be expedited and this should cover all the others."
2018-01-10-T-006-S-00075,2018-01-10-T-006,75,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Law whether he will consider a provision in the Penal Code or the Children and Young Persons Act to enhance the discretionary power of the courts to administer harsher punishments for child abuse offenders.
2018-01-10-T-006-S-00076,2018-01-10-T-006,76,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Law, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Social and Family Development and other agencies have been working together over the past year to review the laws relating to child abuse, with a view to enhancing protection for children. This includes a review of the adequacy of penalties for the entire spectrum of child abuse offences. We will announce more details when the review is completed."
2018-01-10-T-006-S-00077,2018-01-10-T-006,77,Christopher de Souza,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for her reply. There was a recent case of the Public Prosecutor against BDB, where the court dealt with grievous hurt and said that for vulnerable victims, an equivalent of section 73, which deals with foreign domestic workers, would be useful to it to enhance its sentencing ability. So, would the Ministry consider something like that?"
2018-01-10-T-006-S-00078,2018-01-10-T-006,78,Indranee Rajah,The Ministry has taken note of the suggestion by the Court of Appeal and we will consider this as part of the broader review for legislation.
2018-01-10-T-007-S-00079,2018-01-10-T-007,79,Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is the cost of the 320 sensors installed in Singapore's potable water supply pipelines to detect water leakages from the pipelines.
2018-01-10-T-007-S-00080,2018-01-10-T-007,80,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, PUB collaborated with the Centre for Environmental Sensing and Modelling under the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) to develop the sensor network system for real-time monitoring of our water supply distribution network. The system enables PUB to monitor relevant hydraulic and water quality parameters, through real-time alerts on irregular data patterns in water pressure, flow and water quality which may potentially affect supply to customers. The data analytics and simulation tools developed as part of the system are used to help plan operations and minimise water supply disruption. PUB will continue to improve the reliability and coverage of the sensor network system."
2018-01-10-T-007-S-00081,2018-01-10-T-007,81,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Leak detection is one function of the system. Nevertheless, the sensor network system is just one component of PUB's leak management programme. PUB conducts physical checks of its pipelines at least once a year and also deploys portable acoustic leak noise data loggers to aid leak detection. Together with our on-going pipeline replacement programme, this results in Singapore experiencing only about six leaks per 100 km of pipes per year, which is among the lowest incidence in the world."
2018-01-10-T-007-S-00082,2018-01-10-T-007,82,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The cost of developing the entire sensor network system, including the 320 sensor stations and the data analytics software, is around $9 million. PUB envisages that the cost of further expanding the sensor network to more parts of Singapore will be lowered as sensing technology improves, and as the initial investment in software development is spread over a larger base of sensors."
2018-01-10-T-007-S-00083,2018-01-10-T-007,83,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"PUB will continue to work closely with the industry to develop and improve sensing capabilities and leak detection technologies. Concurrently, PUB is actively looking at new ideas and innovations that will help minimise water losses due to leaks and ensure 24/7 supply of good water to customers."
2018-01-10-T-007-S-00084,2018-01-10-T-007,84,Seah Kian Peng,Just a short supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. Does one of the possible solutions of the leak management and technological programme include going into possible reduction of evaporation from reservoirs? Is that one of the measures being undertaken?
2018-01-10-T-007-S-00085,2018-01-10-T-007,85,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"This water sensor network system, as I have said, fulfils a number of functions. Leak detection is just one of the functions of the sensor network system. The sensor network system helps PUB in terms of monitoring the performance of its water distribution network by monitoring network pressure, water quality and water flow, and so on. In fact, it is necessary and it is important for the data obtained from this to be in real-time because it helps PUB in terms of planning for its operation as well as identifying and responding to anomalies and to minimise water supply disruption. For instance, when there is a water leak incident and the PUB field crew is sent to respond to the incident, they can use the sensor data as well as the software simulation tools to plan for their operations to identify potential risks, and then to be able to take appropriate actions in order to isolate and carry out repair works whilst monitoring this operation as well as the water quality as they are undertaking the repairs. This, again, helps to minimise the water disruption incidence."
2018-01-10-T-007-S-00086,2018-01-10-T-007,86,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to the other areas where PUB continues to look at how it can minimise water losses, due to leaks as well as other causes, one of the areas would be evaporation loss, say, from the reservoirs. My understanding is that PUB has looked into this and some of the products available − for instance, to apply a product to the water surface of the reservoirs to reduce water loss. But in undertaking an evaluation on the cost effectiveness, my understanding is that it is very expensive. It requires multiple applications because the material will degrade under sunlight. So, it has not been taken up, but they will continue to look at different areas in order to be able to minimise water losses as well as to supply good quality water 24/7 to its customers."
2018-01-10-T-007-S-00087,2018-01-10-T-007,87,Azmoon Ahmad,I just have one supplementary question to the Senior Minister of State. How much improvement has been made before and after the implementation of the new technology for the leak detection? Can she share this information?
2018-01-10-T-007-S-00088,2018-01-10-T-007,88,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have said, for this sensor network system, leak detection is only one of its functions. A main function of this sensor network system is to monitor the performance of the water distribution network in real-time and to help PUB plan its operations. PUB has found that the sensor network system has been able to enhance its operations, and substantially reduced incidents like valve operations that can lead to a disruption in water supply. Therefore, it is going to expand the deployment of this sensor network system to cover other parts of the network, which would be the newly laid pipelines as well as pipelines where there is limited coverage and in the next two to three years to also cover the NEWater and industrial water pipelines."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00089,2018-01-10-T-008,89,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is the number of water pipe leaks each year for the past 10 years.
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00090,2018-01-10-T-008,90,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, PUB operates a 5,500 km network of pipes to deliver water to 1.5 million customer accounts. Over the last seven years, Singapore has experienced about six leaks per 100 km of pipes per year. This is down from about 10 leaks per 100 km of pipes per year in 2003 and 2004, and as I have noted earlier, among the lowest incidence in the world."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00091,2018-01-10-T-008,91,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"PUB has a stringent pipe laying regime to ensure that pipelines are well designed and implemented. PUB also constantly looks out for improved methods and materials, for example, the use of more corrosion-resistant polyurethane coating."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00092,2018-01-10-T-008,92,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"However, despite the best design and implementation, leaks do occur mainly because of corrosion, uneven soil settlement or damage from construction work. Corrosion and soil settlement can impact all pipes, especially as they age."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00093,2018-01-10-T-008,93,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"PUB has a comprehensive leak detection process to pick up leaks as early as possible. PUB conducts physical checks of its entire pipe network at least once a year, or more frequently where necessary. Portable acoustic leak noise data loggers are used to aid leak detection. Beyond detecting leaks, PUB has a Pipe Renewal Programme to pro-actively replace older pipes or pipes which are more prone to leaks due to local conditions. The renewal rate has increased from 20 km per year in 2016 to 30 km per year in 2017 and will reach 50 km per year in 2018."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00094,2018-01-10-T-008,94,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For leaks due to construction damage, PUB takes tough action against errant parties, which could include the issue of a stop work notice to cease construction activities immediately and the imposition of financial penalties if pipes are damaged. Regulations were strengthened in 2017 to require companies to notify or seek approval from PUB before undertaking construction activities that may affect the pipe network and to ensure appropriate protection measures."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00095,2018-01-10-T-008,95,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"When leaks occur, PUB seeks to fix them quickly. Most instances are resolved within a few hours. Occasionally, due to the need to ensure that water supply to residents is not disrupted when leaking pipelines are isolated from the rest of the network, more time is required to switch residents over to an alternative supply pipeline before the affected pipeline can be shut off."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00096,2018-01-10-T-008,96,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Water is precious and everybody needs to do his or her part to conserve it. I would like to assure Members and Singaporeans that PUB engineers will continue to do their best to maintain Singapore's water supply network and ensure good water supply to customers round the clock.
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00097,2018-01-10-T-008,97,Deputy Speaker,Does the Member still have supplementary questions after such a long reply?
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00098,2018-01-10-T-008,98,Leon Perera,"Just a few, Mr Deputy Speaker."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00099,2018-01-10-T-008,99,Deputy Speaker,"Okay, Mr Perera."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00100,2018-01-10-T-008,100,Leon Perera,Thank you. I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for her comprehensive reply. Just a few supplementary questions.
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00101,2018-01-10-T-008,101,Leon Perera,"Firstly, will the Senior Minister of State be able to share the figure for the number of leaks each year for the last seven years? I believe the Senior Minister of State said, on average, it is six leaks per 100 km over the last seven years. But what I am trying to get at is has the number been increasing, decreasing or remaining more or less the same? So, can that information be shared? That is the first one."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00102,2018-01-10-T-008,102,Leon Perera,"The second one is  will the PUB consider publishing this data on an annual basis if that is not being done right now? I say that also in the context of the statement that we have one of the best rates of water leakage in the world, which is commendable. I presume that that is using data that is published from other countries. So, presumably, other countries do publish this data. So, if that is not being done, will that data on the number of leaks per year be published on a regular basis?"
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00103,2018-01-10-T-008,103,Leon Perera,"My third and last supplementary question  is the PUB working or moving beyond just leak detection and response towards proactive leak anticipation or prediction? I believe that there are research projects and there are initiatives in other parts of the world – I am not sure if that is being done in Singapore – where models are constructed using data to predict and anticipate where a fault or a leak is likely to occur, so that preventive action can be taken before the leak actually occurs. I know in Sydney, this has been going on for some time. The Water Research Foundation believes that through failure prediction —"
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00104,2018-01-10-T-008,104,Deputy Speaker,"Mr Leon, can you round up your question?"
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00105,2018-01-10-T-008,105,Leon Perera,"Yes. So, through the creation of software models that take into account different factors we can anticipate that. So, is that being done or can that be considered to be done? Thank you."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00106,2018-01-10-T-008,106,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to the first set of questions about the trend in the incidence rate of the leaks, I would say that, generally, it has been hovering around there for the last seven years. In fact, for 2017, we anticipated that the incidence rate will be about six leaks per 100 km. So, that has been the general trend in the numbers. There has been no discernible uptrend in the leak incidence rates."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00107,2018-01-10-T-008,107,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to publication, we will take the Member's suggestions on board. But from time to time, we do actually report and publish such rates in any case."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00108,2018-01-10-T-008,108,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For the other countries, we also get information from published literature but I am not sure if everyone publishes it on an annual basis or on a regular basis. We will have to check."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00109,2018-01-10-T-008,109,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have said, we have one of the lowest incidence in the world. Just to give the Member an example from data that we have got  Berlin as well as Munich in Germany, it is about seven leaks over 100 km. In UK's eastern region, it is about 13 leaks per 100 km. In Sydney, Australia, it is 28 leaks per 100 km. These are some of the data that we have."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00110,2018-01-10-T-008,110,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to proactively identifying leaks, as I have said, we have a comprehensive leak management programme. This also includes proactively trying to prevent leaks from happening. So, our annual inspection of 5,500 km of water pipeline network that we have, it is a proactive or pre-emptive measure because we also utilise our portable acoustic leak noise data loggers to try and identify these leaks before they surface, through visual inspection as well as using these tools. In fact, in more hotspot areas where leaks may occur because of soil condition and all that, we inspect it even more than once – maybe up to two to three times a year."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00111,2018-01-10-T-008,111,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In addition, proactively, we also have a pipe renewal system. The average age of our pipe network is about 25 years, which is actually well within the useful lifespan of these pipelines. We have been able to do this because since the 1980s, we have an on-going pipe renewal programme and we have been increasing the length of pipe that we replace each year. We also do that with better materials, more corrosion-resistant materials. We are constantly looking at improved methods and technologies to prevent or reduce leak incidence rates."
2018-01-10-T-008-S-00112,2018-01-10-T-008,112,Amy Khor Lean Suan,
2018-01-10-T-009-S-00113,2018-01-10-T-009,113,Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry is exploring options for burials by sea after death.
2018-01-10-T-009-S-00114,2018-01-10-T-009,114,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"<span style=""background-color  transparent; color  rgb(0, 0, 0);"">  </span>"
2018-01-10-T-009-S-00115,2018-01-10-T-009,115,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Apart from the scattering of cremated remains at sea, NEA is studying the feasibility of designating sites for the scattering of cremated remains on land. This will expand the available options for the placement of cremated remains. The NEA does not have plans to introduce burials at sea."
2018-01-10-T-009-S-00116,2018-01-10-T-009,116,Low Thia Khiang,
2018-01-10-T-009-S-00117,2018-01-10-T-009,117,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"There has been some public interest in ash scattering on land. Inland ash scattering is done in countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and Korea. We are studying the inland ash scattering concept and we are planning to offer this option of inland ash scattering at designated Government after-death facilities. We are consulting stakeholders, religious leaders as well as funeral parlour directors and so on, before we make an announcement later this year."
2018-01-10-T-009-S-00118,2018-01-10-T-009,118,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Just to clarify, it is not inland ash scattering options but inland ash scattering as another option for the placement of cremated remains."
2018-01-10-T-009-S-00119,2018-01-10-T-009,119,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek one clarification from the Senior Minister of State. Could the Senior Minister of State provide us with any data about whether the burial by sea or scattering of ashes by sea, has it become more popular in the last three to five years? Could the Senior Minister of State update us on that?"
2018-01-10-T-009-S-00120,2018-01-10-T-009,120,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I do not have the numbers but my understanding is that the numbers have been pretty constant. There is a designated site, about 1.5 nautical miles south of Pulau Semakau, provided by Maritime Port Authority for scattering of ashes at sea. So, just to clarify, when we talk about sea burials, we are talking about lowering the whole body into the sea. It is scattering of ashes at sea, which is allowed, but not sea burials."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00121,2018-01-10-T-010,121,Sylvia Lim,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what is the implementation roadmap and timeline for the full Open Electricity Market to all households islandwide.
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00122,2018-01-10-T-010,122,S Iswaran,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Open Electricity Market will commence in Jurong in April 2018 and will provide around 120,000 household and business accounts with the choice to buy electricity from a retailer with a price plan that best meets their needs. Those who prefer to continue buying electricity from the SP Group at the regulated tariff can also continue to do so."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00123,2018-01-10-T-010,123,S Iswaran,"This soft launch will allow the Energy Market Authority (EMA), the SP Group and electricity retailers to gather feedback and fine-tune their processes and backend systems before the Open Electricity Market is extended to the rest of Singapore in the second half of 2018."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00124,2018-01-10-T-010,124,Sylvia Lim,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have five supplementary questions for the Minister."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00125,2018-01-10-T-010,125,Sylvia Lim,"The first is we do understand that the pilot is in Jurong and the areas demarcated by postal districts are, I understand, for the postal codes starting from 60 to 64. So, I would like to ask for the rest of the island, whether the plan is to also have staggered commencement based on postal districts or is everybody going to go live at the same time for the rest of the people outside Jurong? That is the first question."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00126,2018-01-10-T-010,126,Sylvia Lim,"The second question is  I understand that there are about 26 licensed retailers of electricity. EMA had previously said that not all the retailers may be involved in the soft launch. So, I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any clarity now on whether certain specific retailers will be involved and whether this was their own choice or some vetting process by the EMA."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00127,2018-01-10-T-010,127,Sylvia Lim,"The third question is that we understand that EMA has committed to making switching over easy for consumers. I would like to have some elaboration on that. For example, I assume that consumers will have to change their meter boxes, so who is going to pay for that?"
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00128,2018-01-10-T-010,128,Sylvia Lim,"The fourth question is the Minister earlier said that we are having a pilot so that we can also study how it pans out. And if there are any feedback from the pilot, we can fine-tune for the rest of the island. So, I would like to ask whether the Government anticipate certain specific challenges from the pilot and whether there is a possibility that such challenges and fine-tuning may set the timeline back to beyond 2018 for the rest of the island?"
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00129,2018-01-10-T-010,129,Sylvia Lim,"Finally, the last question, we have noted that in other countries where there is a choice of electricity retailers, there may be information given to consumers about price comparisons. This may be done by the vendors themselves, for instance. In some of these countries, the regulator actually takes on the role of accrediting whether that information is accurate, to ensure that the consumers are not duped or given inaccurate information. An example is, I think, in the UK, where the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) does this sort of accreditation of information. So, I would like to ask the Minister whether the EMA, for example, is considering such an accreditation role, so that the consumers will have accurate information."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00130,2018-01-10-T-010,130,Deputy Speaker,"May I remind Members that supplementary questions may be put for the purposes of elucidating an oral answer. That is under the Standing Orders. So, could Members keep their supplementary questions short?"
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00131,2018-01-10-T-010,131,S Iswaran,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Member for her keen interest in this initiative. I was heeding your advice and that is why I kept my initial answer short to allow for supplementary questions. There is five, then we try and do justice to some of them, at least."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00132,2018-01-10-T-010,132,S Iswaran,"Pilot in Jurong, does that mean that we will have staggered implementation across the board. That is exactly why we are having a pilot because we need to understand. Notwithstanding the best of efforts and planning ahead, this is a massive exercise because it would involve over a million accounts, island-wide eventually, and that is why the idea of focusing it on one district or one area like Jurong, which in a way reflects the diversity or our household and business types. And that, I think, would enable the key entities – EMA, SP and the retailers – to also understand if there are any unanticipated challenges. It is precisely that they are unanticipated that I cannot tell the Member, in answer to her fourth question, do we anticipate any specific challenges. That is exactly why we are having the pilot to see if there is something unanticipated or something that is coming in from a different angle that we had not foreseen, and that is the purpose behind it."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00133,2018-01-10-T-010,133,S Iswaran,"So, the answer is if the pilot goes well, then I think we should be able to stick to the timeline and move towards the second half for complete implementation. If, however, there are reasons to review that, then we will do so, and we will convey that. The most important point here is the customer experience has to be a good one, and we want to avoid having undue disruption or concern amongst our consumers. So, that is our priority in this exercise."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00134,2018-01-10-T-010,134,S Iswaran,"Retailers, yes, there is a vetting process. EMA is now in the process of vetting and qualifying them. They are applying a fairly tight set of criteria. The reason is because unlike the current situation where the retailers are essentially dealing with businesses who are in the contestable market – I understand it is about 90,000 accounts – we are now moving towards households. And therefore, there is a need to make sure that there is an appropriate set of rules governing their conduct and capabilities that the retailers are able to meet."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00135,2018-01-10-T-010,135,S Iswaran,"So, this is a process that EMA is going through now in its engagement with the retailers. Before we start a pilot, it should be quite apparent how many and the identity of these retailers."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00136,2018-01-10-T-010,136,S Iswaran,"Switching is easy, but what about meters? Again, this is something that will be elaborated. But, essentially, the way the Open Electricity Market is designed − I do not want to get into a very technical discussion − it means you can do a switch without having to have what they call ""smart meters"" or ""advanced meters"". It is possible and, in fact, our system is designed to do that. It is based on a principle called ""load profiling"" instead. However, if you have advanced metering infrastructure, it allows for greater flexibility and the kind of plans."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00137,2018-01-10-T-010,137,S Iswaran,"This is something that EMA is studying. In the commercial market, in general, when they opted to become contestable and sign up with retailers, they have had some advanced meters installed. In the case of households, it depends because if their consumption levels are not very high, it may not merit that kind of investment. On the other hand, advanced meters do provide a lot more data which can be very useful for both policy and for system optimisation. So, we have to work out the trade-offs and design."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00138,2018-01-10-T-010,138,S Iswaran,"On price comparisons or accreditation, the intent is to provide as much information as possible to consumers so that they can make informed decisions, and one part of that, apart from the general communications and media plan, is to have an online portal that will provide comparisons across different types of plans so that customers can then access this and then make the decisions based on their needs and they are informed by what these different plans offer."
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00139,2018-01-10-T-010,139,Png Eng Huat,"Thank you, Sir, just a quick question. Currently, they are replacing the meter outside the houses. In Hougang, I saw them changing from a big one to a very small one. Are those smart meters? So, are they contestable-ready?"
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00140,2018-01-10-T-010,140,S Iswaran,I do know about the specific meter. Is the Member talking about household meters?
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00141,2018-01-10-T-010,141,Png Eng Huat,Yes.
2018-01-10-T-010-S-00142,2018-01-10-T-010,142,S Iswaran,"So, I do not know about the specific meters in Hougang. But I would that, in general, the replacement for households has not been about going towards smart meters. That is an entirely different exercise. Indeed, when you deploy smart meters, you also need to have some backend systems that are able to use them. Otherwise, it is effectively a dumb meter because it does not do much more than a conventional analogue meter. So, this is something that we are studying. I would say that, most likely, it is not, because there has been no plan to implement advanced metering for households."
2018-01-10-T-011-S-00143,2018-01-10-T-011,143,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) how are excavation works to repair telecom cables, water pipes, sewage pipes and other underground works coordinated across agencies such that excavation work is minimised and shared across agencies to the fullest extent possible; and (b) whether the Government will consider tracking and publishing the instances when excavation works are undertaken at the same area multiple times within the same six-month period as a measure of the effectiveness of such co-ordination."
2018-01-10-T-011-S-00144,2018-01-10-T-011,144,Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, before I reply to this Question, can I give a short reply to the earlier supplementary question by Mr Dennis Tan."
2018-01-10-T-011-S-00145,2018-01-10-T-011,145,Deputy Speaker,Yes.
2018-01-10-T-011-S-00146,2018-01-10-T-011,146,Khaw Boon Wan,Emergency brakes can be applied even when the train is in automatic mode.
2018-01-10-T-011-S-00147,2018-01-10-T-011,147,Khaw Boon Wan,"Road works are coordinated by the Road Opening Coordination Committee (ROCC) which comprises representatives from Government agencies, utility and telecoms service providers. It is chaired by LTA. As far as possible, the Committee schedules the work plans of the respective agencies to minimise inconvenience to commuters and residents. However, some works cannot be planned for, such as emergency repairs of cable faults or gas leaks. We will ask the Committee to consider publishing indicators of the effectiveness of their coordination efforts."
2018-01-10-T-011-S-00148,2018-01-10-T-011,148,Deputy Speaker,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.
2018-01-10-T-011-S-00149,2018-01-10-T-011,149,Lee Bee Wah,Question No 12.
2018-01-10-T-011-S-00150,2018-01-10-T-011,150,Leon Perera,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I think Question No 11 has not been answered yet."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00151,2018-01-10-T-012,151,Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what additional noise abatement measures to counter low-flying aircraft noises coming from the nearby Seletar Airport can be put in place; (b) whether the height limit of the airspace over residential areas can be increased; and (c) whether a different flight path can be given to aircraft landing at the airport so that they will not fly over housing estates, especially in the middle of the night."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00152,2018-01-10-T-012,152,Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the actual flight paths of aircraft depend on the prevailing wind conditions and directions. In the case of Seletar Airport, arriving and departing aircraft will sometimes fly over nearby residential estates because of the wind conditions around Seletar Airport."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00153,2018-01-10-T-012,153,Ng Chee Meng,"The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) is mindful of the noise pollution caused by overflying aircraft and has several measures to reduce it. First, whenever wind conditions permit, CAAS proactively routes the aircraft away from the residential areas."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00154,2018-01-10-T-012,154,Ng Chee Meng,"Second, CAAS requires aircraft that overfly residential estates, such as those to the south and west of Seletar Airport, to operate at a height of at least 450 m or 1,500 ft. CAAS has considered raising the height of such flight paths. However, this would compromise the safety of the aircraft because the aircraft will have to ascend or climb and descend at steeper angles."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00155,2018-01-10-T-012,155,Ng Chee Meng,"Third, CAAS prohibits training and freighter flights between 10.00 pm and 7.00 am at Seletar Airport, and allows only newer and quieter aircraft to operate within Singapore."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00156,2018-01-10-T-012,156,Lee Bee Wah,"Sir, I would like to let the Minister know that Nee South has been a very peaceful place where residents can have a good night's sleep until recently when I received several feedback. Actually, it is not just sometimes, as the Minister mentioned. Just to give you some examples. On 3 January, there were three flights coming in ­—"
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00157,2018-01-10-T-012,157,Deputy Speaker,"Er Dr Lee, please ask the clarification."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00158,2018-01-10-T-012,158,Lee Bee Wah,"Yes, I would like to ask whether we can limit the time further, because if you mention 10.00 pm to 7.00 am, it is not true. There are flights that come in at 3 am, 4 am and 5 am. It is continuous – on 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 January. And there are flights that come in after 10.00 pm. So, for those that are noisy, can we turn them away or not allow them to land at Seletar Airport at all and not come near Nee Soon South because they wake people up in the early morning?"
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00159,2018-01-10-T-012,159,Deputy Speaker,Minister for Transport. Please make sure they do not come to Mountbatten either. [
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00160,2018-01-10-T-012,160,Ng Chee Meng,"I thank the hon Member for raising it. The flights that are permitted from 10.00 pm to 7.00 am are aircraft that are usually smaller and with newer engines, and these can include medical evacuation flights into Seletar Airport. So, we limit this window to smaller, quieter aircraft, and the big aircraft with noisier engines are only limited to day time. So, the data that the Member has provided are probably accurate. The bigger, noisier airplanes are only limited mostly to the day time and up to 10 o'clock at night. Post-10.00 pm, sometimes, it will be for medical evacuation and smaller aircraft."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00161,2018-01-10-T-012,161,Ng Chee Meng,"We take the point that aircraft do bring noise into not just Nee Soon South but to other areas of Singapore because of the small land mass of Singapore. So, CAAS will continue to adopt the best practices according to international standards to include the best practices in noise abatement measures."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00162,2018-01-10-T-012,162,Lee Bee Wah,"I would like to ask the Minister how he defines ""small aircraft"". If residents can be woken up at 3.00 am, 4.00 am, I think the noise is not little. So, I would seriously want to urge the Minister and CAAS to look into this issue so that the residents' sleep does not have to be disturbed so often."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00163,2018-01-10-T-012,163,Ng Chee Meng,"Yes, I thank the hon Member for the feedback. Some of these inconveniences will definitely be reviewed consistently to make sure that we bring the least disamenities to residents."
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00164,2018-01-10-T-012,164,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Just a clarification from the Minister. Does this flight time also apply to other vicinities, such as near Paya Lebar Airbase in Hougang and Aljunied?"
2018-01-10-T-012-S-00165,2018-01-10-T-012,165,Ng Chee Meng,"It applies with different timings to different military airports, whether it is Paya Lebar or Tengah. These noise abatement measures, from my memory, do take into account school examinations, for instance, when there will be curtailing of flying. And for the military aircraft, if my memory serves me right, they try to land by 10.00 pm, unless it is for operational contingencies."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00166,2018-01-10-T-013,166,Sun Xueling,"asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what proportion of University students, Polytechnic and ITE students currently embark on work internships during their studies; (b) what is the duration and nature of these internships; and (c) what can be done to encourage more companies to provide internship opportunities for young Singaporeans."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00167,2018-01-10-T-013,167,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, internships and industry attachments are an important aspect of higher education in Singapore. They provide students with meaningful learning experience in a real-world context, help them develop fuller perspectives of the various industries and better prepare them for work."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00168,2018-01-10-T-013,168,Low Yen Ling,"Our post-Secondary education institutes (PSEIs) source and facilitate placements for students to go on internships. Today, 44% of ITE, 98% of Polytechnic and 70% of University students take up internships. Some students complete two or more internships during their studies."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00169,2018-01-10-T-013,169,Low Yen Ling,"Internships for PSEI students are typically between eight and 24 weeks that means about two to six months in terms of duration. In some instances, internships could last up to a year, depending on the structure of the courses that students are enrolled in."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00170,2018-01-10-T-013,170,Low Yen Ling,"Internships are usually designed to complement the curriculum in the PSEIs, and to bridge theory and practice for the students. The PSEIs work closely with industry partners to design internship programmes. They identify key competencies that interns should acquire and other learning outcomes that would enhance the students’ employability in respective fields during internship."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00171,2018-01-10-T-013,171,Low Yen Ling,"It is important to ensure that internships are carried out as intended and are meaningful for the students. To this end, our PSEIs have been progressively enhancing the internships, such as introducing structured mentorships, to better meet our students’ learning needs."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00172,2018-01-10-T-013,172,Low Yen Ling,"Industry support is key in ensuring the availability and quality of internships for PSEI students. The PSEIs frequently engage current and new industry partners, as well as companies, to explore new internship opportunities. They also tap on the help of industry associations and economic agencies. Companies are increasingly willing to host interns to develop their talent pipeline and assess potential candidates for recruitment."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00173,2018-01-10-T-013,173,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary. I just wanted to ask whether companies that offer internships to students consider the internship period as relevant work experience and whether they consider, in terms of employment thereafter these students who have gone through the internship by giving them some increment in terms of salary so that they get a higher salary grade when they are eventually employed by the companies."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00174,2018-01-10-T-013,174,Low Yen Ling,"I want to thank Dr Intan for her questions and I want to assure her that the PSEIs understand the value that the internship will bring to the students. It will better prepare them for work, like she has shared, and the students also understand and appreciate the value that the internship will bring to their CV, really allowing them to have a better appreciation of what they have learnt in school, bridging theory and practice, so that they will be well placed to adjust to the workforce."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00175,2018-01-10-T-013,175,Low Yen Ling,"The example that Dr Intan has mentioned is aligned to why we started the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme. The SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme is a work-learn initiative that allows the graduates from Polytechnic and ITE immediately upon their graduation, whether it is in ITE or Polytechnic, to join a host company between 12 to 18 months, even longer. It is necessary for them to spend between 12 to 18 months because we are trying to achieve two objectives  to allow them to have meaningful work experience that is aligned to what they have learnt in Polytechnic or ITE; at the same time, to build on that foundation such that they can even articulate to a specialist diploma if they were Polytechnic graduates, or maybe a technical diploma if they graduate from ITE. So, we do have a conduit to facilitate the intent that the Member has mentioned."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00176,2018-01-10-T-013,176,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the comprehensive answer. I would like to enquire if there is an intention to build up the proportion for ITE graduates going for internships from 44%, closer to 100%, and the same for University graduates as well?"
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00177,2018-01-10-T-013,177,Low Yen Ling,"I want to thank Ms Sun Xueling for her two supplementary questions. Allow me to explain. Even the applied learning nature of the ITE education, actually, hands-on training is already very, very much part of the core curriculum of ITE now. Currently, more than half, or about 60% of the ITE courses include an internship component. Moving forward, the remaining ITE courses will also be, in a way, enhanced to include an internship component such that by year 2020, all ITE courses will offer enhanced internship."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00178,2018-01-10-T-013,178,Low Yen Ling,"The Member also asked about the Autonomous Universities (AUs). Allow me to share that, as some AUs like SMU, SUTD and SUSS, internships are already compulsory. SIT has its eight to 12 months long Integrated Work Study Programme. Internships are strongly encouraged in NUS and NTU and in certain courses, attachments are a part of the curriculum such that for the undergraduates, they will have to complete internship as part of the graduation requirement."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00179,2018-01-10-T-013,179,K Thanaletchimi,"I would just like to seek a clarification on internship. Do we really monitor the quality of internship programme? And, do we evaluate it because companies may deem to keen provide internship but who does the monitoring and evaluation and feedback?"
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00180,2018-01-10-T-013,180,Low Yen Ling,"I want to thank the Member Ms Thanaletchimi for the supplementary questions. I want to assure her that the PSEIs take the quality of the internship very seriously. PSEIs usually will conduct post-internship surveys to seek the feedback of students on the quality of the internship and also the supervision that is provided by the host companies, as well as whether the prescribed learning outcomes that were mapped before the internship, to what extent have they been achieved. I have checked and confirmed that PSEIs have ceased partnering some host companies because they have received poor feedback from the students."
2018-01-10-T-013-S-00181,2018-01-10-T-013,181,Low Yen Ling,"The key really is, we want to ensure that the learning outcomes of our students are at the centre, at the heart of what we are doing here."
2018-01-10-T-014-S-00182,2018-01-10-T-014,182,Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) how many scams on claims have been reported and investigated since the implementation of SkillsFuture; and (b) what is the Ministry doing to stop cases of training providers pressuring citizens to sign up for courses by falsely telling them that their SkillsFuture credits will expire soon.
2018-01-10-T-014-S-00183,2018-01-10-T-014,183,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, since January 2016, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) has referred six instances of fraudulent claims to the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) for investigation, of which two were major cases. We have heard Minister Ong Ye Kung elaborating on these two cases two days ago in the House, including the actions that have been taken as well as additional actions that will be taken moving forward."
2018-01-10-T-014-S-00184,2018-01-10-T-014,184,Low Yen Ling,"SSG has set in place specific marketing guidelines for training providers. It has issued advisory, warning and suspension letters to 27 training providers who have breached these guidelines. These errant organisations have been warned some have been suspended. SSG regularly conducts random ground audits to check compliance. The agency welcomes feedback from members of the public who spot or suspect any malpractice."
2018-01-10-T-014-S-00185,2018-01-10-T-014,185,Low Yen Ling,"We want to reiterate that SSG, MOE and the Government has zero tolerance for any attempt by individuals, training providers or organisations to abuse its funding schemes that serve the interest of Singaporeans. SSG will not hesitate to act against such errant individuals or organisations."
2018-01-10-T-014-S-00186,2018-01-10-T-014,186,Lee Bee Wah,I would like to the Senior Parliamentary Secretary how many have been suspended.
2018-01-10-T-014-S-00187,2018-01-10-T-014,187,Low Yen Ling,"Out of the 27 training providers, some have been suspended. I can come back to the Member on the details. But we want to assure Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and all Members that we take a very serious view of any abuse and SSG is strengthening its efforts on all fronts to uphold the goals of SkillsFuture for the benefit of many Singaporeans. And training providers who breachT these guidelines like the 27, will be dealt be, with a very severe warning and in some cases, suspended, or even heavy actions."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00188,2018-01-10-T-015,188,Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what are the criteria to qualify a company to conduct Workforce Skills Qualifications courses; (b) what can students do when the quality of the instructors is not as advertised; and (c) how does the Ministry oversee these companies to ensure they are not overcharging.
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00189,2018-01-10-T-015,189,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, before accrediting any Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) training course provider, the SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (SSG) must first evaluate the provider's ability to design and develop the curriculum, the design of its courseware, that means the course materials, its training delivery, system of assessment, the Approved Training Organisation (ATO)'s financial management practices, and whether the ATO has qualified adult educators – so, six-pronged criteria."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00190,2018-01-10-T-015,190,Low Yen Ling,"The training provider must meet these standards and requirements before it is appointed as an ATO to deliver WSQ programmes. To ensure that continued compliance, SSG regularly audits the ATOs' systems and processes and the outcomes of such audits are reviewed and considered by SSG for the renewal of the ATOs' application to offer training. So, even after they are appointed, we will continue to do random audits to ensure that they comply. If not, upon renewal, it may be revoked."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00191,2018-01-10-T-015,191,Low Yen Ling,"To ensure and uphold the standards of ATOs' training, SSG recently introduced a community feedback feature in the MySkillsFuture portal which was launched on 29 November 2017. Course participants can directly provide feedback and views on the quality of learning on the respective SkillsFuture Credit-eligible courses they attended. I also would like to share with the Members that this year, SSG will publish on MySkillsFuture portal, information on the training outcomes of SSG-supported courses. So, you can see more information about the courses to make an informed decision. This is done because we want to make available information for individuals or Singaporeans to make more informed learning choices. It will also serve to heighten the ATOs' accountability for results in their training. SSG will continue to look for ways of improving greater transparency and information on training quality and impact."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00192,2018-01-10-T-015,192,Low Yen Ling,"As for the question of affordability of course fees, SSG requires ATOs to seek its approval for their course fees. But we all know in a free market, the best safeguard against unreasonable pricing is competition. Today, we have about 500 training providers delivering WSQ courses. In a way, it serves as some form of check on the course fees."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00193,2018-01-10-T-015,193,Deputy Speaker,"Ms Chia Yong Yong, you have a supplementary question?"
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00194,2018-01-10-T-015,194,Chia Yong Yong,"Yes. Thank you, Sir. I have a question for the Senior Parliamentary Secretary. In any application for accreditation by a potential service provider or trainers, are the applicants required to declare any association or relations to other service providers who may have been under investigation or who may have been penalised for any improper conduct? And such association might include relationships to shareholders, directors and managers of errant or suspected errant trainers."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00195,2018-01-10-T-015,195,Low Yen Ling,"I want to thank the Nominated Member of Parliament Ms Chia Yong Yong for her supplementary questions. I highlighted the six-pronged criteria that SSG will take into consideration when they evaluate, as to whether we should appoint the ATO. We will certainly also look at the track record of the organisation. This is where I also want to reassure her and Members if any members of the public are aware that the particular organisation, in terms of the history or background is quite dubious, because of their linkages with other service providers, we welcome them to step forward and share this information with SSG."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00196,2018-01-10-T-015,196,Low Yen Ling,"On Monday, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about the number for the hotline. I am happy to share with the House that the SSG's hotline is 67855785. Operating hours are from Monday to Friday, 8.30 am to 5.30 pm, and on Saturday, 8.30 am to 1.00 pm. Do not be worried. For any other hours outside of the operating hours, please assure your residents or members of the public to leave their contact details. We will close the loop with them during the next working day."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00197,2018-01-10-T-015,197,Low Yen Ling,"In addition, if the members of the public prefer to send in their feedback via email or even via the MySkillsFuture portal, they can do so through the new feature I mentioned earlier – community feedback feature."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00198,2018-01-10-T-015,198,Lee Bee Wah,"Sir, there is saying on the ground, that says, ""the best business to do nowadays is where the Government gives out grants"". That is why I think a lot of people jump into this. I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary two supplementary questions. How can the Ministry provide more information to course applicants to make an informed decision? The second question is, will the Ministry consider open review of courses, just like when we want to book hotels or restaurants overseas, there is always some reviews there for us to view. So, will the Ministry consider that so that when a participant wants to go for that course, they will look at the reviews?"
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00199,2018-01-10-T-015,199,Low Yen Ling,"I want thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for her supplementary questions and I want to assure her and the Members in the House that MOE has stringent standards on the quality of the WSQ training providers. For example, you would probably recall that from October 2014, we require the trainers for the WSQ-approved training organisations, at least 80% of their trainers must have Advanced Certificate in Training and Assessment (ACTA) or equivalent. So, we want to ensure the competency of the training providers."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00200,2018-01-10-T-015,200,Low Yen Ling,"The question that the Member asked about, whether we can put out more information, she would be glad that this is the intent of SSG and MOE. I mentioned briefly earlier that the portal called MySkillsFuture portal was launched on 29 November 2017 to help Singaporeans and course applicants to make better, informed decision. We have received feedback from course participants. So, progressively, starting from this month, SSG will progressively publish information on a few things  the course quality, trainee's rating on course outcome, like what the Member has mentioned. This covers areas such as effective learning, standards of the trainers, course content, the ability to apply the learning, impact on job performance and job scope, as well as the providers' customer service."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00201,2018-01-10-T-015,201,Low Yen Ling,"So, we want to assure Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Members that course applicants can be assured that the key criteria of quality, course transparency and accountability really underpin SSG's efforts to enhance Singaporeans' learning needs."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00202,2018-01-10-T-015,202,K Thanaletchimi,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a supplementary for the Senior Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the training providers who have attained ATO and Accredited Training Provider (ATP). Could the Ministry consider ranking these training providers based on the quality of teaching? Very often, we hear of the main trainers to be ACTA accredited but then, if they are not there, the relief trainers do not have that certification."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00203,2018-01-10-T-015,203,Low Yen Ling,"I want to thank Ms Thanaletchimi for her suggestions which we will consider. In practical terms, what could be a top training organisation may not exactly be a top one for another course applicant; it depends on their learning needs, what industry they are in, and so on."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00204,2018-01-10-T-015,204,Low Yen Ling,"I have briefly mentioned ACTA. Allow me to elaborate because I think Ms Thanaletchimi will be quite keen. As part of our efforts to enhance the professional standards and also the identity of the adult educators in the Training Adult Education (TAE) industry, SSG has, from October 2014, developed the TAE professional competency model which is a skills reference framework with clear descriptions of the competencies and proficiencies that is required of our adult educators. So, all hands on deck, we are trying to level up the professional standards of the adult educators to ensure that Singaporeans who want to level up their education, their skills, will be well placed to do so."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00205,2018-01-10-T-015,205,Deputy Speaker,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, last clarification."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00206,2018-01-10-T-015,206,Lee Bee Wah,"Just now, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned about feedback by course participants. I would like to ask, is the feedback submitted to the course provider or to the Ministry directly? Because there may be certain censorship there. Also, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary did not reply to my specific question of an open review system. If it is an open review, people can easily go online to see the reviews of past participants."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00207,2018-01-10-T-015,207,Low Yen Ling,"I want to thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for her question. With regards to feedback, it will be collected using a two-prong approach. Many of us would have attended courses and at the end of the course, you probably would be given a feedback form. I think she is alluding to that. Indeed, there may be some course participants' views which may be moderated. This is why we have recently introduced a new feature on the My SkillsFuture portal. This is the Community Feedback feature. For residents who feel more comfortable calling, I have provided the hotline. There are many ways to get to us to make sure that Singaporeans have all channels to provide us information of any ATO or training provider, if they suspect any malpractice or any misleading marketing practices or even fraudulent activities."
2018-01-10-T-015-S-00208,2018-01-10-T-015,208,Low Yen Ling,"I thought I had answered that question but let me do that again. The Member talked about open review and I highlighted that starting this month we will progressively put out more information on the portal and those information cannot just come from nowhere. The information in areas that I mentioned, for example trainees rating, must come from the participants of the courses previously."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00209,2018-01-10-T-016,209,Sylvia Lim,"asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Government is concerned that the report by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released in November 2017 titled ""Excellence and Equity in Education"" found that economically disadvantaged students in Singapore were significantly more likely to under-perform in science in school, compared to their OECD counterparts."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00210,2018-01-10-T-016,210,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, Ms Lim's question as stated is factually incorrect. It is not true that students from lower socio-economic backgrounds in Singapore are more likely to under-perform than their OECD counterparts. In fact, the data from the OECD report show that students from lower socio-economic status (SES) homes in Singapore have higher average PISA 2015 scores than their OECD peers from comparable SES backgrounds in all the three domains measured − Reading, Mathematics and Science."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00211,2018-01-10-T-016,211,Janil Puthucheary,"Notwithstanding this, if I can presume to read into Ms Lim's underlying concern, it is indeed something that MOE is focused upon because it is important that the students from the lower SES homes are able to overcome their circumstances and do well."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00212,2018-01-10-T-016,212,Janil Puthucheary,"The same OECD report has found that about half of our students from the bottom 25% SES in Singapore performed much better internationally than what their home circumstances would predict. OECD calls such students ""resilient students"". Our proportion of resilient students is substantially higher than OECD's average of about 30% in the PISA 2015 study."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00213,2018-01-10-T-016,213,Janil Puthucheary,"Our efforts to support the learning of students who need more help are working. MOE has put in place various programmes to provide additional support targeted at specific learning needs of students. We have a special reading programme for K2 children with difficulties learning English; and the Learning Support Programme in English and Mathematics for P1 and P2 students. At the higher grade levels, there are corresponding programmes such as those that provide reading remediation or help students improve their confidence and numeracy skills. Other efforts include targeted needs-based financial assistance schemes across all schooling years."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00214,2018-01-10-T-016,214,Janil Puthucheary,"But we do not rest on our laurels. It takes constant hard work to enable every student to achieve their potential during their educational journey, especially those from more challenging home circumstances. MOE will therefore continue to work closely with other agencies and community partners to provide the necessary support for students who need it most."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00215,2018-01-10-T-016,215,Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Sir. Two supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State. Earlier, he mentioned that my assumption in the question was not correct. But from the report, it is stated that Belgium, Singapore and Switzerland were the only three high-performing countries with below-average levels of equity in education outcome. So, what do they mean by that? The only three high-performing countries with below-average levels of equity."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00216,2018-01-10-T-016,216,Sylvia Lim,"I think there was a table that compared the performance of socio-economically disadvantaged students at 15 years old across different countries. It was stated that the likelihood of such disadvantaged students to under-perform is 2.8 times for the OECD average, but Singapore is 4.37 times. So, is that not an indication that we have a bigger issue to worry about in terms of equity?"
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00217,2018-01-10-T-016,217,Sylvia Lim,"The second question I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State is, what indicators does MOE track of social mobility in education? In a previous Parliamentary Question (PQ) that I filed almost 10 years ago, we know from the then Minister that MOE does track, for example, students going to our public Universities based on housing type. We had an indication of social mobility there but are there any other indicators that the Ministry tracks internally?"
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00218,2018-01-10-T-016,218,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, with respect to the second question I do not have the data with me. I would be happy to follow up with Ms Lim or she can file a separate PQ on internal data. The information I have is related to the OECD report and I would like to address the first question."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00219,2018-01-10-T-016,219,Janil Puthucheary,"What the OECD study found was that in Singapore, the higher performing students outperformed the OECD average by a wider margin than the lower performing students in the lower SES homes. So, our lower SES students do outperform the lower SES students in OECD countries. But our higher SES students outperform the higher SES students in other OECD countries by an even larger margin resulting in the differential that she talked about."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00220,2018-01-10-T-016,220,Janil Puthucheary,"So, our lower SES students are doing well. Our lower SES students are outperforming the OECD average. The higher SES students are outperforming the higher SES students in the OECD by a larger margin, and so the difference in the outperformance of all our students is greater than the OECD average. So, if one chooses that as the measure of equity, which the OECD has chosen to do, then the mathematical result is as Ms Lim has demonstrated."
2018-01-10-T-016-S-00221,2018-01-10-T-016,221,Janil Puthucheary,"However, it does not mean that our lower SES students are underperforming their OECD counterparts. That is not the case. I hope that answers Ms Lim's question."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00222,2018-01-10-T-017,222,Sun Xueling,"asked the Minister for National Development what are the processes in place to ensure that (i) design and consultancy fees for building iconic ""green"" and ""sustainable"" buildings are fair and appropriate (ii) proper cost and benefit analyses are conducted before going ahead with the construction of such buildings (iii) the tender evaluation body of such contracts is well-versed in the subject and has a sense of the fair costs of design and construction and (iv) the tender evaluation body for such bids does not rely solely on an assessment based on relative bids."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00223,2018-01-10-T-017,223,Desmond Lee,"Mr Deputy Speaker, In all green building projects, Government agencies will first assess their efficiency requirements, bearing in mind the overall costs and benefits. Thereafter, they will award the project to a proposal that achieves the desired efficiency outcomes at an optimal cost. There are systems, processes, and controls in place to achieve this. While consultancy and construction fees are driven by market forces, the public procurement frameworks ensure that agencies pay fair and competitive prices."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00224,2018-01-10-T-017,224,Desmond Lee,"In addition, the Centre for Public Project Management (CP2M) compiles norms for construction costs and consultancy fees for agencies’ reference to aid in budgeting for projects. CP2M also works with agencies to review the design of major infrastructure projects to ensure cost effectiveness and value for money."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00225,2018-01-10-T-017,225,Desmond Lee,"Based on a study conducted by BCA, buildings that meet the Green Mark Platinum standard cost up to 5% more compared to buildings that do not meet the required energy efficiency outcomes. However, the additional costs are more than offset by the savings from reduced energy and water consumption. The payback period can range from three to six years, which is well within the typical useful life of the building asset. So, from a cost-benefit perspective, there are good reasons to continue our push for Green Mark buildings including Green Mark public sector buildings."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00226,2018-01-10-T-017,226,Desmond Lee,"But beyond cost benefit perspectives, there are also other reasons why we need to push for Green buildings. Last September, BCA and NUS released the results of a joint research study which suggests that Green Mark buildings provide a healthier indoor environment for their occupants. Occupants were also generally more satisfied with their indoor environment and were less likely to experience symptoms of Sick Building Syndrome."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00227,2018-01-10-T-017,227,Desmond Lee,"Sir, ultimately the public sector must walk the talk and continue to take the lead in demonstrating our commitment to urban and environmental sustainability. So, the initiative known as the public sector taking the lead in environmental sustainability (PSTLES) was launched in 2006 to improve energy and water efficiency of our public sector buildings and today we reaffirm that commitment."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00228,2018-01-10-T-017,228,Sun Xueling,I thank the Minister. I have three supplementary questions. Could he share what the make-up of the CP2M committee? Who are the members of this committee? Are they largely civil servants or do they include participants from the private sector as well?
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00229,2018-01-10-T-017,229,Sun Xueling,My second supplementary question is if there were any issues with asset maintenance arising from the use of Green technology.
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00230,2018-01-10-T-017,230,Sun Xueling,"Thirdly, with rapid changes in technology, has that also resulted in problems in finding parts or in the process of trying to maintain these Green buildings?"
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00231,2018-01-10-T-017,231,Desmond Lee,"Could the Member repeat the second question, I did not quite catch it."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00232,2018-01-10-T-017,232,Sun Xueling,"The second question was with regards to whether there were any issues with asset maintenance arising from having Green buildings, be it spare parts or something else. The third question was with regards to changes in technology."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00233,2018-01-10-T-017,233,Desmond Lee,"On the composition of CP2M, I do not have the exact composition and names at this point in time. The second and third questions relate to availability of replacement parts as well as technology?"
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00234,2018-01-10-T-017,234,Sun Xueling,"The second question was if there were no changes in technology, and we had gone to the same manufacturer or the same construction company, whether there were issues in the replacement of parts."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00235,2018-01-10-T-017,235,Sun Xueling,"My third question was if there was a change in green technology, let us say industry wide, and you had to look for a new company to replace parts, will that cause issues?"
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00236,2018-01-10-T-017,236,Desmond Lee,"Mr Deputy Speaker, when you look at requirements for a building to achieve Green Mark certification, there is a variety of criteria. Some of them involve the incorporation of technology such as filters to remove particles from the air to make the indoor environment healthier. They involve mechanical parts, they involve technology. Some of them are based on design, for example, making better use of sunlight instead of enclosing the space and then having to use electricity to light up an indoor space in the day time. There are a variety of these measures that go into making a building both water and energy efficient."
2018-01-10-T-017-S-00237,2018-01-10-T-017,237,Desmond Lee,"As far as it involves technology such as rainwater harvesting technology or solar panels, these are technologies that are available in the market. The developer, whether it is a public sector developer or a private sector developer, working with the consultants would have to assess whether the technology and equipment that they use are sustainable, maintainable and replaceable throughout the life cycle of the building."
2018-01-10-T-018-S-00238,2018-01-10-T-018,238,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider reducing the minimum age for the Lease Buyback Scheme where the flat owner has a serious medical condition causing significant reduction of life expectancy.
2018-01-10-T-018-S-00239,2018-01-10-T-018,239,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, to be eligible for the Lease Buyback Scheme, all flat owners should be aged 65 or older. Age 65 corresponds to the CPF Payout Eligibility Age, which is the minimum age when they can start to receive their monthly payouts from the CPF."
2018-01-10-T-018-S-00240,2018-01-10-T-018,240,Lawrence Wong,"Nevertheless, should there be exceptional circumstances such as medical or financial reasons, HDB will exercise flexibility for households who do not meet the age requirement fully to take up the Lease Buyback Scheme on a case-by-case basis."
2018-01-10-T-019-S-00241,2018-01-10-T-019,241,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the tempo and siting of land development allocation considers the cumulative effect of continuous noise on nearby residents arising from successive construction developments in close proximity; and (b) what measures are being used to incentivise the minimisation of noise arising from public or private sector developments especially when there are residential areas nearby.
2018-01-10-T-019-S-00242,2018-01-10-T-019,242,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in the planning of public and private development projects, agencies take into account several considerations, which will include the impact of construction works on nearby residents."
2018-01-10-T-019-S-00243,2018-01-10-T-019,243,Lawrence Wong,"However, given our built-up urban environment and land constraints, it is not always possible to totally avoid noise-generating activities such as construction works."
2018-01-10-T-019-S-00244,2018-01-10-T-019,244,Lawrence Wong,"In areas that are being developed fairly rapidly such as new housing estates, residents who moved into the area earlier may go through the experience of several nearby upcoming developments being constructed subsequently."
2018-01-10-T-019-S-00245,2018-01-10-T-019,245,Lawrence Wong,"Nevertheless, public sector agencies are committed to reducing construction noise levels. For instance, LTA takes reference from NEA’s guidelines when implementing road and rail infrastructure projects. HDB’s contractors also include measures like the staggering of noisy activities, using quieter equipment and construction methods, shielding of noise sources and restricting the duration of noisy activities like piling, to minimise inconvenience to residents during the development process."
2018-01-10-T-019-S-00246,2018-01-10-T-019,246,Lawrence Wong,"During the construction process, noise limits are imposed on construction sites under the Environmental Protection and Management Act. Construction companies which violate these limits are liable to enforcement action by NEA, which could include a fine of up to $40,000 upon conviction, and a ""stop-work order"" may also be imposed on repeat offenders."
2018-01-10-T-019-S-00247,2018-01-10-T-019,247,Lawrence Wong,"A ""no-work rule"" has also been in place since September 2011 which prohibits noisy work activities on Sundays and public holidays at construction sites within 150 m of residential premises and noise-sensitive premises."
2018-01-10-T-019-S-00248,2018-01-10-T-019,248,Tan Wu Meng,"I thank the Minister for his answer. I would like to ask one supplementary question. Can the Minister reassure us that the agencies will be proactive in minimising noise, especially in built-up estates, mature estates, like Clementi? I ask this because I have had residents' feedback that for some developments, especially where there was concurrent demolition going on, large pieces of debris were being broken down on-site rather than transported elsewhere to be broken down, with ensuing noise disamenities."
2018-01-10-T-019-S-00249,2018-01-10-T-019,249,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, as I had mentioned earlier, the agencies are already paying attention to this and they would continue to do their best in, firstly, staging the projects so that we manage the tempo of the projects as the Member had asked, and then subsequently, even when the projects are being implemented, working their best to manage activities on-site, and that would include complying with NEA's noise limits, but even going beyond that. We know there are more advanced construction methods that allow for construction to be done more productively, and importantly, in a quieter fashion. In fact, NEA also has a Quieter Construction Fund which co-funds construction activities that may be more expensive, but can do things in a quieter way."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00250,2018-01-10-T-020,250,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many PMETs have been assisted under the Career Support Programme (CSP) since its inception, with a breakdown by each of the three six-monthly employment period and by those aged above and below 40 respectively; (b) what evidence is available indicating that the PMETs have been successfully reintegrated into the workforce with the help of this scheme; and (c) whether any evidence has emerged indicating gaps in the employability of PMETs under the CSP that require further training interventions."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00251,2018-01-10-T-020,251,Josephine Teo,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Career Support Programme (CSP) provides short-term wage support of up to 18 months with support levels that can go up to 50% to encourage employers to hire mid-career PMET job-seekers who have been retrenched or unemployed for six months or more. This helps to address mismatches in wage expectations and provides mid-career PMET job-seekers more opportunities to regain employment, especially the long-term unemployed. The CSP also helps employers to tap a wider pool of mid-career PMETs to meet their manpower needs. In fact, around half of CSP employers are SMEs."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00252,2018-01-10-T-020,252,Josephine Teo,"Since its inception in October 2015, over 1,100 PMETs have been supported through CSP. More than 90% were aged 40 and above, and more than 80% were long-term unemployed at the point of placement. Placements have steadily picked up, from about 200 in the first three quarters of 2016, to more than 800 in the same period in 2017."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00253,2018-01-10-T-020,253,Josephine Teo,"The retention rate of the 2015 and 2016 cohorts is encouraging. Within 12 months of CSP placement, about 70% remained in employment. Majority remained with the CSP employer and the rest found new jobs with other employers. Those who are still seeking employment can return to WSG or NTUC-e2i centres for assistance."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00254,2018-01-10-T-020,254,Josephine Teo,"Apart from CSP, PMET job seekers can also benefit from other Adapt and Grow programmes. For example, PMETs with skills mismatches can tap on the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) to reskill and move into new occupations and sectors with good prospects and opportunities for progression. Momentum for the PCPs has also picked up. In the first three quarters of 2017, about 2,700 PMETs were placed under the PCPs, and this is up from 900 in the same period in 2016."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00255,2018-01-10-T-020,255,Leon Perera,"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply. Just a few supplementary questions. If I understood the Minister correctly, to date, for the CSP about 70% of the employees have remained in the CSP employer, and 30% have moved on to another employer, or have left the CSP employer. Is that right?"
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00256,2018-01-10-T-020,256,Josephine Teo,"Deputy Speaker, to clarify, 70% remained in employment. But as it turns out, of those who remained in employment, 70% remained with the same employer and 30% moved on to another employer. But so as not to confused matters, we just stick to 70% remained in employment."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00257,2018-01-10-T-020,257,Leon Perera,"I thank the Minister for her clarification. So, my supplementary question will be, to date, based on these figures, I suppose a minority of them, I mean there was a certain amount of attrition – about 30% – have there been any insights gleaned into the reasons behind that? Were there any employability gaps that were discerned after the PMET was placed with the CSP employer which suggest that there are some training gaps that need to be fulfilled? Because anecdotally, I have come across such feedback that that may be the case occasionally. And if so, what kind of solutions can be put forward or deployed to meet those training and employability gaps."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00258,2018-01-10-T-020,258,Josephine Teo,"I thank the Member very much for that supplementary question. Mr Deputy Speaker, the CSP is one of many programmes that the Workforce Singapore, together with MOM, leverage on to help job seekers, whether they have been unemployed for a short period of time or if they have been employed for extended periods of time. Obviously, the needs differ, and so, we do not use one programme exclusively."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00259,2018-01-10-T-020,259,Josephine Teo,"In the case of the CSP, it is very targeted. It addresses a specific issue with wages. In other words, the person is more or less job ready. The employer is quite keen to take him or her on. But, the salary remains something that they cannot find agreement on. So, the CSP comes in specifically to address this issue."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00260,2018-01-10-T-020,260,Josephine Teo,"The Professional Conversion Programme addresses a different set of issues. Under those circumstances, the jobseeker may be attractive to the employer, but there is a certain gap in the range of skills that he has that causes the employer to think a little bit harder. And so, the PCP comes in to intervene and encourages the employer to give the jobseeker an opportunity to close that skills gap. So, CSP takes care of wage gap; PCP takes care of skills gap."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00261,2018-01-10-T-020,261,Josephine Teo,"Within the whole range of programmes under the Adapt and Grow Initiative, there are yet others. For example, the P-Max programme deals specifically with the needs of SMEs. For some PMETs that are transiting from different work environments, the cultural context of operating in an SME may require them to have a longer period of adjustment. So, the P-Max programme does that."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00262,2018-01-10-T-020,262,Josephine Teo,"I should add that at the Careers Connect centres, which Workforce Singapore operates, there are a whole range of other programmes that deal specifically with issues that jobseekers may have, and they are not confined to training intervention. So, for example, there may be jobseekers who are struggling to cope emotionally with job loss and they have to cross that barrier before they be effective in job search. The Career Recharger programme does that for them – it is one-on-one counselling. There are those who have overcome that barrier, but they want to share tips with other jobseekers who are looking for work in the same field. The Career 360 programme does that for them. Then, there may be those who have not quite sorted out what they really want to do at that stage of their career. The Career Catalyst programme again provides one-on-one counselling to help them to do that. So, there are a whole range of programmes available, and we remain very open to what other interventions will help jobseekers regain employment more quickly, and we will continue to improve upon them."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00263,2018-01-10-T-020,263,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I thank the Minister for the answer. Just two supplementary questions. Firstly, from my knowledge of the CSP, I think there is still quite a number of SMEs as well as HR and employers in those SMEs who are not aware of the CSP. Just two suggestions. Firstly, can MOM strengthen its outreach, particularly for all SMEs in Singapore, through various collaterals where MOM or other public agencies interface with these SMEs? Secondly, will the Ministry consider, instead of having the employers tap on the CSP prior to hiring the person or before they are allowed to claim the funding, whether it can be made automatic, in the sense that you can detect whether they do hire people who are earning $3,600 and above, and who are above or under 40, and who are unemployed and retrenched?"
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00264,2018-01-10-T-020,264,Josephine Teo,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Mr Patrick Tay for the feedback. It is well noted. The CSP has been on-going for just about two years. We accept the fact that we can improve on outreach and enable more employers to know about the help that is available to them, and will certainly strengthen the outreach, particularly to SMEs."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00265,2018-01-10-T-020,265,Josephine Teo,"As it stands right now, the outreach to the SMEs, or at least if you look at the numbers, SMEs take-up is not too bad – it is about half."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00266,2018-01-10-T-020,266,Josephine Teo,"To his question, if I understand correctly, on whether we can detect that a person has been employed and so, automatically provide a CSP assistance to his employer. The difficulty with that is  how do we know that there was a wage gap? It is only when, if the person has been employed, one assumes that the employer was happy to pay whatever was finally agreed upon. So, it is not something that we can presume, and there are so many cases where people have entered into jobs, and the employers are happy to settle on a certain level of payment. So, we should not assume that there was a wage gap to begin with."
2018-01-10-T-020-S-00267,2018-01-10-T-020,267,Josephine Teo,"At the same time I think, given what has been discussed in this House in the last couple of days, when disbursing grants, even in terms of wage support, we want to make sure that it is in cases that are really deserving. Can we improve on the application and the processing; can we make sure the employer does not have to wait too long? The answers to those questions are indeed, yes, but always maintaining a certain rigour in the assessment."
2018-01-10-T-021-S-00268,2018-01-10-T-021,268,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past five years, how many HDB flats have been foreclosed and put on mortgage sale/public auction by financial institutions due to defaults in payment by flat lessees; (b) how many flat lessees have approached HDB to buy back the flats that they are unable to sell in the open market; (c) how does HDB assist them to sell their flats in the open market; and (d) how many flats have been sold by lessees with the sale proceeds being insufficient to return to their individual CPF accounts."
2018-01-10-T-021-S-00269,2018-01-10-T-021,269,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, from January 2013 to November 2017, there were 118 cases of completed mortgagee sale of HDB flats by banks."
2018-01-10-T-021-S-00270,2018-01-10-T-021,270,Lawrence Wong,HDB does not buy back flats from flat owners and does not keep records of requests by flat owners who wish to sell their flats to HDB. HDB flat owners who have met the minimum occupation period may sell their flats in the open market.
2018-01-10-T-021-S-00271,2018-01-10-T-021,271,Lawrence Wong,"Such open market sales are a mutual agreement between the respective sellers and buyers, and HDB does not intervene in the transaction. HDB does, however, facilitate the sale of flats on the open market through measures such as publishing information on recent resale transactions on its website, and providing a resale checklist to guide sellers and buyers through the process."
2018-01-10-T-021-S-00272,2018-01-10-T-021,272,Lawrence Wong,"On the Member's fourth question, from January 2013 to November 2017, 6% of the HDB flats sold in the open market generated insufficient proceeds for the lessees to make a full CPF refund."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00273,2018-01-10-T-022,273,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for National Development (a)what have been done to control the population of wild birds in HDB estates and the possible transmission of diseases by birds; and (b) whether methods used by airports such as a sonic system to chase away the birds can be used to prevent the birds from over-growing in HDB estates.
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00274,2018-01-10-T-022,274,Koh Poh Koon,"AVA adopts a multi-pronged approach to controlling the population of wild birds like crows, mynahs and pigeons in our HDB estates."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00275,2018-01-10-T-022,275,Koh Poh Koon,"First, AVA works with Town Councils to implement measures to mitigate issues caused by birds, and this includes using bird deterrent gels and fogging trees to discourage birds from roosting near our residential areas."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00276,2018-01-10-T-022,276,Koh Poh Koon,"Second, AVA also works with NEA and Town Councils to ensure proper disposal of food waste at our hawker centres and within our residential areas. This reduces the availability of food that will attract the birds."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00277,2018-01-10-T-022,277,Koh Poh Koon,"Third, AVA also works with NParks and Town Councils to prune trees within the estates to deter birds from roosting in those trees."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00278,2018-01-10-T-022,278,Koh Poh Koon,"AVA also conducts regular surveillance of wild birds to detect diseases and thus far, there has been no detection of diseases of concern in the common bird species. AVA also inspects pet shops that sell birds to the general public to ensure that the birds are properly looked after and in good health. Moreover, in our farming industry, our local poultry farms are required to put in place proper biosecurity measures to prevent any disease incursion. Members of the public are advised therefore also to exercise due care and caution to not handle any dead birds or have direct contact with bird droppings because these are where diseases can be transmitted."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00279,2018-01-10-T-022,279,Koh Poh Koon,"AVA has considered the suggestion to use sonic systems to deter birds. However, we must be aware that the effects are usually temporary and the birds have been known to acclimatise to the sound. Such sonic systems can also be quite loud which reduces their suitability for deployment in our dense residential areas."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00280,2018-01-10-T-022,280,Koh Poh Koon,"The public, I must emphasise, also has an important role to play in curbing the bird population by maintaining the overall cleanliness of the environment and not feeding the wild birds. AVA, NEA and Town Councils will continue to educate residents not to litter or feed the birds. Enforcement actions will be taken against those who do not comply."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00281,2018-01-10-T-022,281,Gan Thiam Poh,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. In my area, we have areas that despite the joint efforts put in, the issue is not solved. So, I want to know besides those methods that the Senior Minister of State has mentioned, are there any other latest methods that could be used to resolve this issue? In fact, I have one case which is quite bad. When I was there I can see it is noisy. Is it possible to change to another type of tree whereby it will deter birds from resting in these trees?"
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00282,2018-01-10-T-022,282,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in tackling the birds issue, we also must understand that this is a multi-factorial problem. If some cases, there is high-rise littering. I know there are some blocks in which we have residents throwing food particles, food substances out from the kitchen window. These are behaviour that constitutes the source of attraction for the birds to come. And once the birds are used to coming to a certain location because of the availability of food, they will then find natural places to roost."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00283,2018-01-10-T-022,283,Koh Poh Koon,"So, I think in tackling this issue, it is not about deploying more and more technology. AVA adopts a science-based approach to see which of these methods can be an effective way to deter the birds. But no scientific method will deter birds from coming back to sources of food. This is where we need to continue to strengthen our public education, to also take enforcement actions where necessary against people who throw food particles out of their windows. They continue to constitute a source of attraction for the birds."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00284,2018-01-10-T-022,284,Koh Poh Koon,"So, I would say it is not just more methods. Some of these methods can be expensive and with very limited efficacy over a period of time. In the longer run, it is always more cost-effective and more durable if you work at the source of it which is to deter uncivil behaviour. And also to make sure that our food establishment in our estates continue to practise good habits, good practices of removing food wastes."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00285,2018-01-10-T-022,285,Gan Thiam Poh,"From the resident who gave me the feedback, I also understand that there was no throwing of food, no high-rise littering to attract birds. From the feedback I gathered, it is because the birds know where to source for the food. In fact, they fly into the house, fly into the flat whenever the residents prepare a nice dinner or nice lunch on the dining table. The bird even went into their house. The Senior Minister of State is right; that could be the source but we cannot really ask everybody to close their windows."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00286,2018-01-10-T-022,286,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand the concerns that Mr Gan is facing with some of these very sensitive issues especially."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00287,2018-01-10-T-022,287,Koh Poh Koon,"I think there are certain trees in which birds may be attracted to, especially those that could be fruiting. If there are specific tree types that do attract a certain particular species of birds, we can take this back to NParks and see if there are options to look at the species of trees in our housing estates."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00288,2018-01-10-T-022,288,Koh Poh Koon,"Beyond that, what AVA is trying to do is also to adopt certain trials to see whether there ways in which, regardless of how many trees we change, sometimes the birds just have some way of going to a particular tree. So, they are trying things like fogging methods, deterrent gels and some of these trials may take some time to mature before we know whether the method is efficacious. More importantly, it has to be cost-effective because at the end of the day, this involves extra spending by Town Councils which means conservancy charges will have to be taken in account, on how the money is being spent as well."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00289,2018-01-10-T-022,289,Koh Poh Koon,"At the end of the day we will explore science-based methods to see whether there are newer ways to deter the birds but immediately if you can recognise a certain species of trees, please let us know, we can get NParks to take a look as well."
2018-01-10-T-022-S-00290,2018-01-10-T-022,290,Deputy Speaker,"Order. End of question time. Ms Chia Yong Yong, do you have a clarification to make?"
2018-01-10-T-023-S-00291,2018-01-10-T-023,291,Chia Yong Yong,"Thank you, Sir. In relation to my speech during the Second Reading of the Charities (Amendment) Bill yesterday, I awaited to declare my interest. For the record, I declare that I am the President of SPD and the Director of SG Enable, both of which are charities regulated under the Charities Act."
2018-01-10-T-023-S-00292,2018-01-10-T-023,292,Deputy Speaker,Your clarification is noted. Order. Notice of Motion.

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00294,2018-01-10-T-024,294,K Shanmugam,*The motion reads as follows
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00295,2018-01-10-T-024,295,K Shanmugam,“(1) That Parliament appoints a Select Committee to examine and report on
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00296,2018-01-10-T-024,296,K Shanmugam,(a) the phenomenon of using digital technology to deliberately spread falsehoods online;
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00297,2018-01-10-T-024,297,K Shanmugam,"(b) the motivations and reasons for the spreading of such falsehoods, and the types of individuals and entities, both local and foreign, which engage in such activity;"

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00300,2018-01-10-T-024,300,K Shanmugam,(i) the principles that should guide Singapore's response; and
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00301,2018-01-10-T-024,301,K Shanmugam,"(ii) any specific measures, including legislation, that should be taken."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00305,2018-01-10-T-024,305,K Shanmugam,"Sir, the deliberate spread of online falsehoods today is a serious problem around the world. You see the details in the Green Paper that has been filed. It gives a framework for the Government’s reasons for bringing this Motion. Countries across the world have been the subject of organised deliberate disinformation campaigns − conducted both by state actors, targeted at destabilising other countries,"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00306,2018-01-10-T-024,306,K Shanmugam,Page  40
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00307,2018-01-10-T-024,307,K Shanmugam,"Most Members, if not all, would have come across these examples reported almost on a daily basis in the media. And the Green Paper sets out in a summary some of the more serious ones."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00308,2018-01-10-T-024,308,K Shanmugam,Why are we concerned? Because we are highly susceptible. Let me share three reasons.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00309,2018-01-10-T-024,309,K Shanmugam,"First, of course, the very high Internet penetration in Singapore. More than 91% of Singaporean households have Internet access. So, it is easy to attack and spread falsehoods in Singapore. We have seen it happening."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00310,2018-01-10-T-024,310,K Shanmugam,"Second, our diversity − as a multi-racial, multi-religious society. That makes it easy to exploit the fault-lines through falsehoods. You get completely fabricated stories spreading. For example, in June of last year, that cat and dog meat were mixed into a marinade of satay in a Geylang bazaar. That is a relatively minor example though it can make a lot of people very angry."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00311,2018-01-10-T-024,311,K Shanmugam,"But you have more serious examples from other countries. You see some of them in the Green Paper. People can and have targeted specific sections of populations. They can target specific sections of our population − using falsehoods based on race, religion."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00312,2018-01-10-T-024,312,K Shanmugam,"Third, our international position, both in this region and internationally, makes us an attractive target. We are a key strategic node, a key player in ASEAN. We are a trade hub, commercial hub, financial hub for this entire region. What we say on regional issues and international issues carries weight. So, if we can be influenced and swayed, then foreign interests can be advanced through us."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00313,2018-01-10-T-024,313,K Shanmugam,"We have been the subject of foreign interference in the past. The Green Paper again sets those out. Those are the obvious known examples. For example, a Malaysian politician financing a newspaper in Singapore which campaigns against National Service – you cannot get a more obvious example."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00314,2018-01-10-T-024,314,K Shanmugam,"Of course, technology has added a completely new dimension. Minister Yaacob will touch on the points relating to technology and how it has completely changed the landscape."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00315,2018-01-10-T-024,315,K Shanmugam,What can this do?
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00316,2018-01-10-T-024,316,K Shanmugam,"Wide spreading of falsehoods can drown out the facts, can cause people to be disillusioned, can be manipulated to create rifts and damage social cohesion. So, the people who shout loudest and shout falsehoods are those who will get hurt."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00317,2018-01-10-T-024,317,K Shanmugam,"Falsehoods, because they tend to be focused on playing to people's feelings and getting them to be angry by putting forward points which are completely fabricated."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00318,2018-01-10-T-024,318,K Shanmugam,"A very senior officer in Sweden is reported by BBC to have said – and this was reported last week – disinformation as a tool, as a campaign, in the context of Sweden has had effect. It affects Sweden's ""fundamental values  freedom of speech, democracy and individual rights""."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00320,2018-01-10-T-024,320,K Shanmugam,"Ultimately, if left unchecked, such deliberate spread of online falsehoods can undermine trust in the country, in the institutions, in democracy and affect social cohesion."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00321,2018-01-10-T-024,321,K Shanmugam,"So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am asking Parliament to appoint a Select Committee, to examine and report on the causes and consequences of deliberate online falsehoods; and the countermeasures that will be required to prevent and combat them in Singapore."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00322,2018-01-10-T-024,322,K Shanmugam,"The Government has been studying this problem for a while. The Select Committee can study the issue in depth with a smaller group of Members of Parliament (MPs), and then present a report to Parliament."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00323,2018-01-10-T-024,323,K Shanmugam,"It will be open to the Select Committee to decide whether to hold public hearings, whether to hear from witnesses. I think it will be useful to do so. The process will allow for a formal dialogue with selected groups."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00324,2018-01-10-T-024,324,K Shanmugam,"The composition of the Select Committee, we suggest, the default position is for 10 members − nine Government MPs and one MP from the Opposition bench − but we propose replacing one of the Government MPs with a Nominated MP, to have more diversity. So, we will have − eight Government MPs, one opposition MP and one NMP."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00325,2018-01-10-T-024,325,K Shanmugam,"The Terms of Reference have been broadly framed, intentionally. So, the Select Committee will have to consider relevant views and options."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00326,2018-01-10-T-024,326,K Shanmugam,"Sir, I ask that a Select Committee be appointed to examine this problem thoroughly, consult as widely as possible, and come up with countermeasures on how we can protect Singapore against this threat. I beg to move."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00329,2018-01-10-T-024,329,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, let me state from the outset that the issue goes beyond tackling online falsehoods per se. More fundamentally, it is about maintaining our sovereignty, as well as the multi-racial nature of our society, by ensuring that those who wish to do us harm by peddling falsehoods online do not succeed."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00330,2018-01-10-T-024,330,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"As we have seen in other countries, deliberate campaigns to proliferate falsehoods online have caused panic and confusion, worsened societal fault-lines and eroded trust in public institutions. If unchecked, they may result in grave consequences for the country's social and political discourse. Let us not forget that Singapore has fallen victim to foreign interference through falsehood and misinformation before."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00331,2018-01-10-T-024,331,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Page  42
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00332,2018-01-10-T-024,332,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"In the Internet age, falsehoods can go viral in seconds. Digital content can be easily manipulated to make it more provocative and stir emotions more easily. Anyone can publish or share falsehoods online, even from halfway around the world. And the nett result is that online falsehoods can destabilise societies far more easily than ever before."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00333,2018-01-10-T-024,333,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Take, for example, the example of the now defunct, The Real Singaporean or TRS website, which my Ministry shut down in May 2015. TRS published doctored articles which sensational headlines as clickbait to increase traffic to its website so as to inflate its readership and earn more advertising dollars."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00334,2018-01-10-T-024,334,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"In February 2015, TRS published a false article on a Filipino family complaining about the noise from a Thaipusam procession involving Indian Singaporeans. Such an incident never happened. The article was deliberately fabricated and falsely attributed the incident to innocent parties to fuel anti-foreigner sentiments. It went viral and created tensions between our local Indian community and the Filipinos living in Singapore."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00335,2018-01-10-T-024,335,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Fortunately, we acted swiftly to prevent TRS from doing further harm. The two editors of the TRS were convicted in court for sedition and MCI cancelled the Class Licence of the TRS website."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00336,2018-01-10-T-024,336,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, recent events worldwide also show that foreign countries can also use online falsehoods to undermine confidence and trust in national institutions and the electoral process. It was estimated that 126 million Americans were exposed to 80,000 pieces of Russian-linked content targeted to influence the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential Elections."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00337,2018-01-10-T-024,337,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"In the UK, foreign Twitter accounts posted four tweets in the month leading up to the UK Referendum, such as how millions of Turkish people will move to the UK, if the UK voted to remain in the EU. Such falsehoods aimed to influence voters and the outcomes of elections. These outcomes in some cases changed the course of the countries, like what Brexit appears to have done."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00338,2018-01-10-T-024,338,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"But let me clarify that we are not against technology. Technology is agnostic. It is the people and actors abusing technology to spread online falsehoods that are the problem. And indeed, technology has improved our lives in many ways, and while technology can be used to divide societies, so too can it be used to bring people together, such as by connecting communities across the world, or mobilising volunteers during crises. That said, as technology continues to push the frontiers of reality, it will be easier to create false information and damage societies."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00339,2018-01-10-T-024,339,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"So, for instance, in 2016, Professors at Stanford University and the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg demonstrated how technologies can record a video of people"

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00341,2018-01-10-T-024,341,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Adobe launched a new product in 2016 called ""Photoshop for Audio"", which allows users to feed about 10 to 20 minutes of someone's voice into an application. The user then type any words he or she wants to say, which will be expressed in the same exact voice. The resultant voice sounds virtually indistinguishable from the real and does not sound computer-generated at all. This can be used to impersonate anyone, even Heads of States."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00342,2018-01-10-T-024,342,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Singapore is especially vulnerable to this for several reasons. First, we are a small and multi-racial society that can be easily overwhelmed by a larger adversary, taking advantage of our societal fault-lines. Second, Singapore has one of the highest smartphone penetration rates in the world at almost 150%. People can easily access the Internet and social media on their smartphones anytime and anywhere, and hence, are more susceptible to the spread of online falsehoods. And third, while we have a population that is technology-savvy, it is an entirely different matter, whether we have the ability discern truth from falsehood."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00343,2018-01-10-T-024,343,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,A Government poll in May 2017 showed that one in four Singaporeans frequently come across online news that was not fully accurate. Two in three of them were unable to recognise some or all of the falsities. And one in four admitted to sharing news that they later found was fake.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00344,2018-01-10-T-024,344,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, efforts to tackle this problem are already on the way. Organisations, such as the Media Literary Council and Government agencies like the NLB, have developed programmes and resources to raise public standards of media literacy."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00345,2018-01-10-T-024,345,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"While public education remains our first line of defence, it is not enough. Mechanisms need to be put in place to respond swiftly to these falsehoods. So, we need an inclusive approach to address these issues holistically, involving not only the public sector, but the private and people sectors too. And we need a broader national conversation about this issue so everyone has a shared understanding of the threat and a sense of ownership about the solution."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00346,2018-01-10-T-024,346,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Hence, Sir, I fully support this Motion to convene a Select Committee on online falsehood. This will allow us to consult widely and tap on the collective wisdom of the community and stakeholders."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00347,2018-01-10-T-024,347,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, we look forward to hearing its deliberations and suggestions, so that we can keep Singapore a sovereign, cohesive and united society together."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00348,2018-01-10-T-024,348,Sun Xueling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to support the Motion. We have heard from the Ministers why deliberate online falsehoods have become a global problem. I would like to argue that Singapore as an international, multi-ethnic, small and open country faces the issue of deliberate online falsehoods, even more acutely than others."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00350,2018-01-10-T-024,350,Sun Xueling,"These are actually strengths. We have an active, well-read and inquisitive population. We have ready access to information, across borders, across time, across languages. We are not barred from accessing information. We can read and write all sorts of things online. But these very strengths can also be used against us, when we face the onslaught of online falsehoods."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00351,2018-01-10-T-024,351,Sun Xueling,"We are a small, densely populated nation. We are also multi-racial and multi-religious. Everything that the world faces, we can face here, in a quicker time, with a nearer striking distance. Given how small we are, falsehoods can spread online in seconds, reaching a large segment of population and causing great inconvenience to everyone."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00352,2018-01-10-T-024,352,Sun Xueling,"Let me give you an example. When false news of the roof collapse at Waterway Terraces I, which is in my ward, broke, I was on the phone in seconds calling up the Town Council, calling up my grassroots leaders to rush there as soon as they can while I drive there from another part of town. The false news was taken down in half an hour but many things happened within that half hour. SPF, SCDF despatched vehicles and manpower. Residents congregated at the scene. Other residents texted to say that they were rushing home. And even after the news was taken down, to play safe, I still mobilised the Town Council to go around check for cracks on walls. So, this might be someone’s idea of a joke but it was not a very efficient use of time and resources."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00353,2018-01-10-T-024,353,Sun Xueling,"Because of how small Singapore is and how connected we are, we can mobilise quickly to respond to situations. In the example that I just provided, everyone was rushing to the scene to provide help. But what if our speed and proximity instead ended up harming us?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00354,2018-01-10-T-024,354,Sun Xueling,"Recently, in Wichita Kansas, an innocent man was shot dead by the police after pranksters called the police to say that he had shot one of his family members and was holding the rest of them hostage. The police SWAT team responded quickly and in force, went down to his doorstep and shot him dead at his doorstep. All because of false information."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00355,2018-01-10-T-024,355,Sun Xueling,"It is also not altogether unimaginable if online falsehoods on a financial institution were put up, leading to a bank run or if someone wanted to agitate foreign workers in Singapore and put up something to say that Singaporeans bullied them."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00356,2018-01-10-T-024,356,Sun Xueling,"Repeated instances of deliberate online falsehoods can also have costs as it can lead to a ""cry wolf syndrome"", whereby when a real emergency strikes, no one reacts because everybody is accustomed to thinking it is false news."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00357,2018-01-10-T-024,357,Sun Xueling,"In recent months, several countries, Germany, France, the UK and Ireland have moved quickly to protect themselves by enacting laws to limit fake news and punish purveyors and websites who either disseminate or fail to take down fake news. Foreign agents and organisations have been identified as seeding fake news to attack these large countries. We should not think that we are immune to this. Rivalry between states have existed since time immemorial."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00359,2018-01-10-T-024,359,Sun Xueling,How then do we tackle this? Do we take a big stick and censor all information online? That would be akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Our openness and access to information is one of our key strengths and has played a key role in creating a thriving and international city out of Singapore.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00360,2018-01-10-T-024,360,Sun Xueling,Do we legislate laws to tackle online falsehoods? It sounds reasonable to penalise those who choose to act irresponsibly and deliberately spread online falsehoods and to create safeguards to ensure that that does not happen. But where do we draw the lines? How do we distinguish those who knowingly create or spread online falsehood from those who are just expressing their opinions? How do we ensure that legislating laws to tackle online falsehood will not end up impeding our right to free speech?
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00361,2018-01-10-T-024,361,Sun Xueling,"Or is part of the solution also to encourage greater media literacy in our citizens, so that they can discern truth from falsehood and working with technology companies to use algorithms to distil facts from fiction?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00362,2018-01-10-T-024,362,Sun Xueling,"I worry about relying solely on the efforts of companies to self-regulate or putting the onus of responsibility on citizens to discern truth from falsehood because if that alone were enough, we would not see online falsehoods proliferating and affecting so many countries worldwide."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00363,2018-01-10-T-024,363,Sun Xueling,"That said, I believe the Motion proposed by the Minister to have a Select Committee examine and report on the problems posed by online falsehood and various ways to tackle them is a worthwhile step forward. The problems posed by online falsehoods with the wide ramifications across all sections of society, rapid speed of transmission and seriousness of disruption to security, financial stability and religious harmony – are all serious enough to warrant convening a Select Committee. I am supportive of the broadly drafted terms of reference – they reflect the fact that the Select Committee will be considering all options, fairly and objectively."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00364,2018-01-10-T-024,364,Sun Xueling,"I would, however, like to ask the Minister how the Select Committee will be organised, how views will be sought and how the public can participate in the process.

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00367,2018-01-10-T-024,367,Sun Xueling,(b) that the process is inclusive so that representations can be received from all sectors and stakeholders and we benefit from their opinions and breadth of knowledge;

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00369,2018-01-10-T-024,369,Sun Xueling,(d) that all options are considered and the recommendations are something that Singaporeans can read for themselves and consider for themselves.

This is not accidental, as there were many terror attacks all over the world last year. Besides terror attacks, there is another weapon which can also cause fear and anxiety in society and destroy social cohesion. This weapon is more insidious and harmful in the long term, but it is often overlooked by people. That is false news."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00372,2018-01-10-T-024,372,Sun Xueling,False news can spread in seconds to a large population and pose a major hidden danger for the society.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00373,2018-01-10-T-024,373,Sun Xueling,"I have personally witnessed how false news can cause damage in my constituency, Punggol. There was news that the roof of a HDB block had collapsed. Although this news was deleted after half an hour, public agencies had already despatched vehicles and manpower to the site within that half an hour. False news has caused the wastage of public resources which could have been used on things that need them more."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00374,2018-01-10-T-024,374,Sun Xueling,"We can imagine what would happen if the false news is not about a collapsed roof but about credit issue of a bank. If the depositors or investors see the false news and a run-on-the-bank happens, the bank will then close down, resulting in real capital loss. Deliberate false news is harmful for the economy and people's lives."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00375,2018-01-10-T-024,375,Sun Xueling,"A new word has emerged these days called ""post-truth politics"" to describe a situation whereby the real truth does not matter anymore and that the situation is driven by people's emotions. The Oxford Dictionary has even listed the word as a key word for 2016, which shows how widespread this phenomenon has become internationally."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00376,2018-01-10-T-024,376,Sun Xueling,"False news is the key instrument to incite people's feelings and create post-truth politics. False news can target a certain community or race in society, instil racial and religious ideology, and breed extremist ideas. This kind of slow and subtle influence can lead to a social divide and affect social stability."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00378,2018-01-10-T-024,378,Sun Xueling,"Internationally, there are already people using the Internet to interfere with other countries' politics. They tend to possess powerful resources and advanced Internet technology. They can fabricate false news to infuriate people in another country, cause domestic turmoil and may even influence regime change."

We cannot rely solely on the efforts of companies to self-regulate, because there may be people who profit from fabricating false news. Neither can we put the onus on citizens to separate truth from falsehood. This is irresponsible."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00384,2018-01-10-T-024,384,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the deliberate spreading of falsehoods is not a novel phenomenon. For as long as human societies existed, there would always be incidence of rumours, untruths being spread in various media. Such falsehoods affect people, relationships, the way people see things, and ultimately, impacts on the society. Human societies have managed to cope and deal with such incidents and its consequences. However, with the advent of digital technology, the spread of falsehoods and its impact on communities have reached unprecedented levels. The spread of deliberate online falsehood is, therefore, of particular concern."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00385,2018-01-10-T-024,385,Rahayu Mahzam,"Firstly, the manner in which we receive and share information has changed significantly. There are now many more information systems and platforms which translates to more means and ways by which falsehoods can be spread. With the proliferation via social media, falsehoods spread much faster. We now have the concept of ""going viral"", a problem which we never had to deal with before. There is now instant communication – Twitter, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Telegram – and with a click of a button, an individual could share information to many others almost immediately. On Facebook, an individual could share a post to 5,000 people. On a single WhatsApp group, you can have up to 256 members. Imagine the extent of the reach in numerous WhatsApp groups."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00386,2018-01-10-T-024,386,Rahayu Mahzam,"Secondly, as individuals, we all receive and share information with the same groups of people. It is natural for people who think alike to come together and share views. The Internet has made it easier for us to talk amongst ourselves with people of like-minded views. In such context, we end up confirming each other’s pre-existing views and reinforce our own biases. Often in such groups, there is no other source of information coming into our circle. We therefore form echo chambers and this amplifies the impact of any falsehoods spread within the group."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00387,2018-01-10-T-024,387,Rahayu Mahzam,"Thirdly, there are people taking advantage of the new means of human communication and the human psyche to spread falsehoods. The identities of those creating or proliferating falsehoods online are hidden behind the screen of anonymity, such that they are emboldened to spread the falsehoods. There have been and will continue to be unsavoury people who would use the online platforms to propagate falsehoods for their own desirable ends and to pursue their own agendas."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00388,2018-01-10-T-024,388,Rahayu Mahzam,"In addition, it is observed that in many places, the mainstream media no longer holds the same degree of trust it had with the people. The people have a preference to refer to"

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00390,2018-01-10-T-024,390,Rahayu Mahzam,"An indication of the severity of the spread of online falsehoods was given at the World Economic Forum in 2014, where the rapid spread of misinformation online was considered the 10th top trend of global significance."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00391,2018-01-10-T-024,391,Rahayu Mahzam,I believe we can all appreciate the significant adverse impact online falsehoods can have on communities. Just look at the buzz that was caused when many people received the message that NTUC Fairprice was giving out gift cards. A friend said that she saw a lady insisting for a gift card at one of the outlets. The implications can be even more serious.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00392,2018-01-10-T-024,392,Rahayu Mahzam,"For example, when terror attacks occurred in Paris in November 2015, a video went viral claiming that London Muslims were celebrating the attacks. In reality, it was a video of a celebration of a victory by Pakistan in a cricket match. The hoax fed into the anger against Muslims in the aftermath of the Paris attacks."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00393,2018-01-10-T-024,393,Rahayu Mahzam,"As a Muslim minority in Singapore, I cringe every time I hear news of terror attacks. I always worry about the distrust that could develop against the Muslims in Singapore. It is one of my greatest fears that an online falsehood could trigger anger against the Muslim community here. There could be disastrous implications if this happens in Singapore. The impact to Singapore may be irreversible. The problem of the spread of online falsehoods is a very real problem and merits immediate attention."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00394,2018-01-10-T-024,394,Rahayu Mahzam,"So, we know the problem, but what do we do about it? There are numerous ways to address the spread of online falsehoods but the current measures appear inadequate."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00395,2018-01-10-T-024,395,Rahayu Mahzam,"Currently, there are statutes like the Telecommunications Act and the Broadcasting Act, which may apply but there are gaps. For instance, under the Telecommunications Act, it is an offence to transmit a message knowing that it is false. However, in practice, this provision has been ineffective in properly addressing the spread of online falsehoods. The circulation of falsehoods is hard to circumvent, given how quickly they go viral today. One person could possibly be held accountable under the Statute for sending the message containing the falsehood but its virulent spread thereafter, cannot be adequately dealt with using existing provisions in law."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00396,2018-01-10-T-024,396,Rahayu Mahzam,"The technology companies are also making effort to take steps to stop the spread of falsehoods by flagging information to consumers or by taking down the posts which breach community standards. In December 2016, Facebook began showing a ""disputed"" warning next to articles that third-party checking websites said were fake news. However, researchers subsequently highlighted to Facebook that this method is ineffective as it was actually entrenching deeply held beliefs. Therefore, Facebook will no longer display these red warning icons but instead display links to related articles next to the disputed news stories."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00397,2018-01-10-T-024,397,Rahayu Mahzam,"There are also some ground-up efforts of fact-checking that are emerging. In October 2017, NUS, SUTD, Google and the Media Literacy Council, supported by The Straits Times, organised a hackathon to solve the problem of online falsehoods. This is an encouraging effort, but I believe it is still too early to tell how successful this will be in the fight against online falsehoods."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00399,2018-01-10-T-024,399,Rahayu Mahzam,I am very glad therefore that this Motion has been put forth for a Select Committee to examine the various aspects of online falsehoods and propose some measures. I note the terms of reference of the Select Committee set out in the Motion and agree with the same.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00400,2018-01-10-T-024,400,Rahayu Mahzam,"I would comment on the reference to possible legislative measures. This would indeed be a natural and obvious response. I trust though, that the Government will not only be considering legislative options. Although, legislation would regulate conduct in relation to the spread of online falsehoods, I believe there are other efforts that could be put in place including public education. I would therefore ask if the Government could consider legislation as part of a wider, more multi-pronged approach."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00401,2018-01-10-T-024,401,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to say a few words in Malay."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00402,2018-01-10-T-024,402,Rahayu Mahzam,(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The development of digital technology in this era has changed the way we communicate and has an effect on the spread of information. One of the consequences is the spread of online falsehoods on an unprecedented scale. All types of falsehoods can spread very quickly and its impact on society is quite significant.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00403,2018-01-10-T-024,403,Rahayu Mahzam,"One example is a video that became viral, that purportedly show Muslims in London celebrating the Paris terrorist attack in November 2015. In reality, the video was a recording of a group of people celebrating Pakistan’s victory in a cricket match. This hoax has further stoked anger and hatred towards Muslims after the Paris incident."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00404,2018-01-10-T-024,404,Rahayu Mahzam,Just imagine if a similar situation happens in Singapore. Race relations in Singapore may become fractured and the lives of our multi-racial and multi-religious society will be affected.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00405,2018-01-10-T-024,405,Rahayu Mahzam,"Therefore, it is important that we act quickly to prevent the spread of online falsehoods. The current efforts are inadequate to resolve this problem. We must think of more effective solutions. The problem of online falsehoods cannot be resolved by a single group. The Government, tech companies, media, society – they must all play their part. We must work as one country in order to achieve an effective outcome."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00406,2018-01-10-T-024,406,Rahayu Mahzam,"Hence, I welcome the proposal to form a Select Committee to study the spread of online falsehoods and propose measures to overcome them."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00407,2018-01-10-T-024,407,Rahayu Mahzam,"(In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this Motion."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00408,2018-01-10-T-024,408,Kok Heng Leun,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am very glad that the Government has put up this Motion to call for setting up of a Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00409,2018-01-10-T-024,409,Kok Heng Leun,"I applaud the Government for taking this approach because this is a very important issue, affecting every Singaporean, young and old, and hence, a call for extensive and in-depth discussion and deliberation is most important."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00410,2018-01-10-T-024,410,Kok Heng Leun,Page  50
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00411,2018-01-10-T-024,411,Kok Heng Leun,"In 2017, Minister Shanmugam, in replying Members of the House, identified three situations of such things. And I would quote him"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00412,2018-01-10-T-024,412,Kok Heng Leun,"""Genuine feedback – it could be in error where the person could have made a mistake but genuine, well-intentioned feedback or complaints because there is a difference of viewpoints, allegations based on an honest belief in certain facts; that is one category. That is understandable. Generally, there should be no consequences for that. The second category where the complaint is justified, feedback is justified, and we must take action. The third category is what the Member is focused on, which is false, deliberate, malicious allegations. We are not talking about errors, we are talking about deliberate falsehoods, malice."""
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00413,2018-01-10-T-024,413,Kok Heng Leun,"And so, I would look forward to the Select Committee to look especially into this third category that the Minister has mentioned and examine deeply the consequences of these falsehoods."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00414,2018-01-10-T-024,414,Kok Heng Leun,"In the UK, there was a call for submission on the understanding of fake news by the British parliament. And, on the website, you can see that parliament actually wants the British public to define what is fake news. The second thing which I thought is really important is, I quote, ""Where does biased but legitimate commentary shade into propaganda and lies?"" I think this second point is very important for the Select Committee to look at. Because this Government has been advocating for more active citizenry, hoping that Singaporeans would be more involved in discourse and discussions. We have seen more Singaporeans speaking up and, of course, the social media has provided that platform for them to express their views. We do not want a heavy handed approach that will be root out constructive, though at times, disagreeable voices."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00415,2018-01-10-T-024,415,Kok Heng Leun,"Hence, I hope that the Select Committee will consider, if there are to be new legislation against deliberate online falsehoods, that it needs to balance the interest of protecting national security and preserving public order with the interests of"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00416,2018-01-10-T-024,416,Kok Heng Leun,"(a) enabling individuals to have meaningful discussions on issues of concern, including Government policies, without fear of having action taken against them, and"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00417,2018-01-10-T-024,417,Kok Heng Leun,"(b) enabling the media, both professional and citizen journalists, to report on such issues of concern."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00418,2018-01-10-T-024,418,Kok Heng Leun,"Where the media is concerned, for example, should there be a responsible journalism defence? Thus, if a media outlet acts responsibly before publishing a story, for example, by conducting inquiries into whether an incident did in fact happen, and by approaching the authorities for a comment, should it be free from liability even if it later turns out that the story contains some inaccuracies? Also, provided that the media has made such inquiries, if it is merely reporting what someone else says without endorsing what has been said, should it be free from liability?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00419,2018-01-10-T-024,419,Kok Heng Leun,"However, I would urge the Select Committee to look at what our present law provisions have as a starting point. Such laws include the Broadcasting (Class Licence)"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00420,2018-01-10-T-024,420,Kok Heng Leun,Page  51
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00421,2018-01-10-T-024,421,Kok Heng Leun,"The Green Paper mentioned – and just now Minister Yaacob also mentioned –the case of the TRS incident. The relevant authorities have moved swiftly and under the existing laws, dealt with that issue. And, in fact, based on what I have observed, very quickly, that piece of falsehood was quashed and the public understood and knew and did not circulate it anymore. I think this demonstrates that our existing laws and provision have been effective. Based on this, we should start our discussion on whether we need new legislation."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00422,2018-01-10-T-024,422,Kok Heng Leun,"I am not saying that these Acts are perfect and do not require review. Indeed, some of these laws give very broad powers to the authorities, and it may be that they should themselves be reviewed but to ensure that the interests of individuals that I have mentioned previously are properly recognised."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00423,2018-01-10-T-024,423,Kok Heng Leun,"But one of the concerns about online platforms is that news would spread so quickly. So, when there is a falsehood being put up, how do we respond as swiftly? And to act swiftly and to respond swiftly, we just cannot depend only on law enforcers. No matter how tough the law is, any person with intention to sabotage with fake news or falsehood would still do it, for profit or for malice."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00424,2018-01-10-T-024,424,Kok Heng Leun,"Hence, the responsibility of citizens becomes important. To stop the spreading of news, it needs the citizens to be vigilant, to take up responsibility but not to vigilante. Hence, in this age of social media, the people's responsibility then, must include the ability to discern and make up their mind what news are dubious and what are falsehoods."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00425,2018-01-10-T-024,425,Kok Heng Leun,"Media literacy is important and should be inculcated in all levels of society  in schools, in community set-ups, in workplaces and even at home. Any good literacy programme must be taught critically so that those who are learning it will learn how to think critically. So, I hope the Select Committee will look at how to further our media literacy outreach, and not just going to schools, but to workplaces, community and grassroots sites."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00426,2018-01-10-T-024,426,Kok Heng Leun,"But I also that this is a wonderful opportunity for everyone to start thinking about these issues, and to ride on the work of the Select Committee that will gain public attention, that the Government should consider, at the same time, put out sustainable engagement programmes on media literacy at all of these sites that I have just mentioned."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00427,2018-01-10-T-024,427,Kok Heng Leun,"As the world become more complex, no one person or institution, can claim to hold truth, to have all information. Hence, everyone contribute to providing information to help to discover truths and to fact-check. Fake news preys on the confirmation biasness of its readers. And so, as it travels very quickly, unsuspecting public would be taken in very quickly. So, to help public learn to discern truths, facts and opinions from lies and falsehoods, it is important that there is a high level of transparency of information flowing especially, from authority. The earlier when information is being shared,"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00428,2018-01-10-T-024,428,Kok Heng Leun,Page  52
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00429,2018-01-10-T-024,429,Kok Heng Leun,"I also hope that the Select Committee would also look at multiple independent fact-checking bodies that would allow the public to fact-check, cross reference so that they can make decisions themselves."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00430,2018-01-10-T-024,430,Kok Heng Leun,"I would also like to ask the Select Committee, when calling out for public engagement, again, to allow more time for consultation. A recent incident was the draft of the Film Act where we had only nine days to make that submission and we had to appeal for another two more weeks for that submission. And I hope that this will not happen. But at the same time, I wonder would the Select Committee consider, because this is an issue of such a broad concern, that there may be disagreement within the Select Committee in terms of what to do, that there should be provisions for minority reports in the Select Committee report."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00431,2018-01-10-T-024,431,Kok Heng Leun,"And finally, Rebecca Solnit, in her book ""Hope in the Dark"" talks about how ordinary people that appear in Superhero movies produced by Hollywood are always portrayed to be passive, clueless, cowardly and helpless, because without the clueless public, Superheroes cannot perform their tasks. But in real life, we realise that people are not that clueless. And I think, in the fighting of online falsehoods, we need all people to be responsible – the people, the Government, the media, the civil society, because we really cannot wait for Superheroes in those crisis moments."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00432,2018-01-10-T-024,432,Christopher de Souza,"Sir, thank you for letting me join in on this debate. I have three points – all three points support the intention to refer the issue of deliberate online falsehoods to a Select Committee."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00433,2018-01-10-T-024,433,Christopher de Souza,"First, even as we try to tackle the problem of deliberate online falsehoods upstream, to be truly inoculated to the adverse impacts of falsehoods, people need discernment to differentiate between truth and falsehoods. This is because of the ubiquitous nature of online falsehoods. I refer to paragraph 14(b) of the Green Paper to put things into perspective  36,746 Twitter accounts generated approximately 1.4 million automated, election-related tweets. Additionally, the repudiation of an article as false is often announced hours after the viral impact and seldom reaches all the audiences. False news may also continue to circulate making the article that repudiated it seem outdated."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00434,2018-01-10-T-024,434,Christopher de Souza,"According to a study done by the Communications and New Media Department at NUS and the Institute of Policy Studies, younger Singaporeans have an optimism bias. That survey showed that Singaporeans who are more optimistically biased tend to ""evaluate the news they receive on social media as less credible"" and that they ""tend to search for more information"". This scepticism that leads people to dig deeper is encouraging."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00435,2018-01-10-T-024,435,Christopher de Souza,"Nevertheless, the value of repetition and perceived corroboration may pose difficulty with automated accounts and multiple websites putting up the same unreliable information."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00436,2018-01-10-T-024,436,Christopher de Souza,"Furthermore, even as people need to disbelieve falsehood, they need to be able to discern what is true, what is reliable. An article entitled ""US kids suss out the truth about"

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00438,2018-01-10-T-024,438,Christopher de Souza,"This is not an easy task. Though the phenomenon of ""fake news"" is not a new 21st century phenomenon but more like an upgraded or multiplied upgraded version of rumours, the rise of technology has exacerbated the issue. In an age of increasing technology sophistication, artificial intelligence can fabricate a scenery that had not existed. It is possible to make a video showing Barack Obama saying things he did not actually say – all without compromising the perceived authenticity of the video, a point alluded to by Minister Yaacob in his speech."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00439,2018-01-10-T-024,439,Christopher de Souza,"Even without sophisticated technology, a simple deliberate miscaptioning and hence, repurposing of an old picture or video, can paint a very misleading picture. For example, in Italy, a government Minister's appearance at a funeral was falsely captioned to make it appear as if she was mourning a mafia boss. Using an apparently trustworthy news article but adding unverified and misleading facts can turn groups of people against each other. When that happens, the corroboration of articles seems to enhance the perceived credibility of the article rather than expose its falsehood."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00440,2018-01-10-T-024,440,Christopher de Souza,"Other ways to increase the audience reach and strengthen perceived veracity by enhancing popularity are through automated bots and phantom accounts. Social media has also become a platform for individuals and larger entities to transcend traditional territorial boundaries to irresponsibly wield the sword of the keyboard to manipulate politics, destabilise a country, increase polarisation or to simply get rich. The Internet has enabled a cloak of anonymity to increase the lack of accountability and enable an easy masquerade of a credible news site through subtle changes to a website domain."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00441,2018-01-10-T-024,441,Christopher de Souza,"While it is not easy, tackling deliberate online falsehoods is important for our future as a nation, for our future as a democracy, for our future as ""one united people""."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00442,2018-01-10-T-024,442,Christopher de Souza,"Allow me, Sir, to move on to my second point  falsehoods can divide us but we need to stand united − united as one multiracial Singapore. We need to safeguard our social cohesion."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00443,2018-01-10-T-024,443,Christopher de Souza,"Unity is important, and unity can be threatened by false allegations. A Straits Times article on India’s fight against fake news reported that false images had been circulated on Twitter purporting to show Rohingyas persecuting Hindus in the Rakhine province, where the Muslim Rohingyas have been fleeing alleged persecution. In that instance, the purported victims were repainted as the oppressors, exploiting the tension in Myanmar towards the Rohingyas. These examples show how false allegations can target and wrongfully exacerbate society’s fault lines and threaten unity."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00444,2018-01-10-T-024,444,Christopher de Souza,Page  54
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00445,2018-01-10-T-024,445,Christopher de Souza,This brings me to my third point. People who tell the truth do not need to and should not be afraid of the actions to be taken. I repeat  people who tell the truth do not need to and should not be afraid of the actions that will be taken.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00446,2018-01-10-T-024,446,Christopher de Souza,"There is a difference, of course, between falsehoods and truths that we do not like to hear. The Green Paper is entitled ""Deliberate Online Falsehoods"". It is not entitled ""prohibiting hard truths""."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00447,2018-01-10-T-024,447,Christopher de Souza,"It is important for a democracy to work that ideas be exchanged. However, concocting a collage out of unrelated data, then squeezing an untenable conclusion out of it and then attempting to pass off that conclusion as truth − now, that is dangerous and should be avoided. Why?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00448,2018-01-10-T-024,448,Christopher de Souza,"Because it misleads people. Simply put, there is no interest in being misinformed. This is especially so when important decisions have to be made."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00449,2018-01-10-T-024,449,Christopher de Souza,"Therefore, while we should not hamper constructive discussion and the expression of viewpoints, we need to make sure that decisions are based on the foundation of truth and not the shifting sands of falsehood. An example of how falsehoods may hamper democracy can be seen in the Brexit situation where there was a misleading poll with shaky extrapolation that caused people to think that millions of Turkish people would move to the UK if it voted to remain in the European Union. What would happen if such important decisions were made based on these false premises?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00450,2018-01-10-T-024,450,Christopher de Souza,"Another example is how, during the recent elections in the US and UK, supporters of a particular candidate or party had been encouraged to vote via invalid methods or on an invalid day. If voters acted on this, the electoral process by which democracy is effected would not function as it was meant to be."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00451,2018-01-10-T-024,451,Christopher de Souza,"Today, Sir, the motion is to refer the question of which principles should apply to the regulation of deliberate online falsehoods. Such a reference is needed. If falsehoods continue to influence the minds of people across sensitive issues, such as our multi-racial identity and our national security, then our unity will be at stake."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00452,2018-01-10-T-024,452,Christopher de Souza,"So, we need to act − and we need to act now."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00453,2018-01-10-T-024,453,Ganesh Rajaram,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of this motion by the Ministry of Law to appoint a Select Committee to examine and report on deliberate online falsehoods."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00454,2018-01-10-T-024,454,Ganesh Rajaram,"As stated in the Green paper and reinforced by the Ministers today, online falsehoods, or '""fake news"", as it is more commonly known, can have very serious and debilitating consequences for societies. We have seen how polarising the effects can be in countries like the United States and France in recent years. We have also had our own share of fake news occurrences in Singapore."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00455,2018-01-10-T-024,455,Ganesh Rajaram,Page  55
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00456,2018-01-10-T-024,456,Ganesh Rajaram,"This incident, and many others like it, tell us that online falsehoods or fake news is a phenomenon that is not going to go away. Indeed, it is going to be more prevalent as the world becomes digital and reliant on social media and online platforms for news."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00457,2018-01-10-T-024,457,Ganesh Rajaram,"So, how do we combat this phenomenon, knowing that it is something that we cannot control? I would like to suggest three possible approaches that perhaps could be further explored by the Committee."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00458,2018-01-10-T-024,458,Ganesh Rajaram,"Firstly, speed and magnitude of response. One of the areas that the Government and the community have to work on is creating multiple credible platforms to push out accurate information, corrections and rebuttals. The Singapore Government has 16 Ministries and 61 Statutory Boards − and I am not even including Government-linked companies here. Each Ministry and Statutory Board has its own website and social media channels. In confronting fake news that is viral and in danger of triggering a nationwide panic, there must be an immediate response across all channels to ensure that the accurate information drowns out the fake news."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00459,2018-01-10-T-024,459,Ganesh Rajaram,"Mainstream news media outlets can help lead this charge by enhancing their credibility. At a Digital Media Conference in November last year, The Straits Times Editor and Editor-in-Chief of the Singapore Press Holdings' English, Malay and Tamil Media Group, Mr Warren Fernandez, said, ""Societies have to find a way to make sure that good content gets out there because if you don’t do anything about it, bad content will drive out good content""."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00460,2018-01-10-T-024,460,Ganesh Rajaram,"I agree completely with this point, and feel strongly that newsrooms of today can do a lot more. One could make the argument that most Singaporeans get their news in real time from platforms like Facebook because even the mainstream news media today get their news and videos from Facebook. But I believe that this can change with more robust and credible news gathering and reporting."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00461,2018-01-10-T-024,461,Ganesh Rajaram,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in situations of critical importance, beyond Government platforms and mainstream news media, we should also consider immediately marshalling social media influencers here in Singapore to help us get the word out as fast as possible. While we all know that our very own Prime Minister Lee is one of the biggest social media influencers in Singapore because of the sheer number of followers across his social media channels, there are others who also have a wider reach. For us to combat fake news with immediacy and magnitude, it is critical that we engage as many credible influencers as possible."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00462,2018-01-10-T-024,462,Ganesh Rajaram,The other approach which the Committee could focus on is education. I was pleased to read this week that tertiary institutions in Singapore are taking up the fight against
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00463,2018-01-10-T-024,463,Ganesh Rajaram,Page  56
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00464,2018-01-10-T-024,464,Ganesh Rajaram,"While that’s a great start, I feel that the education has to start at a much earlier stage − at pre-school. If you go to any restaurant or hawker centre in Singapore today, toddlers watching content on iPads and mobile phones are the norm. Most kids learn to use iPads and mobile phones even before they learn how to speak. Sadly, when my son was growing up, these devices were not available. In this digital age, parents and teachers need to teach kids about the difference between what is ""fake"" and what is ""true"". It is akin to teaching our children not to talk to strangers. To be able to tell the difference between what is fake and what is true has to be ingrained in kids from young. This is not something that can be solved by legislation. This needs a whole-of-Singapore approach – everyone from parents to grandparents to teachers need to get involved."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00465,2018-01-10-T-024,465,Ganesh Rajaram,"Lastly, there is a need for the small group of influencers out there who take pride in offering alternative views and commentary on political and social happenings in Singapore to be more factual, accurate and constructive. Their opinions may not necessarily be fake, but their views and opinions can be very damaging to our social and cultural fabric. To me, opinion pieces that can undermine sensitive issues or negotiations can be even more damaging than fake news from foreign sources. These influencers are Singaporeans, many of whom are very familiar with the OB markers as they may be experts or former media professionals. Many of these influencers may contribute commentaries to foreign online publications that are written to deliberately elicit a strong reaction. The community should be wary of these influencers, and learn to seek other credible sources of information before making a judgement."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00466,2018-01-10-T-024,466,Ganesh Rajaram,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in closing, I would like to commend the Ministry of Law for this initiative to convene a Select Committee. Fake news is a very serious phenomenon, and, if left unchecked, will have disastrous consequences for our social fabric."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00467,2018-01-10-T-024,467,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Mr Deputy Speaker, ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"". This is an insightful slogan of Washington Post, a well-regarded US newspaper. The Washington Post recognises that a democracy cannot survive and thrive without an informed public discourse informed by facts, truth and transparency."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00468,2018-01-10-T-024,468,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Indeed, in the past few years, leading democracies have been hacked. The long list includes the US, UK, France, Germany, Sweden and Italy. These nations have been hacked by foreign powers and special interest groups, who systematically inject fake news into the openness and the connectedness of many democracies, so as to further their foreign agenda or narrow interests and, in certain instances, they have succeeded."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00469,2018-01-10-T-024,469,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Why do such concerted efforts frequently succeed, even in mature democracies with well-informed electorates? We are beginning to benefit from new research on fake news. Dartmouth College recently analysed the real and fake news consumption of thousands of adults in the lead up to the 2016 US election."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00470,2018-01-10-T-024,470,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"The research shows that most lies and false rumours online go nowhere. However, the key researcher, Dr Brendan, notes that social media companies have algorithms that"

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00472,2018-01-10-T-024,472,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"We should not be surprised by the ingenuity of these algorithms, because social media companies have an overriding financial interest to keep us entertained and connected for as many hours a day as possible, by delivering one dopamine dose, one newsfeed at a time."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00473,2018-01-10-T-024,473,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Fake news also thrives because of our psychological make-up. Psychologists have noted that for the human mind to critically examine whether an article is true or false, a person must first mentally articulate them, temporarily accepting the news as possibly true. But even if our brain subsequently rule what we read as fake, our mind has already made a subconscious note of that, and this lingers in our minds longer than we think it does."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00474,2018-01-10-T-024,474,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Psychologists also believe that repetition matters. Merely seeing a newsfeed headlines many times, even if they are later debunked as fake news, make it more credible than it should. In short, even if we recognise news as fake, fake news can influence us subtly."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00475,2018-01-10-T-024,475,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"People might speculate as to the reasons for the Select Committee. In fact, it has been suggested that one of the reasons for convening this Select Committee is the petition process which was initiated by some activists in relation to Parliament’s consideration and adoption of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill in August 2016. But such speculation does not change the issue at hand."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00476,2018-01-10-T-024,476,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"In view of the danger that certain state and non-state actors pose, by weaponising disinformation into fake news, I support the creation of the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00477,2018-01-10-T-024,477,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Beyond the formation of the Selection Committee, I have two other suggestions."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00478,2018-01-10-T-024,478,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"One, while the Committee’s work is critical, we should tackle the issue upstream by strengthening our people’s understanding of how our society works."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00479,2018-01-10-T-024,479,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Any country with an under-informed electorate has fertile grounds for fake news to thrive. Therefore, we must find more effective ways to keep our people well-informed about the fundamentals of how our society works."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00480,2018-01-10-T-024,480,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"This includes how our society manages our multi-cultural and multi-religious fault-lines; how the Government spends its money, and how we manage our reserves; how our political and electoral process functions; how we encourage transparency in public debate among Singaporeans, but also saying no to foreign influence on our public opinion."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00481,2018-01-10-T-024,481,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"A good way to start is to teach them in schools. Today, we already teach critical thinking in schools, and we do have social studies and national education. But more can and must be done. So, I agree with Mr Kok Heng Leun's view on strengthening media literacy."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00484,2018-01-10-T-024,484,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"A clear understanding on the news consumption patterns will be necessary to help us calibrate policies, so that we can create a healthy balance between healthy discourse and necessary intervention."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00485,2018-01-10-T-024,485,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Mr Deputy Speaker, let me now conclude. Public discourse is the means for our society to reflect collectively, reflect on what values matter, reflect on whether our policies have lived up to our ideals, and reflect on whether we have pushed a logical idea to its illogical extreme."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00486,2018-01-10-T-024,486,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"For the longest time, our mainstream media has served as an accurate mirror for our society to reflect upon. With the rise of social media and the decline of mainstream media, many Singaporeans are no longer even looking at the same mirror."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00487,2018-01-10-T-024,487,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"At the same time, vested or financial interests distort their social media newsfeeds more and more each day. In the decades ahead, we have a lot of major decisions to make. And we need to collectively decide on our way forward on the basis of facts, and not rumours and, certainly, not fake news. We must do everything in our power to combat fake news to ensure that Singapore’s public deliberations continue to be enlightened because democracy dies in darkness. With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in full support of the motion."

With the rise in technology and digitisation, the online space has been widening and is certainly one area of concern for every right-minded people and organisations, including the Labour Movement, given the multi-national, multi-racial, multi-religious composition of the people and members that we have."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00490,2018-01-10-T-024,490,K Thanaletchimi,"Sir, as I support the appointment of the Select Committee, I would like to put forth the following recommendations."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00491,2018-01-10-T-024,491,K Thanaletchimi,"I support the appointment of a Select Committee to study the issue of deliberate online falsehoods, that is, fake news, and make appropriate and well-balanced recommendations as to how, as a nation, we should respond and how to cultivate the values of accountability and responsibility, especially when posting materials on social media. It is imperative for the Committee to study this issue in depth and solicit responses from the public and various interest groups as a ground-up inclusive move, as compared to introducing legislation alone without consultation. There is a fine line between satires, deliberate online falsehood or differing yet genuine opinions that may not resonate with the State's views. I propose that the Select Committee comprise different parties in the community and professionals from the digital media sector with relevant knowledge and experience."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00493,2018-01-10-T-024,493,K Thanaletchimi,"Currently, MOH has an online platform to feedback on specific concerns or complaints with the healthcare service providers or the Ministry. There could be an additional category to include feedback on online falsehoods relating to public health safety issues for MOH to investigate and clarify with members of the public. This is one such example I could give, and other Ministries could also have a similar kind of arrangement. This would mobilise the public energies to police lies and distortions with a web-based open system listing journalists, publications, news channels and other websites."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00494,2018-01-10-T-024,494,K Thanaletchimi,"On public engagement. Given the diverse demographic of our Republic, it is important to embrace diverse viewpoints. Singapore Conversations was a good way to engage Singaporeans openly on policies and the rationale behind them. The Government could continue to sharpen their strategic communication efforts and media activities to be able to rebut false stories and to be believed, and it has to be responsive and timed."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00495,2018-01-10-T-024,495,K Thanaletchimi,"Education and mind set change. This is a very important topic that many Members have also spoken about. Ultimately, the focus could be on educating our citizens on media and digital information literacy. I would like to applaud the efforts of tertiary institutions, such as Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, NTU, SMU that have introduced lessons to help students differentiate fact from fiction, where students are taught to do credibility checks on sources, cross-referencing, and use of authoritative sources. Secondary schools could also include media and digital information literacy in their curriculum, where students learn to pick on cues to uncover misinformation, question misleading sources and resist the temptation of believing just simply. Eventually, we hope to cultivate a generation with a healthy scepticism on the online information."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00496,2018-01-10-T-024,496,K Thanaletchimi,"Lastly, on legislation. We should monitor the situation and consider various effective means of curbing and preventing deliberate on-line falsehood. Legislation and tighter controls must also be considered to combat the “virus” of falsehood. As for foreign influence, we need to have some gate-keeping mechanism to know the source of the news, who is the sponsor, what is the intent of the action, as what the Minister for Law has mentioned earlier. We should learn from the experiences of other countries and study what actions have been taken to overcome those challenges."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00497,2018-01-10-T-024,497,K Thanaletchimi,"France, Germany and the US are also similarly working to overcome the problem of fake news. The proposed law in France requires websites to make public the identities of those who sponsor content. It also provides for emergency procedures introduced during elections, providing judges the ultimate power to remove content, close websites that publish false information or fake news."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00505,2018-01-10-T-024,505,Deputy Speaker,Debate resumed.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00506,2018-01-10-T-024,506,Seah Kian Peng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the speakers before me who have given their views on Deliberate Online Falsehoods."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00507,2018-01-10-T-024,507,Seah Kian Peng,"One way to think about today's debate is whether we should adopt a paternalistic or a liberal stance towards false information per se – whether online or off. I think our discussion today should take bearing from the existing principles that already inform this House's views on falsehoods and truths – namely, the relatively uncontroversial principles that we should, first, reduce falsehoods as much as we can and, second, promote the truth as vigorously as we can."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00508,2018-01-10-T-024,508,Seah Kian Peng,"But as with so much in policy making, this is easier said than done. Deliberate Online Falsehoods cut across these two broad spectrums  (i) completely false information, photos or videos purposefully created and spread to confuse or misinform; (ii) information, photos or videos manipulated to deceive, or old photographs shared as new."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00509,2018-01-10-T-024,509,Seah Kian Peng,"More than half of British users of social media surveyed have admitted that they fail to check the original source of online material before sharing or ""liking"" it. What about Singaporeans?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00510,2018-01-10-T-024,510,Seah Kian Peng,A June 2017 survey by MCI found that around 25% of respondents shared information that they later discovered to be false. Around two-thirds could not recognise falsehoods when they first saw it and only half were confident of their ability to recognise falsehoods. Most of us admit that we cannot distinguish the truth from falsehoods.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00511,2018-01-10-T-024,511,Seah Kian Peng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, today I want to make a simple argument – that we now need more processes to safeguard the two principles that have underwritten our governance philosophy all these years and which I have spoken about earlier  reducing falsehoods and promoting truth. New processes are needed because the status quo is based on two assumptions which we now know to be questionable."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00514,2018-01-10-T-024,514,Seah Kian Peng,"So, the Government should not – and should not want to – protect us from our mistakes. Surely, it is a fundamental tenet of our democratic system that people should be allowed to make their own decisions, and if those decisions are mistaken, it is a matter of accepting the outcome of a democratic process. That is true."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00515,2018-01-10-T-024,515,Seah Kian Peng,"But it is also true that people have a right to expect that the political leaders that they have put in place carry a duty – to ensure that their decision making environment – that is, the people's decision-making environment – is not populated by intentional falsehoods. That their leaders not be blind to the dangers that such falsehoods can have on freedom of opinions, religions, races and genders. Also, it should be noted that we are restricting fraudulent information and not restricting information per se."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00516,2018-01-10-T-024,516,Seah Kian Peng,"In fact, I see countering falsehoods as a way to safeguard freedom of speech – by ensuring the conditions are in place for there to be meaningful and free debate. Falsehoods mislead, crowd out truths and prevent constructive debate and discourse."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00517,2018-01-10-T-024,517,Seah Kian Peng,"Just throwing all the ""data"" we have into a pot and then leaving people to distinguish between good and bad information makes the assumption that people have both the time and the capacity to do this. I do not mean ""capacity"" in the strict sense of expertise or education – I mean it in the loose sense of ""inclination"" – or whether we ""can be bothered."" Indeed, most people cannot be bothered."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00518,2018-01-10-T-024,518,Seah Kian Peng,"Declaring my interest as the CEO of NTUC FairPrice, FairPrice, too, has had its fair share of Online Falsehoods. So, according to information online, FairPrice, for example, sells ""halal pork"" and also ""plastic rice""."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00519,2018-01-10-T-024,519,Seah Kian Peng,"In 2007, FairPrice filed a police report after we found a picture of ""halal pork"", allegedly sold by stores, on the Internet. If the first person who saw this checked with us and deleted it, it would have died there. Instead, the news was carried in both the mainstream media as well as online news media, and caused a stir in the community, and rightly so. It was so widespread that MUIS had to carry out physical checks. That was in 2007. It went viral again in 2011 and again in 2014, and FairPrice had to respond publicly that this was a 2007 hoax that had resurfaced. Even today, 10 years later, I still get messages asking me about this. So, for the last time I hope, this is a deliberate online falsehood! Indeed, a lie can travel half way around the world before the truth gets out of bed."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00520,2018-01-10-T-024,520,Seah Kian Peng,"Just last year, FairPrice also had to file a police report over viral claims that its house brand jasmine fragrant rice is made of plastic. Last year, too, AVA had to step in and come out to debunk a Facebook video that alleged a coffee shop in Ang Mo Kio was selling ""man- made eggs from China""."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00522,2018-01-10-T-024,522,Seah Kian Peng,"We know of instances of brands' reputations tarnished by appearing on fake news websites and, unwittingly, funding their activities. Back in March last year, Havas Group UK, a media agency, decided to stop all its ad spending on Google and YouTube after ads for its clients appeared next to ""questionable or unsafe content"" online."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00523,2018-01-10-T-024,523,Seah Kian Peng,"Consequences go beyond dollars and cents into the very destiny of men. In the UK, voters for remain or exit voted on the basis of information later found to be false. Countries are hoping to sway online citizens to be one way or the other, vote one way or the other, pressure their governments one way or the other, using – not evidence or facts, but by casting fear, seeding doubt, and pressing emotional buttons."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00524,2018-01-10-T-024,524,Seah Kian Peng,"There are many of us who do not have the knowledge nor the time to sieve through falsehoods; this is exacerbated by the mode of delivery of such news. How easy it is to like, comment or share information these days. We owe a duty of care to the public, by presenting them with straight facts, we owe it to each other to be vigilant of misinformation. We need to be vigilant and alert to decipher masses of information thrown at them. We know this in the same way we know it is bad to eat too much sugar, that exercise is good and sloth bad. We know and yet we do not do what we should; instead, quite often, we do what we should not."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00525,2018-01-10-T-024,525,Seah Kian Peng,"So, we need the vigilance of laws, regulations and due process. Being vigilant does not mean being undemocratic. We need to educate the community, let them know if the news comes from a certified source, and equip them to decide whether to read or share it. At the same time, we owe it to them, to ourselves to ensure that the environment under which such decision making takes place is as uncluttered with falsehoods as possible."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00526,2018-01-10-T-024,526,Seah Kian Peng,"Having regulations and due process also reduces our hiding behind the excuse of ""honest mistakes"". We make claims, and then, when proven false, we apologise and say, ""we are all human"". We did not intend to mislead, to misrepresent, our memories are faulty, and blah, blah, blah. Intentions aside, we all know that the consequences matter. Having a review of how we regard such falsehoods will raise the bar for due care in public discourse, and also, hopefully, reduce the instances of being reckless with the truth. We are all imperfect beings – and, hence, need to show that we have taken due care when we engage in public debates."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00527,2018-01-10-T-024,527,Seah Kian Peng,"If Singapore had four seasons, I would say winter is coming. Those who follow Game of Thrones, ""winter is coming"". Given that the assumption of infinite time and capacity is false, our first principle must be to reduce falsehoods as much as we can, to be vigilant and guard against the purveyors of such harmful things. In short"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00528,2018-01-10-T-024,528,Seah Kian Peng,False Assumption 1 – People have infinite time and capacity to make decisions.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00529,2018-01-10-T-024,529,Seah Kian Peng,"So, Principle 1 is – Reduce Falsehoods as much as we can."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00531,2018-01-10-T-024,531,Seah Kian Peng,"This is the argument from the ""marketplace of ideas"" – that people will change their minds when the facts change. As Cicero, the great Roman orator said, ""Does not, as fire dropped upon water is immediately extinguished and cooled, so, does not, I say, a false accusation, when brought in contact with a most pure and holy life, instantly fall and become extinguished?"" Cicero, I think, did not have experience with ""halal pork""!"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00532,2018-01-10-T-024,532,Seah Kian Peng,"The answer to his question, whether falsehoods wither and die when exposed to the light of truth is, of course, no! Lies thrive and contest against the truth, even when the ""truth"" is as evident as where a man was born, or the amount of money spent on healthcare. In the post-truth world, the role of facts, unfortunately, has been shown to have less force then supposed."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00533,2018-01-10-T-024,533,Seah Kian Peng,"Instead of changing their minds when presented with a different set of facts, people may instead choose to disregard these facts or find ways to find new facts which support their pre-existing ideas. This confirmation bias is well-tested and should be taken into consideration when we make the marketplace argument. In short"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00534,2018-01-10-T-024,534,Seah Kian Peng,"False assumption 2 – People change their minds when presented with new facts, which leads me to Principle 2 – We have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the marketplace of public discourse is not crowded out by falsehoods."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00535,2018-01-10-T-024,535,Seah Kian Peng,"To do this, we need to actively invest in any efforts to discern, filter, contain, disrupt or even punish deliberate Online Falsehoods. Perhaps, the solutions may be both legislative and relying on market forces. Stronger fact-checking/self-regulation by social media sites and technology companies. Popular search engines and social media platforms, such as Google and Facebook, have been struggling for years to fight false news, despite their best intentions."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00536,2018-01-10-T-024,536,Seah Kian Peng,"For instance, in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting last October, despite Facebook and Google promising to inhibit such circulation, falsehoods, such as the identity and the affiliation of the shooter, still ran rampant. There is much room for improvement, especially when one reason is that the algorithm in these systems often bring attention to posts that get their readers' interests – exactly what falsehood is designed to do. If the post garnered 10,000 likes and shares, then, surely, it must be real, right? Wrong! And this is where numbers provide false safety. There is very little wisdom in crowds, or, at least, very little that we ought to take at face value when it comes to important decisions."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00537,2018-01-10-T-024,537,Seah Kian Peng,"Israel, for example, has proposed legislation requiring social networks to take reasonable measures to monitor their platforms for incitement to terrorism, and to remove such incitement, or be liable to pay fines."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00538,2018-01-10-T-024,538,Seah Kian Peng,"Stronger fact-checking, self-regulation by society, by individuals.

This is a moral argument. The limitations to public education now are in its outreach and time. It will be difficult to reach certain segments of the community, such as the elderly. Also, public education of this nature takes a long time before results bear fruit, and we do need some immediate solutions, given the gravity of the situation now."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00541,2018-01-10-T-024,541,Seah Kian Peng,"Intervention through legislation. In the UK, the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee is conducting an inquiry into ""fake news"". Facebook and Twitter may face sanctions if they fail to hand over information to the Committee to assist in a Parliamentary investigation into Russian interference in the EU referendum."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00542,2018-01-10-T-024,542,Seah Kian Peng,"Some examples of what legislation can do include making falsehood publication a criminal offence, mandating the removal of such news from platforms and websites, and/or ensuring that readers have access to facts. This achieves the crucial objective of deterrence, which non-regulatory measures mentioned above cannot achieve."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00543,2018-01-10-T-024,543,Seah Kian Peng,"The extent of Government involvement requires deep discussion. Heavy-handed legislation may backfire on the Government acting as judge, jury and executioner of what constitutes credible information. We may end up freezing free speech online. Legislation, if overly relied on, may also weaken the ability of society to educate themselves and discern what is real or not for themselves."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00544,2018-01-10-T-024,544,Seah Kian Peng,It is clear that the challenges brought by deliberate online falsehoods are many and complex.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00545,2018-01-10-T-024,545,Seah Kian Peng,You will notice Mr Deputy Speaker that I have merely challenged two assumptions and reinforced two principles in the wake of these false assumptions. I have stressed the role of process in ensuring that the environment for our public discourse remains clean and unencumbered.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00546,2018-01-10-T-024,546,Seah Kian Peng,"As to the actual processes themselves – what they should be, how much is needed – I think these are the issues that the Select Committee is best placed to explore, as it allows the committee to draw representations from contributors and stakeholders of all sectors."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00547,2018-01-10-T-024,547,Seah Kian Peng,"Having a Select Committee will allow for a thorough discussion of the problems posed by this issue, such as responsibilities of social media and tech companies’ platforms, how to educate the public to discern news, the duty that websites have towards using deliberate falsehoods to attract more hits and to drive revenue."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00548,2018-01-10-T-024,548,Seah Kian Peng,"In particular, I think such a committee would also be able to articulate more clearly and in greater detail the principles that underline our governance model in terms of regulating information."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00549,2018-01-10-T-024,549,Seah Kian Peng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I had earlier spoken about the need to balance our freedoms with duties but perhaps I ought to make it clearer than that. It is not just a balance, but a difference between means and ends. We do not pursue freedom for its own end. We do not, if I may put it bluntly, have a “philosophy of freedoms”."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00551,2018-01-10-T-024,551,Seah Kian Peng,"Sir, he was speaking in 1986. Yes, more than 30 years ago – and the world has come full circle. So, I think we ought to hear his words to the end. He said, “Singapore has far more vulnerabilities than most national states because it has none of the essential prerequisites for a viable, stable and prosperous state. It has nevertheless functioned fairly adequately for 27 years only on the basis of two intangibles – ideas and the human characters shaped by these ideas.”"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00552,2018-01-10-T-024,552,Seah Kian Peng,"Ideas as shaped by human character, not ideas as tossed willy nilly into a pot, undiscerned, half-formed, half-baked."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00553,2018-01-10-T-024,553,Seah Kian Peng,Let us all recognise the need to work out for ourselves in Singapore what is the correct approach towards preventing and combating deliberate online falsehoods.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00554,2018-01-10-T-024,554,Seah Kian Peng,"A Select Committee with the broad terms of reference as proposed in this Motion is the best way of working these out. Sir, I support the Motion."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00555,2018-01-10-T-024,555,Mahdev Mohan,"Sir, I used to believe that if most of my friends are speaking about something, it is likely, more than likely to be true. If you apply this presumption to the Internet, it is basically that if something goes viral, that news must have veracity. I have changed my presumptions."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00556,2018-01-10-T-024,556,Mahdev Mohan,"The old presumption that if people are all talking about something or sharing some information by the Internet that is going to be true is now the reverse presumption – it is likely something you have to look at very carefully. Weaponised in this way, deliberate online falsehoods or misinformation can sow societal discord, as has been observed in the Green Paper by the Ministers and in various jurisdictions. Fake news also risks, importantly, devaluing and delegitimising the voices of expertise and the concept of objective data—which undermines society’s ability to engage in a rational discourse based upon shared facts. As an academic, there is an importance of objective data that is extremely important. In the course of this speech, I would like to point this House to what is going on in the universities as far as fake news is concerned."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00557,2018-01-10-T-024,557,Mahdev Mohan,"I support the Motion of a Select Committee, Sir, to address this problem, as well as the Ministries' recognition of the Green Paper that this problem requires a multi-stakeholder response. Not just from the Government, not just from a whole-of-Government, but it is has to be a whole-of-Singapore approach."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00558,2018-01-10-T-024,558,Mahdev Mohan,"The Select Committee should in my view, Sir, should consider four points, as I would set out in this speech. First, how do we define, what is or what is not fake news. Two, how do we utilise the Government's existing toolbox of soft measures as well as hard laws to combat fake news. Three, how do we equip users of the Internet, most of Singaporeans to be the first line of defence against online falsehoods. And finally, how"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00559,2018-01-10-T-024,559,Mahdev Mohan,Page  66
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00560,2018-01-10-T-024,560,Mahdev Mohan,"Looking at the definition, as the first point, it is important to clarify, and for the Select Committee to look into this point, as to what the term ‘""fake news"" or deliberate online falsehoods really mean and to frame the problem we are seeking to tackle."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00561,2018-01-10-T-024,561,Mahdev Mohan,That phrase fake news for a variety of reasons and for a variety of people is a loaded term capable of being co-opted by different constituents across the world for different purposes.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00562,2018-01-10-T-024,562,Mahdev Mohan,"I note that three Professors from NTU have directed their minds to this problem of what is fake news in an article they published in August. They undertook an examination of 34 scholarly articles and looked at a duration between 2003 and 2017 in order to map the different conceptions of fake news. They have gone on to say that fake news has two elements. The first, obviously, would be whether there or not is veracity, or facticity in their view; and secondly, the intention behind the news, the degree to which the author of fake news intends to deceive. The most recent understandings of fake news or online falsehoods focus on pieces of news that are low in veracity and high in the intention to mislead. This would be the most dangerous elements of fake news for online falsehoods. When looking at this definition, it is important also to see what it would exclude."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00563,2018-01-10-T-024,563,Mahdev Mohan,"So, as an example, fictitious news stories with a vague plausibility but which are aimed at humour should be excluded if they are deliberately satirical and that they caveat that that is their purpose. It is different."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00564,2018-01-10-T-024,564,Mahdev Mohan,"If there is innocent, inadvertent inaccuracies or mistakes, as some have spoken about earlier, that should be excluded. And finally, impassioned opinion or commentary that is based on facts, even if people would disagree with these facts, that should be excluded."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00565,2018-01-10-T-024,565,Mahdev Mohan,"Ultimately, it is important for the Select Committee to give us a parameter of what is fake news that we would be looking at."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00566,2018-01-10-T-024,566,Mahdev Mohan,"Secondly, looking at the regulatory tool box that is currently available for Government, our Government agencies indeed hold significant power and sometimes could impose major sanctions if they choose to do so in relation to data authenticity, privacy, security and they must always be subject to certain constraints in the public interest."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00567,2018-01-10-T-024,567,Mahdev Mohan,"The Select Committee should outline and recommend how a Smart Nation in the 21st century should responsibly enforce existing norms. There is a considerable range in this tool box, which regulators have. It ranges from inspection, support, advice and it can be backed by criminal, civil and reputational sanctions."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00568,2018-01-10-T-024,568,Mahdev Mohan,"Pre-emptive measures, which is what the Select Committee would be thinking about, should be the main focus of legal solutions that we are putting together, as false information and fake news can inflict lasting damage long after it has been disseminated, even if this news is subsequently disproved. Where damage or harm is caused, appropriate remedies are currently available, as some Members have spoken"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00569,2018-01-10-T-024,569,Mahdev Mohan,Page  67
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00570,2018-01-10-T-024,570,Mahdev Mohan,"Beyond what currently exists, the Select Committee should be thinking about what is necessary to be part of the arsenal that is currently not there but that should be there because it is necessary to be there."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00571,2018-01-10-T-024,571,Mahdev Mohan,"Third, how do we equipping Internet users, regular Singaporeans to be that first line of defence?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00572,2018-01-10-T-024,572,Mahdev Mohan,"According to a research paper by IT security company Trend Micro in May last year, Trend Micro said this ""In a post-truth era, news is easy to manufacture but challenging to verify, it’s essentially up to the users to better discern the veracity of the stories they read and prevent fake news from further proliferating""."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00573,2018-01-10-T-024,573,Mahdev Mohan,"I would therefore agree with the Members who have spoken before me to talk about the importance of discerning truth from fake news. It is far more difficult than you would think. As a very simple example, those of us who follow football can understand that if you have a WhatsApp chat group, there is information on your sports teams, on the players that you support and what you think should be changed. Should the managers be doing something different, should a new player be acquired and very often fake news is actually propagated on these WhatsApp chat groups."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00574,2018-01-10-T-024,574,Mahdev Mohan,"Two points come up. What happens because of this? People are upset, but how far is that damage? So, I would not look at that particular example as something that we should come up with a very strong enforcement measure against. How much of this is fake news and what is the damage of that fake news, is also something we should look at."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00575,2018-01-10-T-024,575,Mahdev Mohan,"There is a need to appreciate the difference in the way people of different ages, social backgrounds and genders use and respond to fake news. Some groups, Sir, are more vulnerable than others. Enhancing digital literacy amongst vulnerable segments of society should also be part of the solution, namely the elderly and the youth who are given false information may benefit from the truth."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00576,2018-01-10-T-024,576,Mahdev Mohan,"Outreach to the elderly could be done through community ambassadors and role models who vet these WhatsApp messages that are sent that could alarm them. Online deliberate falsehoods, Sir, in my opinion are a poison. The same networks that false news has benefited from could also be applied as an antidote to this poison."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00577,2018-01-10-T-024,577,Mahdev Mohan,"A network, Sir, of fact-checkers, as many of us have spoken about, could be set up. Fact-checkers, who are perhaps journalists, university students, scholars to look into information before it is widely disseminated or to constantly correct misinformation as it happens."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00578,2018-01-10-T-024,578,Mahdev Mohan,Campaigns should be launched to raise awareness on the scourge of misinformation and to equip these fact-checkers with the tools needed to combat falsehoods. Media outlets should consider including critical coverage of disinformation just to explain that this is not the case and to set the record straight.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00579,2018-01-10-T-024,579,Mahdev Mohan,Page  68
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00580,2018-01-10-T-024,580,Mahdev Mohan,"Finally, Sir, we should look to involve major Internet platforms and ICT providers. Major Internet platforms should support the research and development of appropriate technological solutions to disinformation and propaganda which users may apply on a voluntary basis. They should cooperate with initiatives that offer fact-checking services to users and review their advertising models to ensure that they do not adversely impact diversity of opinions that users can hold. It is important not to put the entire burden of policing on these platforms on the people, on the users who are using them."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00581,2018-01-10-T-024,581,Mahdev Mohan,"As one example, I look to a colleague at the Singapore Management University, Prof Warren Chik, who has come out to say and written in the Law Gazette that it may be appropriate not always to have new legislation. So, yes, have some soft laws, have guidelines, have best practices but should we go straight into legislation?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00582,2018-01-10-T-024,582,Mahdev Mohan,"Prof Chik also says that it would be important to clarify with the relevant Internet intermediaries hosting or providing access to information to come under the ambit of existing regulations overseen by the IMDA. He said that making it clear that the regime covers news aggregators, social media platforms that provide newsfeeds and other similar content hosts or sources of news will have the effect of ensuring compliance with combating deliberate online falsehoods and concomitant amendments to the regulations to include specific conditions for operation."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00583,2018-01-10-T-024,583,Mahdev Mohan,"His question, I guess, would be  do we really need a new piece of legislation?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00584,2018-01-10-T-024,584,Mahdev Mohan,"I think the Select Committee should look into this question very carefully. What are the benefits of legislation on this particular point? And if there is going to be legislation, will there be aspects of that legislation which are not just hardcoding new crimes but is giving support to vulnerable and the youth to raise awareness against fake news?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00585,2018-01-10-T-024,585,Mahdev Mohan,"Finally, Sir, it is important to start with more transparency between the Internet platforms and the public, because we do not even understand often, how they are moderating content, and how their algorithms are bring used, or showing up on people's newsfeeds. The question, therefore, for the Select Committee is  is technological design currently being harnessed to both promote more credible content or present content in a way that fosters consumer skepticism and critical analysis? If not, something needs to change."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00586,2018-01-10-T-024,586,Mahdev Mohan,"Sir, Mr Seah, before me, said compellingly that perhaps, we are approaching ""winter"". And this ""winter"", I am not talking about seasons, but of course, ""winter"" from the Game of Thrones; that ""winter is coming"". But I think what we should do is to say, ""Well, if there is winter is coming, how do we insulate ourselves, and get the thickest coats and the best protection from this winter?"" Because usage of the Internet is not going to stop, it is only going to increase."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00588,2018-01-10-T-024,588,Zaqy Mohamad,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to speak on this important Motion, and I applaud the effort to push this Motion in this House. While there are many aspects of this discussion, I would like to focus on two important considerations."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00589,2018-01-10-T-024,589,Zaqy Mohamad,"Firstly, I need to underscore that constructive public debate or the exercise of freedom of speech must be founded on truth, not falsehoods. Those who advocate strongly for freedom of speech are quick to argue that the ""market"" should be left to ""correct"" misinformation and disinformation. They point out that a marketplace of ideas and thoughts will certainly eventually lead to the truth emerging."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00590,2018-01-10-T-024,590,Zaqy Mohamad,"This, while true in the past, may not necessarily be the case in this digital era, where falsehoods are propagated at such speeds and volumes which makes it difficult for the common man to discern between fact and fiction. In this digital era, algorithms and social media platforms can also be manipulated by motivated parties – local and foreign, private and state-payers."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00591,2018-01-10-T-024,591,Zaqy Mohamad,"Measures need to be taken to ensure that while free speech is exercised, facts will prevail. Free speech must be founded on facts, and not on falsehoods, especially those that are designed to undermine society."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00592,2018-01-10-T-024,592,Zaqy Mohamad,"We should not take this lightly. The dangers of how freedom of speech can be abused to cause significant harm to society, can be seen from the experiences in the UK and Australia. In the UK, online falsehoods were used to distort sentiment in relation to Government policies and to breed xenophobia."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00593,2018-01-10-T-024,593,Zaqy Mohamad,"In 2016, online falsehoods were spread about immigration in the lead-up to the ""Brexit"" referendum, which fuelled support for ""Brexit"" by claiming that the UK will see an influx of 12 million Turks if it remained in the EU. False information was also used to stir up racial tensions in the UK to smear Muslims as a group, and to turn non-Muslims against Muslims."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00594,2018-01-10-T-024,594,Zaqy Mohamad,"In the face of numerous occurrences of online falsehoods in the UK, the UK government has launched a parliamentary inquiry into fake news. Their experiences have shown them that if left unchecked, the spread of falsehoods has a serious detrimental impact on society. In Australia, online falsehoods were used to stir up racial tensions to smear Muslims as a group and to stir up xenophobic feelings."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00595,2018-01-10-T-024,595,Zaqy Mohamad,"In 2015, companies that get products halal certified were targets of a campaign that claimed that halal certification funds terrorism. Conducted largely through the social media and online networks, Australian anti-Islamic groups demanded companies that carry halal certification labels to drop them. This was part of what were known as rallies to ""reclaim Australia"". There was never any evidence to support the allegation that money from halal certification funded terrorist groups."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00596,2018-01-10-T-024,596,Zaqy Mohamad,"Just like the UK, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has undertaken a formal inquiry into major digital platforms and their impact on media, journalism and advertising, with the impact of falsehoods as part of this inquiry. The Australian process is somewhat similar to Singapore’s proposed Select Committee"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00597,2018-01-10-T-024,597,Zaqy Mohamad,Page  70
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00598,2018-01-10-T-024,598,Zaqy Mohamad,"The second consideration is that falsehoods have the ability to radicalise individuals with extremist sentiments. Terrorist groups have long recognised the need to use online media effectively, in order to radicalise masses and achieve their sinister aims. In an undated letter to Taliban leader Mullah Omar, quoted in 2014, al-Qaeda’s then leader Osama bin Laden himself observed that ""90 percent of the preparation for war is effective use of the media""."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00599,2018-01-10-T-024,599,Zaqy Mohamad,"Al-Qaeda was long advocating ghazwa ma’lumatiyya, or information operations, and harb electroniyya which is electronic warfare."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00600,2018-01-10-T-024,600,Zaqy Mohamad,"Bin Laden’s successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, shared this same view. He referred to ""jihad of the bayan"" which is the message of declaration, and considered this more important than ""jihad of the spear"" – he praised the ""knights of the media jihad"", and the ""clandestine mujahideen"" who were conducting it. Terrorist organisations use Twitter to put out fake news stories. There have been many instances of mainstream media mistaking terrorist-originated tweets as legitimate sources of breaking news."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00601,2018-01-10-T-024,601,Zaqy Mohamad,"An example of a terrorist organisation that has been using online falsehoods to push its own agenda is the Islamic State (ISIS). In 2017, it claimed that Mosul’s famed al-Nuri mosque was blown up by a US-led coalition airstrike, when in fact, ISIS had destroyed the mosque themselves, using explosives. Their goal as jihadists was to blame the West and the Americans. The Iraq Military and the US Military released counter-footage, trying to show the truth of the matter, but objective truth has little meaning as the followers of ISIS cannot be swayed by evidence. So, even if you put the counter-truth, it is hard to sway the public and hard to counter the perceptions the mistruths have already shaped."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00602,2018-01-10-T-024,602,Zaqy Mohamad,"So, we need to be aware of the consequences when our online space is hijacked or influenced by players with certain motivations or agenda. In our multi-religious and multi-ethnic Singapore, which has enjoyed decades of stability and harmony, such falsehoods should have no place as someone with the intention to stir up emotions and they can do it easily, using religion."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00603,2018-01-10-T-024,603,Zaqy Mohamad,"What measures do we need the Government to look into? And these are some suggestions, I hope, the Select Committee can consider. Some countries, such as Germany, have laws to take down unlawful content and systemic breaches that can result in fines of EUR $50 million. The EU, UK and France are considering similar take-down laws. New Zealand takes a different approach under the Harmful Digital Communications Act that allows the Court to order a right to reply or to correct false statements concerning individuals."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00604,2018-01-10-T-024,604,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the process of appointing the Select Committee, given the sensitivities of the topic and the pervasive use of the online platform by many Singaporeans. Given our small size and highly connected population, we are at risk of foreign influence and intervention."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00605,2018-01-10-T-024,605,Zaqy Mohamad,"The Select Committee is therefore a good platform to get views from many Singaporeans and other stakeholders to hear their views, challenges and for us to learn the best way to take this forward for the greater good of Singapore and fellow citizens."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00606,2018-01-10-T-024,606,Zaqy Mohamad,Page  71
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00607,2018-01-10-T-024,607,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion. Please allow me to continue my speech in Malay."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00608,2018-01-10-T-024,608,Zaqy Mohamad,(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  The move to initiate a Parliamentary process in order to study and obtain feedback on the issue of falsehoods that are deliberately spread online is timely.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00609,2018-01-10-T-024,609,Zaqy Mohamad,"This is because we have long faced the issue of having all kinds of news and information coming from multiple sources, including from overseas. What is worrying is that some of these news or information do not state the full picture, or is done out of context. Its proliferation is certainly something dangerous."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00610,2018-01-10-T-024,610,Zaqy Mohamad,"Another issue pertains to information or news that is spread with a specific agenda. For instance, during this new year, an ISIS video was spread that showed militants supposedly from Singapore urging ISIS militants from around the world to step up efforts to harm their enemies."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00611,2018-01-10-T-024,611,Zaqy Mohamad,MUIS and leaders of Malay bodies in Singapore immediately condemned the act of spreading of the video.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00612,2018-01-10-T-024,612,Zaqy Mohamad,"I believe that this will not be the last time that such videos and information will be spread. It will take a continuous effort to prevent the spread of online falsehoods, in addition to efforts to educate and warn our community about the dangers of spreading such news and information."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00613,2018-01-10-T-024,613,Zaqy Mohamad,"For instance, terrorist groups have always recognised the need to harness online media effectively in order to propagate their radical beliefs, in addition to recruiting new members to achieve their agenda."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00614,2018-01-10-T-024,614,Zaqy Mohamad,"Let me give some examples. In an undated letter to Taliban leader Mullah Omar that was reported in 2014, the Al-Qaeda leader at that time, Osama bin Laden himself observed that “90% of preparations for war involve the use of media”."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00615,2018-01-10-T-024,615,Zaqy Mohamad,"Al-Qaeda have long encouraged what they call ghazwa ma’lumatiyya (or information operations), and harb electroniyya (or electronic warfare)."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00616,2018-01-10-T-024,616,Zaqy Mohamad,"Terrorist groups also use Twitter to spread online falsehoods. In fact, several mainsetream media outlets use information from Twitter as a legitimate source of news that is used in news updates."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00617,2018-01-10-T-024,617,Zaqy Mohamad,"One example pertains to a terrorist organisation that uses online media to spread false information in order to promote their agenda. A year ago, ISIS claimed that the Al-Nuri Mosque in Mosul was destroyed in an airstrike by an allied force led by the United States. However, it was ISIS themselves who destroyed the mosque."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00619,2018-01-10-T-024,619,Zaqy Mohamad,"In Singapore’s context, as a small multicultural, multiracial and multireligious nation, we cannot afford to fall victim to such influences or threats, no matter how small. This is especially so in matters related to religion and race, which are sensitive."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00620,2018-01-10-T-024,620,Zaqy Mohamad,"Some of the sensitive issues being spread, that can heighten emotions and divide our society, are beyond our control because it comes from external sources. Certain groups will take the opportunity to spread Islamophobia, and this will surely have an impact in terms of our Muslim community’s relationship with non-Muslims and how they view our Muslim community."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00621,2018-01-10-T-024,621,Zaqy Mohamad,"Our experience in Singapore, from time to time, is that we are worried whether certain information that is spread and proliferate in social media is incomplete or inaccurate. Some of these news and information can cause anger or discontent."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00622,2018-01-10-T-024,622,Zaqy Mohamad,"For example, there was an allegation that halal pork was sold at NTUC Fairprice supermarkets. A lot of time and resources were needed to correct such information and give assurance to the public,"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00623,2018-01-10-T-024,623,Zaqy Mohamad,"With technological advancement, information, especially videos and photos, can be created or modified to spread rumours and inaccurate information, and this can spread quickly."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00624,2018-01-10-T-024,624,Zaqy Mohamad,"Hence, what are the measures that we would like the Government to study? Some countries like Germany have introduced legislation to close down platforms that display content that break the law, and such offences can carry fines up to €50 million."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00625,2018-01-10-T-024,625,Zaqy Mohamad,"The European Union, UK and France are considering similar legislation. New Zealand is taking an approach under its laws that allows its Courts to order a right of reply to correct any false information about an individual."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00626,2018-01-10-T-024,626,Zaqy Mohamad,"Clearly, the management of online falsehoods is a serious issue. We should focus on how Singapore can contain it. At the same time, it is hoped that any regulations or laws will not hinder the immense benefits of online platforms and social media technologies that have contributed a lot in terms of spreading information and communications."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00627,2018-01-10-T-024,627,Zaqy Mohamad,"In order to achieve solutions that can benefit everyone, and to protect us from online falsehood, we must support the Select Committee process and recognise the Government’s efforts to take a consultative approach to resolve this sensitive issue."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00628,2018-01-10-T-024,628,Zaqy Mohamad,"In this regard, I hope that the Malay/Muslim community can also contribute and play a role, whether they are community and religious leaders, online entrepreneurs or the man-in-the-street, and that all of us will give suggestions and ideas about ways to counter online falsehoods."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00631,2018-01-10-T-024,631,Lee Bee Wah,Page  73
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00632,2018-01-10-T-024,632,Lee Bee Wah,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In 1969, there were rumours of Malays attacking Chinese in Malaysia. This led to serious race riots which also affected Singapore. The riots in Singapore lasted for seven whole days resulting in four people dead and 80 injured. People of my age or older would have remembered the terror and horror in those few days."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00633,2018-01-10-T-024,633,Lee Bee Wah,"At that time, my family was living in a rubber plantation in the countryside in Malacca. The houses in the plantation were far away from each other. In the day time, we worked in the plantation; in the evening, the whole family would stay together with our neighbour whose house was far away, for safety reasons."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00634,2018-01-10-T-024,634,Lee Bee Wah,"At that time, my third brother was just born. I remember my mother told me that if Malays came this evening, we must all quickly escape into the jungle in the back; but we would have to leave our little brother behind. I was then only eight years old, attending Primary 2. I understood what my mother meant and felt helpless. All I could do was to pray silently that the moment we had to leave our new born brother behind would never come. For me, those days of fear and anxiety are unforgettable."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00635,2018-01-10-T-024,635,Lee Bee Wah,"The 1969 race riots are a case in point to show how rumours and fake news can cause grave damages. Today, the power of fake news can be even greater. I would like to remind Singaporeans that today's fake news is hard to discern and root out. They spread fast and will affect innocent people. Hence, every Singaporean must stay vigilant and work together to control the spread of fake news."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00636,2018-01-10-T-024,636,Lee Bee Wah,"First, let us talk about the challenges in discerning truth from falsehood. Technology can make fake news look more and more credible, almost identical as real news. Have you seen online short videos? As long as there is just one person in the video, this person's image can be matched with different expressions and voices to make it look like the person has actually said those words. In the old days, we used to say “seeing is believing”. Now, however, you cannot even believe what you have seen with your own eyes."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00637,2018-01-10-T-024,637,Lee Bee Wah,"In addition to falsehoods in the form of news, there are also computer programmes which can pretend to be a real person and spread rumours online, misleading people to think that many people hold the same view."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00638,2018-01-10-T-024,638,Lee Bee Wah,"Needless to say that fake news spread fast. Fake news is not only limited to English media. I often receive fake news in Chinese sent from my residents. They asked me whether they should believe news, such as Mao Shan Wang durians containing pesticides, plastic rice and fake seaweed."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00639,2018-01-10-T-024,639,Lee Bee Wah,"I noticed that there are many websites and Facebook pages in China, Taiwan and Malaysia that spread fake news. There are even websites based in Australia targeting at Chinese readers in Singapore. They publish fake news to stir up trouble for Singapore-China and Singapore-US relationships."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00640,2018-01-10-T-024,640,Lee Bee Wah,"I believe that the same phenomenon happens to the Malay and Tamil media as well. Fake news, therefore, can appear in various forms and different languages to influence Singaporeans."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00641,2018-01-10-T-024,641,Lee Bee Wah,"Some people say that a party involved can rebut. However, it shows that the rebuttal tends to be not as “hot” and the transmitting speed is much slower, hence there will still be many people who would believe the fake news. Many fake news spread through"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00642,2018-01-10-T-024,642,Lee Bee Wah,Page  74
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00643,2018-01-10-T-024,643,Lee Bee Wah,"Because there can be substantial gains behind spreading fake news, it is very difficult to root them out. There are two kinds of gains. The first is financial gains. For example, the couple who created The Real Singapore website made more than $500,000 from advertising and bought a house in Australia. $500,000. How long will that take for most Singaporeans to make? They made this money without any effort and conscience, simply by fabricating stories overseas, slandering innocent Singaporeans and dividing our society. Although the website has been closed down, there are still other similar websites. I hope the Government can find ways to sanction them."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00644,2018-01-10-T-024,644,Lee Bee Wah,"Another motive is for political influence. Countries can now easily feed fake news to another country. The US has found out that fake news from Russia and East Europe had been read by 150 million people, and this could have influenced the US Presidential Election. 150 million is 30 times of our own population. If other countries intend to use fake news to influence our five million people and destroy our racial harmony and stability, it should not be too difficult."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00645,2018-01-10-T-024,645,Lee Bee Wah,"How influential can fake news be? Fake news can affect the livelihood of a common person, such as a durian seller, simply because of the fake news that durians have pesticides. Recently, a coffee shop was wrongly accused for selling fake eggs. I believed the owner must have felt helpless and worried."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00646,2018-01-10-T-024,646,Lee Bee Wah,"Fake news can also slow down the transmission of important information and endanger people's safety. For example, when Zika was spreading in the US, because some people believed that Zika did not come from mosquitoes but from vaccines or pesticides, they refused to let inspectors check whether there were mosquitoes breeding in their home. This led to the spread of the virus and many innocent infants and their families being affected."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00647,2018-01-10-T-024,647,Lee Bee Wah,"There was a lot of fake news circulating in Singapore as well at that time but, luckily, people still believed reliable media and we were able to transmit the right information and control the spread of Zika collectively."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00648,2018-01-10-T-024,648,Lee Bee Wah,"This time, we had passed the test. However, if we allow fake news to spread and undermine people's trust in reliable media, I am afraid we may not be so lucky the next time."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00649,2018-01-10-T-024,649,Lee Bee Wah,"It is not hard to imagine that, for example, a country X would like Singapore to adopt pro-X policies. Like in 1969, they can spread fake news of racial discrimination and marginalisation. Fake news now can spread to the entire island within hours, stirring up suspicion among races. The Government rebuts but country X is prepared beforehand and a new wave of fake news will surface, accusing the Government of racial discrimination. Country X will use social media and a large number of messages left by fake accounts to drown the rebuttal from the Government. In the end, race riots will occur and our economy will slump into recession. After that, country X will look for a puppet to set up a political party, proclaiming to protect the interest of a certain race. The party thereafter manages to acquire political power and adopts pro-X policies. X becomes the ultimate beneficiary but the victims are Singaporeans in general. Those Singaporeans who have forwarded fake news have inadvertently become X’s accomplices."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00650,2018-01-10-T-024,650,Lee Bee Wah,Page  75
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00651,2018-01-10-T-024,651,Lee Bee Wah,Even superpowers like the US suspect the presence of foreign influence. Small nations like Singapore must also stay vigilant. Not doing so is akin to gambling with Singaporeans' life and livelihood.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00652,2018-01-10-T-024,652,Lee Bee Wah,"Hence, I support the establishment of the Select Committee to study carefully how to tackle fake news. I hope the Committee can pay attention to the following two issues."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00653,2018-01-10-T-024,653,Lee Bee Wah,"First, will this Act undermine online freedom of speech? Second, will this Act be used against the opposition parties and people who criticise the Government?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00654,2018-01-10-T-024,654,Lee Bee Wah,"Deputy Speaker, I support the establishment of the Select Committee to gather feedback from various sectors, to be debated later in Parliament."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00655,2018-01-10-T-024,655,Lee Bee Wah,Only through an effective Fake News Act can we collectively combat the threats brought by fake news. We should maintain openness and circulation of information while sanctioning and controlling deliberate falsehoods.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00656,2018-01-10-T-024,656,Lee Bee Wah,"At the same time, I hope Singaporeans, including Members of this House, should think twice before forwarding any messages. Exercise due diligence so that the messages will not end up harming innocent citizens. [Applause]"

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00660,2018-01-10-T-024,660,K Shanmugam,"Seven MPs and four NMPs have spoken, all supported the Motion. Many important points have been raised. Examples have been given of the problems caused by falsehoods. Er Lee Bee Wah reminded us about the 1969 race riots caused by rumours of Chinese attacking Malays − examples of real world consequences which have very serious downstream impact for the entire country."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00661,2018-01-10-T-024,661,K Shanmugam,"Minister Yaacob talked about the experience his Ministry has had with ""The Real Singapore"" website − fabricating articles, creating tensions within different racial groups in Singapore − just one example."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00662,2018-01-10-T-024,662,K Shanmugam,"Mr Zaqy Mohamed brought up the 2015 Australian example − a misinformation campaign by Australian anti-Islamic groups that halal certification funds terrorism. Ms Sun Xueling told us of her experience where a false story was spread that the roof of Waterway Terraces I in her ward collapsed. Within 30 minutes, we had Police and Civil Defence vehicles, all despatched, and resources used up. Ms Thanaletchimi spoke about the online survey scam relating to NTUC Fairprice that it was rewarding customers with a $500 gift voucher."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00665,2018-01-10-T-024,665,K Shanmugam,"Mr de Souza referred to the danger of proliferation and perceived corroboration through automated accounts and multiple websites putting up the same falsehood. So, if it appears in many places, it must true, right?"
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00666,2018-01-10-T-024,666,K Shanmugam,"Mr Henry Kwek referred to the susceptibility to online falsehoods in view of people's psychological make-up, and how falsehoods linger in our minds longer than we think."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00667,2018-01-10-T-024,667,K Shanmugam,"Mr Rajaram spoke about how false information will become only more prevalent, not less, as the world becomes more digital."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00668,2018-01-10-T-024,668,K Shanmugam,A number of Members also spoke about possible responses − what this Select Committee ought to consider. A number of points were made.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00669,2018-01-10-T-024,669,K Shanmugam,"Mr Seah Kian Peng put out some principles which should guide our response to falsehoods. I think this is something the Select Committee is explicitly asked to consider. Methods might change, but we must be clear about the principle, what we are trying to achieve."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00670,2018-01-10-T-024,670,K Shanmugam,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah suggested that the Select Committee pay particular attention to whether any measures taken will affect free speech online or silence the critics of the Government. I think Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Kok Heng Leun also made similar points."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00671,2018-01-10-T-024,671,K Shanmugam,"I think the precise form and ambit of any measure to be proposed, including legislation, is something for the Select Committee to consider. But I think most Singaporeans would agree that free online debate − including the expression of critical comments − should not be predicated on deliberate falsehoods. My own view is that combating falsehoods is not contrary to the exercise of freedom of speech. In fact, keeping falsehoods out of our discourse enables freedom of speech to be meaningfully exercised."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00672,2018-01-10-T-024,672,K Shanmugam,"Deliberate falsehoods, I think, have got to be contrasted with factual inaccuracies, resulting in false statements being made. You can see that they are different, and I assume that that is something that the Select Committee will consider and how we respond, what sort of responses are suggested, may have to take into account the nature of the falsehoods and the intentions behind the falsehoods."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00673,2018-01-10-T-024,673,K Shanmugam,"As Mr Kok Heng Leun pointed out, fake news is often used to divide, mislead and conquer society. And he asked how this segues into biased commentary, and I think these are viewpoints that should be made to the Select Committee."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00674,2018-01-10-T-024,674,K Shanmugam,"As I have said, strongly held viewpoints but based on inaccuracies is one type of falsehood. What is the impact on people, what sort of reaction it gets; it is quite different from deliberate, targeted falsehood. How do you react to this? What is the impact of the falsehoods and what sort of reaction, what sort of responses you give to these? I think these are matters that should be considered."

2018-01-10-T-024-S-00676,2018-01-10-T-024,676,K Shanmugam,"I listened carefully to the points made by Mr Rajaram and I agree with many of them. Of course, one of the problems that many countries face with falsehoods is that falsehoods tend to travel much better than truth because they are targeted at stoking up anger and unhappiness. The truth is generally less exciting and, therefore, travels less well. I think you have seen enough articles that point to research which comes to that viewpoint."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00677,2018-01-10-T-024,677,K Shanmugam,"Mr Seah Kian Peng and Asst Prof Mohan both suggested that we should strengthen fact-checking capacity of technology companies. And Ms Thanaletchimi and Asst Prof Mohan also suggested that online, fact-checking platforms be created for the public and Nominated Member Kok Heng Leun also made a similar point. I think these are points that the Select Committee can consider. That is why the terms of reference are drafted widely enough."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00678,2018-01-10-T-024,678,K Shanmugam,"Ms Thanaletchimi said that the Select Committee perhaps can have people from specialised sectors, including media, if I had not misheard her. The Select Committee will comprise Members of Parliament but they can hear from experts from different areas, sectors, including the media and other sectors."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00679,2018-01-10-T-024,679,K Shanmugam,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad and Ms Thanaletchimi referred to measures taken by Germany, the EU, UK, France and New Zealand. In that context, Asst Prof Mohan also talked what the Select Committee can consider."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00680,2018-01-10-T-024,680,K Shanmugam,"I think these are all very important points, important questions. But those are questions for the Select Committee to consider more fully when it starts work. That is why we have crafted the terms of reference broadly, so that different perspectives can come in."
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00681,2018-01-10-T-024,681,K Shanmugam,Ms Sun Xueling asked how the Select Committee will be organised. Mr Kok also expressed the hope that the Select Committee would consult broadly and consider a number of issues. Those are again for the Select Committee to consider after it is constituted.
2018-01-10-T-024-S-00682,2018-01-10-T-024,682,K Shanmugam,"For my part, I hope that different stakeholders will come forward – experts, media, technology companies and the public. I think the process will benefit from different views, different perspectives. Hopefully, the process will help Singaporeans better understand what is at stake. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker."
