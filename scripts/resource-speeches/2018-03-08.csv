2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. Pursuant to the resolution passed by the House on Tuesday, 6 March, I wish to make my statement.",1,2,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00002
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I had written to Speaker on Monday evening, 5 March, to inform him that I wish to make a statement in the House concerning the exchanges I had with Ministers Heng Swee Keat and Shanmugam during the Budget Round-up on 1 March. The next morning on Tuesday, 6 March, Speaker informed me that the Leader of the House also wished to make a statement on the matter. I was not informed of when she would do so.",2,3,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00003
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),She subsequently made a statement that same morning at the start of the sitting while I was on my way to Parliament. She has extended a copy of her statement to me by email.,3,4,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00004
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Speaker, Sir, after the debate on 1 March, I had time to track back what led me to have the impression and suspicions I articulated during the exchanges with the Ministers. I would like to share these findings.",4,5,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00005
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Since 2013, the Prime Minister had said that our expected increases in spending would require more tax revenue. Finance Minister Heng had also made a similar statement in last year's Budget, saying that the Government was studying how it would raise revenue through new taxes or raising tax rates. These statements were very general and did not specify any time frame for the raising of taxes.",5,6,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00006
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In November 2017, during the PAP Convention, Prime Minister Lee announced definitively that the Government would be raising taxes as Government spending on investments and social services grew. He further stated that Finance Minister Heng was right when he said raising taxes was not a matter of whether but when.",6,7,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00007
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The Prime Minister's statement was made on 19 November 2017 with the Budget Statement for 2018 just three months away. Literally, these announcements concerning tax increases set off public discussion and speculation. Three days later, on 22 November 2017, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement that Prime Minister Lee's announcement at the PAP Convention was in line with a much earlier statement made by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman when he was Finance Minister in 2015. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman had then said that the revenue measures that the Government had already undertaken would provide sufficiently for increased spending planned until the end of the decade.",7,8,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00008
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In reporting the MOF statement, Channel NewsAsia commented as follows, and I quote, ""The Ministry's statement came after Mr Lee's comments on the impending tax hike triggered public discussion that the Government is making a U-turn.""",8,9,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00009
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"MOF further stated that planning for the issue now would allow the Ministry to, and I quote, ""better ease in the needed measures and to give our people and businesses some time to adjust"".",9,10,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00010
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The MOF statement did not definitively say that there would be no tax increase in this Budget. The fact is, raising taxes in the Budget and only announcing it in the Budget Statement was what the Government had done in the past.",10,11,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00011
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Hence, the uncertainty over whether taxes, and in particular, GST would be raised this Budget continued even after the MOF statement. This was further fuelled when MOF officeholders kept up the discussion on raising taxes in the immediate run-up to the Budget Statement, saying they were working on when.",11,12,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00012
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Prominent economists went on record to predict that the GST rate would be raised in 2018 or 2019. Such economists included those from UOB, Ernst & Young and DBS.",12,13,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00013
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),What is notable is that nowhere in the discussions just before Budget 2018 did the Government publicly commit that it would not raise GST before 2021. This was only announced on 19 February 2018 during the Budget Statement.,13,14,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00014
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As an Opposition Member of Parliament, it is my duty to watch every move and signal from the Government for the future of Singapore and the welfare of Singaporeans. Hence, I admit that I did suspect that the Government intended to raise the GST. However, the Government contributed to this suspicion by its non-denial of reports and economists' predictions of an immediate GST rise.",14,15,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00015
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Based on the sequence of events, I believed that the Government could have intended to raise the GST at this Budget. Thus, during the heat of the exchanges at the Budget Round-up, I articulated my suspicion. In doing so, I believe I was doing my duty as an MP to convey ground concerns, reactions and confusion. I did not accuse the Government of being untruthful as alleged, and neither had I intended to accuse the Government of dishonesty. I do not accept the over-characterisation the PAP MPs have put on my words and intentions, based on their own interpretation borne out of over-active imaginations and over-sensitivity.",15,16,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00016
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Since the Government has now refuted that it had any intention to raise GST immediately, I can accept that my suspicion then may not have been correct.",16,17,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00017
2018-03-08-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Leader, do you have any response to the clarification?",1,18,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00018
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mr Speaker, I thank Ms Sylvia Lim for admitting that she had made a suspicion, although she has said that she has not accused the Government of dishonesty. But let me put the facts here.",1,19,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00019
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"She made the accusation, she made the statement in the House. At that time, she did not have the facts with her. The Minister for Finance put the facts squarely before the House, inviting her to question as a witness. She did not make any attempt to do that. So, here you are, Minister for Finance, together with Prime Minister with Deputy Prime Minister, putting their statements, explaining to the House their plans all along, they had been thinking about it, in the long run, planning for tax increases for the next decade. And you have an MP coming here to make statements that basically accuses them of doing otherwise. Ms Lim is saying that the Government is saying one thing in public but planning secretly to do another.",2,20,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00020
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"So, I am disappointed that she has failed to apologise to the House for making this false allegations.",3,21,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00021
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"The allegations have indeed harmed and tarnished the reputations of other Members, namely, the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat, because she has put questions, she has not withdrawn the allegations, she has not apologised.",4,22,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00022
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"I think the privilege that Parliamentarians enjoy come with responsibility, that whatever we say here, if you do not have the facts, you should check them, and having checked so, you should consider whether the remarks have indeed hurt the integrity of the Members. And I put to the House that indeed, they have.",5,23,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00023
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"So, I would just like to remind Members of the House that they may not abuse this privilege to misrepresent facts or mislead Parliament. They are not entitled to make unsubstantiated allegations without taking steps to check the facts or knowingly maintain the allegations they have been shown to have no factual basis.",6,24,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00024
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Unlike her colleague Non-Constituency MP Leon Perera, who both withdrew and apologised to this House for making misleading statements in a recent case, Ms Lim has refused to apologise.",7,25,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00025
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"By so refusing, her conduct falls short of the standard of integrity and honour expected of all Members. I must therefore put the honourable Member on notice and the rest of the House too, that if she repeats such dishonourable conduct and abuse Parliamentary Privilege, I would refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges.",8,26,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00026
2018-03-08-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.,1,27,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00027
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to respond. I would just like to make two points at this stage, depending on where the Speaker wants to take this debate. If the Government had indeed been so clear of its intentions not to raise GST before 2021, why is it that the public was so worried that this would happen? Why was it that the economists came up with reports after the Prime Minister's speech at the PAP Convention to predict that the GST rate would be increased in this Budget? Are they all dishonest and hypocritical?",1,28,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00028
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Secondly, perhaps we can get some clarification from the Leader on the standards expected in this House. And I would like to quote this statement from Cabinet which was made in the House quite recently. I begin the quote, ""If MPs believe that something is wrong, it is MP's job to pursue the facts and make these allegations in their name, decide whether something seems to be wrong and if you think something is wrong, even if you are not fully sure, then come to this House, confront the Government, ask for explanations and answers."" This is a quote from Prime Minister Lee during the closing debate on 38 Oxley Road.",2,29,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00029
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"So, I would like the Leader to clarify. Is there a difference in standard here? One standard when the Prime Minister's name needs to be cleared and another standard when we are talking about raising taxes on the people?",3,30,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00030
2018-03-08-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Leader.,1,31,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00031
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In this Chamber, we often make representations and bring forth the views from our constituents, from our stakeholders. This is expected of us. We are Members of the Parliament; most of us are elected to do so, to be the voice of the people. We are fully expected to do so, there is nothing wrong with it.",1,32,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00032
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"But we have a responsibility when we bring this matter to this place. Because this Chamber is for serious debate, is for making laws, is where we have serious discussions about the future of Singapore. So, before we bring the opinions, the speculations, the views, the unhappiness, to this Chamber, we need to check the facts.",2,33,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00033
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Ms Lim has admitted that she did not do so in the first instance. But having said so, after she has brought the matter here, we have laid down the facts to her. The Finance Minister had plainly said that there was not such an intention. And yet, she continued to insist on that allegation. That is the matter that we are discussing here. And this is the difference between what we say in this Chamber and what economists, analysts say outside this Chamber. We have a duty to fellow Members, we have a duty to fellow Singaporeans that whatever we say here carry responsibility. And this also is the standard that the Prime Minister has said earlier.",3,34,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00034
2018-03-08-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.,1,35,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00035
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Sir, I think it is clear where we stand and I would just like to make it plain what my position is. I do not see any reason for me to retract the statements which I made during the exchanges with the Ministers. As I mentioned in my earlier statement, there was a sequence of events which led me to have that suspicion, contributed to by the Government. And secondly, Sir, I will not apologise to this House because I believe that I was doing my duty as an MP in the Constitutional role that we have been elected into, to give the Government the forum to account to the people. And for that, I make no apology.",1,36,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00036
2018-03-08-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I duly note – Leader, anything else?",1,37,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00037
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,I would just like a clarification. Does Ms Lim not retract her allegation?,1,38,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00038
2018-03-08-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,I believe she has been quite clear on that.,1,39,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00039
2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,I thought I made it very clear that I am not retracting.,1,40,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00040
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, I misunderstood earlier. I thought that Ms Lim has admitted that those were her suspicion and that she would retract it. But that being the case, I must say that we are deeply disappointed. For someone of her experience should accuse the Government for lack of candour, even though the facts had been explained to her clearly, both in the public domain in statements made by MOF as well as here, by the Minister for Finance.",1,41,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00041
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I would like to say that her conduct falls well short of the standards of integrity and honourable conduct we expect of all Members, and regrettably, to say that it reflects the low standards which the Member and her Party have set for themselves with regard to commitment to truthful and honest debate in Parliament.",2,42,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00042
2018-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I repeat again – it is expected of us to bring our views forth here. It is expected of us to debate. But if the facts were wrong and we have said that the facts were wrong, we had not had this plan of floating a balloon, only to retract after public pressure, that is just not existent, it is a figment of her imagination, she continues with this accusation, which is deeply disappointing and deplorable.",3,43,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00043
2018-03-08-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I have permitted both sides of the House to state the respective positions. Minister for Finance, would you like to add?",1,44,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00044
2018-03-08-T-002,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to take up this matter. Now, I think, Ms Lim, you made a statement on 1 March and let me quote, ""We do know that in the run-up to the Budget discussion, there were some test balloons being floated out about the facts that the Government needs to raise revenue. And immediately the public seized on the fact that Deputy Prime Minister Tharman and, perhaps, other leaders had earlier said that the Government has enough money for the decade. So, the public pointed out, 'Hey, you know, is this a contradiction?' And I rather suspect"", ""I"" meaning Ms Sylvia Lim, ""that the Government is stuck with that announcement. Otherwise, if the announcement had not been made, perhaps, we would be debating a GST hike today.""",1,45,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00045
2018-03-08-T-002,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"I think what Ms Lim meant by that statement is that she was suggesting that the Government would have raised GST immediately, if not for that adverse public reaction when it ""floated"" the suggestion late last year and if it had not ""stuck"" with the previous statement that it had enough money for the decade.",2,46,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00046
2018-03-08-T-002,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Ms Lim was, in fact, accusing the Government of being untruthful when it says that it had planned ahead and that its proposal to raise the GST between 2021 and 2025 was a result of such planning.",3,47,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00047
2018-03-08-T-002,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Ms Lim asked earlier why is it that the Ministry of Finance did not come out to reveal details at the Budget. The Budget is a serious matter. We take great care in preparing the Budget and that the details are kept as secret until the day of the Budget. Because it has got impact on the market, not just in Singapore but internationally.",4,48,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00048
2018-03-08-T-002,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"So, I do think that these are serious matters. What Ms Lim is saying that your allegations, you made the allegations, you claim to reflect the views of the public. But you said ""I suspect that this is the case"".",5,49,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00049
2018-03-08-T-002,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Parliament is serious forum for us to discuss serious matters. Now that you have the opportunity to gather all the facts, now that I and my colleagues have made all the clarifications, and you had the chance over the last few days since you made the statement, to check the Hansard, to check whatever facts, I think it is only right and honourable that you withdraw the statement. Unless you have a basis for that, that you cannot come here and say, ""I heard this. I am repeating this"". You need to have a basis.",6,50,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00050
2018-03-08-T-002,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"So, having examined all the facts, do you have a basis? And if not, I think it is only right and proper that you withdraw the statement.",7,51,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00051

2018-03-08-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The Minister for Finance mentioned that, of course, Budget preparation is a secret and so on. And I think that is part of the whole issue. Only the Cabinet knows the truth. And as I said in my speech earlier, the Government has said it has refuted that they had any intention to raise the GST this year. I do not know the truth so I can accept that I may have been wrong. But I do not accept that my suspicion had no basis. And I do not apologise.",2,54,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00054

2018-03-08-T-002,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Thank you, Sir. I do take it that Budget is a serious matter, and there is always secrecy because it might affect market movements and all that. But since the Government has no intention to raise GST, I think there is nothing wrong for the Government to come up earlier to say that, ""Look. We do not have the intention to raise GST at this Budget."" That would have cleared the air and the confusion on the ground of speculation that, ""Well, you are keeping quiet, you are raising tax, but not mentioning what kind of tax."" GST is a form of tax.",1,56,2018-03-08-T-002-S-00056
2018-03-08-T-002,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"And that, I think, contributed to ground confusion, and leading to the impression formed. I can understand that in the heat of exchange, that it comes to your mind, you articulated that.

But now, having had so many days to examine the facts, I would like to know whether Ms Lim, do you have a basis for your belief? And now, do you accept the explanations that have been given that this has been intention of the Government, there was no back-tracking, that this was the facts as we had put out. In fact, the issue of raising taxes had been raised many times before that. It is just that the timing and the details are not revealed.

Meanwhile, concerns of social divide were sparked following a study that revealed clear divide among social classes in Singapore.

Many of these organisations often tapped on the same pool of donors and this limits their fund-raising effort to a certain extent. Thus, the matching grant that the Government provides help ease the load for many of them.",1,98,2018-03-08-T-004-S-00098
2018-03-08-T-004,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Over the years, the Government has made injections to the various grants enabling organisations to benefit more from the grants. However, there have also been instances where the matching grants have been reduced or re-allocated from the organisations. When this happens, it means these organisations have to work even harder to raise their own funds to make up for the shortfall from the deduction of dollar-for-dollar matching grant. This can also distract the organisations from focusing on what they should be doing best, that is, providing programmes for community benefit rather than spending time to look for funds.",2,99,2018-03-08-T-004-S-00099
2018-03-08-T-004,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"It may be made worse when a matching fund can be become the end game of these organisations. During times of economic downturn, raising funds become an even bigger problem when people are less likely to donate yet at the same time the demand for the services provided by these organisations increased. So this, essentially, means the organisations may be in a situation where the number of clients in need increased yet their funds decreased. This may end up organisations to scale down their operations or the extent of their services causing them to be unable to serve those in need effectively. Ultimately, reduction in funds leads not only to operation challenges for the organisations but may also exacerbate challenges for Singaporeans in need as their needs are left unserved.",3,100,2018-03-08-T-004-S-00100

May I also suggest that the following criteria to be included if they are not already. First, the integrity and maturity of the VWOs and SHGs; and secondly, the outreach, the SHGs and VWOs, had achieved in previous years.

2018-03-08-T-004,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Integrity and maturity of VWOs and SHGs would be a useful measure of whether it would be able to utilise the funds appropriately. VWOs or SHGs that have long been established and have a good track record in terms of governance and in terms of the programmes and services provided should be accorded a higher cap in the grant. Similarly, an organisation that has a good record of outreach historically could be given even a higher cap. By offering tiered grants it will encourage our organisations, both SHGs and VWOs to improve their processes, governance and standards as well as quality of programmes and services leading to a more vibrant VWO sector which can only benefit more Singaporeans.",6,103,2018-03-08-T-004-S-00103

2018-03-08-T-004,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"One of the key challenges for the new FAS council was to reinvigorate the S.League. How does the Council aim to fill the seats at stadiums across the island, when untested and unknown youth players will be taking to the field?

Are we satisfied with continuing to be has-beens in local and regional tournaments in the foreseeable future?

2018-03-08-T-004,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Beyond the emphasis on youth, one good development is the strong efforts by the FAS to stamp out smoking among footballers, particularly, the younger players. Personally, I am baffled that it took so long for the FAS to act on this, given that any sport, not just football, should have a zero tolerance for smoking and require athletes to be in peak fitness. Regardless, better late than never, so it is a good move on the part of the FAS.",19,377,2018-03-08-T-004-S-00377

Joseph, who used to have a largely sedentary lifestyle, started walking more, watching his diet and sleeping better. A newspaper reported his case in February and mentioned that he has lost 3 kg in one month. I am happy to report that Joseph is now exercising more, six days a week, Monday to Saturday.

Ultimately, we want our freelancers – they are all very hardworking, talented people – we would want them to have meaningful careers but also at the same time, financially viable careers. So, this is a first step we are doing. We hope to lead by example.

They upheld the values and ideals of meritocracy, incorruptibility, multiracialism and personal responsibility, to build a modern and vibrant city with opportunities for all. Today, we can walk the streets feeling safe at night; we take clean air and water for granted; all our children go to good schools where guns and drugs are unheard of; and our youth have diverse opportunities to pursue their dreams.

I know that we achieve this not by spoiling our children and giving them everything on a silver platter; not by disregarding how race and religion continue to define us, even though meritocracy means we have equal opportunity; and not by promising our children equal outcomes regardless of effort.

To win the future, to ride out the challenges of income inequality, disruptive technology and an ageing society, we need the support of all Singaporeans, young and old, to nurture a strong society with an entrepreneurial dare and a smart nation with a heart. Together with everyone in Singapore, we can build a strong Singapore society, anchored in meritocracy, self-reliance, hard work and compassion for the vulnerable and realise our ideal of being one united people.

It is really about how we look after and make things better for Singaporeans as individuals, for Singapore, the community and society. And also, there is a time dimension of meeting today’s needs while catering for future ones. All four are clearly important. They are same-same but also different. There are trade-offs and choices that need to be made, even when we focus on the very reasons for our existence.",7,787,2018-03-08-T-007-S-00787

2018-03-08-T-007,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"It is to discuss how we intend to realise our ideals, aspirations via plans and details. The need to be pragmatic is as important as the ideals we hold dear.

Closer to home, in 1971, S Rajaratnam shared, ""What you have done may not get as much publicity as utterances of professional oppositionists, but long after these have gone, what you have done will strengthen the democracy of deeds and not words.""",9,789,2018-03-08-T-007-S-00789

2018-03-08-T-007,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"But when we look past the differences that are often amplified, do we not see that we have more points of convergence and agreement than not?

2018-03-08-T-007,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Others have noticed this. I recently listened to a BBC interview where a commentator was amazed that a government was able to plan for a tax increase in four years' time.
