2012-09-11-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in March this year, my Ministry announced a series of initiatives to build up community- and home-based eldercare services to better support ageing-in-place. We are on track to roll out the measures progressively over the next few months.",1,7,2012-09-11-T-001-S-00007
2012-09-11-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Last month, MCYS unveiled the ""3-in-1"" concept for Integrated Day Facilities or IDF for short. First, the IDFs will offer integrated care services for the frail elderly, combining social day care, centre-based nursing, community rehabilitation and dementia care. Second, IDFs will provide information, coordination and referral services to better support families and care-givers. Third, the larger IDFs will provide gym and social space for community use.",2,8,2012-09-11-T-001-S-00008
2012-09-11-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"By second quarter of next year, we should complete the building of two new IDFs – one in Tampines and the other in Toa Payoh – and the upgrading of six existing day-care centres to IDFs. Another new IDF at Serangoon will be completed in the second half of 2013. By 2016, there will be about 40 IDFs serving up to 6,000 elderly. Details on the location of the remaining IDFs will be announced in the next two to three months.",3,9,2012-09-11-T-001-S-00009
2012-09-11-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"My Ministry is also introducing social home-based care where the elderly at home can receive care services, such as personal hygiene, housekeeping and laundry from a single care worker. We are working closely with our partners to recruit and train these care workers so as to launch this service in the fourth quarter of this year. By 2016, we will scale this service to benefit up to 4,000 elderly.",4,10,2012-09-11-T-001-S-00010
2012-09-11-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,I am also happy to share that the Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) Grant of $120 per month will come into effect from October this year. Applications have opened since 6 August this year. Households which employ a Foreign Domestic Worker to look after an elderly or person with disabilities and meet the eligibility criteria can apply for the grant.,5,11,2012-09-11-T-001-S-00011
2012-09-11-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To provide greater support for the vulnerable elderly in the community, my Ministry will organise the existing Seniors Activity Centres (SACs) into a hub-and-spoke concept, where Anchor SACs will support clusters of SACs to strengthen and expand their reach. Anchor SACs will perform additional roles, such as closer monitoring through home visits, case management and counselling services, for vulnerable elderly in the community. We expect the first six Anchor SACs to start operations by December this year. By 2016, we will have 16 Anchor SACs supporting some 39,000 elderly Singaporeans.",6,12,2012-09-11-T-001-S-00012

2012-09-11-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, these are some of the initiatives my Ministry is working on to better support our elderly in the community and their caregivers. In planning the number and distribution of eldercare facilities, we take into consideration the demographic profile of each region, the adequacy of existing services and the availability of suitable premises. I am confident that most Singaporeans support the vision of ageing-in-place and understand the need for eldercare services to be developed within our communities. We will continue to engage the local communities, refine the implementation strategies as well as review our services from time to time to ensure that they remain relevant and adequate.",8,14,2012-09-11-T-001-S-00014
2012-09-11-T-001,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Sir, I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. I have one supplementary question for the Minister. We observe that there is an increasing number of Singaporeans in their 50s to 60s who have to support their even more elderly parents in their 80s and 90s. We want to know how MCYS can help this group of Singaporeans better because some of these Singaporeans also have to support their children in their education.",1,15,2012-09-11-T-001-S-00015
2012-09-11-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Sir, let me thank the hon Member Mr Ang for his comment. And indeed, we share his concern that as the life expectancy of our Singaporeans go into the 80s and 90s, there will be people in their 50s and 60s who are required, not only to take care of their elderly parents in their 80s and 90s, but also at the same time, take care of their children who might be in their early 20s or some in their 30s. Indeed, this is one of the big challenges for our society as we face an ageing population.",1,16,2012-09-11-T-001-S-00016
2012-09-11-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MCYS will continue to look at how we can better support this group of people because some of them may be near retirement and they might need some other specific help. On top of the current schemes, we are also going to look at what other new schemes we may be required to implement to cater to this specific group of people that the Member has highlighted, who are in their 50s or 60s. They are near retirement or just past retirement but perhaps still with the need to take care of their elderly parents. In the next few months, as we re-organise ourselves and focus on the potential gaps in our social safety nets in the future, this will be one area that we will be looking at.",2,17,2012-09-11-T-001-S-00017

2012-09-11-T-002,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran,"asked the Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports what will be the priorities of the newly-announced Ministry of Social and Family Development since there are many social challenges that will fall under its purview.",1,19,2012-09-11-T-002-S-00019

2012-09-11-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Chan Chun Sing)","Mr Speaker, Sir, given the emerging demographic, economic and societal challenges Singapore faces, the formation of the new Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will bring a sharper focus to the Government's work in the development of families, social services and social safety nets. At this point, our immediate priority is to ensure continuity in our current areas of coverage from family and social services to community development, youth and sports, even as we work towards a successful transition to the new Ministry.",1,21,2012-09-11-T-002-S-00021
2012-09-11-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Chan Chun Sing)","Looking forward, MSF will focus on three key areas following the transition. First, we will enhance social safety nets for low-income and needy individuals and families. Some amongst these groups have complex needs beyond financial assistance. They may need help in areas such as housing, education and employment, counselling, caring for an elderly or rehabilitation. We will develop more effective initiatives to reach out to them and render help and support to enable them to improve their circumstances.",2,22,2012-09-11-T-002-S-00022
2012-09-11-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Chan Chun Sing)","Second, we will improve the delivery of social services by working closely with the people and private sectors.

We will work on accessibility, affordability and standards, and ensuring more responsive and citizen-centric delivery of services.",3,23,2012-09-11-T-002-S-00023
2012-09-11-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Chan Chun Sing)","Third, we will further strengthen families. The family unit is the bedrock of our society, but it is coming under increasing strain with our changing demographics. We will create a more conducive environment for family formation and the strengthening of family bonds and resilience. We will also review our policies to meet family needs, such as childcare and eldercare, more effectively.",4,24,2012-09-11-T-002-S-00024
2012-09-11-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Chan Chun Sing)","Sir, a strong social service sector is critical to support each of these three focus areas. The Ministry will therefore invest more resources to develop the sector. We will do more in working with the sector to attract, develop and retain social service professionals, raise sector capability and productivity, and improve service co-ordination. Through these efforts, we hope to bring about more resilient individuals and families, and play a part in helping our citizens achieve their hopes and aspirations for themselves and their families.",5,25,2012-09-11-T-002-S-00025

2012-09-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,"The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Chan Chun Sing)","Sir, Mr Christopher de Souza has made a number of suggestions to facilitate the employment of persons with disabilities. This was one key area covered under the Enabling Masterplan (EM) 2012-2016 announced earlier this year. In terms of financial incentives, the Government decided to extend the Workfare Income Supplement and Special Employment Credit to persons with disabilities and their employers. Our current priority is on implementing these initiatives, and evaluating their efficacy before considering new ones.",1,29,2012-09-11-T-003-S-00029
2012-09-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,"The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Chan Chun Sing)","Mr de Souza is concerned that the Special Employment Credit is for those from Special Education (SPED) schools. The SPED school criterion was included to help us better target the relevant group who is likely to face greater difficulties seeking employment. I would like to assure Members that we will allow equally deserving applicants to come onto the scheme, even if they have not attended SPED schools. We will exercise flexibility in the administration of the scheme.",2,30,2012-09-11-T-003-S-00030
2012-09-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,"The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Chan Chun Sing)","Besides providing financial incentives, we need to work on other areas to help persons with disabilities find employment. For example, it is important to help them raise their skills so that they are more employable. As part of our EM efforts over the next five years, more persons with disabilities will receive pre-vocational and vocational education in SPED schools. We are also reviewing the Open Door Fund. One aspect we hope to improve is the apprenticeship element to help the disabled gain better access to job-specific training, something which is also suggested by the Member.",3,31,2012-09-11-T-003-S-00031
2012-09-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,"The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Chan Chun Sing)",I would like to assure Members that we will continue to work with the disability sector and employers to help more persons with disabilities in their training and employment.,4,32,2012-09-11-T-003-S-00032
2012-09-11-T-003,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"Sir, I thank the Minister for the supportive response. I am very glad that MCYS and Government are open to include non-SPED graduates in the Employment Credit Scheme. I would just like to know – instead of leaving it as an open request – is it possible for Government to formally include non-SPED graduates, as long as they have diagnosis and all the support of disability organisations to prove that they do need that support, can we formally include them in the Employment Credit Scheme? And, if so, when can that be done?",1,33,2012-09-11-T-003-S-00033
2012-09-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Sir, let me first thank Ms Denise Phua for the comment and suggestion. Yes, this is an area that we will certainly look at but let us look at the numbers for a start. I must stress that the most important thing beyond the numbers is really to get employers who are understanding and who are willing to partner the sector to re-design some of the jobs in order for the people to be placed in meaningful jobs. As to how we can better help them, having this scheme that the Member has suggested is one way. Beyond this scheme, we are also looking at other ways that we can encourage more employers to be more forthcoming in the re-design of jobs, to enable people with disabilities to join their sector.",1,34,2012-09-11-T-003-S-00034

2012-09-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At the same time, I must also stress that we need a conducive work environment where supportive colleagues can also play a part to help induct these people into the workplace. So, we will certainly look at that.",3,36,2012-09-11-T-003-S-00036
2012-09-11-T-003,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he would consider improving the transport facilities for the disabled in terms of transport availability to help them to get to their jobs or to their doctors; and also, in terms of financial assistance, for the needy who require such transport?",1,37,2012-09-11-T-003-S-00037
2012-09-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Member Dr Lily Neo for her comment. Indeed, we share her concerns about the transportation for the disabled people, from home to work, and also for them to access other services. We are working on two prongs to help the access for the people with disabilities.",1,38,2012-09-11-T-003-S-00038
2012-09-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"One prong is what we call the specialised vehicles.

2012-09-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The other prong that we are working on which we have just recently completed a Request for Proposal (RFP), is to allow some of the people in the disabled community to actually access public transport. We know that the London cab issue has come up. Licences will expire next year. We have just completed our Request for Proposal and I am happy to note that some operators have come forward to help us run a new fleet of vehicles that can take some high-back wheelchairs and motorised wheelchairs to enable our disabled community to have wider access to public transport. We will continue to look at it and closely monitor the demand to see whether there is a demand for us to expand such services to allow our disabled community to have access to the day-to-day living functions.",3,40,2012-09-11-T-003-S-00040

Cleaning used to be characterised by very tough working conditions and low pay. Consequently, few Singaporeans, especially younger Singaporeans, were or are willing to enter this industry. With our recent moves to tighten the supply on foreign labour, this industry is going to have to restructure, and restructure significantly. Our vision is for our cleaners to have a fairer and higher wage and to have better working conditions. NEA is working with the Hawker Associations as well as Town Councils to engage better and more reliable cleaning companies that are willing to pay fair wages and to train their personnel and provide the necessary equipment.",1,50,2012-09-11-T-005-S-00050

Efforts are currently on-going on multiple fronts to improve the standards and professionalism of the cleaning industry. We launched the NEA Clean Mark Accreditation Scheme back in July 2010. There have also been other incentive schemes to support job re-design and better equipment in order to raise productivity and professionalism so that these jobs can pay better and be more attractive.,3,52,2012-09-11-T-005-S-00052

We are reviewing the lessons learnt from these past efforts to see how we can better re-launch a tray-return initiative that is sustainable for the long term. Together with like-minded partners, such as the Singapore Kindness Movement, we aim to launch this refreshed initiative at a few hawker centres in the latter half of this year. This initiative will require both customer involvement as well as the provision of tray-return facilities to improve accessibility and the convenience of doing this. Existing centres will need to be retrofitted with tray-return facilities and, certainly, new hawker centres will be designed with these facilities in mind.",5,54,2012-09-11-T-005-S-00054

This means the different stakeholders will each have to play their respective roles. For instance, as patrons, as customers, we will all have to be more gracious and more considerate, not only for the burden of the cleaners but also for the patrons to join us at the table or eat subsequently at the same table as us. I would point out that it is very wrong to take the attitude that this is a paid-for service, therefore, I do not need to return the tray or I do not need to clean up the mess that I leave behind.

The food centre cleaner jobs are, like the Minister said, often shunned by locals and, in fact, often staffed by the elderly who are mostly unskilled and who have no other options for work. Therefore, installing facilities for the patrons to return their used utensils would, indeed, be very important. I have seen it happened successfully in organisations like IKEA and some more progressive companies at their staff canteens. I do strongly believe that it needs to be done. Since it reduces the hardship of, especially, the elderly cleaners and it does encourage co-ownership of maintaining a clean and pleasant environment for both the patrons and the public, I would like to ask if Minister could accelerate and be more aggressive in the installation of these facilities, especially for the current upgrading of existing food centres/hawker centres and, for the new ones as well.",1,60,2012-09-11-T-005-S-00060

Singapore may be a clean place but it is often due to the hard work of the cleaners rather than the consideration and behaviour of us, Singaporeans. We need better role models and I can think of countries like Japan, Korea, and I have heard, nowadays, even Taiwan, are cleaner, not because they have more cleaners but because people are more considerate and more gracious. That is a harder message but it is one which I hope I will have support from Members of this House, both from the Opposition and the Government to push through. We need that and I think the Opposition, now that you are running Town Councils and hawker centres and cleanliness in your own areas, I think you will agree with me this is an issue which we all need to work together on.",2,64,2012-09-11-T-005-S-00064

In the Ministry's process of retrofitting the hawker centres, whether the new ones or those undergoing HIP, some contractors I spoke with have given the feedback that the design of the tables and chairs, and the spacing between them do not allow for mechanised cleaning equipment to go in and clean under the table. So, that simple retrofitting will need to take into consideration cleaning equipment. Secondly, the location of the cable power points. They are located too far apart so you have the long cables to bring the equipment in.

As Minister has said, cleaning up after ourselves is an act of consideration. However, I have personally come across a number of cleaners and seen other patrons who have been told not to clear our trays because the cleaners were fearful that they might be rebuked by their supervisors, or worse off, lose their jobs because of that. So, while promoting kindness through this process, I would like to ask if the Ministry would also have guidelines in place to ensure that our low-wage workers who, perhaps, depend on this as their sole livelihood, would have their livelihood protected, as well as ensure that operators do not use this simply as an effective cost-cutting measure by getting consumers to clean up for them.",1,69,2012-09-11-T-005-S-00069

This is not a problem which we are going to solve simply by opening the floodgates or even trying to pay people more. Let me assure the House this will not result in unemployment amongst cleaners.

As our labour force growth slows, we will need to ensure that good productivity growth continues, so that our lives can continue to improve. Hence, in 2010, we set an average productivity target of 2% to 3% per annum. These are stretch targets, but they are necessary. In 2010, we saw exceptional productivity growth of 11.1%, but this is one-off as it was due to the strong recovery from the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009. Inevitably, coming off a high base in 2010, our productivity growth in 2011 was 1%. In fact, productivity this year has not been very positive either. This is because employment has grown much faster than GDP over the period.",1,86,2012-09-11-T-008-S-00086
2012-09-11-T-008,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"While productivity growth measured in terms of value added per worker is really quite sensitive to economic cycles and can swing substantially over the short term, the low productivity growth rates over the past one-and-a-half years is a matter of concern and it is something that we are watching quite carefully. It shows really how urgently we need to step up our productivity efforts. We do need to press on with efforts to restructure our economy, meaning to move up the productivity chain. Companies need to reduce their reliance on manpower, and workers need to continue upgrading themselves so that they can take on the higher value-added jobs created as we restructure the economy. If we are to succeed, we must persist in the gradual tightening of our foreign worker policy.",2,87,2012-09-11-T-008-S-00087

The National Productivity and Continuing Education Council (NPCEC) has taken a sectoral approach to engage industries and develop productivity roadmaps tailored for each priority sector. A considerable amount of time and effort has been spent in ensuring that the strategies and schemes can support progressive companies and help them cope in our tight labour market through productivity improvements.

While many of these programmes and schemes are in their initial implementation phase, take-up rates have been encouraging, and we expect this to increase further. I have said this quite often, it is very important for industries, businesses to provide feedback so that we can continue to tailor the programmes so that it is right on target and that it is effective for the sectors concerned.",4,89,2012-09-11-T-008-S-00089

It helps SMEs defray the costs of implementing info-comm solutions. The scheme has seen strong take-up since it was started in April 2011. More than 1,800 SMEs have benefited from the scheme. Companies can claim up to 70% of the qualifying costs for the purchase of info-comm technology (ICT) solutions, such as an accounting and payroll system, or enterprise resource planning solutions.

This is a challenge we do need to continue to address. The best designed schemes with the best intentions are not very helpful if no one makes use of them. Therefore, we need to continue to work to improve them, to improve the accessibility of these schemes so that companies can really tap on them, and like I said before, it is very important that we receive the feedback so that we can continue to refine the process.",7,92,2012-09-11-T-008-S-00092

We believe that increasing productivity is the right way to do so, without jeopardising, at the same time, our competitiveness, which is important, to make sure that companies remain viable because when companies remain viable, jobs are created for our people.

I agree that productivity is a good strategy to enhance the salary of our workers in the long run, but the real challenge is that it is a stretch target. How then can we make people understand – employers and employees – that productivity is the way to go, and are we seeing results in real wages of our workers?

What we have seen in the last 10 years is that productivity growth has moved in tandem with real wage increase. Productivity growth was about 1.7% in the course of the last decade, and real total wages grew at about 1.6% per annum during the same period. Our sense is that with wage productivity growth, as a whole, there would be a possibility for wages to rise at the same time.",1,98,2012-09-11-T-008-S-00098

This is where it is important for us to continue to grow the economy so that it remains competitive. That will also create pressures, which is why the effort of productivity does not exist on its own. The effort in terms of raising productivity is very much tied to our policies in terms of tightening the workforce, especially the foreign workforce. Something that we have embarked on – it largely peaked in the 2008 period and has gradually come down. We continue to step up. There is a range of measures that we take, whether it is a DRC, whether it is a levy and so on. That is very much an effort that we need to continue to focus on.",2,99,2012-09-11-T-008-S-00099

We do know that when we look at other industries, for example in F&B industry – if you look at, say, Japan, the way they construct, it is almost like a production line. The way you operate your shop, your restaurant, it is really geared towards maximising the productivity, maximising the output, in terms of the fewer workers that they have.

When we look at how we have evolved over the last decade, it has put us in a decent position. We need to calibrate because there are obviously disamenities that come and the labour force has grown a bit faster than perhaps we could have adapted to. But we are in a strong position to adjust.",4,116,2012-09-11-T-008-S-00116
2012-09-11-T-008,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We do see jobs continue to be created. Foreign multi-national companies and good Singapore companies remain anchored here, even though we know that Singapore is not a low-cost operating base. But companies find it worthwhile because there is stability, there is certainty. Over time, we have also developed as a hub in many different areas. Much as the world is wired up, a lot of businesses still need to be done on a face-to-face basis. People need to meet. There is a legal infrastructure. There is a financial infrastructure in place. And this hub is created over time, and you create a dependency that exists here. That is why companies remain here. When good companies remain here, good jobs are created.",5,117,2012-09-11-T-008-S-00117
2012-09-11-T-008,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We all know that, increasingly, there are more young people entering the workforce as graduates − one in three; in fact, one in two if we include all the Polytechnic graduates who, after working a few years, will then go on to acquire more degrees. With that, come aspirations, and aspirations for good dynamic competitive jobs. Singapore, by and large, has become that way. But to do that, we need to maintain a decent level of economic growth while at the same time making sure that Singaporeans are at the core of it, so that these good quality jobs can be created to meet the aspirations of young Singaporeans.",6,118,2012-09-11-T-008-S-00118
2012-09-11-T-008,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"That is something that we will continue to work at. In terms of take-up rates, in terms of employment for young graduates and so on, we have seen that the employment rates are good. We do see that real wages continue to grow. But that is not something we want to take for granted. This competition is quite acute, it is something that we need to try to calibrate, and at the same time, maintaining it at a sustainable level.",7,119,2012-09-11-T-008-S-00119

2012-09-11-T-009,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,asked  the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry has monitored the number of Work Permits and S Passes that have not been renewed and the number of new Work Permits and S Passes issued for the last six months; and (b) what is the net increase/decrease in Work Permits and S Passes issued.,1,121,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00121

2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"There are three things we are juggling. Firstly, we need to calibrate our foreign manpower growth via a range of adjustments to our framework and measures. Secondly, we are mindful that companies need to do well, because they create jobs and they create good jobs for Singaporeans. I do not just mean local companies; I mean foreign companies that decide to base themselves here, when they do have decent options elsewhere. Thirdly, we need companies to be more productive and not just depend on easy access to foreign labour.",1,123,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00123
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"My Ministry is tracking the impact of our policies closely, including the number of Work Permits, S Passes and Employment Passes (EPs) and how they are being renewed and issued. We will release the numbers when the 2012 annual foreign workforce data is published early next year.",2,124,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00124
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"What I can share now is that there has been a higher number of EPs and S Passes that have not been renewed. From 1 January 2012 to 31 July 2012, 30% of EP and S Pass applications were rejected, an increase from 26% for the whole of 2011. Twenty-nine per cent out of the total number of rejected applications were for renewals, an increase compared to 21% for the whole of 2011.",3,125,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00125
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The higher rejection rates were due to the following reasons. One, the increase in EP and S Pass qualifying salaries from 1 July 2011. To give companies time to adjust, existing EP and S Pass holders who were due for renewal before 1 January 2012 were given at least an additional year to meet the prevailing more stringent criteria. This is to allow companies time to adjust.",4,126,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00126
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Two, the tightening of the educational qualifications for EP, and with older applicants having to command a higher salary commensurate with their working experience and the quality expected of them, which will kick in from 1 January 2012. This is quite a fundamental and important reframing of EP criteria. It is beginning to take effect, and it is probably important in terms of levelling the playing field for all Singaporeans.",5,127,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00127
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Three, the tightening of the S Pass sub-Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) from 25% to 20% of the total workforce from 1 July 2012, has taken effect for all new foreign workers. However, we have also given companies some time to adjust their strategies. Their existing foreign workers will have up to 30 June 2014 to comply with the new DRCs.",6,128,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00128
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Essentially, that is the data as of now. We will tabulate and track the figures. At the end of it, there will be a more complete picture when we look at how we tabulate the figures as a whole. What I will say is that we need to calibrate. It is not about turning off the tap. As I said, we all recognise that we do need access to foreign workers in our workforce at the different levels. Because what they provide is a diverse workforce which remains important in keeping our companies competitive. At the same time, we need to balance the different things that we need to juggle. How do we keep companies viable? For them to be viable, they do need access to a diverse workforce but, at the same time, being able to generate good jobs for Singaporeans and to make sure that Singaporeans remain the core of the workforce.",7,129,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00129

2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"You can see the tensions pulling in the different directions. Unfortunately, it is not a precise science where we can calibrate all the different dials to exactly the right kind of outcomes we want, because we do not operate on a quota basis like COEs, where I cap the number of COEs we release every month. That is not the direction we want to go because I do not think it will be right to allocate manpower on that basis. But we use the market, we use some of these measures that we put in place, whether DRC or levies, so that there is a cost to companies employing them.",9,131,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00131
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"As I said earlier, a combination with other measures will incentivise companies to transform.

2012-09-11-T-009,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"I thank the Minister for the answer. I do not think he answered the part about Work Permit. He mentioned about Employment Pass and S Pass. In fact, the reason I raised this question is that many of my Members in the Chambers have a common comment about the old Work Permit. When they went to renew their permits, they did not get the permits renewed, and the new ones did not get approved. The impression is that the total number of Work Permits, since the policy kicked in, has, in fact, been reduced.",1,133,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00133
2012-09-11-T-009,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"We were given the impression that there will be no increase in the number of Work Permits and S Passes, and the pricing mechanism will come in. That means the total number of Work Permits will not be reduced, or will grow very slowly. The impression of many businesses is that the new applications do not get approved and the old ones do not get renewed. The impression on the ground is that the total number of Work Permits is reducing.",2,134,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00134
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in some sense, it is a happy problem. Not so happy for the individual companies. Let me explain. From an individual company's perspective, I agree. I get a lot of emails from companies and we meet many of them on a regular basis. There will be individual companies that will find difficulties in renewing Work Permits, S Pass and even EP. They may not even get new ones.",1,135,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00135
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"At the same time, from the market perspective, from the overall economic perspective, the demand is continuing to increase. Companies are growing across the board. Some companies may not get it; other companies do. There are new companies coming online as well, and they are all competing for the workforce that is available. Overall, even as we are calibrating downwards, it is not that the growth has become negative. We have basically slowed down the growth, but it is still growing. We need to watch that growth to make sure that from a macro perspective, it is at the rate that we can sustain; it is a rate that we can be comfortable with. We are still looking at, from a broad basis, about one-third of our overall workforce to comprise of foreign workforce.",2,136,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00136

2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"That is a target from the ESC and which is something that we want to keep to. It will hover at about that level, but the way we calibrate it is through these different measures. Individual companies may find difficulties but other companies manage to get them. And a lot of it will depend on the different criteria put in place.",4,138,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00138
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"What I would like to assure companies is that we are fully aware that companies do need to draw on foreign workers, foreign talent in various forms but, at the same time, we also need to wean companies off easy access to them. In order for that to take place, they need to change the way they do business. Like I mentioned earlier, we do think there is upside certainly in a number of industries and a certain number of businesses where they can transform. Many have begun to do that. Anecdotally, a lot of them are looking at us to make a change and re-calibrate back to the old levels. The point is we are not. Going forward, this is something that we have to do, and companies are taking that on board. And we would like to support the companies in that process.",5,139,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00139
2012-09-11-T-009,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Sir, I would like to ask a clarification with regard to the calibration of EPs and S Passes. Rightly so, companies are recognising the need to adjust, and in the process of adjusting and calibrating – as these are higher-skilled workers that many of their businesses are dependent on – will the Ministry also look at flexibility in allowing for extra time, in terms of short extensions, to allow them as they look for new workers to also do skills transfer, especially for EPs?",1,140,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00140
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"There is indeed space for us to look at individual appeals on a case-by-case basis. For new applicants, I think the rules will kick in quite firmly and quite decisively. I do not think there is any room for manoeuvre with regard to new applicants. But for older applicants, that means those who have been with the companies, and this is where we do understand because someone has been with the company for some time, whether on EP or S Pass, I think there is also, over time, productivity that has been built in because they are fully familiar with the system. So, that is where I think we can look at on a case-to-case basis, how do we then accede to requests and appeals.",1,141,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00141
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"There is also a challenge because we get appeals from all over. Every company will swear that theirs is a special circumstance, they need exceptions, and if we go down that path, it actually becomes difficult because the whole framework will start to unravel. So, there is space, but it does mean that we need to scrutinise the various appeals and, in some cases, we have to accede but not all cases. A lot depends on the circumstances of these companies.",2,142,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00142

Would the Minister consider a tripartite framework where available vacancies in specific industries are made known to the unions to enable us to alert our members of such employment opportunities, before approving these Employment Passes for foreigners? This is also to assure Mr Teo Siong Seng here that we are social partners and we are going all the way out to help him.",1,145,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00145

I just want to return to this key point – that at the end of it, it must make sense for Singaporeans and Singaporean workers, because that is at the core of our interest. How do you then construct a framework that allows that to happen? Having a flexible adept workforce remains important because it allows the whole economy to remain that way, and to remain competitive.",2,147,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00147
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We do see that there are gaps, so there are matching issues. This is where we think that we could do more to plug the gaps where the needs are. We have begun to do that, and we can extend that effort. For example, I get emails from companies appealing and saying, ""Look, I have been trying very hard, but I cannot find Singaporeans who want to do this particular job."" Then, what we try to do is link them up with WDA, with e2i, where they know who are the Singaporeans who are also looking for openings, and then try to match them. Sometimes, there is actually a match in terms of people with certain expertise and with those needs. But we also find that it does not always work out that way because sometimes the companies say, ""Notwithstanding they are skilled in a way, but I do not want to take them"".",3,148,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00148
2012-09-11-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Is it due to inappropriateness or the inappropriate quality of the candidates, or is it because they are still looking at perhaps cheaper options elsewhere? Those are the dilemmas that we need to manage. But I do agree that we can carry out that matching process a lot better. It is really about information − how do we match our awareness of the people, even though our unemployment rate is low – about 3%. But it does represent 50,000-60,000 Singaporeans. How do I make sure that the awareness of who they are, where they are, which sectors they are in, so that we can help to upgrade them and so on, through courses, but at the same time where are the needs in industries, and see how best we can match them. So, working with the unions and companies would be an important step to see how we can move ahead. But to formalise it, that is something that we are open to, but I do not think we need to do that at the moment. It is something that we can consider.",4,149,2012-09-11-T-009-S-00149

While HDB would provide broad planning parameters, such as the mix of flat sizes and the range of social and community facilities to be provided, the developer is responsible for the design, construction quality and the pricing of the flat. Nonetheless, HDB would actively engage the developers by sharing good practices and relevant experiences in public housing development. HDB would also provide useful feedback to the developers and their consultants during the design and construction phases, with particular attention on safety, security and maintenance issues.",1,153,2012-09-11-T-010-S-00153

I hope that Minister can clarify whether there has been such a policy, or if there were other factors that could have led to such perception.

Whether we can play a mediating role depends on the specific issues involved. At the end of the day, we must be mindful that it is a contractual obligation between the buyer and the seller.

In a mature town like Bukit Panjang where we have something like eight BTOs announced, the concern among residents, understandably, is whether all the infrastructure like roads, public transport and facilities and amenities like hawker centres and so on, would be able to cope with the increase in population. The problem on the ground is always this  there are so many agencies to deal with, and each time when the construction starts, there is no co-ordinating agency to work through. So, I am glad that the Senior Minister of State has said that HDB should be the agency. I want to ask the Senior Minister of State this  should there be a situation where, for example, LTA says that ""We cannot build any wider roads here now; we cannot have more road links or more public transport"", is HDB still going to proceed with some of these constructions, knowing that there is going to be congestion on the ground?",1,167,2012-09-11-T-011-S-00167
2012-09-11-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"My second question is whether in the ramp-up to this housing programme, is it reasonable to build eight BTOs at about the same time, all at one go, in a mature estate? Should HDB not phase out some of these at different locations so that we do not have a complete tsunami of housing construction going on at the same time?",2,168,2012-09-11-T-011-S-00168
2012-09-11-T-011,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Well, I thank the Member for his questions. I see that there are immediate worries but also longer term happiness because his town would be transformed in three to four years' time. When HDB plans for any major expansion, they would do so by taking advantage of existing infrastructure that are being laid out well ahead of time in that particular estate. So, in Bukit Panjang, I would assume that the entire town is planned in such a way that it is to house a certain density or population and the resulting vehicular density and so on. On that basis, while residents may see empty land parcels in their neighbourhood in the last few years, they should expect the parcels to be filled up in a way that will be supported by a certain housing density when built up. On that premise, HDB will go forward to launch new projects onsite. As Minister has said, some of these sites are built so that they can take advantage of the existing amenities.",1,169,2012-09-11-T-011-S-00169
2012-09-11-T-011,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"I would like to assure the Member that in his particular location of Bukit Panjang, where eight BTOs have been announced and are under construction, HDB keeps a close eye on what is happening on the ground to make sure that as and when the project is executed, mitigating measures on pollution will be taken to ensure that inconvenience to the residents is minimised.",2,170,2012-09-11-T-011-S-00170

2012-09-11-T-011,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask Minister how often does he has these inter-ministry meetings. Certainly, I do not agree that there is good co-ordination. For example, in Yishun South, I have six BTOs, but the road network that you are going to provide to serve the residents in that area will be completed only in 2015, whereas I will have five BTOs completed by 2014. So, there will be a big jam along Lentor Avenue. The other aspect is the bus services. Definitely, bus services are grossly inadequate. Is this being discussed, when was it discussed, and how will it be resolved?",1,173,2012-09-11-T-011-S-00173
2012-09-11-T-011,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for her questions as well. The co-ordination meetings are on-going. In the recent ramp-up of BTO flat construction, we have learnt a lesson internally that we also need to plan on a longer time horizon. In other words, some of the major infrastructures, such as vehicular network and rail access, will take a much longer time than construction of HDB flat precincts. That co-ordination for short-term construction projects and longer term planning are on-going, and we would intensify them as and when necessary. In the Member's particular area, we would suggest that we continue to stay closely co-ordinated, in terms of bringing the various pieces of infrastructure to take place at about the same time, so that the inconvenience on the ground can be minimised and shortened. We will convey the Member's concerns to MOT and LTA.",1,174,2012-09-11-T-011-S-00174

2012-09-11-T-011,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Sir. A follow-up question for the Senior Minister of State  when I liaised with HDB about the BTO projects, they made reference to the fact that a lot of the plans are reflected in the URA Masterplan for 2008, and indicated to residents that they could refer to the URA website, or the publicly available information concerning the URA project plans, housing plans and plot ratios and the likes of it. It is not co-ordinated within the HDB domain, or within the HDB website to describe to people what is going to happen. You have multiple agency information that requires individuals to navigate in order to understand the development on the ground. I hope that in the co-ordination effort with HDB, they could synthesise some of the information so that residents have a better idea as to what is going to happen to their town, what kinds of developments are going to take place over the next few years, and how the masterplan will affect their living environment as a whole. Then, they are better informed and know what choice they have to make, what neighbourhood they are going to stay in.",1,176,2012-09-11-T-011-S-00176
2012-09-11-T-011,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Well, on an on-going basis, HDB does conduct briefings to the local MPs, and the entire GRC sometimes, to update them on key projects that will take place or are scheduled over the next few years. I personally attended a number of such briefings. I find them very useful. What may be useful, going forward, is to make available some of this information publicly, to the residents. We have to do so carefully, because as soon as we make it public, we also lose some flexibility on subsequent fine-tuning or adjustments or acceleration or push-backs on some of the plans. We will discuss with the local Member of Parliament and see how best to have meaningful communications with the residents.",1,177,2012-09-11-T-011-S-00177

I can imagine a situation where you could have a party which pushes it to the limits and the police were forced to intervene. I think that would be a very problematic situation.

In lift lobbies where there is a minimum access area of 1.2 metres, would these items be allowed?

The HDB, MND checking of Town Councils' performance leading to the quarterly reports seem to also adopt the same practices.

These are requirements not only for the purpose of imposing rules but for the safety of the residents. But if there are other things, clutters or decorations or plants which may bring other kinds of problems, which do not necessarily impose fire hazards or evacuation problems, these are rules which MND or Town Councils have, in implementing them.

Before I go on to share more on what and how the Government subsidises public transportation, let me say at the onset that under our model, the transport operators bear the operational costs for running the system, and these operational costs are recovered largely from public transport fares. The Government, on its part, bears the cost of infrastructure development which includes capital intensive infrastructure like MRT tunnels, stations, depots as well as bus interchanges, terminals and bus stop shelters.",1,224,2012-09-11-T-015-S-00224

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Sir, the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) prescribes the responsibilities and obligations pertaining to the employment of foreign workers. We last amended the EFMA in 2007.",2,234,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00234
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"In the last few years, my Ministry has taken steps to moderate the inflow and raise the quality of foreign manpower in Singapore. We want to shift from a labour-driven to productivity-driven growth model. Our intent is to ensure that we support decent and sustainable economic growth that will create good jobs and wages for Singaporeans, and to ensure that our Singaporeans remain at the core of our workforce. The adjustments we have made to our employment framework and regulations are aimed at supporting this intent.",3,235,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00235
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Employers in Singapore are, by and large, responsible, but there are some who seek to profit by circumventing our work pass framework. As we further tighten the policies on the hiring and retention of foreign manpower, we can expect errant employers to try harder to get around the rules. This is where we are not lacking in creativity. For example, we have found some declaring higher salaries than they are actually paying their foreign workers, asking foreign workers to foot their own levies and insurance premiums, contributing CPF to locals that do not really exist or, at least, are not actively in their employment, in order to meet the required ratio of local to foreign workers, and submitting forged certificates to qualify for skilled work passes.",4,236,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00236

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Singaporeans ultimately suffer when employers fail to pay the true costs of hiring foreign manpower or hiring foreign manpower that they are not entitled to. Local workers will lose out in employment opportunities. Honest employers who play by the rules are also unfairly disadvantaged. Besides errant employers, syndicates also profit from setting up sham operations to illegally import and supply foreign workers who otherwise should not be here. Syndicates have devised increasingly complex schemes to get around our enforcement approaches. Such operations exploit foreign workers and they also cost our local employment opportunities and cost us resources to assist stranded workers.",6,238,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00238
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Sir, the proposed amendments to the EFMA will enhance the Government's ability to ensure the integrity of our work pass framework. Recognising that EFMA contraventions range widely from administrative infringements to criminal offences, these amendments will introduce a calibrated and appropriate response to different types of contraventions. In totality, the changes will allow my Ministry to step up enforcement actions against errant employers, errant foreign workers and syndicates more expeditiously and effectively, thereby enhancing deterrence against EFMA contraventions, which ultimately hurt Singaporeans.",7,239,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00239
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We have made the amendments along three broad thrusts. Firstly, MOM will establish an administrative penalty regime to enforce administrative infringements to complement our prosecution efforts. We will impose significant administrative financial penalties and administrative actions, such as debarment from applying for and renewing work passes. The purpose is to deter employers from exploiting the work pass framework for financial gain. Secondly, to enhance deterrence, MOM will introduce new EFMA contraventions and increase penalties commensurate with potential profits gained from abuse of the system. Thirdly, to facilitate enforcement against common contraventions and syndicate operations of increasing complexity, MOM will include new presumption clauses and expand our investigatory powers.",8,240,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00240
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Sir, let me start with the first set of amendments. All EFMA contraventions are currently classified as criminal offences. These range from breaches which are often administrative in nature, for example, the failure to pay S Pass holders via GIRO, to the more egregious and clearly criminal offences which harm workers, such as non-payment of salaries and the collection of employment kickbacks. At present, the criminal process can be lengthy and consume prosecutorial and court resources. Therefore, we need to take swifter actions against administrative infringements, rather than going down the criminal offence route, and to ensure that penalties are more severe and also at the same time commensurate with the impact of those contraventions. Employers who are trying to profit by getting round our work pass rules must be made to disgorge their ill-gotten gains through imposing sufficiently high financial penalties and debarring them from applying for and renewing foreign work passes. This would be more effective than prosecuting them in court via the criminal route.",9,241,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00241

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We have, therefore, strengthened the process by differentiating EFMA administrative infringements from criminal offences. This is not a weakening of the process; rather it is about making it much more effective. Some existing EFMA offences will be newly classified as administrative infringements under the new penalty regime. Let me describe some examples to these details later.",11,243,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00243
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We used essentially three principles to determine which infringements to classify as administrative infringements and which to regard as criminal offences. First, administrative infringements do not cause direct harm or abuse to workers. Where workers are harmed or abused, it is still important to retain the possibility of custodial sentencing. Second, these infringements would not have been regarded as criminal activities outside the work pass framework. Third, administrative infringements are those for which administrative financial penalties and administrative actions, such as debarment from application of work passes, would be effective in deterring errant behaviour. Given that administrative financial penalties have limited effect on the majority of foreign workers, my Ministry will retain all contraventions committed by foreign workers as criminal offences.",12,244,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00244
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The Commissioners for Foreign Manpower will be appointed and authorised to administer the new administrative penalty regime. The Controller of Work Passes can now delegate his powers to authorised officers to administer the regime under the new section 3(3). These Commissioners will be empowered to impose administrative financial penalties, capped at a maximum of $20,000 per infringement, debar employers from applying and renewing work passes, and give directions to comply. Such directions include orders to rectify breaches, impose performance bonds to ensure compliance with rules and regulations, and direct that compensation be paid by the employer to make good any sums due to an employee.",13,245,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00245
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"With the establishment of the administrative penalty regime, a new section 25 has been introduced in the Bill. MOM can now prosecute infringers that fail to comply with the Commissioners' directions, subject to a maximum fine of $10,000, or to a maximum imprisonment term of 12 months, or to both. Unpaid administrative financial penalties will be recovered by the Government as civil debts. The Commissioners will now have inquiry powers and it allows infringers to submit written representations in response to the Commissioners' findings. The inquiry process will be directed by the Commissioners, and any hearing that may be convened by the Commissioners will be informal in nature, without the presence of legal counsel, to keep the proceedings expeditious and lower costs.",14,246,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00246

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),The Minister for Manpower will be given the power to establish an independent Appeal Board to assess appeals against decisions made by the Commissioners for Foreign Manpower. The Appeal Board will consist of three members. The Chairperson would be someone who is qualified to be a Judge of the Supreme Court. The Appeal Board's decision is final.,16,248,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00248
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Sir, let me emphasise that this move to classify certain infringements as administrative in nature by no means represents a softening in our enforcement approach. Rather, these amendments will allow us to step up enforcement and increase our enforcement effectiveness. We expect the Commissioners for Foreign Manpower to take faster action against infringements. The maximum administrative financial penalty of $20,000 per infringement will be sufficiently high, we believe, to disgorge illegal economic profits from employers. Together, these moves should allow the Government to achieve wider deterrence against errant employers and thereby protecting the majority of employers who are fair and responsible employers.",17,249,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00249
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Some administrative infringements are also related to criminal offences that preserve the possibility of harsher sentencing for employers who harm or abuse workers. For example, while failing to purchase medical insurance for Work Permit holders is an administrative infringement subject to a maximum administrative financial penalty of $10,000, the failure to bear the costs of upkeep and maintenance of Work Permit holders, including medical treatment, is an offence subject to a maximum fine of $10,000, or to a maximum imprisonment term of 12 months or to both. This approach will allow the Government to calibrate its response depending on whether the employer was simply trying to save costs, or whether he was in many ways neglecting his employment obligations to the foreign worker.",18,250,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00250
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"I will now move on to the next set of proposed amendments. We intend to raise the signature and better define the elements of serious contraventions. MOM will establish five key stand-alone contraventions, and raise their penalties.",19,251,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00251
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"First, we will now prosecute syndicates that set up shell businesses and illegally import and supply foreign workers. These syndicates circumvent our immigration laws on employing illegal immigrants. They recruit foreign workers ostensibly on legal work passes, but do not provide actual employment, upkeep or maintenance. Instead, these workers are then left and forced to seek illegal employment on their own. Syndicates have also evolved from setting up pure shell businesses to setting up partial-sham businesses that may employ a few local workers for genuine business operations, while, on the side, recruiting foreign workers on false promises of employment and supplying them out illegally. MOM will adopt the same penalties for employing illegal immigrants under the Immigration Act and impose them on offenders who illegally import and supply foreign workers. This will include a fine of up to $6,000, a minimum imprisonment term of six months, up to two years, and mandatory caning for offenders that hire more than five foreign workers. Further, the court will confiscate the illegal profits collected from supplying and importing foreign workers. In determining the sum to be confiscated, the court may also separately order compensation to any workers who have suffered harm as a result of the employer having brought them into the country without providing them with proper employment.",20,252,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00252

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Second, we will prosecute foreign workers that submit forged educational qualifications to circumvent MOM's criteria for educational qualifications, especially for S Pass and EP holders. Offenders will be subject to a maximum fine of $20,000, or to a maximum imprisonment term of two years, or to both. Foreign workers have also been known to submit forged educational qualifications and subsequently feign ignorance of the submission, which hampers our enforcement efforts in proving that they had knowledge of the falsehood. Hence, we will now presume that a work pass applicant has knowledge of the information provided in his application, including that of the qualifications which have been submitted. The burden of proof will now be placed on the errant workers. My Ministry will ensure that enforcement action is targeted at culpable workers. An innocent worker can rebut the presumption by proving that he did not have knowledge of the submission of false qualifications when the declaration was made. For instance, he can prove that the employment agency or employer had submitted the forged certificate on his behalf without his knowledge. My Ministry will take action against other culpable parties, such as errant employers and employment agents, if they have abetted such acts.",22,254,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00254
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Third, we will prosecute persons, including employers, supervisors, HR staff and sub-contractors, that collect monies as consideration for employment from foreign workers. We usually refer to such monies as ""employment kickbacks"", which workers are made to pay based on promises of employment. The collection of employment kickbacks increases the foreign workers' debt burden while disadvantaging Singaporeans in favour of foreign labour. Offenders will be subject to a maximum fine of $30,000, or to a maximum imprisonment term of two years, or to both. The court will confiscate the employment kickbacks collected from foreign workers and return the monies to the State. This is separate from the court's power to award compensation to workers who have suffered harm from the demand or receipt of kickbacks.",23,255,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00255
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We will also introduce a presumption clause to make it easier to enforce against employers who demand employment kickbacks from workers. Currently, employers' illegal collection of payments from foreign workers is usually made in cash, there is no paper trail to speak off, and this seriously constrains our enforcement efforts.",24,256,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00256

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Therefore, we will presume that any monies collected from foreign workers will be deemed as employment kickbacks, unless the purposes for which they were collected can be properly accounted for. The accused can rebut the presumption by showing that they had legitimate reasons for collecting monies from their workers.",26,258,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00258
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Fourth, my Ministry will impose a maximum administrative financial penalty of $20,000 on errant employers that illegally recover employment costs from foreign workers. Under our work pass conditions, employers should be bearing costs, such as foreign worker levies, security deposits, medical insurance premiums and so on. Instead, some employers, the errant ones, fail to bear the true costs of hiring foreign workers by recovering these costs from their workers. The Commissioners for Foreign Manpower will be allowed to impose administrative financial penalties on such errant employers to disgorge illegal profits, debar them from applying for and renewing work passes for foreign workers, and impose directions on employers to compensate foreign workers for the recovery of employment costs.",27,259,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00259
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Fifth, the Government can impose a maximum administrative financial penalty of $20,000 on errant employers that pay CPF to local ""phantom workers"" to inflate their foreign worker quota, in order to have access to more foreign workers which they do not have access to, in the first place. The Commissioners for Foreign Manpower will also be allowed to debar employers, and impose directions on employers to mitigate his wrongdoings and prevent recurrence. Although this new contravention attracts administrative penalties, persons who set up shell or partial-sham businesses using local phantom workers to bring foreign workers into Singapore and release them to find their own employment will continue to be dealt with in court. They will be prosecuted under the new illegal labour importation offence which, as highlighted earlier, carries severe penalties that may include jail time and caning.",28,260,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00260
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Although there are essentially no changes to key employer responsibilities, the five standalone contraventions, enhanced penalties and two accompanying presumption clauses will enable us to step up enforcement against errant employers and syndicates and to look after Singaporeans at the same time and to make sure that we protect the majority of employers who are law-abiding and responsible.",29,261,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00261
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"To further enhance deterrence, we will increase maximum penalties for EFMA contraventions. The penalties have been benchmarked against contraventions of similar nature in the Immigration Act and the Penal Code. They have also been calibrated to ensure that more egregious offences attract higher penalties. Severe offences, such as illegal employment of foreign workers, will be subject to harsh penalties including a minimum fine of $5,000, up to a maximum fine of $30,000, and/or a maximum imprisonment term of 12 months, for first-time offenders. This will also allow the courts to take into account any costs avoided by the employer, including medical and work injury compensation insurance premiums, security deposits and levy payments. Administrative infringements, such as the failure to terminate the employment of a foreign worker after receiving notification of the Controller's revocation of the worker's work pass, will be subject to a $10,000 administrative financial penalty.",30,262,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00262

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"I earlier mentioned that errant employers can be debarred from applying for and renewing work passes. However, creativity kicks in again and to circumvent MOM's debarment, errant employers have resorted to applying for work passes using the names of other people that are not debarred, as they continue actually, for all intents and purposes, to run the same business behind the scenes. Errant employers also get their associates to set up what appear to be new businesses, and transfer their existing business, including their workers, business contracts, and business premises to these associates. So, basically, they change the signboard. To prevent errant employers from deploying such tactics, the Controller, in the exercise of his discretion, may now debar persons who have acted in concert with or on the direction of a debarred person, or debar associates of debarred persons who are engaged in a trade or business which is substantially similar to that of the debarred person.",32,264,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00264
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Aside from the key contraventions, the work pass conditions within the Employment of Foreign Manpower Regulations will be updated with more explicit requirements, to provide greater clarity on employers' responsibilities. Contraventions of the work pass conditions will likewise be classified as administrative infringements or criminal offences.",33,265,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00265
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Currently, the Minister may prescribe conditions that apply during the validity of the work pass. These conditions prescribe in detail the duties pertaining to all aspects of the foreign employee's entry, work, stay and conduct while employed in Singapore, as well as his departure upon the cessation of employment. To broaden the scope of employers' responsibilities where necessary, section 29 has been amended to allow the Minister to impose pre- and post-employment conditions under the EFM (Work Passes) Regulations. An example of which is the pre-employment condition that requires employers to ensure that the In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter in native language is sent to foreign workers prior to their departure, to keep them informed of their actual employment terms and reduce their reliance on unscrupulous middlemen. An example of a post-employment condition is the requirement for employers to provide upkeep for foreign workers awaiting resolution of statutory claims in Singapore, including claims under the Employment Act and Work Injury Compensation Act.",34,266,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00266
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Sir, it is very critical that employers are able to meet the criteria for hiring S Pass and EP holders not only when they apply for the pass but throughout the validity of their work pass. At present, there are no explicit restrictions on the reduction of salary after an S Pass or EP holder has secured a work pass here. An errant employer – and they exist – would circumvent the salary criteria of our S and Employment Passes by declaring higher salaries to secure these passes and then sharply reduce the salaries thereafter, that is, after the passes have been issued. To close this loophole, we will require all employers who wish to reduce the salaries of their S Pass and EP holders to submit a request for re-assessment of their work pass eligibility. This will not prevent employers from reducing the salaries of their foreign workers for legitimate reasons. But all they have to do now is to submit the lower salaries for re-assessment of their eligibility of a work pass and we will consider that. If they are not eligible for their current work passes, the employer may consider downgrading to another work pass type that carries more restrictions, or try harder to recruit a Singaporean. This new requirement will be elaborated in the EFM (Work Passes) Regulations. This requirement will make it harder for errant employers to abuse the work pass framework, and help protect job and wage growth opportunities for Singaporeans. The failure to comply with this regulatory condition will be subject to a maximum administrative financial penalty of $10,000. The Controller of Work Passes may consider waiving this requirement, for example, in a general economic downturn where salary reductions may have to be made across the board to help businesses stay afloat.",35,267,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00267

However, errant corporate officers often, and almost always, deny knowledge of such contraventions, for example, when an officer overseeing salary payments claims ignorance that salaries were not paid. We will now presume that a corporate officer, who is primarily responsible and has failed to exercise reasonable supervision, has acted in neglect and is liable for the respective criminal offence or administrative infringement. The corporate officer can rebut the presumption by proving that he had exercised reasonable supervision to avoid the commission of the contravention, for example, if he had taken all necessary steps to ensure prompt salary payment and safeguard against lapses.",38,270,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00270
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"MOM will have enhanced investigatory powers. This includes the power to enter and inspect a premise where any work pass application has been made, where a foreign employee is working or accommodated, or any business premises belonging to the employer, at any reasonable time. This will allow MOM to assess the authenticity of the work pass applications, the existence of business operations and weed out shell businesses during upstream audits. In addition, MOM will be allowed to search a premise by force, if there is reasonable belief of a breach of the EFMA or when a foreigner can be found within the premise. MOM will also have the power to take video and voice recordings during investigations and use the recordings as evidence in Court. Finally, employers may also be asked to produce all employees, both local and foreign, to the best of their ability to assist in investigations. The enhanced range of investigatory powers is largely based on similar powers granted to MOM under the Employment Agencies Act and Workplace Safety and Health Act. So, in a sense, it is not new. Employers can be assured that only trained MOM officers are allowed to carry out such operations, as they do now under the Acts mentioned earlier. They will also exercise these enhanced powers judiciously, only when circumstances require such recourse, and taking care to minimise disruptions to genuine business operations.",39,271,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00271

Just as we have done this round, we will engage stakeholders on the proposed changes. As mentioned before, we are also going to undertake a review of the Employment Act.",42,274,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00274
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Sir, this Bill, ultimately, is aimed at going after errant employers. Most employers in Singapore are responsible and fair. And this Bill, ultimately, bolsters our efforts in creating sustainable and inclusive growth in Singapore and ensuring that Singaporeans remain at the core of our workforce. It will do so by ensuring employers pay the true costs of hiring foreign workers and creating a level playing field for law-abiding employers. This Bill also seeks to stem the worst abuses against foreign workers. This is in keeping with our values as a society, that we believe all our workers should be treated fairly, decently and with respect, regardless of their nationality. Let me close by saying that this Bill is really about looking after our Singaporeans, that they remain at the core of our workforce, and this Bill is about the kind of people and society that we want to be. Sir, I beg to move.",43,275,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00275

2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the quick action taken by the Ministry of Manpower to plug the loopholes that are being exploited by some employers in employing foreign workers. While people might say that the crooks are always one step ahead of the law, I think, in this case, the long arm of the law is quickly catching up.",1,278,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00278
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sir, I believe it is correct that we should have a set of instruments to deal with different situations that we find ourselves in. Like having a good Swiss army knife, we should be equipped with the appropriate and effective tools for the job. Likewise, in the proposed amendments to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, the Ministry wants to establish an administrative penalty regime and Commissioners of Foreign Manpower to complement criminal actions. I think this is a good move as it allows for certain offences to be dealt with quickly and makes the point that we will not tolerate the illegal employment of foreign manpower. This protects honest employers as well as foreign workers.",2,279,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00279
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Additionally, Sir, by adding new contraventions and enhancing enforcement, the Ministry will be able to send a strong message to employers to take their responsibilities towards workers, both Singaporean and foreigners, seriously. Illegal employment of foreign workers will be dealt with firmly, and the penalties are a stiff deterrent. The proposed amendments will also go some way to enhance Singapore's position as a safe place to work, even as we compete with the region for skilled manpower. This will continue to be a constant challenge, given the economic growth that we are aiming at in the coming years.",3,280,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00280
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Having said that, Sir, I would like to make a few broader points. As we all know, the issue of foreign manpower in Singapore is fairly emotive. The feedback I received from residents and fellow Singaporeans are quite clear. They are being felt everywhere and every day, be it in the MRT trains, at the workplace, in shopping centres and at the hawker centres. Or in the polyclinics and hospitals, and in our void decks and gardens, we encounter foreign workers in all these places, and many more. But is this phenomenon recent? We have had foreign workers here for many, many years. Yet, it seems that, sometime over the last couple of years, we suddenly reached a tipping point.",4,281,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00281
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The daily touchpoints between Singaporeans and foreign workers suddenly became not touchpoints, but friction points. Complaints, at first soft and infrequent, became more strident, and amplified by social media, the complaints reached a point where the situation seemed intolerable.",5,282,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00282
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Though I may not agree with all the views and feedback, I empathise with many of my fellow Singaporeans. The fact is that we reached a threshold that seemed to be unbearable. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, it seems. But, I cannot help, Sir, but wonder − when did it happen? At what point was too many too much? If we can find this out, it would be instructive for our policymakers – where exactly is that tipping point? Find that out, and maybe save ourselves a lot of grief in the future.",6,283,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00283

2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sir, allow me to highlight two additional points in this discussion. One, it is imperative that we manage the influx and quality of foreign workers. It has become clear that in the tug-of-war between demand for foreign labour and the stress that they put on our infrastructure, the limits of our infrastructure have fortunately won – at least for the immediate future. Nonetheless, as we take errant employers to task, we should also ask ourselves  how many of these employers had to resort to illegal ways because their legitimate application for foreign workers was turned down? Imagine a situation where a contractor submits a bid for a construction project. He does not carry foreign workers on his payroll until he is sure that he has a project to deploy them. This is a common situation. Once he secures a contract, he would be in desperate need for foreign workers. Yet, because of the tight work permit situation, he may be unable to get approvals. What does he do? Decline the project, and risk his company's viability? If he does that, he risks closing down, and that helps no one, because even the Singaporeans working in his company could become unemployed too. You could imagine that the contractor would be tempted to use other ways to get his workers.",8,285,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00285
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My point here, Sir, is that even if these amendments are approved, the authorities should carefully look into the individual circumstances of each case, because not every employer who breaks the law is an evil opportunist, looking at squeezing the last buck from hapless workers. Ironically, it is these very contractors who will build our infrastructure, to alleviate the crunch that we are facing today.",9,286,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00286
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"This brings me to my second point. I accept that Singapore businesses must wean themselves off the reliance on foreign workers. One cannot simply expect to use larger and larger numbers of foreign workers instead of investing in productivity improvements. I think this argument is valid in most industries – increase the productivity and you will be in a better situation. However, for small and medium companies, and, in particular, in the service industry, it is more challenging to reduce reliance on manpower. Take the food and beverage industry for example. Yes, a number of companies have been able to mechanise to save labour. We have conveyor belts to serve food. We have noodle-frying robots. We even have robots that could serve as waiters, though I am not sure if this is fully implemented out there.",10,287,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00287
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"With all due respect, not everyone wants to eat off a conveyor belt. Some may want to be served, to have a cosy neighbourhood cafe to go to, to relax and spend time with friends and family. And if we are going to allow for this range of dining options, we have to acknowledge that certain types of food outlets are heavily reliant on manpower. Waiters, cooks, baristas, and the like – many people also prefer the personal touch. We also have to allow that in between hawker centres and Michelin-star restaurants, there should be a whole range of dining options, run by small and medium entrepreneurs, who are at the core of our economy. These offer dining options at various price points. And for particularly the small outlets − the truth, Sir, is employing Singaporeans while at the same time keeping prices reasonable has become an insurmountable challenge for them. I am regularly told that the salaries they can offer for cooks, waiters, cashiers and the like are at a level that Singaporeans are not interested in. So, the jobs are out there, but, unfortunately, Singaporeans are not interested in them.",11,288,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00288

2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"It would be worthwhile for us to consider the difficulties of this group of businesses. Perhaps, we should look into how to support the employment of Singaporeans within such businesses, or open up options for the employment of foreign manpower. Sir, while on this subject, the MOM website states that service-sector companies wishing to apply for work permits, indicating lower starting salaries, can recruit workers only from the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea and Taiwan. Could the Ministry explain why is this so, and consider extending the source countries so that employers have a wider choice of recruitment to support the wider range of dining options that are available today in Singapore?",13,290,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00290

2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, Singaporeans must always be at the heart of our foreign worker employment policy – and I would include employment under work permits, S Passes and EPs. If, for example, Singaporean workers and Singaporean businesses can prosper by allowing in more foreigners, and the cost is an infrastructure crunch, then I say, build more infrastructure.",15,292,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00292
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"If Singaporean workers' jobs are threatened by allowing in more foreigners, then I would say, upgrade the skills of our workers, then make them world-ready and more skilful so that they are able to compete with the best. And if salaries in certain sectors or certain jobs are too low, then maybe we can think of creative and innovative ways of giving Singaporeans additional allowances to take on these jobs. There are already precedents – many companies and even the Government give hardship allowances to people posted to more undesirable jobs, albeit overseas.",16,293,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00293
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"If Singaporean workers' advancement prospects are dimmed, then the Government must take a closer look at companies, particularly those with a sizeable foreign workforce, to see whether they deal fairly in offering promotion prospects. At the same time, when approving EPs, especially at the higher end of the spectrum, the Government must be convinced that the company could not find a single Singaporean capable of performing the job. If we allow the companies to decide what is good for them, then, sadly to say, they will decide what is good for their company and not necessarily good for Singaporean workers or Singapore. In addition, the Government must also be satisfied that the qualifications and experiences, as well as the economic contributions that applicants declare, are fully verified before EPs are issued.",17,294,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00294

2012-09-11-T-016,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, in the pursuit of economic growth, the business of bringing in migrant foreign workers has spawned into a business that has a life of its own. The very process of bringing in these workers is so lucrative that it does not matter if there are matching jobs for them. For some unscrupulous agents, it does not even matter if there are any jobs for these workers, for there is money to be made just by landing them here on our shores. And this lucrative business of bringing in migrant workers alone unwittingly benefits the Government as well because every worker comes with a levy to be paid on the dot, on the 17th of each month by GIRO, regardless of whether there are matching jobs or any jobs for these workers or not.",1,297,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00297

We have heard and read horror stories about how some of these migrant workers are being treated, and sometimes abandoned, the moment injuries befall them. It is very sad to know that some of these workers already living in poverty back home and going into debt in order to make the trip here will end up worse than ever before because of some unscrupulous agents and errant employers.",2,298,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00298

2012-09-11-T-016,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"This amendment Bill before us is largely in the right direction. I hope the Ministry of Manpower will continue to be guided by these twin principles. Singaporeans want the Government to be serious about enforcing our foreign manpower regulations and we want to be a humane society which guarantees that the workers, foreign or local, are treated decently and not exploited. The new section 22A of the Act, as provided by clause 17, which punishes employers who deduct money from workers' salaries to pay for levies or other costs that they themselves are liable for is a case in point. This is a good move. Nevertheless, the NGO Transient Workers Count Too still voiced their concern, that is, ""Lack of simple mechanism for workers to recover their monies and compensation even so ordered by the Ministry of Manpower"". Can the Minister respond to this?",2,304,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00304
2012-09-11-T-016,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"In being serious about enforcing our foreign manpower regulations, granting inspectors higher levels of authority, such as the right to enter premises and to take audio/video evidence, is critical. The amended powers of employment inspectors laid out in clause 12 are, therefore, important. Industry observers are generally of the opinion that the gap between the practice and principles of the amended Employment of Foreign Manpower Act will be the problem. I say this not to state the obvious but to draw attention to clause 8 which concerns levies. Focusing on levies as an instrument of control may not be better than using foreign worker quotas. Business owners are unlikely to be incentivised to hire Singaporeans over non-Singaporeans because they can always pass on the additional cost of the levy to the worker or to their business customers. Even if stricter foreign worker quotas are implemented, the Government will not lose out in revenue collection since the levies here have been increasing. Increasing levies is a win-win situation for the Government. More revenue is collected and foreign manpower is controlled. But we also need to think of employers, especially those who run SMEs. How can we help them if they are squeezed by increasing levies? Can more be done besides asking them to increase productivity levels?",3,305,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00305

What employers need to do is to ignite employees' passion for their jobs, strengthen their sense of identity towards work, provide adequate training, and create an innovative culture among employees. Personally, I only discovered recently that innovation can actually be taught. In fact, innovation and creativity often come from within the company. Given the right inspiration, employees often can zoom in on the problem and find new ways to improve efficiency.",15,324,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00324
2012-09-11-T-016,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"The illegal employment of foreign workers highlights the severe shortage of manpower, as well as other problems, for example, the local workforce structure, employee training programmes, and ways to improve workflow. To turn the situation around requires the collective effort of the entire society. For example, food court operators must provide relevant facilities and Singaporeans must slowly adjust to the self-service model, and return plates and dishes to collection points after using them.",16,325,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00325

Punishing employers and employment agencies is the right thing to do, but it is critical to find a solution to the problem. With regard to tackling the foreign worker issue, I believe that companies, employees and, in fact, the entire society, has reached a critical juncture for change. So, as long as the tripartite partners work closely together, we can definitely find a solution.

2012-09-11-T-016,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"As we aim to position Singapore as a global city for global talent and skilled labour to come here to grow our economy, we need to ensure that our laws and regulations also incorporate the safety and welfare of this group.

I am aware that many businesses, particularly the SMEs, are facing a difficult time coping with the rising costs of doing business in Singapore. These include costs of manpower as well, especially since the Government has taken steps to reduce the dependence on foreign workers. While this forces companies to look deeper into productivity – and that is a good thing – we also need to be more mindful that we should not burden our SMEs with too high costs.

2012-09-11-T-016,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Sir, these are the cases where workers are suffering from agony for a second time while waiting for the judgement, or they already have suffered at the hands of the errant employer or the agent. These workers without working rights are a liability to the country and also a potential source of social problems. The issue here is created by the inordinate time taken for the dispute resolution processes to be completed and the lack of a right to make a living for the foreign worker.",12,344,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00344
2012-09-11-T-016,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"I would like to suggest that the Ministry establishes express special benches to hear such cases in a short period of time and deliver enforceable and binding judgements. The workers can then leave the country upon resolution, thus easing the burden and problems for all. Further, the Ministry should consider short- term work permits to allow them to work in the interim period while awaiting judgement so that they are not a liability to the state in any form.",13,345,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00345
2012-09-11-T-016,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"The amendments seem to come down rather heavily on faking credentials. While the spirit is welcome, there are grey areas which are particularly making low-wage and less educated workers vulnerable. A lack of understanding of legal implications and English language on the part of the workers may allow the agents to exploit the situation and have employees sign on blank documents. Widespread education of penalties on employees for falsification of data should be done both in Singapore and in foreign countries of interest.",14,346,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00346
2012-09-11-T-016,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"The proposed new section 22B makes it an offence to ""obtain a work pass for a foreign employee for a trade or business that does not exist, that is not in operation … and fails to employ the foreign employee"". In cases of companies whose object is to supply workers to other companies, this is a reality leaving workers in Singapore without jobs and income. The law is clear in its intent. But there should be further detailing to ensure that contracting companies or agent companies are having the foreign workers on regular payroll and not keeping the workers as an available pool for subcontractors. This can be done by having electronic time sheets using biometric and itemised salary slips and paying their salaries direct into their bank accounts to avoid disputes on outstanding wages, and so on. Wage disputes are often a big proportion of contentious issues for foreign workers.",15,347,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00347

2012-09-11-T-016,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"One of the root causes for disputes is false representation and false promises made by agents about the job scope and benefits while the employees are still in their home countries. Besides, the dispute often stems from the huge amount of monies paid as agent's fee in the home country, in addition to any monies being paid later after arriving in Singapore. Most of these agreements are verbal and cash transactions which cannot be verified. The goal should be to root out possibilities of misrepresentations by middlemen. Although the rules and regulations are in place, the Ministry should have tighter guidelines and monitoring of agents who may act in collusion with several other people within and outside Singapore to give false hopes and promises to innocent and gullible workers. The number of agents and their methods of working need monitoring and control to eliminate any possibility of abuse of the law. We should perhaps regulate this profession in order to monitor standards and quality as well as ensure that the integrity of the profession is not compromised.",17,349,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00349
2012-09-11-T-016,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Sir, while dealing with foreign manpower problems, it will be a good idea to explore working with the governments of those countries, the main ones in particular, especially through their Embassies in Singapore. They can help in endorsing foreign credentials and spreading the rules and tight regulations including penalties for offenders in home countries. Exploring possibilities of working with authorised employment bureaus in foreign countries may possibly limit pranks by middlemen.",18,350,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00350

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, allow me to discuss the amendments to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Bill from two different perspectives  the perspective of the foreign workers themselves and the perspective of the employers. I have four issues to raise on each side.",1,352,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00352
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Let me start with the foreign worker perspective. The first issue of kickbacks and churn. In order to get the foreign worker perspective, I went to visit several foreign workers last Sunday at one of the bigger dormitories in Singapore. These dormitories house about a thousand men from Bangladesh, India and China. All of them share similar living and working conditions, 10 bunk beds to a room, no mattresses, but their financial circumstances were very different, depending on what country they come from and what type of employment agencies they used. Some of the younger workers I spoke to, have to pay as much as $7,000-$8,000 in their first year. They get sent back and then they hope to come back in their second year, but they have to pay another $4,500 in fees. Thus, I hope that these tougher penalties will stop such kickbacks and exploitation and, hopefully, lead to lower costs for these foreign workers. This should lead to better and fairer treatment for them.",2,353,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00353

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"The second issue is a longer employment term. Will MOM also consider granting a longer employment term beyond one year especially if the worker has done a satisfactory job? Currently, many get sent back after a year and they do not even break even.",4,355,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00355
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Thirdly, heavier penalties on workers. Incidents of forgery of certificates or falsification of documents will mean workers are penalised with up to 24 months in jail or 12 months for employers. Can we justify workers having such heavier penalties for the same crime?",5,356,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00356
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Lastly, cutting back on welfare. Would MOM ensure that higher levies imposed next year will not lead to employers cutting down on providing basic welfare for their employees to save costs? Whilst these workers build beautiful skyscrapers for us, they do return each night to fairly spartan living conditions. Any worsening of these conditions could spark more social issues.",6,357,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00357
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"I now go on to the employer perspective. In order to get the employer perspective, I spoke to business associations, employers and even some insurance companies that provide coverage for these workers.",7,358,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00358
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Firstly, finding the perpetrators of kickbacks. Because of these kickbacks, some companies have been able to hire foreign workers through S and Employment Passes at effectively lower costs than they should be. This in itself is a deterrent for productivity gains. As the Acting Minister himself said, most of these kickbacks are received in cash. Hence, it is very difficult to prove that such errant employers are receiving kickbacks. Hence, any increment in penalty may not have a significant deterrent unless such enforcement measures mentioned in clause 12 can be effective in apprehending such employers. So, the question is  will these amendments be effective in finding the perpetrators?",8,359,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00359
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Secondly, more clarity on stiffer penalties. The Acting Minister did bring up the myriad of increment in penalties. These penalties have been increased to a new maximum of $20,000-$30,000 in cash, caning and imprisonment. The question here is one of clarity for determining the penalty and the extent of the civil servants' empowerment and the determination of whether it is a financial penalty, caning or imprisonment. Hence, I think it would be good to have a clearer or, perhaps, a simpler structure on these penalties, instead of the current way of meting out a combination.",9,360,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00360
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Thirdly, raising productivity of foreign workers. As we embark on productivity gains for local workers, will MOM also consider allowing foreign workers to improve their productivity by allowing them to multi-task, that is, whilst their work passes may specify a single job description, can they be allowed to advance on, take on more, or can their existing insurance policies be extended for more coverage?",10,361,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00361

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Also, we hope that the changes in DRC does not mean that employers have to let go of their more experienced and productive workers. With tighter ratios, it will also be more difficult for employers to plan their employee training, hence impeding productivity gains.",12,363,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00363
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Lastly, the timing of these tightening measures. Higher levies, heavier penalties and tighter ratios mean higher costs for employers. In fact, one can argue that what caused many Singaporean employers to break the law initially was the sharp rise in labour costs caused by the tightening measures that started in July 2010. Now with margins being squeezed further by global economic headwinds, some local employers have to choose between closing down their businesses or resorting to even cheaper labour. If more SMEs close down, the risk is that lower wage Singaporeans who are hired in this sector will suffer. Hence, I would suggest that there may be a time to review this approach of restructuring our economy and I question the timing of such measures now. This tightening is a self-imposed supply side constraint that can result in slow growth and high inflation.",13,364,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00364
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Finally, I will summarise the objectives of these amendments. The first objective of preventing exploitation of foreign workers from unscrupulous employers is to be applauded and fully supported. The other objective of ensuring that Singaporeans are not denied jobs when employers circumvent these rules to hire cheaper foreign labour needs to be questioned further. I would argue that if we are indeed successful in our efforts to improve the skills, productivity and wages of our lower income Singaporeans, then they would not want to take up these jobs left behind by low-wage foreign workers.",14,365,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00365
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"I would argue that most Singaporeans aspire towards better paid jobs through skills upgrading. Hence, rather than focusing on squeezing employers to reduce their dependence on foreign labour for lower skilled jobs, why not channel our resources and efforts on improving the skills of our lower wage Singaporeans instead? This will enhance their employability and ultimately raise their standard of living. This is what inclusive growth is all about.",15,366,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00366

2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"This Bill, which tackles these issues amongst others, is therefore well intentioned. That said, I would like to seek clarification on three issues from the Acting Minister. First, the proposed new sections 7(4C) and (4D) of the Bill allow the Controller in some instances to debar a person from applying for or being issued with a work pass. I understand the need for this amendment – it deals with previous offenders circumventing their debarred status by enlisting the help of others to employ foreign workers. However, the net may be cast too wide.",4,386,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00386
2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There are two categories of persons who are debarred. The first is those who act in concert with, or at the direction of, the debarred person in connection with the employment of any foreign worker. This clearly makes sense and is directly relevant to the problem.",5,387,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00387
2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second is more problematic – it covers associates of the debarred person who are engaged in substantially the same trade or business as the debarred person. There is a broad range of people who are defined as ""associates"", and may catch people with little connection to the debarred person. To give an example, a person whose partner in a partnership is a relative of a debarred person and who is engaged in a similar trade as the debarred person may find himself unable to employ foreign workers because he is deemed an ""associate"" of the debarred person.",6,388,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00388
2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The answer I suspect will be that it is necessary for the Controller to have a wide discretion to do his job, and he will know how to properly exercise it. But that should not be the starting point. Surely, there must first be some evidence that the associate is acting with, or at the direction of, the debarred person. If so, that will be caught by the first category and there is no need for the second. Not being able to employ foreign workers may well break a business, and we should not draft our laws in the name of expedience to give such wide discretion as to make things less certain for employers.",7,389,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00389
2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There is, of course, the option of appealing to the Minister under section 7(5). But this process may prove too long, onerous or costly, particularly for SMEs. And who is going to do the job while the appeal is pending?",8,390,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00390
2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Could the Acting Minister therefore clarify how the subsection relating to ""Associates"" will be applied? In particular, under what circumstances will an ""associate"" be debarred in the absence of any evidence that he is working in concert with, or at the direction of, the debarred person in relation to the employment of foreign persons?",9,391,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00391

2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My second query relates to the protection of vulnerable foreign workers. The proposed amended section 5(7) imposes a longer maximum term of imprisonment of two years on foreign workers who work without a valid work pass. In contrast, employers who employ foreign workers without a valid work pass are only subject to a maximum term of imprisonment of 12 months. This limit of 12 months applies even on a second or subsequent conviction. This disparity in sentencing appears anomalous. First, there are cases where illegal foreign workers are victims of human trafficking, and have been lured to work in Singapore under false pretences. In such cases, surely the employer is more culpable if he hires him. Second, even where trafficking is not involved, greater culpability lies with the employer where he has deliberately hired illegal workers to cut business costs and compete unfairly. In fact, it is the demand for illegal employees from these errant employers that fuels the supply. Could the Acting Minister therefore clarify the reasons for the difference in punishments?",11,393,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00393
2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Related to this issue is the repealing of section 15 of the Act, and replacing the burden of proving the truth of the contents of a written application for a Work Pass with the presumption that the foreign worker had knowledge of the information provided in the application. This presumption has the effect of making it easier to convict foreign workers. However, the reality of the situation is that foreign workers are in a position to be exploited by unscrupulous employers. If an employer chooses to falsify the contents of his application to aid his application, the foreign worker in question is unlikely to protest.",12,394,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00394
2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The point to be made is really this  the foreign employee or worker is in a vulnerable position relative to the employer. He is likely to be less informed about his obligations. He is also unlikely to question his employer's actions because of the financial pressure he is under. The amendments to sections 5(7) and 15 are not reflective of the power imbalance between foreign employees and their employers. Specifically, the fear of criminal sanction may prevent illegally employed workers from coming forward or seeking help, even in extreme circumstances. Employers may use the threat of exposure against foreign workers to keep them under control. The increase in the maximum imprisonment sentence for foreign employees under section 5(7) may aggravate this problem.",13,395,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00395
2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Enhancing penalties against illegal foreign workers and making it easier to prosecute them is not a deterrent. That presumes they know the law, which is unrealistic. The focus should therefore be on restricting the demand for these foreign workers. We should enhance penalties against errant employers. We should also consider alternative approaches. For example, granting amnesty or repatriation for illegals who turn themselves in and testify against their employers.",14,396,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00396
2012-09-11-T-016,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My final query relates to section 25. This provision reclassifies certain offences under the act as ""prescribed infringements"". These prescribed infringements attract a financial penalty, and deal with situations such as employers inflating their foreign employee entitlement. While this scheme allows such cases to be settled quickly and easily, justice may be compromised. One reason is that the standard of proof has been lowered to a balance of probabilities unlike the criminal standard of ""beyond reasonable doubt"". Furthermore, section 25(4)(c) states that no party may be represented by an advocate or solicitor. In the case of SMEs, this may be difficult if they do not have in-house legal expertise to deal with such matters and make effective representations. Hence, this new scheme again has the effect of trading fairness for administrative efficiency. There is no reason why the employer should not be allowed legal representation if it wishes it. I hope the Acting Minister will be able to address my concerns regarding this new provision as well.",15,397,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00397

What about deducting from foreign workers salaries for payment of acute medical care required by these workers whilst they are still being employed?

To continue Singapore's path of growth, the contribution of foreign workers is inevitable. We need to appreciate their contribution and respect them as fellow human beings.

Legal rules and regulations can only go so far. The true success of these legal reforms will depend very much on the renewing of our approach, treatment of and engagement with our foreign workers.

2012-09-11-T-016,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, the Bill's new presumption clause on ""kickbacks"" presumes that any monies collected from foreign workers are collected as consideration for employment, and will attract a maximum fine of $30,000 and/or two years' jail. I hope this presumption clause goes a long way towards deterring the illegal practice by employers and their intermediaries, both foreign and local, of demanding exorbitant fees from foreign workers. I get consistent feedback from foreign workers, from Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar, that this practice is persistent and widespread. They are expected to pay thousands of dollars, often in cash, to secure or renew their employment in Singapore. These transactions often involve multiple parties, all part of well-organised syndicates. Not only do such practices subject poor foreign workers to long servitudes of crippling debt, but they also deceptively position Singaporeans at an unfair disadvantage to foreigners, by distorting the true level of foreign worker wages.",7,452,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00452

The Ministry may wish to time their implementation of these rules with their readiness to step up checks, using a special enforcement task force.

Unfortunately, too many do not understand their rights, their avenues for redress or the procedures for reporting abuse. Many foreign workers suffer exploitation in silence, fearing the loss of their jobs; and often not without justification. For example, one Bangladeshi worker related how he had once joined a group of 25 workers to complain about their errant employer to MOM – in the end, 20 of the complainants lost their jobs as they were terminated shortly thereafter.",13,458,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00458

If whistle-blowers can be assured by MOM that they will assist them in finding another job in Singapore, it would help remove the fear amongst these vulnerable workers of being punished when they help to bring errant employers to book.

To ensure that companies develop a strong core of Singaporeans amongst PME jobs, I had called for employers to be obliged to show that they had attempted to employ Singaporeans first, before they consider foreign executives.

In most other countries, it will be taken for granted that locals should be considered first for jobs, and employers are expected to demonstrate that they had made a great effort to do so, before considering foreigners. Employers are also mandated to pay foreign workers the prevailing market salaries for locals so that the same occupational group, are not compressed by the presence of foreigners in the workplace who are willing to take less for their work.

We need a benchmark. The Ministry of Manpower can also consider tying the application of Work Permit to the employment of local older workers. We believe that a qualified and better skilled worker is not only more productive, he is also easier to train and integrate, and is less likely to come saddled with huge agency fees or false educational qualifications.

I would like to urge the Ministry of Manpower to take a stricter view and set a quota on the number of labour supply agencies for each economic sector and that there should be regular audits carried out of their employment practices. The owners of the employment agencies should also meet essential requirements such as a sound background, appropriate qualifications/training and experience. The quality of hiring and adherence to work pass framework can then be better ensured.

A certain portion of foreign workers only receive their salary in cash. There may not be any salary or pay slips issued to the workers. At the same time, employers may threaten to terminate these workers if they would report to the authorities about underpayment or working overtime without payment. As mentioned earlier, these foreign workers may still be owing thousands of dollars to employment agencies even before coming over to Singapore. They would not want to risk their jobs. We do not know how many of such cases there are. Salary arrears or tracking can be difficult for foreign workers who are sometimes illiterate. These are complex issues that will be faced in the enforcement of the law.

2012-09-11-T-016,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Another area of concern is about the re-categorisation of the penalty regime into criminal offences and regulatory breaches in the amendment Bill. While I understand that the rationale is to achieve greater expediency with the outstanding cases, we ought to be careful with the signalling effect to the employers. Does it mean that those categories of offences under regulatory breaches which do not cause direct harm to foreign workers be seen to be settled with ease and treated with less rigour? For example, the inflation of foreign worker quota is listed as an administrative breach. This could have serious implications as any additional foreign worker hired is depriving our citizens a job opportunity. Many Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) have shared with me about their worries of their jobs being displaced in a restructuring exercise when it turns out that employers have decided to replace them with S Pass holders or EP holders. What is even more difficult to ascertain than a foreign worker quota is the actual job scope that the foreign workers are tasked with. For example, an S Pass holder may be delegated jobs that are executive in nature while still holding on technical responsibilities.

If employers are the critical link in this process, we ought to carry out a deeper cost-benefit analysis in hiring foreign workers. Let us face this – the levies, training, food and accommodation paid to upkeep a foreign worker in Singapore has a direct correlation to the final wages that they are paid. This, in turn, provides a direct comparison point in hiring a Singaporean. If the wages paid to foreign workers are too low, they are tempted to flout the law in taking on more jobs illegally. They may not be able to have enough to survive in Singapore. We should not earn the unwanted reputation of being a sweatshop bent on exploiting foreign workers.

2012-09-11-T-016,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Fair sustainable wages for foreign workers are also in reality determined by the employers' ability to pay them. In the application process for foreign workers' permits, there should be closer scrutiny by the Ministry of Manpower on the financial situation of these applicant companies. If a company's revenue streams are vulnerable and at the same time it has incurred huge debts, the foreign workers that it is seeking would definitely be left in the lurch when the company collapses or when the business fails. Hence, there should be tighter financial screening as well as criteria established. Maybe we can even have a situation where the approval of Work Permits is not just based on the sectoral quota but also the market capitalisation of the company.",11,490,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00490

While changes to the Bill are intended to have a systemic impact on foreign worker issues, I support the call by my fellow Parliamentarians to urge MOM to give a sharper focus on some details of the intended changes in order to prevent any possible loopholes that may be exploited by employers to the point that the impact or outcome desired by introducing these amendments are negated.

The law has to try and pre-empt these creative tactics and stay several steps ahead of these perpetrators. Where it is not possible to do so, then tough measures will have to be taken in order to ensure that there is some sense of equity and that law abiding companies and the Singapore workers at large are not placed at a disadvantage.",2,497,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00497

2012-09-11-T-016,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, I support the move that requires employers to pay S Pass holders fixed monthly salaries that are not below the threshold set. There have been cases where employers put up applications for S Pass holders with salaries that appeared to meet the basic requirements but, in reality, these are not the true wages paid by the employer. A union leader shared with me a story where his employer declared that they were paying an S Pass holder more than $2,000 but in effect the worker was getting a much lesser income. The shift allowance was added to top up the difference to meet the S Pass qualifying income criteria despite this worker not working under shift. This is an abuse of the system as it puts other law-abiding companies at a disadvantage and it leads to an imbalance of opportunities for Singaporean job seekers as it deprives them of job opportunities in the company. We do not want to create a situation where the loophole makes it more compelling for an employer to engage an S Pass holder over a Singaporean with the same skill sets and qualifications just because it is cheaper for them to do so.",4,499,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00499
2012-09-11-T-016,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, I would thus like to call for a system where employers have to clearly state the breakdown of the salary of their S Pass workers so that there is clarity on their basic wage and how much is being paid for other allowances. Currently, the law requires S Pass holders to earn at least $2,000 without specifying whether the salary is indeed $2,000 or the gross payment made to the S Pass holders is $2,000. There must be greater clarity on what the salary requirement entails at the point of application for S Pass holders.",5,500,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00500

Making this mandatory will help facilitate investigations for such disputes and will establish the facts of the case more clearly and conclusively.",6,501,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00501

We, the union, have received feedback from our foreign worker members that without a bank account, they do not have a safe place to keep their hard-earned income and risk it being stolen at their dormitories.

The onus is on the employer to provide accommodation for their workers and ideally, of course, we would want all of them to follow the laws, but in order for this to happen, there must be more land space provided by the Government for more dormitories to be built. Many employers face problems securing apartments for their workers as it is difficult for them to rent private apartments, and even those who manage to do so may face complaints from neighbours.

As I said earlier, we are by no means softening our approach. Since most employers who use local phantom workers are seeking to bypass the work pass framework for economic gain, we should hit them quickly and hard where it hurts most − which is in their pockets. With the new regime, enforcement will be swifter and financial penalties will be high enough to disgorge their illegal profits and hence, deter employers from such wrongdoings. The adjustment from just purely a criminal route to an administrative route is not about efficiency, it is about making sure that these moves are effective.",11,517,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00517

Under the employment of foreign manpower regulations, we will also make it an infringement if employers reduce the salaries of the S Pass and EP holders without submitting a request for re-assessment of their work pass eligibility to the Controller of work passes.

One of the key initiatives was to curb the excessive charging of fees by Singaporean agencies to the worker. Fees are now limited to no more than one month of his salary for each year of the duration of the approved work pass or employment contract, whichever is shorter, subject to a maximum of two months' salary. Local employment agencies are also prohibited from abetting or taking employment kickbacks, and the earlier measures described will kick in if this happens.",18,524,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00524

I share his concern at face value, if we were to look at it from that perspective. However, I think it is important to look at the discussion in context. The courts have thus far typically awarded fines only and not jail terms for illegal employment offences, regardless of whether they were committed by employers of foreign workers. That is what happening presently. In any case, we should view these proposed penalties holistically. The penalties for illegally employed workers and employers who hire them differ in several ways. For employers who illegally employ foreign workers, we will impose a mandatory minimum fine of $5,000 per charge on first-time offenders and the mandatory minimum fine of $10,000, again, per charge plus a minimum imprisonment term of one month on repeat offenders. There are no corresponding minimum fines or imprisonment terms for foreign workers.

However, the possibility that some of them might be innocent victims should not lead to a lax enforcement approach towards all foreigners trying to work here illegally. Rather, the approach that my Ministry and the Ministry of Home Affairs have adopted under the National Plan of Action against Trafficking of Persons is to put in place procedures to identify victims who have been coerced or deceived into false labour situations. Labour trafficking victims will not be prosecuted as illegal workers.

The work pass conditions currently already impose requirements on employers, including provisions on ensuring acceptable accommodation, the prompt payment of salary, the provision of medical treatment and ensuring the safety and health of the workers at work. To answer Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef's queries specifically, arrangements for foreign workers to pay part of their medical bills are only allowed for employers of non-domestic foreign workers. Businesses that wish to have such arrangements for their employees' medical costs may do so provided that the part of the medical cost to be paid by the foreign worker is only for costs that have exceeded the minimum $15,000 mandatory medical insurance coverage.

It is really about recognition of the imbalance in their relationship. I think that is a fair concern. But as a matter of principle, I think we all agree that any party who submits any application declaring certain facts about himself or herself to the Government should also at the same time bear responsibility to its contents. Errant foreign workers have been known to submit forged educational certificates to circumvent S Pass and EP controls or collude with foreign employment agencies in their home countries to submit forged certificates and subsequently feign ignorance.",29,535,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00535

We have encountered many cases where workers denied that they signed the application form or claimed that they signed blindly without knowing the contents of the form. Such a defence is easy to raise but it is very difficult to rebut as ultimately the knowledge lies in the mind of the beholder. For example, we had a case last year where a worker was actually acquitted despite confessing that he knew that the forged certificate had been prepared by his agent. His defence was that he was unaware that the forged certificate was part of the stack of supporting documents for his S Pass application that he had, in fact, personally submitted to the Ministry.",30,536,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00536

If we try to be too narrow or prescriptive in our definition of ""associates"", offenders easily and very easily resurrect their businesses and continue to employ the foreign workers. This will make a mockery of our penalties.",34,540,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00540
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Let me share some real cases to illustrate. A cleaning company and its HR manager were both charged for making false declarations to the Controller and were thus debarred from hiring foreign workers. The HR manager's husband was a manager in the original company, proceeded to set up a new company. This new company was identical to the original company in all material respects – same management, same services and even same cleaning equipment and actually the same foreign workers – just under a different name.",35,541,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00541
2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In another case, shortly after a seafood restaurant was debarred from hiring foreign workers, we found that a new seafood company, with a strikingly similar name, had been set up. It had put in applications for work passes, relying on foreign quota obtained by CPF contributions to several local workers, of which two were directors from the original seafood company. Both companies shared the same registered address. When my officers visited the address, the signboard of the original seafood restaurant was still there. So, they did not even change the signboard. The workers were even wearing the old uniforms. Everything was new in name only. These things happen. I think that is where we realise over time that in certain cases, you will find that sometimes, when incidents are reported, we were not always able to proceed and prosecute effectively because in the regulations and laws, we did not have all the space available for us to move accordingly, hence the amendments to this Bill.",36,542,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00542

But because we can expect that they will just continue along this path, we have sought a wider berth for the Controller in this instance. If we leave exploitable loopholes, we will really risk undermining the effectiveness of our enforcement efforts and deterrent measures. The amendments in this Bill are not just about amending the Bill itself, but to facilitate enforcement. In fact, other Members have highlighted that my Ministry should increase the rigour of its upstream checks to better regulate which businesses are allowed to bring in foreign workers.",37,543,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00543

2012-09-11-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Patrick Tay suggested that MOM consider issuing work passes to businesses based on assessment of their market capitalisation to ensure that only financially viable businesses are allowed to employ foreign workers.

I agree, and MOM is committed to doing so. As I mentioned earlier, Commissioners for Foreign Manpower will now have the powers to order administrative, financial penalties, debar employers from hiring foreign workers and impose directions on employers. Such directions to remedy, mitigate or eliminate any effects of any infringement will include compensating workers when their employers recover employment costs, like levies, from them. Failure to comply with the Commissioner's directions will be a prosecutable offence, subject to a maximum fine of $10,000 or to a maximum imprisonment term of 12 months, or to both.",40,546,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00546

Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef also noted that enforcement efforts should not be carried out in isolation. I fully agree that Government agencies should not work in silo and we do not. There is close coordination between the relevant Government agencies, and MOM frequently conducts joint inspections with agencies, such as the Singapore Police Force, ICA, CNB, NEA, SCDF and URA on foreign worker housing, immigration as well as employment-related offences. I, myself, have been to a number of these inspections.

The new administrative penalty regime that MOM will put in place will have appropriate safeguards to ensure that the infringer is not denied his fundamental right to be heard and that natural justice is upheld. The infringer would be made aware of the case and evidence against him, and he would be given ample opportunity to respond. The infringer would also be able to appeal against the Commissioner's decision, should he also choose. Such appeals would be entertained and would be directed to an Appeal Board which would consist of three members and be chaired by a person qualified to be a judge of the Supreme Court and legal representation would be allowed there.",46,552,2012-09-11-T-016-S-00552

We have indeed stepped up publicity targeted at foreign workers. To empower workers to make informed decisions about working in Singapore, my Ministry revised the in-principle approval letter for work permit holders last year to include key employment terms and translated all these letters into the workers' native languages. My Ministry has also piloted pre-departure briefings in BCA's overseas test centres in workers' home countries such as China, India and Bangladesh. We will also reach out to foreign workers with these messages through various channels when they are in Singapore, including a foreign worker handy guide and a foreign worker newsletter, and through road shows held in worker dormitories and areas where they frequently congregate.

In 2010, the Economic Strategies Committee concluded that skills, innovation and productivity must form the basis to sustain Singapore's economic growth. As we shift towards productivity and innovation-driven growth, we will create more higher value jobs that will require Singaporeans to have more knowledge, skills and experience. We are already seeing this today as Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) make up about one in three resident workers, the fastest growing segment of Singapore’s resident workforce.",1,568,2012-09-11-T-018-S-00568

Differentiation of the university landscape can also create more pockets of excellence. We have already done well in developing good research-oriented universities. The introduction of more applied, practice-oriented degrees at SIT and UniSIM will provide a differentiated pathway, one with close linkages to industry as graduates will be equipped with industry-relevant practical skills.

It also means that the playing field is more level and competitive for all. In order to meet these aspirations, we need to be able to grow jobs that pay well.

The old railway station at Bukit Timah is now a conserved building and the main station at Tanjong Pagar has been preserved as a National Monument.

For instance, we have allowed for more flexibility in funding organisations that have a good track record and are able to provide substantive proposals with clear action plans. Similarly, we have started to fund longer-term programmes to help sustain their momentum and deepen the relationships between locals and new immigrants. One such example is the Singapore Healthcare Immersion Programme (SHIP) to help foreign Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) adapt to their life and work in Singapore.",8,635,2012-09-11-T-023-S-00635
