2017-07-03-T-001,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Madam, the petitioners alleged that the Sungei Road Market, being the only living remnant of the grassroots tradition of free hawking in Singapore, is an invaluable and irreplaceable element of the organic intangible heritage and communal identity of our country. It is also the indispensable means of livelihood of the many dozens of elderly vendors who have few or no practicable alternatives; yet are supporting themselves and contributing to our community and shared social fabric.",3,4,2017-07-03-T-001-S-00004
2017-07-03-T-001,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"In light of this, the petitioners ask this House to designate an alternative site to which Sungei Road may be relocated.",4,5,2017-07-03-T-001-S-00005

2017-07-03-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"asked	 the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry plans to align measures to manage indiscriminate parking and use of bicycles owned by bike-sharing companies across agencies so that there is a consistent framework that can be implemented in areas managed by HDB, URA and Town Councils; and (b) what are some of the concerns and feedback from the public and operators for some of the measures being considered.",1,11,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00011
2017-07-03-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"asked	 the Minister for Transport (a) what is the policy of the Government on regulating dockless bicycle-sharing schemes; (b) since January 2017, what is the number of complaints received on the improper usage of dockless bicycles including indiscriminate parking and vandalism; and (c) what is the number of dockless bicycles confiscated by the authorities and, of which, how many have been returned to the bicycle sharing firms.",1,12,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00012
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 1 to 2 together?",1,13,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00013
2017-07-03-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,14,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00014
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,LTA has been coordinating with fellow Government agencies and Town Councils to align the approach against indiscriminate parking of shared bicycles. There are three elements in our approach.,1,15,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00015
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"First, ensure an adequate supply of parking spaces. LTA is working with NParks, HDB and Town Councils to increase bicycle parking capacity within their premises. On LTA's part, it has implemented 34 bicycle parking zones, which can accommodate 1,400 bicycles, at MRT stations. These are quicker to implement than bicycle racks and LTA will be providing more, including near bus stops. At the same time, LTA will continue with its on-going plans to add 6,000 more bicycle lots at various MRT stations, and another 500 lots in the city area by 2019.",2,16,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00016
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Second, ensure the cooperation of the bicycle-sharing companies. LTA requires them to promptly remove the bicycles which are indiscriminately parked. It is in their interest to cooperate with the authorities. Any public backlash may make the business model unsustainable.",3,17,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00017
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Third, strict enforcement against errant behaviour. If the indiscriminately parked bicycles are not removed within half a day, LTA will impound them, levy a fee on the bicycle-sharing companies for the resources used for the impounding, and fine the companies. LTA has received about 70 complaints of indiscriminate parking since the beginning of this year. This does not include the many comments on forums and social media. LTA has served around 1,000 notices for indiscriminately parked bicycles, of which 200 bicycles have been impounded, and about half of the impounded bicycles have been collected by the companies.",4,18,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00018
2017-07-03-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Can I check with the Senior Minister of State, in total, right now, how many dockless bicycles do we have in the market, and whether the three companies are in discussion with LTA to expand the number of bicycles rapidly, and whether any of the three companies have started to implement the geo-fencing scheme and the scheme to encourage people to park properly and also have some system to penalise the users who park improperly?",1,19,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00019
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Mr Ang for the supplementary questions. At this point in time, there are a total of about 29,000 to 30,000 shared bicycles available in the market. LTA is engaging the bike-sharing operators to deploy their fleet in a responsible manner to prevent excessive, indiscriminate parking as well as disamenities to the public.",1,20,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00020
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As to the Member's last question on geo-fencing, LTA is also working with the various bike-sharing companies to look into some of these innovative and technological solutions so that the prevalence of indiscriminate parking will also be minimised.",2,21,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00021
2017-07-03-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I have two supplementary questions. One would be the number of lots you have or have planned to put in place, are they sufficient? I look at the plan and it is for 2019. The issues that are faced by my residents and many others in Singapore show that the bikes are indiscriminately parked if there are no parking spaces allocated for them. The regulatory framework today has to take into account that there is not enough parking spaces and that you need to enforce this a lot more stringently.",1,22,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00022
2017-07-03-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),The second question relates to my Parliamentary Question (PQ) on the level of enforcement. LTA has the enforcement authority but I think most of the other agencies have not implemented this. Are there plans to make this more consistent across all agencies?,2,23,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00023
2017-07-03-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I can give some data points. My Community Club (CC), which is managed by People's Association, for example, has 65 of these illegally parked. We have called the operators and they have not collected any of the bikes. They may not be interested in collecting them because the bikes may already have been paid for by deposits. To a certain sense, there is the business model issue, and there may not be interest for them to also collect the bikes. So, the level of enforcement may not be sufficient. Are there other plans to make enforcement more consistent across all agencies, not just LTA?",3,24,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00024
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Zaqy for the supplementary questions. The Member is right and I agree with his suggestion that we need to have a Whole-of-Government approach. Currently, we have about 130,700 racked and dockless bicycle-parking spaces. LTA will work with Government agencies, including Town Councils, to allow shared bicycles to be parked in all public bicycle parking areas. We are looking into increasing the number of parking places as well.",1,25,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00025
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,LTA will also coordinate and strengthen enforcement approaches across these various agencies against indiscriminate bicycle parking.,2,26,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00026
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Last but not least, as part of the Whole-of-Government approach, LTA will work with all agencies to harmonise the active mobility infrastructure to make it more convenient and seamless for users.",3,27,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00027
2017-07-03-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"I have two more supplementary questions. Are there any more new entrants into the bike-sharing market that have approached LTA recently? Jurong Town Council has increased the number of yellow boxes for shared bicycles to park but we still face discriminate parking. Will MOT consider imposing a rule for the three companies to implement policies to encourage proper parking first, before LTA allows them to expand at such a great speed?",1,28,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00028
2017-07-03-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mdm Speaker, there are currently no new entrants of bike-sharing operators. We do foresee that there may be a potential for new entrants in the future. We are also working with the bike-sharing operators to encourage them to come up with some form of incentive and penalty system so that they can modify or mould the behaviour of users, so that indiscriminate parking will be discouraged, just as the Member had mentioned in his TC.",1,29,2017-07-03-T-002-S-00029
2017-07-03-T-003,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,"asked 	 the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Government will prosecute hirers of rental bicycles who damage, dismantle or dispose of bicycles illegally or convert them for their own use.",1,30,2017-07-03-T-003-S-00030
2017-07-03-T-003,Amrin Amin,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Police will conduct an investigation if a case is reported and a criminal offence is committed. Based on the facts of the case, the Police will consult the Attorney-General's Chambers, who will decide whether to prosecute the persons involved, whether the offender is a hirer or not.",1,31,2017-07-03-T-003-S-00031
2017-07-03-T-003,Amrin Amin,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"This approach is no different from how we deal with other offences. For example, last month, Police investigated two cases at Jalan Tenteram and Upper Boon Keng, where rental bicycles were thrown from buildings. The person arrested for the Upper Boon Keng case was charged in Court and he was convicted of a rash act and sentenced to nine weeks jail. For the Jalan Tenteram case, arrest was also made and investigations are on-going.",2,32,2017-07-03-T-003-S-00032
2017-07-03-T-003,Amrin Amin,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"However, prosecution by itself will not eliminate the problem of misuse or abuse of the rental bicycles. The bicycle rental companies and the hirers have to take responsibility to ensure the appropriate use of the rental bicycles.",3,33,2017-07-03-T-003-S-00033
2017-07-03-T-003,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, there were several reports in the newspapers about bicycles having been dismantled, having had their GPS devices removed, and some are thrown into the river and so on. Surely, the Police ought to take punitive action. If we do nothing, then it may be seen that we are tolerating, we are accepting behaviour that totally disregards the rights of owners of bicycles. If we allow such behaviour to continue, then, today, it may be those bike-sharing companies; tomorrow, it will be some other illegal activity.",1,34,2017-07-03-T-003-S-00034
2017-07-03-T-003,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether the Police would take a more stringent approach against culprits who abuse shared bicycles, who remove and dismantle them or who basically convert the shared bicycles to their own use and leave these bicycles at home. To me, this is theft, this is conversion.",2,35,2017-07-03-T-003-S-00035
2017-07-03-T-003,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"I thank the Member for raising the issue. It is an issue that we take seriously and we will work closely with MOT to conduct enforcement action. Where necessary, we will take punitive action to deter such acts.",1,36,2017-07-03-T-003-S-00036
2017-07-03-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked	 the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Government will reconsider its decision not to provide a replacement site for the Sungei Road Hawking Zone (SRHZ); and (b) whether an update can be provided on the help given to the vendors and whether any additional help will be given to vendors after the closure of the SRHZ.,1,37,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00037
2017-07-03-T-004,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun,"asked	 the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources after the closure of the Sungei Road flea market, how will the Ministry engage and monitor the mental health of the elderly vendors who are displaced after losing their stalls and livelihood.",1,38,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00038
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"With your permission, Mdm Speaker, may I take Question Nos 4 and 5 together?",1,39,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00039
2017-07-03-T-004,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,40,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00040
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Thank you. Street hawking, or the peddling of goods on the streets, was common in Singapore several decades ago. If you look at old photos of street hawking, you can see the poor hygiene conditions, the pollution of waterways, the piles of waste that attracted pests, the potential fire hazards and the obstruction to traffic that resulted in disamenities to the residents at such localities. The Government thus undertook to relocate the street hawkers to purpose-built hawker centres and markets. Many street hawkers had made the transition well, making use of the sheltered facilities to sell their goods and going on to expand their offerings.",1,41,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00041
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"However, not all the street hawkers were resettled and 31 rag-and-bone men were given permits to continue their trade at the Sungei Road site in view of their chosen trade. In 2000, when their permits expired, the site was designated as the Sungei Road Hawking Zone (SRHZ). Only 11 of the 31 original permit holders still remain today.",2,42,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00042
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Through the years, many others have taken the opportunity to peddle their goods for free at the SRHZ. However, the activities of the SRHZ have resulted in disamenities such as the obstruction of roads and the storage of goods in surrounding areas including the nearby drains and housing estate, posing risks to public health and incurring additional public resources for the upkeep of the public areas.",3,43,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00043
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Despite this, we have continued to allow the SRHZ to remain in operation for as long as we could, even though the area has been zoned for residential use. In fact, when the Jalan Besar MRT station was being constructed in 2011, instead of removing the whole SRHZ, the size of the SRHZ was reduced as required, so that the SRHZ could continue to stay open.",4,44,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00044
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We understand that the SRHZ holds memories for some Singaporeans. The National Heritage Board (NHB), therefore, conducted research and documentation to preserve the memories of the site for future generations. A virtual tour of the site as well as other resources are available on the NHB's heritage portal, ""roots.sg"". Singaporeans have also contributed their personal stories, photographs and videos on social media.",5,45,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00045
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Since 2012, we have informed the Association for the Recycling of Second Hand Goods that notice would be given to the users of the SRHZ to cease their operations once the development plans for the Sungei Road area are confirmed. This was also mentioned to this House in 2012. Now that the site where the SRHZ is located is required by the Ministry of National Development (MND) for ground preparation works to facilitate future public housing development, the last day of operations of the SRHZ will be 10 July 2017.",6,46,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00046
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We note that there are calls, including a Petition presented earlier by the Member, Mr Kok Heng Leun, for the SRHZ to be relocated. Indeed, SRHZ users who wish to continue their trade can do so at appropriate venues such as hawker centres, where there are better facilities and necessary amenities for users to conduct their businesses, or at existing flea markets, where these activities can be properly managed. This is similar to how street hawkers in the past have moved on to purpose-built hawker centres and markets.",7,47,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00047
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Users may also take advantage of the opportunities that these new business locations present. For example, Mdm Tan Guo Mei, who was featured in the news recently, took the opportunity when she moved to a lock-up stall at a hawker centre to expand her offerings to include new goods which she can sell at all times and not be exposed to the weather elements. Other SRHZ users who have taken up such stalls have also indicated that they intend to move on to also sell new items such as shoes and accessories, beyond the second-hand items that they used to sell.",8,48,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00048
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The National Environment Agency (NEA) has set aside more than 40 lock-up stalls at hawker centres for those SRHZ users who wish to carry on their trade. To assist them in their transition, we have offered the 11 original permit holders a 100% rental rebate for the first year and a 50% rental rebate for the second year. For all other users, we have offered a 50% rental rebate for the first two years on a goodwill basis, provided they live in public housing and do not own more than one property. So far, 29 SRHZ users have been allocated a lock-up stall. Many of these stalls are clustered at two popular hawker centres not too far from the SRHZ − the Chinatown Market and the Golden Mile Food Centre.",9,49,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00049
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The Hawkers' Associations at these two centres have in fact, invited the SRHZ users who have taken up stalls there to join them, which is an important step to help the users integrate into the local hawker centre community. To further assist these SRHZ users in their transition to the new business environment, the NEA will facilitate training for those interested in getting tips on merchandising and display of their items for sale. The NEA has also put out information on their new business locations so that the SRHZ users' clientele and those who wish to buy second-hand goods can go to these locations after the SRHZ closes.",10,50,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00050
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Today, the sale of second hand goods in Singapore is not limited to the SRHZ. Nor does it have to be done solely at hawker centres. For example, in some existing flea markets such as at that at Kreta Ayer, which have been in existence for some 15 years, there have always been vendors who sell second hand goods items.",11,51,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00051
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We also recognise that some of the users would prefer not to operate daily and wish to sell their goods at flea markets instead of operating a lock-up stall. To this end, the NEA has worked with the People's Association (PA) and the Central Singapore Community Development Council (CDC) to assist the SRHZ users to tap on existing flea markets. So far, 16 SRHZ users have applied for stalls at the flea markets at various locations, including those near their homes. A majority of those who have chosen to continue their trade at flea markets have, in fact, moved to the Kreta Ayer flea market which is located between Block 4 Sago Lane and Chinatown Complex.",12,52,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00052
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I note that there have also been calls for the Government to engage the users of the SRHZ deeply. I would like to take this opportunity to share that we have indeed been doing so. Over the past few months, the NEA has been working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), the Workforce Singapore (WSG) and Central Singapore CDC to proactively engage the SRHZ users on-site, as well as off-site, to offer various forms of assistance after the closure of the site.",13,53,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00053
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Besides assistance with getting stalls at hawker centres and flea markets, the WSG has been providing job placement assistance to the SRHZ users who wish to seek employment. The MSF and the Central Singapore CDC have also been actively helping those who require financial assistance to get financial help through the ComCare scheme and other schemes. So far, 18 out of the 23 individuals who applied for financial assistance are assessed to be eligible and have received financial assistance. For example, one of them is a 61-year-old man who is receiving assistance while he makes the transition to his new job as a cleaner at a Primary school.",14,54,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00054
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"All in, the agencies have engaged about 200 users of the SRHZ, most of whom are between the ages of 40 and 65. All SRHZ users who are in need of help and have come forward are being assisted. More than 60 of them are now receiving some form of Government assistance including those who have been allocated stalls. Another 70 or so had earlier indicated interest to receive assistance. However, they have not yet come forward to apply as many of them have indicated that they will decide on their future plans only after the closure of the SRHZ.",15,55,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00055
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"More than 80 SRHZ users, however, have told us that they do not require any assistance after the closure of the SRHZ. This is because they are able to support themselves, or their families can support them, or they have full-time jobs elsewhere. Some have shared that they have been plying their trade at the SRHZ as a hobby occasionally on the weekends and will discontinue doing so once the SRHZ closes.",16,56,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00056
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Besides the assistance given by the government agencies, many Grassroots Advisers and community leaders have also been visiting the SRHZ users residing in their constituencies on a one-on-one basis in their homes to see if they require further community assistance. Those in need have been offered community support such as job referrals and financial help to tide them over the transition period. Others have also been encouraged to join the health and wellness programmes organised by their Residents' Committee (RC) as a good way to stay active after the closure of the SRHZ.",17,57,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00057
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We would like to thank all who have given their views and suggestions in support of the SRHZ users. I would like to assure Members of the House that my Ministry will continue to work with the relevant agencies to engage and support the SRHZ users through their transition, and ensure that necessary help is rendered to them even after the closure of the SRHZ. We would also like to encourage the community to continue to support the SRHZ users, for example, by patronising their stalls in hawker centres and flea markets.",18,58,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00058
2017-07-03-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have two supplementary questions. First, how can we help those who have expressed concern that there had been a decline in earnings after moving to hawker centres and flea markets? Is there any further help in their set-up cost or further rebate? Question two is, is the Government following up on the SRHZ users who have not come forward for assistance and say they will wait until their SRHZ closes.",1,59,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00059
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I would like to thank the Member for her supplementary questions. Regarding the first question, about how we can ensure that they succeed in the lock-up stalls in the hawker centres or markets or in the flea markets, as I have said earlier, we understand that in any change of business, for instance, business locations, a transition is required and it is not unexpected that business could be slow in the beginning. So, to ease them into the transition, we have provided, as I have said, rental rebates as well as offer short training courses that will provide them with tips on merchandising, display and so on at the shops, as well as, of course, now we have put up information at the SRHZ itself to tell the customers there where some of these stalls or these users have relocated to. We are also working with them to come up with flyers that they can distribute to let their customers know where they are.",1,60,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00060
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In addition, I understand that there is also help for instance, from Central CDC, from Mayor Denis Phua and her team − transitional assistance to help them at the flea market and also at the stalls, and various schemes. And I know also, as I have said, that the Hawkers' Association at Chinatown as well as at Golden Mile have actually welcomed the SRHZ users who are going to set up stalls there and even offered them membership into the Hawkers' Association so that they can integrate into the community.",2,61,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00061

If they require flea market stalls and so on, we will help them to apply. If they require other assistance, for instance, if they decide to change trade to look for a job, we will also work with the agencies to help them with that.",3,62,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00062

2017-07-03-T-004,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"I think it is important to know that what happened here in Sungei Road is that it is a place-making that is very, very genuine and real. By removing it, we are actually taking away that place-making possibility. If there is something that is already ground-up and alive, why take it away? Why not have a relocation, put them there, and at the same time, manage the disamenities which I think is something that we can do?",2,65,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00065
2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I would like to thank the Member for his supplementary question.

2017-07-03-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"SRHZ used to be a place where you could find very unique antiques, knick-knacks and so on, but I think over time, the nature of the site has changed, both in terms of the profile of the users of the site, as well as the buyers and the type of goods sold. In fact, if you go to the SHRZ now, the most common type of goods sold there, not necessarily second hand goods, but second hand goods, are such as clothes, watches, hand-phone covers, cables, as well as shoes − goods that are not unique to or only sold at the SRHZ. In fact, you can find them in neighbourhood shops too. Indeed, the sale of second hand goods is not limited to the SRHZ. There are already existing avenues where such goods are sold, say, in the existing flea markets, which are also ground-up initiatives from the community mostly, and also online.",2,67,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00067

In fact, by offering them, say, lock-up stalls, it is a more sustainable permanent solution, and they can actually use it to expand their offerings beyond what they are selling currently.",3,68,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00068

2017-07-03-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"It has been said that the users are elderly and dependent on the business at the SRHZ for a living. Some also said that it is good for the elderly to be active, to push the carts in the elements and set up stalls elsewhere. I wonder  what is the Government's specific response to these needs, especially for the elderly? And also, how many users has the Ministry found, who are actually dependent on the zone for a livelihood?",2,71,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00071
2017-07-03-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The second question is  I would like to ask if the Ministry has analysed the reasons − what my colleague Er Dr Lee has mentioned − and identified further solutions on how to address the grouses of the poorer business by the current users who have moved or are going to move to lock-up stalls that are provided by NEA. And by giving such priority, are there also objections to these priorities given? Can other community groups at the grassroots level also be engaged to help resolve these issues?",3,72,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00072
2017-07-03-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The third question is  what is the Government's specific response to some of the requests of the users and supporters for relocations to several suggested replacement sites in the cities, or other preferred sites for free or very low rent with provision for storage space and shelter, and what is the Government's response if there are also other similar needs?",4,73,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00073

With regard to the first question on how many users rely on the SRHZ for their livelihoods, based on our engagement with these users on the ground as well as how the health of the SRHZ users would be affected with the closure of the SRHZ, let me say that − as I have replied in my response earlier − we have engaged more than 200 SRHZ users. Just by way of comparison, during the weekends, which is the peak of the SRHZ when most of the users will be there to ply their trade and sell their goods, there are usually about 200 SRHZ users. So, I think our engagement has been quite comprehensive.",1,74,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00074

They have given various reasons. Some say they can support themselves. Some say their family can support them. For others, they have full-time jobs. They go to SRHZ to ply their goods perhaps on the weekends. For some, they say they ply their goods as a hobby and they have decided to stop after the closure of SRHZ, although if they wish to, they can actually continue at the flea markets.",2,75,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00075

Some have been allocated lock-up stalls. As I have said, 29 have been allocated lock-up stalls, including Mr Tang Kong Yuen who is the Vice President of the Association for the Recycling of the Second Hand Goods, and 11 of them have already started operating their lock-up stalls. Sixteen have been given flea market stalls, and some have already started operating. These users have the entrepreneurial spirit; they have embraced change and decided to move on and have in fact started operating their stalls. We should encourage and help them. Members of the community who are concerned could also help them, for instance, by patronising their stalls.",3,76,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00076

We will continue to see how we can assist them after the closure. I think that the users of SRHZ do not need to ply their trade in order to stay healthy. In fact, pushing the cart and so on may actually be detrimental to their health if they do not do it properly.

In fact, we have allowed the SRHZ to continue for as long as possible, but now that it is needed for redevelopment and we have to close it, plus the nature of the site has changed over the years and given that the sale of such goods is not just limited to SRHZ, we have helped them to relocate to other areas, like hawker centres as well as flea markets.",8,81,2017-07-03-T-004-S-00081

If MOE does not take any action now, several of our JCs would find themselves with JC1 intake of below 400, less than half of the typical 800. Some would even struggle to fill 200 places.

One was to retain schools even when enrolment has fallen very low, and bring together students from various schools and run programmes at the cluster or regional level. However, we decided against it as staff and students will face operational challenges such as timetabling constraints, and travelling between different schools for activities would add to their commute time.

These are two separate issues. We are merging schools to ensure a good range of programmes for our students in schools that would otherwise face low enrolment. MOE takes a needs-based resourcing approach for teacher resourcing, targeting additional support at students with greater learning needs by reducing class sizes in a selective manner, so as to improve our educational outcomes across different schools and student profiles. We have been able to do this due to our steadily improving teacher-to-student ratios, which are now comparable to that of OECD countries. We believe that this approach in reducing class size is more targeted and sustainable, and can be applied across all schools based on needs, rather than just the schools with low enrolment.",9,109,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00109

Our engagements are focused on the post-announcement phase, targeting key areas of concerns for staff and students, such as support during the transition and preservation of their school heritage. I would like to assure Mr Dennis Tan that we work closely with our key stakeholders for the mergers and will continue to do so with the affected schools to ease the transition for all staff, students and parents.",12,112,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00112
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"I understand that some parents and students are concerned that fewer JCs would mean stiffer competition for places. Let me give a categorical assurance that all JC-eligible students, that is, those with a score of 20 points or below, who opt for the JC pathway will be able to enrol in one of the JCs. For 2018, we plan to increase the JC1 student intake for the remaining JCs and we have sufficient capacity in our JCs to ensure that no JC-eligible student would be denied a place.",13,113,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00113
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"A related question is how the eventual JC cut-off points for the 2018 Joint Admission Exercise would change with the JC mergers. MOE does not pre-determine JC cut-off points. They vary from year to year depending on students' choices. We do not know how students' choices may change with the announcement of JC mergers. For this reason, I am unable to give specific answers to Mr Zaqy Mohamad's nor Mr Leon Perera's questions as to whether we will see higher aggregate scores for JC admissions or specific percentages following the mergers. With the change in the 2018 JC landscape, variations in cut-off points may be slightly more than in previous years. Most importantly, a student who qualifies for JC and chooses to go, will have a JC place. Our educators, as well as Education and Career Guidance Counsellors, will continue to guide our students in selecting their post-Secondary pathways based on their strengths, aspirations and interests.",14,114,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00114

2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"MOE had decided to set up various new schools in 2010, namely Crest, Spectra, as well as EJC, as part of our efforts to provide more options in our education landscape, and better meet our students' diverse aspirations and educational needs. This was even though we were aware of the falling cohort sizes in the coming years. Crest and Spectra were specially established to offer a special Normal (Technical) curriculum to cater to Secondary school students who are more suited for the applied learning track.",16,116,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00116
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"In the same vein, we set up the new EJC to cater to students who would benefit from the Integrated Programme (IP) pathway at three Secondary schools − Catholic High, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' and Singapore Chinese Girls'. We started the new IP pathway in 2004, with the intention that this would, over time, admit up to 10% of the PSLE cohort, and the IP pathway has been valued by students. The extension of the IP to these three schools and the announcement of EJC in 2010 was part of this planned IP expansion.",17,117,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00117
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The suitability of a JC to partner its feeder Secondary schools to offer the IP is an important consideration to ensure that the programme offered will be meaningful for the students. At that time, there was no suitable JC to partner these three Secondary schools. EJC was thus set up to leverage the strengths of the partner Secondary schools and to add diversity to the JC landscape.",18,118,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00118
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Like Mr Desmond Choo, MOE recognises that school mergers are unsettling for school staff. In the case of teachers, this sometimes involves re-deployment to another level, for example, from Secondary school to Primary school, or JC to Secondary or Primary school. There are also areas of needs in MOE HQ, such as developing resources for ICT learning for our students and other vacancies in MOE HQ where teachers could contribute.",19,119,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00119

We work closely with school leaders and support them in engaging affected staff. For all school mergers, we have assured our MOE staff that they will not be retrenched. Staff are engaged on the deployment plans and manpower needs for the merged schools. They are also informed of the re-deployment plans and support available to them. Many of these conversations take place on a one-to-one basis. Thereafter, staff are given time to explore options they are interested in through our internal posting exercise.

The training includes bridging courses to equip them with the necessary pedagogical skills and content knowledge to teach at the redeployed level. Apart from deepening their understanding of the different learning profiles of the students they will teach, these bridging courses will also help teachers understand their students' different social and emotional needs, and how they can foster strong teacher-student rapport to help them better support these students in their learning. These teachers will also have the opportunity to be attached to their new schools before their formal postings begin.

2017-07-03-T-007,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Firstly, it is on the plight of the workers. I am glad to hear that none of the teaching and non-teaching staff would be made redundant and retrenched. However, as we know, because of such rationalisation, there will be transfers of teachers, including non-teaching staff, for example, the administrative staff. I say this because I speak on behalf of the four teachers' unions as well as our public sector unions. There is general concern how they will be helped because different schools have different cultures, geographically as well as whether they are Primary and Secondary schools, or JCs. It is very different in the way they do things, whether it is IP schools, non-IP schools or other schools. That is one.",2,125,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00125
2017-07-03-T-007,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Secondly, I urge the Ministry − although I know it is a sensitive process − to engage and inform the unions, in the spirit of good labour-management relationship, in advance, so that we can prepare beforehand, in case any of these grievances do come to us.",3,126,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00126
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, I agree with the Member that the transfers of staff, whether it is teaching or non-teaching staff, will, indeed, be associated with anxiety, and MOE will do as much as we can to ensure that these transfers are smooth. This is a combination of finding appropriate postings on the basis of skills as well as needs, and we do take into account the compatibility of the culture and socio-emotional aspects. We also provide pedagogical support, additional courses and training for staff who may be doing something that they are not familiar with, especially if they have been used to teaching a particular subject or level for many number of years. They will need professional training and assistance to make the transition work.",1,127,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00127
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The Member's point about engaging the union is an apt and appropriate one. As I have explained, the announcement of the specific merger pairs was not something that we could test the waters with extensively before a decision was made. So, I hope the Member appreciates that we made the announcements and began engagements as soon as we were able to, with some confidence that there was clarity over the decisions that we were going to go forward with. But the larger point that we do have to make sure that we work well with the teachers' unions and have good labour relations in this aspect is very important. I do agree with the Member.",2,128,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00128

2017-07-03-T-007,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The first question is, if geographical location is one of the criterion that was taken into account, did the Ministry consider that in closing Serangoon Junior College, potential students residing in the northeast areas like Sengkang, Punggol and Hougang, would be affected, that is, they would have to travel further to a college that is further away?",2,130,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00130
2017-07-03-T-007,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second supplementary question  there is some talk that only the Government-funded, non-IP, non-Mission, non-affiliated JCs are being merged. If we look at the list of schools to be closed, that hypothesis does not seem entirely baseless. What is the Senior Minister of State's comment on what I would say is a popular view that is being taken?",3,131,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00131
2017-07-03-T-007,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The third supplementary question  if low enrolment is a criterion, last year's Straits Times reported about the growing popularity of a few Junior Colleges, namely, Meridian JC, Nanyang JC and Serangoon JC. Was this taken into account for this particular criterion of low enrolment? Does the Ministry not agree that by choosing to close down these schools, they would, to some extent, have undone some of the hard work that the principals and staff had put in?",4,132,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00132
2017-07-03-T-007,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Finally, the Senior Minister of State also mentioned about consultation. Could I just ask who were the stakeholders from the affected Junior Colleges who were consulted? How long ago was this consultation? How long did the consultation take place?",5,133,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00133
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, I thank the Member for the four questions. With respect to the first and the third questions, the geographical considerations and enrolment were taken into account but no single factor was overwhelming. So, for both dimensions − the enrolment as well as the geographical location − we can find examples where it is not ideal. There is no nice or ideal solution to this. It is painful to close a school, merge a school or relocate a school. There is anxiety when staff have to change jobs, to do something that they have not been doing, to move from one place of work to another. There is no easy answer to this. But we did try as far as possible to ensure that the merged pairs result in a good geographical spread of JC places across the nation.",1,134,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00134
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Yes, there would be some students who will end up having a slightly longer commute. It is not the only factor, but geographical considerations were taken into account.",2,135,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00135
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Low enrolment was taken into account. The point the Member made was that we were undoing the work of the staff to build up a JC. I think whether you are a low-enrolment school or a high-enrolment school, you would feel that your work has been undone. This is a very understandable concern. It is not about whether it is a low-enrolment school or a high-enrolment school. That anxiety is going to be there. So, we are trying as hard as possible to preserve the ethos and values of these schools when we merge them, through the preservation of their niche programmes, CCAs, engagements with the renaming, the history and the heritage.",3,136,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00136
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Ultimately, that work and the values and the effort rest in the professionals who are involved. The key part of a school is the teachers, staff and the ethos and the values they bring. They are staying within our system; we are not losing them. As we merge these schools, these professionals who are part of our education landscape, the key part of our education landscape, the work that they have done in developing their profession and developing their schools, will be preserved within our system because they are all being retained within our system, or have the opportunity to be retained within our system.",4,137,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00137

2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"As for the issue of the Government non-IP schools, I think I addressed that in my response initially that it is correct that the mergers involve the Government non-IP JCs, and there are a couple of reasons. I am just trying to find the paragraph, so I can refer the Member to it − one is the issue of governance. If you have a Government-aided school versus a Government school, the governance framework is different. If you are trying to merge two schools with two very different governance frameworks, there are additional challenges − not impossible but it adds an added layer of complexity and difficulty that we felt was not needed at this point in time, that we could do it without having to engage in an even more difficult exercise.",6,139,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00139
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, I had addressed that. Was that an additional point about that that the Member had? I mean, we do acknowledge that it is so, and I hope I have explained why it is so.",7,140,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00140
2017-07-03-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the explanation. Two supplementary questions. Is there a concern by the Ministry that there will be a further decline in the number of JC places, in the sense they are talking about future graduate workforce in Singapore.",1,141,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00141
2017-07-03-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The second question would be, would you say that the JC experience, in terms of infrastructure and environment, has not really changed compared to, say, competition, such as Polytechnic places where today, there is a lot more vibrancy in terms of marketing and the variety of courses being made available. If you go to JCs, for example, many of the students I spoke to and asked, ""Why did you choose Polytechnics over JCs?"", for example, they would say, ""You go to JC, you see classrooms and classrooms and not much more, whereas you go to the Polytechnic, you will see labs, very interesting things"". So, the experience also matters in terms of the erosion of JC places. Would the Ministry be reviewing that because there is value to a JC education? Would not having change this environment and experience result in further erosion of students taking the JC pathway, given that you also have more competition for students today, with regard to whether it is IB or Integrated Programme or Polytechnics.",2,142,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00142
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"I thank the Member. To the first question, our anticipation is that the proportion of a given cohort that will apply for the JC pathway and then seek a graduate education is likely to be the same. In absolute numbers, it may change but in terms of proportions, the pathways are there. We anticipate that, likely, the proportions will remain about the same, going forward. It is hard to say, but that is our anticipation of the future.",1,143,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00143
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The Member brought up a very important point about the methodology of teaching in the JCs, if I understand that correctly, that perhaps, there are aspects of the curricular experience or the student experience in our JCs which is different from what someone might experience at the Polytechnics. But that is a good thing. We have increasing diversity in the post-Secondary education landscape.",2,144,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00144
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"For a student to be offered more choice where the choice is not merely about the certification pathway or the accreditation pathway, or the academic process that they are going through, but the holistic student experience they may have, is a good thing. If there is an opportunity for the JCs to think about how they can improve their provision of a student experience because of competition for the students to go to alternative pathways, that can also only be a good thing to improve our education landscape.",3,145,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00145
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"I do not think the changes in enrolment numbers, the falling birth cohort and our need for mergers of institutions would change any of these. This is a natural outcome of the increasing diversity that we want to have and that we are developing within our education space.",4,146,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00146
2017-07-03-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I have one supplementary question. Why was it not possible for MOE to transfer staff and to provide resources to support the IP Programme to existing JCs, especially since the Ministry was aware of falling cohort sizes in 2010? This would have allowed the long heritage of some JCs, which are going to be closed shortly as announced this year, to continue to grow and thrive?",1,147,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00147
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"I thank the Member for the question. We explored a wide range of possibilities to deal with this problem. I cannot speak specifically of the processes in 2010 but, certainly, across time, we have explored a wide variety of possibilities of how we might deal with falling enrolment, whether we need to change the models of some of the JCs, go for smaller JCs, go for larger JCs, including some of the suggestions that the Member has made.",1,148,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00148
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"There was no singular reason why that was not done. It was the larger reason that, system wide, we wanted to preserve a number of outcomes. We wanted to have, in 2010, the three schools that we talked about to increase diversity in our landscape, and provide a receptacle for the IP Programme for the Secondary schools that I spoke about in my earlier response. And later on, as part of the programme, we want to ensure that geographical distribution and access to public transport, the changes where housing is going to be going forward, where population shifts are going are considered, so there is no single neat reason why one particular route was not taken. It was really an overall approach and judgement was made that this was perhaps the best way to go forward to try to deal with the problem, which is a painful problem.",2,149,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00149
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"One consideration is the pain and the distress the alumni feel. It is very real. It is not something to be trivialised or ignored, and it is not something that MOE was unaware of. But MOE has to balance that with how we can best serve the next generation. We cannot allow any single factor − whether it is the geographical distribution, the enrolment, the emotional distress of the alumni − we cannot allow any single factor to override completely what should be our prime concern, which is how to develop an education system that is going to best serve the next generation, looking forward to the future. There are unknowns but that is how we have to approach this problem. We acknowledge the problems and the distress that it has caused and we are trying our best to minimise them.",3,150,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00150
2017-07-03-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),I thank the Senior Minister of State for his detailed answers. I just have four supplementary questions.,1,151,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00151
2017-07-03-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, I think the Senior Minister of State has acknowledged the emotional cost that this has created. My question would be in terms of the longer term planning protocols and processes within MOE, are there any learnings that have been drawn for this? Clearly, falling birth rates would have been foreseeable a very long time ago because these are patterns that do not tend to fluctuate too much year by year. Nevertheless, capacity did increase over the last decade. So, have there been any lessons drawn about how we can improve the forward planning in terms of establishing new JCs, establishing more capacity for JC places?",2,152,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00152
2017-07-03-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Second question is in relation to JCs that cater to students who score 10 points and above, or students who score less well academically. It would appear that the number of JC choices available to such students would now be diminished and that would mean that there would be longer travel time for such students. For example, 14 to 16 pointers in the East would have fewer JC options, and students in the West with 10 to 12 points would have fewer options as well. I think the Senior Minister of State did acknowledge that in the context of discussing CCA clustering, increasing travel times does diminish the quality of the student experience. Would the Senior Minister of State acknowledge that this is in some sense penalising those students who opt for the JC path but perform less well academically, and what measures are going to be taken to manage that.",3,153,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00153
2017-07-03-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"My third question is, my understanding is that at the time when the JC mergers were announced, MOE was in the process of implementing a new curriculum in the Junior Colleges and this was the curriculum that MOE invested in, bringing teachers in to train the JC teachers on this new curriculum. There was a period when the teachers would have to review the curriculum, revise and test their teaching materials, get feedback from the teaching process, and so on. My question is just on the timing of the announcement. Would the timing not have been better if it had been either before or after the implementation of this new curriculum, which it is my understanding is currently in process?",4,154,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00154
2017-07-03-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Lastly, on the fate of administrative non-teaching staff and vendors in the JCs, I would like to ask about vendors such as canteen operators, shop operators, lab technicians and so on, what measures are being taken to assist them in the transition. Thank you.",5,155,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00155
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"If I could address the last question, we are looking at all staff, different groups of staff and different type of challenges. We are looking at all staff to ensure that they have opportunities.",1,156,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00156
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The third question is about the timing of the announcement, and the curriculum review and training of teachers. Yes, there were announcements of specifics for the JC curriculum review. But the reality is that curriculum review, pedagogical development and professional training is on-going all the time. There is always going to be tweaks to our system. There is always going to be new courses and new skills to be developed. There is never going to be a good time. There is never going to be the equivalent of a ""Now it is school holidays and we can clean the canteen"". In terms of our education system, this on-going professional review is constant. We will always find something happening and something going on. So, we had to make the choice for the timing of this in terms of how far ahead we had to plan for birth cohorts, at which point we were going to have an enrolment that was so low that a JC was not going to be able to run a viable programme with CCAs and performing arts and so forth, and the academic curricular. So, that is fundamentally what determines the timing, not anything else.",2,157,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00157
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"As for the cut-off points, and how it may affect the students who are, perhaps, not performing so well, this will vary over time. As schools merge and other schools see changes in capacity, the cut-off point required to get into a given JC may change. It depends on some degree of competitiveness amongst the student cohort and it depends on the choices that students make. There is no deliberate attempt to penalise anybody here. There is no deliberate attempt to put the burden of these school mergers on a particular segment of our population. What will happen over time is that the cut-off points and the choices that students make will change. And, really, there is no way to accurately plan or predict that except to say, on the whole, every JC-eligible student will have a place in the system. We are not denying that to anybody.",3,158,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00158
2017-07-03-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The first question that the Member brought up was about lessons that have been learnt. This is going to be a dynamic process. The changes in birth cohort, the changes in where population lives and what we do in our education system, will require a dynamic process. Between 2005 and 2012, we significantly rammed up JC places. We had packed classrooms because we had maximised the capacity, because that was when we had the peak student cohort sizes going through. We are not going to turn around and say that was the wrong thing to do at that time because now we are reducing places and merging schools. That was what we needed to do then and this is what we need to do now. We do have to take a dynamic approach.",4,159,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00159

We had some anticipation but we do also have some anticipation that things would change; we have a window, we know about the births that already happened, we do not know about births that have not happened yet. There is some uncertainty in this, just as there is uncertainty about the choices that students would make over the popularity of a new JC or a merged JC. There is some uncertainty about this. There are a number of factors to take into consideration. We try to minimise the down sides, we try to have a key principle about why we are doing this and how we want to go forward in order to serve the future students of the education system, to service the next generation.",5,160,2017-07-03-T-007-S-00160

2017-07-03-T-008,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Mdm Speaker, a small, open economy like Singapore's must adapt to the significant structural shifts in the external environment. Industries and jobs are changing due to changes in technology, demand patterns and supply conditions. In particular, digital technology is likely to trigger changes in many industries. These changes will bring new opportunities and new challenges. After extensive consultation, the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) has proposed a set of recommendations to guide our approach.",1,162,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00162

2017-07-03-T-008,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"At its core, the scope and focus of the Future Economy Council is on growing and transforming Singapore's economy for the benefit of our people. This will be done at three levels − first, growing an economy that is vibrant, open and connected to the world, supporting the growth of new and existing industries; second, strengthening our enterprises through industry-specific transformations to help them grow, innovate and scale-up; and third, enabling Singaporeans acquire and utilise deep skills, so as to seize opportunities in the future economy.",3,164,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00164
2017-07-03-T-008,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"All these will require close collaboration among the tripartite partners. The Government, industries, unions and individuals all have key parts to play. The Council therefore comprises representatives from the Government, private sector, unions, Institutes of Higher Learning and Trade Associations and Chambers. Besides the main Council, six tripartite FEC sub-committees, led by private and public sector co-chairs, are co-ordinating the efforts for six clusters of industries. At the industry level, we have Industry Tripartite Committees leading the work on the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs).",4,165,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00165

As part of the Construction ITM under the sub-committee, BCA brought together 400 industry stakeholders, including Institutes of Higher Learning and TACs such as the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) and the Singapore Institute of Building Ltd (SIBL), and identified 35 key technologies across seven clusters in the built environment for further R&D to unlock greater productivity gains. The work culminated in the Construction Productivity R&D Roadmap, which is being incorporated as part of the Construction ITM. This example illustrates how different stakeholders can come together, each bringing their unique strengths, to advance the construction industry.",5,166,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00166

We need to continuously anticipate and embrace these changes, and transform our economy for the future. At the same time, we know that we cannot predict the future with any certainty and therefore, we will not be able to anticipate every single change and trend. So, we must have the agility to make changes and adjustments along the way and ensure that we continue to be in right direction.",1,171,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00171

We will have to map and remap our paths along the journey.",2,172,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00172
2017-07-03-T-008,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"This is not something that the Council alone can do.

2017-07-03-T-008,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We need all stakeholders to come onboard this in order for us to be successful.

I hope that our entrepreneurs and businesses will continue to move fast, seize opportunities, make use of Government schemes and facilitation in your growth and internationalisation.",4,174,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00174

I am happy that there is a meeting of minds on the CFE.",5,175,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00175
2017-07-03-T-008,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On engagement, the short answer is yes, definitely. Engagement is a key and vital part of the current phase of our FEC work.

2017-07-03-T-008,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Secondly, I am really concerned about the possibility of a segment of the workforce being left behind.

2017-07-03-T-008,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Thirdly, addressing what I see is a development where, for example, in transport, that many of our PMETs are taking to becoming Uber and Grab drivers when the development in the future economy is really towards driverless vehicles. I would like to ask the Minister's opinion on that.",3,182,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00182
2017-07-03-T-008,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I thank Ms Denise Phua for her three very thoughtful questions. First, on whether the CFE would develop a new literacy curriculum for adults, the skill-sets which are needed for all of us as working adults will change and keep changing. That is why SkillsFuture is such an important part of this effort. As to whether there should be a new broad-based curriculum for everybody, that is something which we would have to study further. What we do know is that we do need to equip many of our people with greater skills in ICT. I mentioned that ICT is one sector for which many industries will be affected and transformed. We are hoping to use ICT to transform many of these industries and create better jobs for our people. There will be a lot of new skills that are needed, whether it should be something that applies generically across all sectors or whether it should be targeted at particular sectors is a subject that we are studying.",1,183,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00183
2017-07-03-T-008,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The second question on the concerns that elderly and low-skilled workers are being left behind, is something that is of great concern. I had several discussions with Minister Lim Swee Say on this matter as well as with Minister Ong Ye Kung and Minister Josephine Teo, on skills and specific segments of our workforce that we have to pay special attention to. Indeed, the elderly and the low-skilled is one area that we are working on. We have to think about not just the skills but the job re-design that is necessary. Again, this is something which the tripartite committee will have to look at. Every of the ITM will need to address some of these critical issues.",2,184,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00184
2017-07-03-T-008,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Similarly, the Member's third question on PMETs and how technology will change their jobs, we are fortunate that our educational standards and level, and the skills of our people have gone up over the years. We are in a better position today to adjust to these changes and we will perform. But at the same time, the pace of change has also accelerated. So, how do we ensure that all our workers, whether they are PMETs or non-PMETs, continue to have the skills to make changes.",3,185,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00185
2017-07-03-T-008,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Which are the sectors for which the change will be even more rapid? I would say that given the pace, the nature of technology, it is difficult to predict that there is one particular Area A or B that will be more at risk. But we will try and at the same time, we need the industries, we need the companies to work together with us to ensure that these changes are made smoothly.",4,186,2017-07-03-T-008-S-00186

There were already suggestions from the public on what to do with the house, including turning it into a museum and memorial.

But it was not possible to knock down the house immediately, anyway, because my sister, Wei Ling then said she intended to continue to stay in the house. And in his will, my father had expressed his wish that Wei Ling be allowed to stay there for as long as she wished. So, I said we should honour that, and that I would say in Parliament the next day that the Government would not make any decision, until such time as my sister was no longer staying there.",7,249,2017-07-03-T-010-S-00249

We should allow some time to pass, consider the ideas carefully, and make calm, considered decisions which will stand the test of time. We want to honour Mr Lee, but we must do so in the right way."" I stated that my father's position on 38 Oxley Road had been unwavering all these years, that he wanted the house knocked down, and that as a son I wanted to see my father's wishes carried out.

So, at the next Cabinet meeting, two days after the Parliament sitting, I recused myself from all discussions and decisions relating to the house, and placed Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean in charge. This was formally recorded in the Cabinet minutes. From that point on, I have been out of the loop whenever the Government handles matters concerning the house. I play no part in any of the discussions or decisions.

Soon after the Parliament sitting, I learned that my siblings were unhappy that I was getting the house. I was not sure why, but I thought the best way to resolve the matter was to transfer the house to them. I first offered to transfer the house to my sister for a nominal sum of $1, on condition that if the property is sold later or acquired by the Government, all proceeds or compensation would go to charity. Unfortunately, that deal fell through.",11,253,2017-07-03-T-010-S-00253

This time we reached agreement, this was December 2015. And we also agreed that my brother and I would each donate half the value of the house to charity. We both did so, and in addition I topped up another half myself. In other words, I myself gave away the full value of the house that I had inherited.

We all want our father's personal wish to be carried out, which is to knock the house down. I no longer have any interest in the house. My brother owns it.

The Committee will only list options for the house, so that when a decision does become necessary one day, perhaps decades from now, the Cabinet of the day, most likely by then under a different Prime Minister, will have these options available to consider.

In the same way, if any Minister discovers, in the course of his official work, that a family member is dealing improperly with some Government agency or seeking to take advantage of the Government, truly the Minister must take this up with the family member, and get him or her to stop. That is what the code of conduct is for. This is expected of anyone in a public position, especially me, as Prime Minister.",31,273,2017-07-03-T-010-S-00273

The Government has the responsibility to consider the public interest aspects of any property with historical and heritage significance, and has a range of powers to gazette or acquire such property. I should emphasise that Government not only has the legal powers to act, but indeed the responsibility to decide on what to do. Government cannot outsource decision-making on this. Ultimately, the Government of the day has to decide and carry the decision.",26,332,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00332

Currently, 72 buildings and structures are gazetted as national monuments, some of which were private residences. And we have conserved over 7,000 buildings. Many of these pre-date our Independence and hark back to our early immigrant and colonial era, such as Admiralty House, the House of Tan Yeok Nee and the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.",27,333,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00333

Indeed, as fewer such precincts or buildings remained, the value of each of them as a link to the past became more salient − old shophouses and warehouses, Peranakan houses, ""black and whites"", and Bukit Brown. With the passing years and fading memories, more Singaporeans too began to yearn to keep these gradually dwindling remaining physical links to our past − either for their architectural typology or the history they embody.",30,336,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00336

In other cases, owners applied for re-development but were directed to conserve the buildings for their historic or heritage value, often forgoing considerable financial gains they might have reaped from re-development. There is a due process for considering such matters and the decision is never taken lightly. The ultimate decision is made by Government. The Minister for National Development will elaborate on this later in his speech.",31,337,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00337

It was home to our founding Prime Minister. It was in its basement dining room that many important discussions and critical decisions on the future of Singapore were made by Mr Lee and our pioneer leaders. As Mr Lee and our pioneer generation of leaders − in fact, our pioneer generation − pass on, the historical significance of markers of this period has grown. 38 Oxley Road is a key marker of this turning point in our history. Since we do not need to decide now how best to maintain this important historical link to the past, it might be best for the time being, to avoid taking irreversible steps such as demolition and re-development of the site, so that we have the benefit of time to consider the matter, and the merits of various options with the perspective of history.",32,338,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00338

While Mr Lee expressed his personal wishes, he was also very proper. Mr Lee did not direct the Government. He was aware of the Government's responsibilities and how the law on this matter operates. Mr Lee wrote to Cabinet five months later, informing us that he had reflected on the matter.

2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The latter, redevelopment into private apartments, would not only result in the loss of a historically significant property, but also allow this very history to be exploited for private profit, for example, by marketing the residences as ""living at the former house of Mr Lee Kuan Yew"". I am certain many Singaporeans will have not approved of this. Indeed, Mr Lee Hsien Yang has also acknowledged this, and on 1 July 2017, has said that he has no ""inclination"" to do so.",36,381,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00381
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,The Committee has been studying various intermediate options such as demolishing the house but keeping the basement dining room with an appropriate heritage centre attached. The dining room was where many important historical meetings were held to discuss how a self-governing Singapore would take shape.,37,382,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00382
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,I personally think there are merits in these intermediate options which could provide a good solution. But these studies are on-going. Mr Lee Hsien Yang has in his public statements also indicated that he is open to some of these options.,38,383,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00383
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Lee Hsien Yang also acknowledges that no decision is needed now as Dr Lee Wei Ling continues to live in the property. This is also the position of the Government. In his statement on 1 July, he also said that he recognises that ""no man stands above the law"". As I have explained, the Government has a duty to go through due process for when a decision needs to be taken, at some future time. And so, we both acknowledge that.",39,384,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00384
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"So, there should really be no reason to disagree with what the Committee is doing. We told him what we were doing. He knows we exist. We are studying the possible options for the time when a decision has to be made.",40,385,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00385
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Third, what are our next steps? Mr Lee Hsien Yang now owns the property. As provided for in Mr Lee Kuan Yew's will, Dr Lee Wei Ling can stay in it for as long as she wishes. And we have said we will not do anything to affect Dr Lee's right to continue living there.",41,386,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00386
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"There is no decision required of this Government so long as Dr Lee stays there and the house is properly maintained, as provided for under the Building Control Act and the Planning Act. Even if the Government were to take a position today, it would not bind a future government at the time when that future government has to make a decision and implement it. We cannot take a prospective decision and say, ""30 years from now, the future government will do this."" Because the future government has the powers under the law to decide for itself.",42,387,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00387
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Mdm Speaker, the studies on the options for the house are continuing. While there is no urgency to complete these studies within a specified time frame − these are drawer plans which would be reviewed periodically − I will consult my colleagues to see if it is useful to put out a range of possibilities, to let the public ponder on the matter without having to arrive at any decision.",43,388,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00388
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Emotions on this issue are still very strong, not just within the family, but also among some Singaporeans. Emotions have sadly been heightened again by this public disagreement. A period of calm would be useful for reflection.",44,389,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00389
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"With the passage of time, I hope that we will be able to arrive at a wise decision on this matter in an informed and considered way that takes into account the significant public interest to preserve the heritage of our young nation, while respecting Mr Lee's personal wishes for the house.",45,390,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00390

2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"I explained that the Ministerial Committee was formed to examine (i) the historical and heritage significance of the property, (ii) the wishes of Mr Lee Kuan Yew in relation to the property, and (iii) the possible plans for the property and the neighbourhood, and the options to move forward. These are all matters which the Government has to take responsibility for, and has to plan for. This is just the normal process of government doing its work, in a calm, objective and proper way.",47,392,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00392
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"In the coming days, we will fully debate the specific allegations that have been made against the Government and examine whether there is any substance behind them.

2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,I urge Members to ask me and my Cabinet colleagues probing questions on any aspect of these allegations which you feel is relevant. Clear any doubts that you may have.,50,395,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00395
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"We must keep our public institutions neutral and not have allegations hurled at our public officers without basis.

2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"We make decisions and act in the public interest of Singaporeans. We do not bend to the private demands of individuals, no matter who they are, or what family connections they can claim. This is the foundation upon which Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team built our Singapore for all of us. Mr Lee would have expected no less from us. This is the Singapore that we want to continue living in. And this is the Singapore that Prime Minister Lee, our Cabinet colleagues and I, and all our public officers in our agencies will fight to uphold and take forward.",52,397,2017-07-03-T-011-S-00397
2017-07-03-T-011,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"We have many real challenges, and much to do.

2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Madam, I would like to speak on two matters in this debate. First, I would clarify the issue of the Deed of Gift between the executors of the estate of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the National Heritage Board (NHB), as I was then the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth. Second, I would elaborate on due processes for proposals on the conservation and preservation of properties.",1,401,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00401
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"First, let me touch on the Deed of Gift. From early 2015 onwards, NHB started planning for a major SG50 exhibition on 6 August 2015, just before the Jubilee Weekend. The exhibition was on Singapore's Founding Leaders. Following the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew in March 2015, NHB was also in discussion with executors of the estate about a donation of artefacts from 38 Oxley Road which could be incorporated into the exhibition.",2,402,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00402
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The Deed of Gift was not based on NHB's standard agreement. The executors of the estate, namely Mr Mee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling, insisted on several unusual conditions. These conditions included the right to buy back the items at $1, so long as the house was not demolished, and the display of the wishes of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew to demolish the house. As Members would have heard just now, the Deed of Gift required NHB to display only part of the demolition clause in Mr Lee's will. In other words, NHB was to display the first part, which sets out Mr Lee's wish to demolish the house, but not the second part, which sets out his wish should the house not be demolished. At that time, NHB did not pick up the significance of this partial quote from the demolition clause.",3,403,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00403
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Ms Lee Suet Fern, who was then the Director on the Board of NHB, was also involved in the discussions between NHB and the executors. She supported the conditions stipulated by the executors in the Deed and her law firm, Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC, helped in the process of finalising the Deed.",4,404,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00404
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The executors held firm to many of the terms they had stipulated in the Deed. For example, when NHB asked to amend the $1 buyback provision, the lawyer for the executors stated that this clause was non-negotiable. While the terms were unusual, NHB proceeded to sign the Deed with the executors because it recognised the heritage significance of the artefacts and felt that it would be in the public interest for them to be exhibited.",5,405,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00405
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"NHB also assessed that several of the objects were in a deteriorated condition and required immediate care and conservation. So, NHB signed the Deed with the executors on 8 June 2015. At around the same time, I updated the Prime Minister on the plans for the exhibition and the inclusion of the Oxley Road artefacts in the exhibition, including the conditions stipulated in the Deed. I later shared with him a copy of the Deed on 12 June.",6,406,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00406
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"As the Prime Minister shared earlier, he felt that the terms of the Deed were onerous to NHB and he told me that as a beneficiary of the estate, his consent for the donation had not been sought, the executors had not informed him of the donation nor the terms of the donation.",7,407,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00407
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"NHB was caught in a difficult position. It had signed the Deed and had accepted the gifts. But it was not clear if the executors were properly empowered to enter into the Deed without first consulting all beneficiaries. This also raises questions about the validity of the agreement. Moreover, the planned exhibition was just two months away and NHB did not have much time left to resolve the issues and then properly prepare for the exhibition.",8,408,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00408
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I discussed this with the then CEO of NHB Ms Rosa Daniel to see what could be done about the matter. Given the circumstances, we agreed that it would be better to take a pause and not rush the Oxley Road items for the August exhibition. We could exhibit them at a later stage, after the issues had been resolved. So, I asked Ms Daniel to inform Mr Lee Hsien Yang that we would like to put off the display of the Oxley Road artefacts from the August exhibition, and do so at some time in the future.",9,409,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00409
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Lee Hsien Yang responded on 10 June that this request was unacceptable and would be a breach of a legally-binding Deed. In fact, NHB had no intention to breach any legal obligation and Ms Daniel clarified this point in an email to Mr Lee Hsien Yang the next day. She said that the Minister's instructions are that NHB is not to breach its obligations if it has entered into valid agreements which are binding on it.",10,410,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00410
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"While the executors were insistent that NHB had to follow through on the exhibition, NHB still had the duty to check whether the Deed of Gift was in order in light of the different views of the beneficiaries. Hence, NHB wrote to the lawyers of the executors to clarify whether probate had been granted for the will, whether there were any other beneficiaries entitled to the assets of the estate and if so whether the consent had been obtained for the gift to NHB. Before responding to these queries, the executors of the estate put out a media release on 11 June publicising their donation of items to NHB. This was a surprise to NHB because the queries had not been addressed. And so NHB issued a statement that same night to highlight that there remains some questions on the Deed of Gift which NHB was in the process of clarifying with the executors.",11,411,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00411
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"On 12 June, Mr Lee Hsien Yang replied to NHB that the executors had not obtained probate for the will but that probate was not necessary for the executors to have the power and authority to enter into the Deed of Gift. He also said that NHB should not be concerned about the position of the beneficiaries under the will. But this response still left open the question of whether there were indeed other beneficiaries and whether their consent had been sought for the donation of items to NHB for the exhibition under the stipulated conditions.",12,412,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00412
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Throughout this period, I was discussing the matter with Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean as the Prime Minister had said that he would leave it to the Deputy Prime Minister to handle the specific dealings between NHB and the executors on the Deed of Gift. Deputy Prime Minister Teo's main concern on the conditions was that NHB was being asked to display a partial quote of the demolition clause which did not fully reflect Mr Lee Kuan Yew's wishes. He felt that NHB, as a public institution, should remain neutral and should not be drawn into a private disagreement or be used to present a particular point of view which was incomplete.",13,413,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00413
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Nevertheless, after weighing all the factors and considering that NHB had already signed the Deed, both Deputy Prime Minister and I agreed that the pluses of having the exhibition with the Oxley Road artefacts in accordance with the Deed outweighed the potential controversy that was likely to arise. This was a major SG50 exhibition on our founding leaders. We had artefacts not just from the estate of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew but also from the National Archives and the families of other founding leaders. And many of these artefacts had not been displayed before. The artefacts helped to enhance the storyline of the exhibition and to bring out the values of our founding leaders for Singaporeans.",14,414,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00414
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Subsequently on 25 June, the Prime Minister informed me that he had written to the executors, in his capacity as beneficiary, indicating to them that notwithstanding his position on the Deed of Gift, he would not object to the exhibition as he did not want to put NHB in a difficult position.",15,415,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00415
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"NHB was thus able to proceed with the exhibition with agreement from all beneficiaries. As NHB needed more time to prepare, it sought the consent of the executors to push back the exhibition date. Eventually, the opening was shifted from 6 August to 21 September 2015. In fact, I attended the opening with Mr Lee Hsien Yang, Dr Lee Wei Ling and Ms Lee Suet Fern. The exhibition was very well received and it has been extended till now.",16,416,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00416
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Madam, as I have explained, my discussion with the Prime Minister on the exhibition was in his official capacity and I shared the Deed of Gift with him on that basis. In response to the question from Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, the Deed of Gift did not have a confidentiality clause. If Mr Lee Hsien Loong has asked for the Deed of Gift in his private capacity, NHB would have been entitled to give it to him, given his position as elder son and beneficiary of the estate.",17,417,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00417
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"More generally, in a scenario where items are being donated to NHB from an estate, and NHB becomes aware that one of the beneficiaries objects to the terms of the donation, it would be necessary for NHB to take steps to verify that there is agreement from all beneficiaries. Otherwise, it could face a potential claim from a beneficiary whose consent was not given. In this case, Mr Lee Hsien Loong told me that his concern was not with the donation of artefacts to NHB but rather the way it was handled and the terms of the donation, as he had shared in his speech earlier. Despite his personal reservations over how the artefacts were conveyed to NHB by the executors in the Deed of Gift, the Prime Minister did not instruct me to stop the display of the Oxley Road artefacts in the exhibition. Instead, he asked me to take instructions from the Deputy Prime Minister on the matter and that was how the matter was handled.",18,418,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00418
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, Madam, I have given an account of what happened to the NHB Deed of Gift. Contrary to this being an abuse of power, I believe the matter was handled correctly and above board.",19,419,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00419
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Madam, I will next elaborate on the due process that applies to the conservation and preservation of properties which is something that the Deputy Prime Minister had highlighted briefly in his speech.",20,420,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00420
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),The Government undertakes a vigorous assessment process for all such properties before deciding whether or not to conserve or preserve them. I will elaborate briefly on what this process is.,21,421,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00421
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"First, Government agencies will undertake detailed research on the preservation or conservation merits of the property of interest. Agencies will have to review the historical, cultural, social and heritage significance of the property, its national importance as well as its architectural merits and rarity. In examining the historical significance of a site, for example, NHB will review how the site has played a role in our national history. In examining the architectural merits of the building, URA will study which parts of the building are most architecturally significant; or if it is a cluster of buildings, which are the most significant buildings within the cluster.",22,422,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00422
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Next, agencies would look into the planning considerations of the property and its surroundings. This includes examining whether there are any technical regulatory requirements which may have an impact on the form of preservation or conservation proposals for the property.",23,423,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00423
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Agencies will also review the allowable uses of the site. For example, URA may look at whether a conserved residential building can be adapted for commercial use or for civic and community purposes. But such a change in use will have to be compatible to its surroundings and supported by infrastructural considerations, such as potentially a higher traffic count brought about by the change of use.",24,424,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00424
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Arising from these planning studies, agencies may then review the need for the Government to acquire the property for conservation or preservation. Under the Preservation of Monuments Act, if a building is occupied as a residence and the Government chooses to gazette it as a monument, then the Government has to acquire it within one year of the preservation order or else the preservation order will lapse. But beyond the legal requirement, the question is whether the planning intent for the conserved or preserved site is best served by having the Government owning the site as opposed to leaving it under private ownership. For example, if the intent for the site is to have significant public access, and the owner is not prepared to do so, then one option is indeed for the Government to acquire the site.",25,425,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00425
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Madam, this sort of research work provides important baseline information for all properties deemed to have heritage and architectural value. In fact, that is the norm. Agencies will engage and undertake these sorts of research work to provide the baseline information we need for all such properties.",26,426,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00426
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"If there is a need to decide on the next step for the property, then the Government agencies will proceed to seek views from the relevant stakeholders. Of course, views will be sought from the property owner. Views will also be sought from relevant professionals and subject matter experts. The URA has a conservation advisory panel while the NHB has a preservation of sites and monuments advisory board. The advisory panels comprise professionals in the building, arts and heritage and education sectors, and will provide their inputs on the conservation or preservation proposals tabled by the agencies. URA and NHB will submit the recommendations of their findings to the respective Ministries for decision thereafter. If the Government acting through MND or MCCY decides to pursue the conservation or preservation proposal, the property owner will be given the opportunity to respond and appeal.",27,427,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00427
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Based on past cases, the vast majority of owners would agree with the conservation or preservation proposals. A few has appealed but the final decision for conservation or preservation lies with the Government.",28,428,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00428
2017-07-03-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Madam, we should follow this due process for all properties with architectural or heritage merit, including 38 Oxley Road. In fact, prior to the formation of the Ministerial Committee, various agencies have already been working on this issue. NHB has been documenting the historical significance of the house. MND and URA have been looking at options for the property as well as the planning and zoning implications arising from the different scenarios. This work was being done at the staff level. Later, in discussing the matter with the Deputy Prime Minister and various Ministerial colleagues, we agreed that it would be useful to have a Ministerial Committee to coordinate the work across agencies and to oversee the matter. That is why MND tabled the proposal at the Cabinet meeting chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Teo on 1 June to set up the Ministerial Committee to draw up a range of possible options for 38 Oxley Road. As the Deputy Prime Minister said earlier, the Ministerial Committee has no pre-conceived notion on what to do with the property. But the current Government has the duty to do the work now in listing out all the options and to prepare ahead of the implications of each one of them. That is the right and responsible thing to do.",29,429,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00429

2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"One, why has the Government set up a Ministerial Committee to consider options that may differ from the personal wishes of the late Mr Lee? Two, why is this issue being debated in Parliament?",5,437,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00437
2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Madam, in response to the first question, some argue that this is strictly a private battle. They say any dispute over the last will and testament of Mr Lee should be a matter placed for judicial decision between the estate, executors and beneficiaries. Our Government should not interfere.",6,438,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00438
2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Many of my residents have shared their views with me on whether 38 Oxley Road should be demolished. Opinions are mixed. There is no consensus. Therefore, no view is without merit. Whether one agrees with or is opposed to the demolition of 38 Oxley Road is a matter of opinion and valid, reasonable arguments prevail on both sides of the aisle.",7,439,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00439

2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Mr Lee played the role of a Founding Prime Minister of a country post-independence − not unlike Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India or Chairman Mao Zedong of China. Citizens of these respective countries may not all subscribe to the politics or personalities of these political figures, but they stand for more than just their political or personal beliefs. Their place in a nation's history cannot be replaced and should not be forgotten.",13,445,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00445
2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Madam, to Singaporeans, Mr Lee stood for far more than just himself. This was clearly evident during his passing and funeral in 2015. Mr Lee stood for the fundamental values of what Singapore represents − multi-culturalism, meritocracy, good governance, rule of law, the list goes on. I am sure all Singaporeans agree with me when I say that the ideals of these values associated with Mr Lee should be passed down to latter generations of Singaporeans.",14,446,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00446

All things considered, the answer must be yes.",17,449,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00449
2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Madam, the next question then is  why are we debating this in Parliament? Some Singaporeans say that Parliament is not the place to settle family disputes. Well, they are absolutely right. A simple answer is − we are not doing so today!",18,450,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00450
2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),We are not here to settle family disputes. We are here today to address the serious allegations made against the Prime Minister and Cabinet for abuse of power and manipulation of state organs for personal needs. We are here because the integrity of the Prime Minister and our Government has been called in question and Singaporeans have a right to know the full details of these allegations.,19,451,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00451
2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"How then is this different from all the other allegations made by many others over the years? Why the different approach, some argue?",20,452,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00452
2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"My sense from speaking with Singaporeans on this issue is that the perception of credibility is higher because of the individuals making the allegations. Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang are children of the late Mr Lee and siblings to Prime Minister. Being family members to two of our Prime Ministers suggest that they are in a position to know or possess information that ordinary Singaporeans may not. This may not necessarily be true. But, there is this public perception, the perception that allegations made by the Prime Minister's siblings or family may be more credible than others.",21,453,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00453
2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Madam, it is therefore imperative that these allegations are addressed head on. A formal national forum − such as a parliamentary debate − is ideal to address these allegations. It is important because such allegations have far reaching implications − not only about the decision to demolish a house − but the integrity and reputation of the Singapore Government is at stake at home and abroad. Amidst an uncertain world and a volatile economy, nothing can be more important.",22,454,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00454
2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),Prime Minister's statement today provides the answers needed to Singaporeans to clear the allegations of abuse of power and manipulation of state organs. This is clear. We all hope that this matter will be resolved with finality after this debate.,23,455,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00455
2017-07-03-T-012,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The issues relating to the late Mr Lee's personal wishes regarding 38 Oxley Road, his last will and testament as well as the dispute between family members are private personal family matters and should rightly remain so.",24,456,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00456

There is therefore a likelihood that further rebuttals and counter-allegations will continue in social media and the press after this debate concludes. Singaporeans are concerned that a further protraction of this saga will harm and detract Singapore from other far more pressing and urgent national and international issues that confronts us.",25,457,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00457

The opinions of the Workers' Party's members and Members of Parliament (MPs) on the other aspects of the issues are just as diverse as public opinion has been in these few weeks.",2,460,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00460

2017-07-03-T-012,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"This is a fundamental point that I want to make which I personally feel strongly about. The problem with this whole saga is the line between the private and the public has been blurred and crossed too many times by the Prime Minister, the Lee siblings and the Government too. We need to restore the line, make it a bright red line, resolve the aspects of disputes that have crossed into the public domain and push the dispute back into the private domain. We need to do this so as to move on for far more important issues that are truly national issues. This saga is distracting the Government, distracting Singaporeans, distracting the international audience and damaging the Singapore brand.",4,462,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00462

2017-07-03-T-012,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"First, Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling should not make vague allegations in the public domain against the Prime Minister based on scattered evidence centred on family displeasure.

2017-07-03-T-012,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"The Government should set an example, and needs to maintain its dignity in the face of insults to its integrity.

The Prime Minister is faced with serious allegations from his brother and sister. These allegations need to be addressed in a proper manner. As the Prime Minister once said himself, ""Such matters cannot be just you say, I say. It is the hallmark of the PAP Government in the past to get to the bottom of such matters via the court."" I believe that the ""you say, I say"" exchange will continue in social media if the Prime Minister fails to take action to put it to a stop.",10,468,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00468

2017-07-03-T-012,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Next, it seems to me that the Minister for Law was a close personal friend of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and other members of the Lee family. He has now fallen out with some members of the Lee family. Dr Lee Wei Ling said he was a changed person. He was previously involved in giving personal advice relating to Mr Lee Kuan Yew's will. However, he is also now part of the Ministerial Commiittee which is looking at the issue of the house arising from the will. Is there not a conflict of interest there?",12,470,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00470
2017-07-03-T-012,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Furthermore, the current Attorney-General, Mr Lucien Wong, was acting as Mr Lee Hsien Loong's personal lawyer in his private dispute against his siblings. But now, the same person is in the position to advise the Government and the Cabinet on matters related to the house and Mr Lee Kuan Yew's will. Is there also a conflict of interest here? Was this consideration taken into account when he was appointed the Attorney-General? Can the Prime Minister clarify the role of the Law Minister and the Attorney-General in this matter and explain to the House whether there is any conflict of interest? If so, how are they going to account to the public for this. Is their current position still tenable?",13,471,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00471

However, this is not a Korean drama show. It is a serious matter because it affects the credibility of our entire country. The timing of the public blow-up of the private dispute is also unfortunate. At this juncture, the country faces serious challenges. Singapore is facing a tricky and volatile geopolitical situation and the Government has to navigate our small state between a self-centred America and a more assertive China skilfully and carefully. We also seem to be vulnerable to the worsening security situation in the war against terrorism in Southeast Asia with troubling cases of self-radicalisation surfacing at home.",14,472,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00472

What the Committee can do is to give the Cabinet some suggestions. Thus, there is no basis to the allegation that the Government is abusing its power.",11,495,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00495

But from what I understand, in the day-to-day work of the Cabinet, it is very common to set up different Ministerial Committees. For example, I am part of the baby formula Committee, led by two Ministers. It seems nothing unusual, it is just part and parcel of the Government's work.",12,496,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00496

I have had many conversations with residents since the issue broke. The tirade online in the name of fulfilling Mr Lee's wishes is a strange way to honour Mr Lee's legacy. There are many theories as to why it had happened. From sibling rivalry, to warring factions in the family, to a fallout due to money. We do not know any better, not being privy to family matters. But if we were to look at the reasons presented in the joint statement on 14 June, namely that keeping the house would help fulfil dynastical ambitions and provide political capital, I would say that that has not found traction on the ground.",34,518,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00518

2017-07-03-T-012,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"For instance, why offer the house for $1 to Dr Lee Wei Ling and then subsequently sell the house to Mr Lee Hsien Yang for full market value?

2017-07-03-T-012,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I understand that the Prime Minister subsequently donated the proceeds from the house to charity. He then recused himself from Government deliberations on the property. Some question if it is possible for the Prime Minister to thoroughly remove himself from the equation given that he is the Prime Minister. But I think that would be akin to saying that the Health Minister should not have family members using Singapore's health services or that the Minister of National Development should not buy a house. I think Deputy Prime Minister Teo has explained quite clearly about the code of conduct that public office holders and civil servants need to adhere to.,38,522,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00522

Dr Lee Wei Ling could be staying there for the next 30 years. Therefore there is nothing for the Government to do now as no decision needs to or can be made. So, I am not sure what the dispute is about? Why is there any argument since the house cannot be demolished now anyway? It looks to me that a sensible course of action is to consider different options and to talk to the family members about various options and to understand their thoughts about the matter.",39,523,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00523
2017-07-03-T-012,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Another question I have is why the Prime Minister did not challenge the last will when he first got to know its contents? The Prime Minister obviously believes that the circumstances around the drafting of the last will are suspect and had actually gone to the extent of doing a statutory declaration which has very serious implications if he is subsequently found out to have lied. Mr Lee Hsien Yang can actually sue the Prime Minister for what he, the Prime Minister has set out in his statutory declaration, namely, that he has grave concerns about the events surrounding the making of the last will and by what appears to be a conflict of interest involving Mrs Lee Suet Fern.",40,524,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00524

They are also ignoring the fact that since Dr Lee is staying there, there is nothing for the Government to do now.

2017-07-03-T-012,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"So, I was very glad to hear the Deputy Prime Minister acknowledging that in the past, such work has been over-zealous. However, in this particular case, it is a bit different from the National Library building because National Library and Bukit Brown Cemetery, they were public space. But now, we have a private estate where the community believes that it has a lot of historical value. And how do we then balance the need of the individuals as well as the state?",16,553,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00553
2017-07-03-T-012,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"In the case of 38 Oxley Road, can a decision be made with wisdom and clarity? Will the closure we all seek ever be fully realised? Many elderly people I meet through the course of my work on end-of-life issues share with me stories about their wills. Although they know what they want, they are very apprehensive and worry about other family members would think. When I asked them if they have discussed the matter with their family members, they said it is difficult to talk about such things. Such obstacles, combined with feelings of pride and fear and blindness, can lead to decisions that seed future disputes. It is then when conversations become important.",17,554,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00554
2017-07-03-T-012,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"And so, in future, when wills are being made, should we not consider having this possibility whereby family members should be part of the process and maybe be a requirement? Of course, there is contention about that.",18,555,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00555
2017-07-03-T-012,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Family does not always have a beautiful utopian image that we like to conjure. Family is all about relationships.

2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Most importantly, Singaporeans should know the true facts. With that, they can decide for themselves why this dispute is brought to the open now because all it does is confuse matters further to the point that it affects the reputation of the Government and Singapore.

2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"But at the heart of it all, amidst all the attention and information being shared by many quarters, the one question that I was left to grapple with was  what was the issue about in the first place?",27,586,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00586
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We know that according to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the house need not be demolished until his daughter chooses not to live in it. The Government is also clear that it will respect Mr Lee's wish in this regard. Hence, it is not as if a decision was taken. We have been assured before by the Government that as long as Dr Lee Wei Ling continues to live in 38 Oxley Road, it shall remain intact.",28,587,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00587
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"So, why is this matter being debated now? And we are left puzzled, what is the underlying motivation behind this dispute. If the Government has committed not to make a decision at this point in time and not on behalf of the Government of the future, then what is this dispute and the public allegations all about? Is it just about the house or is there more to this?",29,588,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00588
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The other concerns is a question of principle. For decades, many regular Singaporeans have had their homes and land acquired for the greater national good. Some for development of HDB flats or MRT lines, while others for heritage and preservation. So many others have sacrificed − not everyone willingly − for the greater good and national interest. If some members of the Lee family believe that they should be exempted from Government deliberations or decisions just because they are a family of standing, then I think this sets the wrong principles and precedence. Based on Prime Minister's statement earlier, I can only guess that the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew recognised and respected this. Otherwise, he could have left out the second part of paragraph 7 of his will, or deliberated the demolishment of the home while he was still alive.",30,589,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00589
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Regardless of the motivations and timing, this issue has raised many questions particularly certain allegations against the Prime Minister and the Government of abuse of power. Like many Singaporeans, I would like to know if these allegations had an ounce of truth and I trust that this Parliamentary session must shed light because Singaporeans want to know the truth.",31,590,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00590
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, there are four particular issues where questions need to be answered. First, the role of the Ministerial Committee. I understand that Ministerial Committees are common and the Cabinet has assembled them on many strategic matters. But was the case of 38 Oxley Road such an important issue that it required assembling a Ministerial Committee? Would it not have sufficed to have URA, NHB or any other relevant Government agency assess the matter and give its recommendations to the Cabinet instead?",32,591,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00591
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"And if indeed, it was necessary, then Singaporeans deserve to know if the Committee was indeed independent. Because the fact that you have to make a decision on the matter where their boss has personal interest does raise questions, but I think Prime Minister has already also spoken that you have to trust the Cabinet and the Government to remain independent. Deputy Prime Minister too has also shared in his Ministerial statement of the roles and functions of the Ministerial Committee. But the question I have would be − the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew had mentioned, on many occasions, he wanted the house demolished. What else transpired when he met the Cabinet on 21 July 2011?",33,592,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00592
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The Government has said that it did not need to make a decision now as Dr Lee Wei Ling is still staying there. If so, was there a reason to set up the Ministerial Committee now? Is there a hurry to do so?",34,593,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00593
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"And how has the Committee interpreted the paragraph 7 of the will thus far? Under what circumstances or criteria can the Government declare a house a national monument for preservation to prevent any demolition or re-development while the family chooses to live on-site? In its study, what does the Committee estimate to be the potential value of the site if sold given the current zoning of the area?",35,594,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00594
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The second area, Madam, that requires clarification is the Deed of Gift. Due to the allegations that have been made, many Singaporeans deserve to know when Prime Minister came to know of the Deed and if there was any leak outside of the purview. And I think, Minister has addressed that earlier.",36,595,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00595
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Here, the role of NHB comes into question. Why did NHB sign on to take over the items, despite the onerous contractual obligations − and knowing that there could be potentially a family dispute?",37,596,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00596
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Since there was potentially a conflict of interest in the matter of Ms Lee Suet Fern, who served on the NHB board and whose firm had prepared the contract on behalf of the family, then why did NHB go ahead and sign it? Was it under any pressure to do so, as you have a Board of Directors working the agreement? Given that many of our top talent in Singapore wear multiple hats, how can we enhance the governance of our Government agencies to avoid potential conflict of interest in future?",38,597,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00597
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),The third area that I seek clarification on is on the matter of the last will of the late Mr Lee and the extent to which the Government should be involved in determining its accuracy.,39,598,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00598
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, why is the Ministerial Committee concerned about the validity of the will? Many Singaporeans wonder why it is necessary for the Government to be involved in ascertaining the accuracy of the will, if at all. Should it not be a private matter, to be challenged in court, they ask?",40,599,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00599
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"There are also some quarters who see the Government taking a role in this because Prime Minister came out to say that he has ""grave concerns"" on the preparation of the last will. Perhaps it may be useful for Prime Minister to clarify in which capacity he made this comment as it would then clarify the Government's perceived role in it.",41,600,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00600
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Lastly, on the platform that has been chosen for this matter, as mentioned by Members, some Singaporeans have asked if a Ministerial statement in Parliament was the right platform to address this issue.",42,601,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00601
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"While I agree that the integrity of the Government should be defended, I hope that we all also realise that this may not stop further allegations from being hurled at the Government. We have already seen, just in the past few days alone, how new actors have been brought into the fray − both Ministers and public servants − as the allegations grew.",43,602,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00602
2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),How does the Government plan to handle communications and further clarifications from the Lee family if there are still queries beyond what has been explained today? Under what circumstances will the Government or Parliament consider further enquiry or select committee to investigate any further allegations or disputes of accounts?,44,603,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00603

2017-07-03-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Opening it up into the public domain does not serve Singapore's interest at all, as it only tarnishes the country's reputation − something that no Singaporean would want and not least the late Mr Lee himself. If the family wishes to honour his wishes and legacy, then this would be a good base to start from.",46,605,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00605

2017-07-03-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"But to be fair to the Prime Minister, are the allegations outrageous? Are they merely a figment of the Lee siblings' overactive imagination? We in this House will not be able to get down to the bottom of these questions during this debate, for one simple reason − there is no natural justice in the procedure adopted. With due respect to the Prime Minister, we are only hearing the Prime Minister's version, the Government's version, today. What else there is, we do not know. Indeed, allegations have been made today that the Lee siblings have been selective in their documentation and may not have been truthful. They are not here to defend themselves.",2,607,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00607

2017-07-03-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Notwithstanding the limited value of this session, I wish to raise one matter that should be of concern to every Singaporean who wishes to see Singapore as a bastion that upholds the rule of law. And that is − how fundamentally precious it is that we defend with all our hearts and minds the independence of our Organs of State. We must protect the Organs of State as professional bodies with a national mission.

When Judges decide cases, they are constrained by the laws passed by Parliament, and their decisions are public and appealable. By contrast, the Attorney-General as the Public Prosecutor has almost absolute prosecutorial discretion − he can decide not to charge a person who has committed an offence, to let an offender off with a warning, to reduce charges and so on. These decisions are most weighty, yet they are not public and not appealable. It is not an exaggeration to say that all of us are at the mercy of the Attorney-General.

The Attorney-General is independent in this role, and not subject to the control of the Government"". These are the AGC's own words.",8,613,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00613
2017-07-03-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Indeed, past Law Ministers had expressly endorsed the need for there to be distance between the Government and the AGC. For instance, Prof S Jayakumar recently gave an interview for a book marking AGC's 150th Anniversary. There, he recalled how when he was appointed Minister of State for Law in 1981, he was given an office located at the AGC, then in High Street. Prof Jayakumar then recounted as follows  ""I told the then Attorney-General Tan Boon Teik that it was not proper for a Minister of State for Law to be housed in the AGC because it would raise all sorts of questions about the AGC's autonomy.""",9,614,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00614
2017-07-03-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Fast forward to today. In prior debates this year, I had raised questions about the appointment of the current Attorney-General and his newest Deputy Attorney-General. The role of the newest Deputy Attorney-General as an immediate past Member of Parliament is well-known. As for the Attorney-General, it was also well-known that he had been a senior partner in the same firm as the Law Minister for a long time. They probably understand each other intimately. We now learn from the Lee siblings that the Attorney-General also happened to be Prime Minister's personal lawyer, and that he had advised the Prime Minister specifically on the matters relating to the Lee estate.",10,615,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00615
2017-07-03-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Now, there is no legal prohibition on appointing the Government's close friends and former party comrades as the Attorney-General or Deputy Attorney-General. But, from a system point of view, do these appointments instil public confidence that the AGC will act independently in matters where the Government, or worse, the Prime Minister, has an interest in the outcomes? At the time when the appointments were being considered, were there no other qualified persons to take up those posts? What about the many career legal service officers who had dedicated their lives to public service? Was there no one there good enough?",11,616,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00616
2017-07-03-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Coming back to facts at hand, I am concerned about the conflicts of interest. How will the AGC act in advising the Government on any decisions it wishes to take on 38 Oxley Road? Has the AGC already been giving advice to the Committee, and who within the AGC is giving the advice? Has the Attorney-General recused himself from even touching the file, since he had represented Prime Minister Lee in his personal capacity as a beneficiary? What about the Deputy Attorney-General? I understand that he only recently resigned as a cadre member of the PAP. When was this? Will he recuse himself from the matter too, since his former party leader, the Secretary-General, is personally involved?",12,617,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00617
2017-07-03-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, Singaporeans are upset over this saga for a multitude of reasons. One consistent theme is embarrassment at the public airing of family disputes and that family matters should be settled privately. Another thread is whether the Prime Minister, other Ministers and the Attorney-General had exercised their powers properly in handling matters touching on the Lee estate. My concern is on the latter, particularly how we protect the rule of law and our institutions. Let us be most alive to the risk of a slippery slope that erodes public trust in the independence of our Organs of State.",13,618,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00618

One was that the executors of the estate could buy back all the items at $1 as long as 38 Oxley Road was not demolished. Second was that part of the demolition clause from the late Minister Mentor Lee's will − the part that expressed the wish for immediate demolition of the house after Dr Lee Wei Ling moves out of it should be prominently displayed, whereas the other part of the will outlining what was to be done if the house could not be demolished was to be omitted from the exhibition.",3,650,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00650

We, the people, cannot be asked to tolerate a situation where the powerful are allowed to say or do whatever they wish, not be held accountable for it and then freely exercise their option to leave the country behind for greener pastures when they are done with their personal agendas. This not the Singapore we want to live in. Or the Singapore we have been asked to fight for. The powerful must be bound by the same principles, values and rules that the less powerful are being asked to play by.",6,669,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00669
2017-07-03-T-012,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"So, I agree with the Workers' Party's approach that ""the crux of the family issues surrounding 38 Oxley Road is for the family to resolve privately or in Cour."" and that Parliament should only be ""concerned with the allegations of abuse of power and the harms these have caused to confidence in Singapore and our political institutions.""",7,670,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00670
2017-07-03-T-012,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"The Prime Minister's accusers should have an independent, neutral space where they can be held to account for their words, put down their side of the story on official record, sharing whatever arguments and evidence they have to back their claims. Such a hearing can happen either as an independent Select Committee, or a Commission of Inquiry (COI), which would have full authority to investigate the accusations, to summon evidence surrounding the most biting allegations raised in the original ""What has happened to Lee Kuan Yew's values?"" document about the supposed misuse of power by the Prime Minister and his wife, the supposed Orwellian threat of state intimidation and monitoring of private citizens, and the supposed nepotism behind key appointments in the public service. Because if investigations reveal there is truth and substance to the allegations, their wrongs must be made right. It is presently hard to ask more questions because so far details are just so vague and the people who can supply more detailed evidence to these questions are just not in this room.",8,671,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00671
2017-07-03-T-012,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"The Prime Minister has shared his hope that ""this full, public airing in Parliament will dispel any doubts that have been planted and strengthen confidence in our institutions and our system of government."" I hope so much for that to be true too but from what I know of ground sentiments, I do not think that is going to happen for those who are unconverted or those who are sitting on the fence. Mr Lee Hsien Yang has already made it clear to the many Singaporeans following his Facebook posts that he believes ""This Parliamentary session is a forum that again places the Prime Minister before his subordinates"" who ""lack sufficient background and evidence of the numerous instances of abuse and conflicts of interest, many yet to be raised"".",9,672,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00672
2017-07-03-T-012,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"That is why I hope the Prime Minister will consider subjecting himself to an independent Committee of Inquiry on the allegations made against him and his Government. A Committee of Inquiry or Select Committee with enough independent non-PAP, non-subordinate representatives would help to address some of his accuser's concerns. I understand this is not a process to be taken lightly and runs the risk of stretching out the painful saga but I believe it is a significant display of political courage that will shore up much trust in our system's integrity, and it will also be a significant display of trust also in the people who will be asked to sit on those Committees.",10,673,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00673
2017-07-03-T-012,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"Prime Minister, I respect your decision to put forth your perspective on the Oxley issue as a statutory declaration. It means high stakes for you if you are found to be falsifying your statement so it does show me how seriously you have considered the stakes of your words. I also respect your decision to open this up to Parliamentary debate and inviting all of us in this House to ask questions that call you to account because every word will go down on public record in the Hansard. Your earlier sharing that you intend to put your words out in public free of parliamentary privilege is an important move that I believe will build trust.",11,674,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00674
2017-07-03-T-012,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"Because in this culture right now shaped by social media, where words are allowed to flow fast and free, it has become all too easy to forget why things like statutory declarations and Hansards matter. They remind us that for society to be strong, for democracy to be resilient, we must all allow the law to call us into account for our words. The things we choose to say, the things we choose not to say because words are the way we build or break our worlds. Since the Prime Minister has already made a statutory declaration, it would be most fair and helpful for Singaporeans to have an independent Committee set up that can request that his accusers would also offer theirs.",12,675,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00675
2017-07-03-T-012,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"Beneath all this is the uncomfortable accusation about whether we are a country of one man rule. Part of the reason why perceptions of authoritarianism continue to fester is that there are still many people who believe and perceive the Government to be opaque in its decision-making and defensive in its communication about its work. This is just a long-standing perspective on the ground that is clear to anyone who looks at contentious Facebook comment threads on any socio-political issues. The idea that anyone would see secret Ministerial Committees as nefarious may seem strange and even silly to those in Government who are familiar with what they are. But to someone hearing about it for the first time, it can be construed to sound mysterious and Orwellian. Where there is no information and understanding given, misinformation and misunderstanding will rush in to fill the vacuum.",13,676,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00676

If anything, a deeper and more open conversation about how political power works in Singapore may be just what our system needs to truly grow up as a post-Lee Kuan Yew democracy. Our electorate needs better political education and more open, empathetic communication about our political processes can help.",14,677,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00677

For no matter how great or powerful or righteous any one man may be, the best of men still die and a country must learn to live beyond them.

We have been gathering views from thousands of Singaporeans − historians, architects, regular people on the street, young people − about what kind of memorial would best honour the legacy of our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and the pioneering team of leaders that built the nation alongside him. Incidentally, Oxley never actually came up as a major suggestion. They wanted more public spaces like Fort Canning or Singapore River.",17,680,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00680
2017-07-03-T-012,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"What we learnt is that many Singaporeans wanted a memorial that could go beyond a mere recollection of the past. They wanted a memorial to be forward-looking and ever relevant to a new generation, a memorial that did not just centre on one particular personality but powerful principles that could be passed on to endure forever. Many hoped for the Founder's Memorial, whenever and wherever it does get built, to ultimately stand for unity across the divides. I imagine whatever Singaporeans had wanted for the Founders' Memorial, they would want for the Oxley house as well. Whether Oxley stays or goes or becomes a memorial garden with a basement, I hope we can find some compromise that will enable it to not go down in our history as a memorial born first in bitterness. Mr Lee Hsien Yang seems open to that memorial garden idea so hopefully that can be the beginning of some common ground that will move us all forward.",18,681,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00681
2017-07-03-T-012,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"Many Singaporeans in the process also referred again and again to the national pledge written by our founders as still the best representation of the story they wanted Singapore to live out, from generation to generation. Singapore was, is and must always be about more than one man's − or one family's − values. Even the National pledge that most closely enshrines all our nation's values was not written by one man alone. It went through a long chain of drafting starting from a Mr Phillip Liau, Mr George Thomson, then Mr S Rajaratnam, various Ministry officials and then Mr Lee Kuan Yew and then submitted to the Cabinet then for final approval.",19,682,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00682
2017-07-03-T-012,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"I have come to believe that nations are really just families writ large. Psychologists who study resilience in families notice that the more children know about their family history, the stronger their sense of personal agency, self-confidence and capacity to face challenges. It also turns out that the pattern of the story told by each family matters. Some families tell their children an ascending narrative with a constantly upward, upbeat, hopeful trajectory. Some families tell descending narratives with a constantly downward depressing and pessimistic trend. But what was interesting is psychologists discovered that both these kind of families are not resilient. It is those families that tell an oscillating narrative instead − a roller-coaster trajectory of a tale with ups and downs − that consistently produced the most resilient children. They understand that highs and lows were part of life and problems were better faced together rather than apart. The oscillating family story helps them develop a strong ""intergenerational self"" − a purposeful awareness that they are part of something larger than themselves.",20,683,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00683

Initially, he has stated that he had not thought through the plans beyond demolition. Subsequently, he mentioned the possibility of planting a memorial garden.

The ruling party has thus single-handedly shaped the political culture in Singapore. Our political culture is one that does not condone any allegations of wrongdoing or impropriety against the Government of the day. Accusers are expected to back to up their claims with evidence, and if they cannot, they are sued. Millions of dollars in damages have been awarded when unsubstantiated allegations amounting to defamation and slander have been made against politicians, so as to preserve their moral authority. Many families have been besmirched by this. In fact, Opposition politicians have been challenged to sue PAP MPs if they feel wronged.",1,714,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00714

When it was suggested to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew by a reporter that it was tenuous to base a defamation suit on Mr Jeyaratnam showing copies of Mr Tang's police reports to a rally crowd, Mr Lee said this was a matter for the courts to decide, and that his lawyers had advised him to sue.

Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling would expect to face multiple defamation lawsuits for alleging that the Prime Minister has either lied or been corrupt in its dealings. As this has not happened and in view of the political culture that I have spoken of, there are Singaporeans who believe that the allegations made against the Prime Minister may have more than a grain of truth to them. Many allegations have been made, and one need only peruse the document made public by Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling, released on 14 June 2017 titled, ""What has happened to Lee Kuan Yew's values?"" to remind themselves of them.",5,718,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00718

There was also market talk that Mr Lee had been offered units in all the properties developed by the HPL group.",10,723,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00723
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Finance Minister duly reported this to the then Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong who ordered an investigation to get the Stock Exchange to provide a list of purchasers of two HPL developments including questioning both the Senior Minister and then Deputy Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong, who had also purchased two HPL apartments. In view of his investigation, Prime Minister Goh was convinced that there was no wrongdoing.",11,724,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00724
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Secondly, caveats were openly lodged giving the names of the Senior Minister and the transacted prices after discount. This fact was crucial as a transparent caveat lodgment did not suggest wrongdoing by any stretch.",12,725,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00725
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, Mr Lee Kuan Yew instructed Mr Ong Beng Seng, the Managing Director of HPL and a key player in clearing the air, to confront the media about the propriety of the purchases by himself and the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Lee stressed to Mr Ong that it was not enough for HPL to release a press statement but that a press conference was in order. Contrast this important detail with the absence of any sense of closure on the allegations made by Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling in the matter we are debating before the House today.",13,726,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00726
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, during the HPL debate, sitting MPs, some of whom worked for developers, were able to clarify the nature of how developers used complicated pricing strategies to market and sell their properties.",14,727,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00727
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The extent of probity and the affirmative conclusions to various matters in the HPL issue notwithstanding, by the time it came to an end in this House, MPs were in a position to triangulate various facts, which in totality made it absolutely clear that no improprieties could be alleged by any reasonable person in the purchase of apartments by the Senior Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister.",15,728,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00728
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the matter before us today, can we honestly say that we are apprised and fully aware of the evidence and facts relevant to the allegations of the Prime Minister abusing his power so as to come to the same conclusion? Frankly, by the end of today's debate, Iike the MPs in this House in 1996, if we can say yes, then there should no lingering suspicions or doubts that the Prime Minister abused his powers in the matter of 38 Oxley Road. And that would be a welcome outcome for Singapore.",16,729,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00729
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, in view of the highly unusual decision by the Prime Minister not to clear his name in the courts, the key question before this House is how do we move forward from here?",17,730,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00730
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Parliament can be a platform to look into and address the matter, but the choice of the appropriate Parliamentary forum is crucial. In fact, allegations of abuse of power by the Prime Minister may conceivably gain even more traction if the wrong Parliamentary forum is chosen.",18,731,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00731
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the event the Prime Minister eschews going to the courts to address these allegations of abuse of power even as more allegations are made and left to the people's imagination to ruminate over, I am of the view that the next best option would be for Parliament to prepare to organise a special Select Committee to look into the allegations made against the Prime Minister.",19,732,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00732
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Its remit would simply be to look into the truthfulness of the allegations and get to the bottom of the matter. In light of evidence being made available to it, the Committee can be expected to summon if it so chooses, the Prime Minister, Mdm Ho Ching, Mrs Lee Suet Fern and anyone else to shed light on the allegations.",20,733,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00733
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I make this proposal for a Select Committee of Parliament in the public interest as I believe it is an avenue to put a stop to these allegations which have now moved beyond damaging just the Government, but have damaged Singapore's reputation and the trust people outside Singapore have in its institutions.",21,734,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00734
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Many Singaporeans are unaware that the consequence of ignoring a summons from Parliament are severe and a defaulter can be arrested and brought before the Select Committee to set the record straight. Should any witness be contemptuous before the Committee, beyond hefty fines, Parliament is even empowered to commit that individual to prison for the rest of this Parliamentary term.",22,735,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00735
2017-07-03-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, the longer this sad episode drags on, Singapore's reputation as a country where the rule of law is a strict guiding principle of our society and the credibility of the Government will be cast in very serious doubt. Like many Singaporeans, I agree that the matters surrounding the will and like disagreements are fundamentally family issues and should be privately resolved forthwith either through the courts or through mediation. But it is the allegations of abuse of power that have to be decisively addressed, otherwise an odour will linger, one that will have severe and significant repercussions for Singapore's reputation. I do not believe a Parliamentary debate like the one we are having today will put the matter to rest, even as I hope I am wrong.",23,736,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00736
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak. This whole situation is really quite unfortunate. Singaporeans are used to seeing Singapore being cited for our reputation of good governance. In the last three weeks, what we have experienced is quite the opposite. In fact, it is like a bad dream. As one of my constituents had put it, I quote, ""The reputation of Singapore is at stake here and all eyes from the international community are on us"". What started out as a ""private family matter"" is no longer just that. The allegations of the abuse of power by the organs of the state put into question the integrity of the Government, and this is serious. Public interest is now at stake. So, it is imperative that it must be put right.",1,737,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00737
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I thank Prime Minister Lee for recognising that this family dispute, the dispute between him and his siblings and it being publicly aired, has caused damage to Singapore and Singaporeans. I am glad that he has apologised to Singaporeans, but as we all know, damage has been done to the reputation of Singapore and the confidence of Singaporeans. So, an apology is not quite sufficient.",2,738,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00738
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So, while we would have preferred not to have to discuss this in Parliament, given the serious allegations and how things have played out, it is important that we address the crux of the concerns of Singaporeans. To be clear, the dispute between Mr Lee Kuan Yew's children is not what we are here to debate, as this is a matter to be settled between the siblings privately. What I wish to speak about today are the consequential impact of the allegation of the abuse of power and hence the question on the integrity of the Singapore Government.",3,739,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00739
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The matter regarding 38 Oxley Road is unprecedented. It is not just a house. It was in that very house that much of the foundations of Singapore's political history started. The owner of the house was not just any person but Mr Lee Kuan Yew, one of Singapore's founding fathers. Hence, the decision on what is to happen to the house on 38 Oxley Road is not a simple decision. It involves not only the interest of Singapore but also the desire to honour Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his last wishes.",4,740,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00740
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"It is because of the unprecedented nature of the matter that ""how"" the decision is arrived at is as important as the decision itself. Therefore, it is critical that as much information as possible on the process and rationale for the options being considered be shared with Singaporeans.",5,741,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00741
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I know we have a reputation of being efficient, effective, handling things in the best possible way with the least amount of disturbance and resources. But I think this is unprecedented and it matters to Singaporeans, not just because it is about Mr Lee Kuan Yew but it is also because it is about the history of Singapore. And therefore, we have to share as much information about the ""how"" as it is about the decision.",6,742,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00742
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So, this brings me to the question of the Ministerial Committee. The Ministerial Committee was convened in July last year, as shared by Deputy Prime Minister Teo and the Ministerial Committee has been set up to look into various options for what happens to the house 38 Oxley Road and the implications of these options. The options that the Ministerial Committee arrives at will guide the decision that Cabinet and the government of the day will have to make when the time comes for a decision on 38 Oxley Road, when Dr Lee Wei Ling no longer lives there.",7,743,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00743
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So, it is therefore crucial that Singaporeans − and I stress this again, I know some people may say it does not matter because if we have the right people in the Committee it is okay − but it does matter. So, it is therefore crucial that Singaporeans are given as much information on the process and the considerations made to arrive at the options. This will help assure Singaporeans if there is indeed independence.",8,744,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00744
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I would like to ask some questions that have been lingering on the ground as well, questions that pertain to why were members of the Ministerial Committee not disclosed until recently? Or under what circumstances are Ministerial Committees which are not publicly convened? I hope these can be answered.",9,745,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00745
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Prime Minister, you have said that you have recused yourself from all Government decisions to be taken on 38 Oxley Road. You have provided information to the Ministerial Committee. I think it is also important for you to share the significance of you providing the Ministerial Committee with the statutory declaration. I do not think people understand the seriousness or at least not everybody may understand the seriousness of a statutory declaration. I think it is important that you share its significance.",10,746,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00746
2017-07-03-T-012,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Mdm Speaker, with all that is happening, I do hope that we will find a way to honour Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and at the same time, although it is difficult for many of us to see it at the same time now with all that is happening, I hope that we can bring Singaporeans and unite Singaporeans together having gone through what we are going through now.",11,747,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00747
2017-07-03-T-012,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Education (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Mdm Speaker, a number of Members of the House have stood up to suggest that Parliament is the wrong place and this should not have been brought to Parliament. There are two major arguments being made. One is, if there is no substance to these allegations, why are we spending our time in Parliament dealing with what is essentially a private family matter. The other is that there is potential substance but this needs to be better dealt with somewhere else.",1,748,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00748
2017-07-03-T-012,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Education (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"The first point I want to make is that coming to Parliament does not preclude anything else happening outside of Parliament. It is not a zero sum game. Two weeks have passed since the first allegations were made. Can you imagine that this would have been resolved in the Courts in two weeks? Can you imagine that a special Select Committee could have been constituted, could have called witnesses, analysed the problem, submitted a report in two weeks? Nothing else could have happened in two weeks.",2,749,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00749
2017-07-03-T-012,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Education (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"But if it comes to Parliament, as we have done today, and we have to debate the Home Team Corps Bill, which I will be speaking on some time after this debate, if we have to debate about issues to do with our finances, about the Monetary Authority of Singapore or about other Statutory Boards and we have a lingering suspicion about our process of Government, about the authority of the Members of this House to debate, to analyse, to deal with the most pressing problems facing Singapore, how could we have gone forward? It is ridiculous to suggest that we cannot talk about this in Parliament. We have to talk about this in Parliament.",3,750,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00750
2017-07-03-T-012,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Education (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"The first point, I find more interesting − that there are no specifics, there is no evidence, there is no substance to the allegations. ""Do not let this go on, end this saga now, because there is nothing to it"" − these are things that have been brought up by PAP MPs, NMPs and Opposition MPs. We have not yet had specifics about what we should be doing differently, other than debate this in Parliament. A special Select Committee is an instrument, a tool empowered by Parliament, as Mr Pritam Singh had argued just now. How can he say that it would be better than Parliament, if he says that there is something wrong fundamentally with Parliament? Yes, a special Select Committee has time, space and the opportunity to gather more evidence and to go into more details. But it is given those powers by Parliament. Ultimately, it provides a report to Parliament and the actions taken on its recommendations are done by Parliament. So, if we are going to choose these routes, the one thing we cannot do, is say that Parliament is not the appropriate place to deal with these matters.",4,751,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00751

The expectations of Parliamentary process, the expectations of prudence, of probity, but even on a very pragmatic basis. We are expected to forward plan just about everything. If you think back not many minutes, not many hours ago, to the Parliamentary Questions. I was standing at this very same rostrum, having to defend questions about the extent to which we could predict changes in our school landscape 15 years, 10 years, five years ahead of time.

Coming to Parliament today is a demonstration that our systems works, that our governance and our Government, the values and the expectations of our public are a marker of our system working. Our ability to talk about this, the documents that have been shared here today, the record of conversations, the record of interactions that we have had, that we bring to bear to make this debate happen, are a marker of the transparency and effectiveness of our system working.",8,755,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00755

These are markers of transparency, these are markers of accountability. Accountability around process, around documentation. Accountability not just at the top − it has to be especially at the top, the Prime Minister has talked about that − but accountability extends all the way through. This code of conduct, these values and these processes need to be understood by every officer in that chain of command so that they know when they are being asked to do something inappropriate, that they know that they have alternative lines of reporting, that they know that they can document these things and it will be there as a matter of record for courts, for a special Select Committee or for Members of Parliament to access, to demonstrate and to debate.

If it was easy and if it was fun, it would not have to be brought here in Parliament. I suppose Government is not there to just deal with the nice things. The Parliamentary debate, the idea of the contest that we have in our speeches and in our discussion that politics itself is contestable, that the issues brought before this House are to be contested over and that we must be rigorously applying ourselves to that contest in order to get the best possible outcome for the people that we serve and for Singapore. That is an important part of what has got us here today, and what will take us forward and make us a resilient and stronger system to withstand any further shocks, allegations and problems that surface.",25,772,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00772

So, it is always inappropriate to quote a clause out of context, or quote only half a paragraph. Because if you try to sharpen iron against iron, both get blunted and a lot of heat is generated. Iron is sharpened against stone. The stone against which we have to sharpen our positions and our thoughts and achieve some clarity on where we are as politicians, as parties, as individual Singaporeans, is a combination of the law and our Constitution as represented by you, Mdm Speaker.",27,774,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00774

If in life he submitted himself to the rule of law, I cannot imagine him overruling it in death. It remains to be seen as to why the demolition was drafted as a wish rather than a directive or a condition under his will. I do not know. But it remains to be seen.

My own thinking is that it would not be right for us to demolish the house solely because he wished it. It would not have been right.

2017-07-03-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Firstly, determining a testator's intent with regard to a property often follows a legal process. The Prime Minister did not challenge the will and it was granted probate from the court. Many questioned, what then is the role of the Ministerial Committee with regard to the will? According to Deputy Prime Minister Teo, and as he mentioned earlier, the Committee's interest in Mr Lee Kuan Yew's will is simply to help them understand his thoughts regarding the house. Many are confused as to what it is that requires further understanding, and does the Committee not accept the will as the official expression of Mr Lee's last wishes?",2,803,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00803
2017-07-03-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Secondly, there may be a conflict between the role of the Ministerial Committee and the process and powers set out in section 11 of the Preservation of Monuments Act. Section 11 states that ""the Minister may, after consulting the Board, make a preservation order to place any monument under the protection of the Board."" The Board here refers to the National Heritage Board. There is no provision in this piece of legislation about taking advice from the Ministerial Committee. How will evidence gathered and decisions taken by the Committee influence the processes set out in section 11? Would the Minister and the NHB be in any way bound by opinions or findings by the Committee? At this point, is NHB also concurrently studying about whether to preserve the house? If the plan is to conserve the area, then, similarly, section 9 of the Planning Act states, ""Where in the opinion of the Minister any area is of special architectural, historic, traditional or aesthetic interest, the Minister may approve under section 8 a proposal to amend the Master Plan to designate the area as a conservation area."" There is no mention of the role of a Ministerial Committee here in this piece of legislation as well.",3,804,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00804
2017-07-03-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thirdly, as explained earlier, I understand the Committee is studying and listing options. But would not the factors this Committee is using − factors including public sentiments − change in the future? What then is the point of setting up this Committee now and making recommendations now? Things would definitely change in two to three decades. Family members' views might change as well.",4,805,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00805
2017-07-03-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Fourth, can Prime Minister clarify under what circumstances are Ministerial Committees convened? Are there written rules and procedures governing the setting up and functions of such committees?",5,806,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00806
2017-07-03-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Lastly, can Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Minister clarify whether the same emphasis was placed on other important buildings like the National Library? There has been much talk on social media about this, and I suppose the question really is, how do we decide what to preserve or conserve and when do we set up Ministerial Committees for these decisions. Minister Lawrence Wong spoke about this earlier, but can I confirm if Ministerial Committees were set up for previous important buildings as well?",6,807,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00807
2017-07-03-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Beyond all these questions, I appreciate that this is not an easy issue to resolve and definitely not one with straightforward answers. The community is divided in their views. Last Friday night, I had two meetings and this issue was brought up in our conversations in both meetings. At the first meeting, the consensus was to demolish. The second meeting, the consensus was not to demolish. They did not support demolishing the house as they felt we have so little heritage left in Singapore that we should preserve or conserve whatever heritage we have left.",7,808,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00808
2017-07-03-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Ultimately, it is easy to understand why we should demolish. It was part of Mr Lee's will. It is perhaps harder to understand why we should not demolish, and can Deputy Prime Minister take this opportunity to further explain and provide details on what exactly is the heritage value and why an option to preserve or conserve the house should be considered.",8,809,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00809
2017-07-03-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In conclusion, Madam, whatever decision we make or options we list, the key is to continue to be transparent about it, and perhaps the most important part is to also be transparent about the process of making the decision or options. It really is not an easy issue to resolve and, as such, I hope, like many Members of this House have suggested, that we set up a Select Committee to look into this and find a way forward.",9,810,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00810
2017-07-03-T-012,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Madam, I am not here today to debate on how the last will of Mr Lee Kuan Yew was made or who drafted it. I am not even bothered why the current owner of 38 Oxley Road would want it demolished as soon as possible. These are really none of my business. These are private matters for the Prime Minister to settle with his siblings and they do not concern the state.",1,811,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00811
2017-07-03-T-012,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I was not a bit affected by this issue until when other Ministers started to weigh in on the matters. The whole episode then took a cringing turn, and allegations of abuse of power began to flow in. That is when the real embarrassment starts. Why are Ministers taking sides in a private dispute on a house that is still legally in the hands of a private individual?",2,812,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00812
2017-07-03-T-012,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"In recent statements made by Ministers on social media, the fate of 38 Oxley Road seems to hinge on whether the house should be demolished completely according to the will of Mr Lee Kuan Yew or preserved, in whole or in part, as a political heritage. One can easily infer from the tone set by these Ministers that the Government is tending towards the latter option, and that, sadly, will drag the Government into the picture to decide on the fate of 38 Oxley Road, in the guise of public interest. Madam, if this Government had had not the slightest interest to take side and form a secret committee to explore other options for the house in the first place, none of these would have happened.",3,813,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00813
2017-07-03-T-012,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Some Ministers seemed to allude to the sanctity of the house from a historical context and that it deserves preservation. Some Ministers had commented that many important meetings and critical decisions on the future of Singapore took place at 38 Oxley Road. While that is not a far-fetched statement since it is the birthplace of the only ruling political party in Singapore since 1965, what other roles did the house play in our march from Third World to First? What official and history-making decisions and declarations affecting Singapore were made in the basement of this house, other than it had always been the private abode of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mdm Kwa Geok Choo? Did the Cabinet of the day hold its first post-1965 meeting at Oxley Road? Did the Cabinet meet regularly at the house rather than at the old Parliament House or Istana?",4,814,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00814
2017-07-03-T-012,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"One thing is very clear to me − a political party was founded in the basement dining room of 38 Oxley Road, not modern Singapore. Modern Singapore was thrust into existence, not by its own free will, on 9 August 1965, under circumstances that are well documented in our history books, and 38 Oxley Road hardly gets a memorable mention anywhere. As the Prime Minister has said earlier, this is just an old house.",5,815,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00815
2017-07-03-T-012,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Thirty-eight Oxley Road probably holds so much intimate and private memories for Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mdm Kwa Geok Choo that none of us in this Chamber, maybe with the exception of the Prime Minister, should even attempt to try to understand or question why they would want their house to be demolished immediately after they are gone. From the accounts given by the Prime Minister today, the fate of the house is really a family matter and it should not be outsourced to the Government to decide.",6,816,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00816
2017-07-03-T-012,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I wish to put on record that I do not support the effort or intention of the Government to gazette 38 Oxley Road for whatever reasons. A reported poll on 23 December 2015 indicated that 77% of the people said they would want to see Mr Lee Kuan Yew's wish for the house to be carried out, although I am of the opinion that such a poll is not even necessary, as this is a completely private matter for the immediate family members to sort out.",7,817,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00817
2017-07-03-T-012,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Even if the balance of the fate of the house is tending towards preservation in the name of public interest, and the Prime Minister recuses himself in this matter, the buck still stops with him. Surely, the Prime Minister is not a lame-duck commander-in-chief in this matter. He has the power to have the final say, take the whole matter off the Government's hand and resolve it privately or in court as he should. The surviving members of the Lee family should not outsource this decision to the Government or any secret committee.",8,818,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00818
2017-07-03-T-012,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Madam, what is more troubling about this private saga is found in the statement released by Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling in the wee hours of 14 June 2017. The statement contains disturbing revelations and undisclosed facts and allegations of abuse of powers.",9,819,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00819
2017-07-03-T-012,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"As highlighted by Ms Sylvia Lim, Singaporeans woke up in the morning to find out that our newly-appointed Attorney General, Mr Lucien Wong, was also the personal lawyer of the Prime Minister previously. The fact that the Prime Minister and our current AG had a commercial relationship was never publicly disclosed until now. How long has Mr Wong been the personal lawyer for the Prime Minister? While such a relationship may not allude to anything, a personal and commercial relation between the Prime Minister and appointed AG should be publicly disclosed in the name of transparency. When I sought the advice of someone from the charity sector about mundane disclosure, this person said, when in doubt, more disclosure is better than less. So err on the safe side.

Lee Kuan Yew was Prime Minister from 1959 to 1990. During those many years, his wife (our mother) consistently avoided the limelight, remaining his stalwart supporter and advisor in private. She lived discreetly, and set a high bar for the conduct of a Prime Minister's wife. She would never instruct Permanent Secretaries or senior civil servants. The contrast between her and Ho Ching could not be more stark. While Ho Ching holds no elected or official position in government, her influence is pervasive, and extends well beyond her job purview.""",12,822,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00822

The Prime Minister has said that it is the duty of the Minister to correct any abuse of power committed by their family members. Nonetheless, these safeguards should be spelt out clearly so that the core values of the Civil Service would not be compromised. Surely, family members of Ministers and political appointees cannot act with impunity just because they are private individuals and the code of conduct only applies to public officer holders.",15,825,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00825

So, what official role does the wife of the Prime Minister have in government that would allow her to act as a contact person for PMO?

Like me, my residents are not legally trained. People ask, how does the Ministerial Committee fit in with a layperson's understanding of due process? This needs to be explained thoroughly because the rule of law is not just about due process. It is about public confidence in that process − confidence that the rule of law applies, and is applied equally.

This genesis or heritage story that we have is at the heart of what is going on right now.

If heritage is so important to Singaporeans, and I am sure it is, from everything that we see, from all accounts, then that is the greater debate.

The proper forum to challenge a will and raise these issues would be in Court. Prime Minister, you had decided not to pursue this matter in Court. A fight in Court, especially between family members, can be emotionally draining and damaging to the relationship. So, while your reluctance to contest the Grant of Probate and your initial decision not to challenge the will is understandable, there are therefore now questions raised about the appropriateness to now raise these issues before the Ministerial Committee. As the Grant of Probate has been granted and there is no challenge, the will should be taken as valid and proper. You had however in your statutory declaration submitted to the Ministerial Committee alluding to certain questionable circumstances upon which the will was executed. This may appear to be a ""backdoor"" approach in challenging the validity of the will. Could you therefore clarify why you found it necessary to affirm the statutory declaration and your intentions in doing so?

The much-quoted demolition clause has two parts; the first part expresses the late Mr and Mrs Lee's wish that the house at 38 Oxley Road be demolished.

If not, then let us move on.",13,933,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00933
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"It is my view that this should not be the way to deal with these allegations.

What are you afraid of?",15,935,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00935

2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),Deputy Prime Minister Teo said that the Ministerial Committee on 38 Oxley Road was convened to explore options. There is an established process for gazetting a building as a national monument or some equivalent of that. Why were the established channels not used in this case? I believe other MPs have spoken about this as well.,17,937,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00937
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Now, it might be argued that perhaps this case is not like others, because deference needs to be shown to the wishes of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.",18,938,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00938
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"However, if that is the stance of the Government, why was a non-transparent Ministerial Committee chosen as the right organisational form for resolving this? Why not some kind of independent panel with the expertise and resources to perform expert heritage analysis and public opinion sensing? A panel that would not be seen by anyone as potentially compromised by the fact that its members directly report to an individual who has personal ties to the matter at hand.",19,939,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00939
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Even more importantly, the Ministerial Committee seems to have focused primarily on revisiting the issue of the wishes of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew as expressed in his last will. I believe several Members have spoken about this already. The Committee wrote to Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling on this question and asked if they would file statutory declarations on the same. The Cabinet Secretary made a statement on this. The Prime Minister released portions of his statutory declaration relating to this. Senior Minister of State for Law Ms Indranee Rajah released several Facebook posts on this.",20,940,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00940
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Surely, the proper platform to challenge the late Mr Lee's will would have been in Court. In fact, other than revisiting the issue of what the late Mr Lee wanted, there would appear to be little evidence available to date of any other work done by the Ministerial Committee in respect of work streams as such as heritage impact assessment, public opinion sensing and so on.",21,941,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00941
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),Why did the Ministerial Committee and other PAP politicians focus so much on the issue of what the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew wanted? Why was the machinery of Government applied to take up a position on a private family matter of a will which had never been litigated in Court? Is opening questions about the late Mr Lee's will without going to the Courts the legitimate business for the Government of Singapore as opposed to being merely a legitimate concern for one individual member of that Government in his individual capacity?,22,942,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00942
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In the past, the process of independent fact-finding favoured by members of the PAP was suing for defamation in Court and that is certainly one way to resolve this matter definitively. My colleague MP Pritam Singh has eloquently argued for an additional method which is a Parliamentary Select Committee, a call to which I agree and a call to which I think several other Members have also expressed some degree of support today.",23,943,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00943
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Such a Committee would have the advantage of leading a process that could determine the facts and recommend follow-up action to Parliament. The follow-up action could relate to the incidents at hand and it could also relate to systemic changes the Committee may propose to curtail the ability of future office holders to abuse their powers or to clarify any grey areas in the current rules that may have enabled this unfortunate series of events to occur, to prevent their recurrence.",24,944,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00944
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The Committee's independence would be under-scored by the presence of non-PAP MPs on the Committee. In fact, in his message on 19 June, the Prime Minister specifically highlighted that non-PAP MPs would be able to question him in Parliament today. A Parliamentary Select Committee merely builds on that institutional recipe of multi-partisanship that the Prime Minister himself positively alluded to, but extends it to include a process of fact-finding involving public hearings and cross-examination of the individuals who have laid these issues before the nation, together with other persons of interest.",25,945,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00945
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The truth would out. If the claims are baseless, the accusers will lose credibility in a very public way. If there is a basis to their claims, that can be acknowledged and followed up. I would note on this point that several Members of the House today have posed questions quite literally to Mr Lee Hsien Yang. How do we envisage Mr Lee Hsien Yang is meant to properly and in an institutional form respond to these questions that have been posed and asked today and he is not here to respond to them?",26,946,2017-07-03-T-012-S-00946
2017-07-03-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore is strengthened, not weakened when we follow a rigorous, independent process to deal with such allegations.

On what to do with the house in the future, the Committee is studying a range of options. What is so wrong about that?",1,952,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00952
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Deputy Prime Minister Teo has said that he personally would not support options at either end of the range. At the one end, preserving the house for visitors to enter and see, which would be totally against the wishes of Mr and Mrs Lee. On the other hand, demolishing the house, and putting the property on the market for new private residences.",2,953,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00953
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Initially, Mr Lee Hsien Yang said, he had ""not thought beyond demolition"". If that is true, he could not have ruled out re-development. Then, he later said that before the Ministerial Committee was formed, he had offered a memorial garden. So, it appears that he had thought beyond demolition, earlier. He did not make it clear if a garden is still his position now.",3,954,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00954
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"After I pointed out the four possible options for the property, including the fact that demolition clears the way to appeal for re-development, Mr Lee Hsien Yang now says that he has no ""inclination"" to develop the house for profit. ""Inclination"" is a word that leaves a lot of room for change of mind.",4,955,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00955
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Why is he being so careful? If he changes his mind, then the land is potentially worth a lot. Why does Mr Lee Hsien Yang not just rule it out categorically?",5,956,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00956
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"But let us take his statement at face value and see what else Mr Lee Hsien Yang said on Saturday. His exact words were ""preservation of the house would be trampling on Mr Lee Kuan Yew's values, and it would be an affront to these same values to develop a luxury ""LKY"" condominium"". Well, is not that exactly the same thing that Deputy Prime Minister Teo had said, leaving aside the bit about values? In other words, no total preservation and no development?",6,957,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00957
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"If that is the case and if he is saying exactly the same thing as Deputy Prime Minister Teo, where is the dispute? Both agree that the extreme ends of the range are out. So, if the Ministerial Committee is studying the intermediate options within the range, what is wrong with that? Nothing has been decided. How can studying these options be an abuse?",7,958,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00958

Each party was given the opportunity to comment on the other side's views, as is only fair. You cannot hear one side without hearing the other.

2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"And so we come back to the key point. What is this dispute really about? The Ministerial Committee is not making any decisions. It is putting up a range of options for Cabinet to look at. Nothing needs to be decided now. Indeed, nothing can be decided now as Dr Lee is still living in the house. That might take 20 to 30 years. Therefore, the house cannot be the reason for the dispute.",42,993,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00993
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The trigger for all the allegations by Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee appear to be something else. Whatever it is, there is no reason to drag Singapore and Singaporeans through this dispute. That is contrary to Mr Lee Kuan Yew's values.",43,994,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00994
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Leon Perera gave the analogy of a company and its shareholders and he asked why the whistle-blowers are not being interrogated by the CPIB. That is the wrong analogy. If something is really wrong, then the correct thing for the whistle-blowers to do is to go to CPIB and file a report. That is the way it should be done if you think that there is something wrong. Or if anyone else thinks that something is wrong, you can file and lodge a formal report. The CPIB cannot be expected to look into unsubstantiated allegations.",44,995,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00995

2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"So, what do we have at the end of the day? At the end of today, we have had one full day of debate. Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling have made plenty of allegations, but we have not seen any substance and no evidence. In Parliament, no one has said that there is any evidence of abuse. I am sure that the MPs have all looked carefully through the allegations. In fact, Mr Low himself, had said that the siblings had presented no evidence.",46,997,2017-07-03-T-014-S-00997

2017-07-03-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have three clarifications for the Senior Minister of State. First, she told the House that the AG and the Deputy AG have been observing the conflict rules in their functions. I would like to ask her categorically whether she is saying that the AG and the Deputy AG Mr Hri Kumar are not involved in advising the Government on matters concerning the Lee estate.",1,1000,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01000
2017-07-03-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The second clarification is, she mentioned the fact that there have been friends of Ministers who have been appointed to various Organs of State and I think she mentioned the Judiciary is one of them. Does she not agree that for the AGC, what we are faced now with is not the Judiciary where there is security of tenure where Judges are appointed and secured until age 65, but we have an AG now who is on a short-term contract − three years? That puts a very different complexion on things.",2,1001,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01001
2017-07-03-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The third clarification is, does she agree or not agree that it is desirable to have distance between the AGC leadership and the Government which was what was believed by some former Ministers including Prof Jayakumar or have standards changed?",3,1002,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01002
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"On the first question, the short answer is that the Attorney-General and the Deputy Attorney-General are not advising the Government on any matters in which they have previously been involved. In other words, whatever it is that they may, in private practice, have advised people on, when they come into the AGC and if it impacts onto those areas, then they would not advise on it.",1,1003,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01003
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, if your question is, for example, is Mr Lucien Wong advising the Ministerial Committee on 38 Oxley Road, the answer is no. For the very simple reason that in AGC, there are other officers.",2,1004,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01004
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, this is not a difficult thing. All lawyers know this. If you had acted on something, and you happen to change organisation or go somewhere else, and there is a conflict, you recuse yourself. It is very simple. It is not a difficult thing to do, and lawyers do it in practice all the time. The Attorney-General and the Deputy Attorney-General are observing these rules. I can assure Ms Sylvia Lim that the rules of conflict are being observed.",3,1005,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01005
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"On the other point, Ms Sylvia Lim said it is different from the Bench where there is security of tenure but in AGC there is no security of tenure which puts a different complexion on things. It does not put a different complexion on things. All lawyers, good lawyers, understand their duty, which is simply this  if you are in a position of conflict, you do not act, you recuse yourself.",4,1006,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01006
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"And, as to whether it is desirable to have distance, the correct question really is, the officers of AGC, do they act independently? In other words, if there is a conflict, do they stand aside? Do they apply their minds to this without fear or favour? Do they do their duty? And the answer to those questions is, yes, they do act independently, they apply their minds and they carry out their duties without fear or favour. So, in short, the officers in the AGC − whether it is the Attorney-General, the Deputy Attorney-General or anyone down along the line − all observe proper rules of conduct.",5,1007,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01007

2017-07-03-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Sir. Two follow-up clarifications for Senior Minister of State. Is she saying that the Deputy AG, because he may not have acted on the Lee estate in some capacity in private estate, is now free to advise the Government on such matters, from the Government's perspective? Is that what she is saying?",1,1009,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01009
2017-07-03-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The second clarification is, she did not answer directly. She said I asked the wrong question about whether there should be distance between the AGC and the Government because the critical question to her was the officers act professionally and independently. But this is really quite a different take for even Prof Jayakumar. If you read what his interview goes into, he says that he may occasionally have working lunches with the AG but it is important to have the appearance of distance. You cannot get too close to these people because people might assume that there will be some compromise. So, I think it is the appearance itself that is important, not just in fact whether people think they are able to act independently. The appearance when you are too close to somebody, it does not create a good feeling.",2,1010,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01010
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have already answered the question. If there is any matter on which the Attorney-General or the Deputy Attorney-General have acted on when they were in private practice and if that same matter comes up when they are in AGC, they obviously cannot advise the Government on it and they will not do so.",1,1011,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01011
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"With respect to the other matters, I have already explained. There have been instances before when either the Attorney-General or Judges may have been close friends with Ministers or anyone else, but that has not deterred them from doing their duty. I understand what Ms Lim is saying. She is saying − actual conflict and, sort of, appearances. In terms of any actual conflict, I have already stated the position quite clearly. They know their duty and they will carry out their duty. They will not act where there is any conflict of interest.",2,1012,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01012
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"And as far as appearances go, if she has any specific allegation of that, please highlight it. Because as far as I can see, there has been no form of impropriety, appearance or otherwise.",3,1013,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01013
2017-07-03-T-014,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"May I remind Members that we are not debating on the role of the AG or the deputy AG. So, please confine your clarifications to matters which Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah has said. Mr Low Thia Khiang.",1,1014,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01014
2017-07-03-T-014,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. First of all, the Senior Minister of State seems to suggest that I said there is no evidence. That is what she said. I said scattered evidence.",1,1015,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01015
2017-07-03-T-014,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Secondly, on the conflict of interest, it seems to me she said that so long as there is a conflict, you stand aside. But the question then is, how would the member of public or anyone else, whether in such a particular case − I mean, the AG stands aside, or does he not stand aside? Thereby, my question is, important appointments like such, even Minister for Law or senior judges and so on, the public perception of its independence and impartiality is important. Is it not important or is it important?",2,1016,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01016
2017-07-03-T-014,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Next, if there is a question of doubt, then what should the Government do?",3,1017,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01017
2017-07-03-T-014,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Next, a point of clarification, actually, on a point of order that I wish to clarify with the Deputy Speaker. I heard the Senior Minister of State's speech earlier on. She seems to be attacking Lee Hsien Yang and imputing some character or motive. He is not here in the House to answer. Is that against Standing Order?",4,1018,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01018

2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,The second question?,1,1020,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01020
2017-07-03-T-014,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,That Mr Low has said that you were saying something against Mr Lee Hsien Yang.,1,1021,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01021
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Low must be mistaken. All I did was point out that there were certain allegations made against the Government. I stated our position on that. And there is nothing at all that prevents Mr Lee Hsien Yang from responding if he wishes to, publicly. All I am doing is stating the Government's position on various issues.",1,1022,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01022
2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"On the second part, on appointments, as I had said earlier, when the Attorney-General was appointed, the Prime Minister consulted the Chief Justice, he consulted the Chairman of the Public Service Commission, as well as the incumbent Attorney-General on the appointment. Due process was observed and there is absolutely nothing wrong with the current appointment of the Attorney-General.",2,1023,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01023

2017-07-03-T-014,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Indeed, it is only Mr Low and Ms Sylvia Lim who keep raising this issue. There is no basis for any concern that the Attorney-General has not acted in a manner that is entirely proper.",4,1025,2017-07-03-T-014-S-01025

2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"All high-rise buildings are required to have additional fire safety provisions such as fire lifts. SCDF defines high-rise buildings as those that are above 24 metres in height, which is about 8 to 10 storeys tall. This is similar to the definition used by the United States’ National Fire Protection Association.",8,1060,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01060
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Super high-rise residential buildings that exceed 40 storeys in height require at least one refuge floor for every 20 storeys. These refuge floors have to be fire resistant for at least two hours and serve as a temporary holding space for evacuees during a fire incident while the firefighters put out the fire.,9,1061,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01061
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"SCDF conducts weekly fire-fighting and rescue exercises for high-rise non-residential buildings, in addition to other exercises at different locations throughout the year. The simulated scenarios allow SCDF officers to familiarise themselves with the various high-rise premises, as well as to validate response plans and procedures.",10,1062,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01062
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about SCDF's plans to ensure occupant safety in older high-rise buildings. SCDF strictly enforces the Fire Code, and carries out regular reviews to ensure that the standard of fire safety in buildings keep pace with developments in the building industry and technological advancements in fire protection systems. SCDF also issues circulars to the industry on amendments to the Fire Code pertaining to new fire safety requirements.",11,1063,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01063
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Claddings were not commonly used till the 1980s. Notwithstanding this, since the introduction of the Fire Code in 1974, all buildings have been required to only use claddings of Class ‘0’ standard. All old buildings built with non-compliant cladding would have to comply with the prevailing Fire Code once they carried out alterations and additions works. All HDB residential blocks built in the 1970s also do not use such claddings. In addition, the construction and upgrading works of all HDB residential blocks would have to comply with prevailing fire safety requirements.",12,1064,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01064
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Nonetheless, for old buildings that were constructed before 1974 and have not undergone any upgrading works over the years which would have required them to meet prevailing fire safety requirements, MHA and SCDF are reviewing legislative amendments to require some of these old buildings to perform fire safety upgrades. In doing so, we will adopt a balanced, risk-based approach.",13,1065,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01065
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Beyond fire safety regulations, Mr Zainal Sapari and Ms Sun Xueling also asked about evacuation procedures for residential buildings. SCDF has stipulated robust fire safety measures for residential buildings. Every residential unit is designed as a fire compartment, and required by the Fire Code to be equipped with fire-rated entrance doors, walls and floors that help to prevent the spread of fire beyond the unit.",14,1066,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01066
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As opposed to large non-residential buildings such as shopping centres and offices, residents would be familiar with the layout of their own homes and buildings. Hence, the carrying out of fire drills is not mandatory for residential buildings. In the event of a fire, residents should close the door of the affected room to contain the fire and evacuate to safety.",15,1067,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01067
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"When SCDF arrives at the scene, SCDF will prioritise evacuation of occupants on the floors affected by fire, as well as those on the two floors above floors affected. If necessary, SCDF may proceed with subsequent evacuation of occupants on additional floors of the building. Residents in unaffected floors will be advised to stay in their respective units, each of which is a fire compartment. Such an approach will minimise injuries or mishaps resulting from the evacuation process.",16,1068,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01068
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"SCDF actively engages the community to raise their awareness on fire safety procedures, through platforms such as Emergency Preparedness block parties and Emergency Preparedness Days organised across various heartland communities. At such events, residents are taught how to evacuate from a smoke-logged room and extinguish small household fires. We urge everyone to actively participate in such events, to pick up important basic fire safety skills.",17,1069,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01069
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For businesses, SCDF and the National Fire and Civil Emergency Preparedness Council (NFEC) have been organising various fire safety workshops and seminars for members of the Company Emergency Response Team (CERT), security officers, employees and trade associations. During these seminars, participants learn about good fire safety practices and also receive practical tips on emergency response skills.",18,1070,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01070
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Singapore has a high standard of fire safety. The number of fire fatalities per 100,000 population is among the lowest in the world.1 This is because we take a multi- pronged approach to fire safety. But every single fatality is simply one too many. Therefore, SCDF strictly enforces, and constantly reviews, the Fire Code to ensure the safety of occupants in buildings, as well as conducts outreach and education efforts so that our citizens are well prepared to respond in the event of a fire.",19,1071,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01071
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But we cannot afford to be complacent, because everyone has a part to play in ensuring fire safety. From time to time, SCDF uncovers fires that start or spread due to building owners or occupants breaching the Fire Code, such as failing to maintain fire-fighting equipment or ensuring that exits are not obstructed. SCDF will take firm action in such instances. In some cases, fires were also caused by carelessness, such as unattended cooking in households. In recent years, SCDF has also seen an increase in the number of fires involving the charging of batteries of electric bicycles and personal mobility devices such as hoverboards. Users of such products should use only approved power adaptors that carry the SAFETY Mark, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions on how to charge the devices properly. We have also heard anecdotal stories of building owners and occupants taking fire evacuation drills lightly.",20,1072,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01072
2017-07-03-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"SCDF will do its part and take its regulatory and fire-fighting responsibilities seriously, but so should all of us.",21,1073,2017-07-03-T-019-S-01073
2017-07-03-T-020,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,asked the Minister for Finance what is the benchmark set by the Government's investment mandate for the annualised 20-year real rate of return for GIC and Temasek Holdings.,1,1074,2017-07-03-T-020-S-01074
2017-07-03-T-020,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The Government's assessment of the long-term performance of GIC and Temasek goes beyond using one single benchmark. The Government takes into account a number of factors including the entities' distinct roles, risk exposure and underlying market and investment trends to make a considered and comprehensive assessment of the entities’ performance. Let me elaborate, starting with GIC.",1,1075,2017-07-03-T-020-S-01075
2017-07-03-T-020,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"GIC is the Government’s fund manager. Its mandate is to achieve good long-term returns above global inflation, to preserve and enhance the international purchasing power of Singapore’s reserves.",2,1076,2017-07-03-T-020-S-01076
2017-07-03-T-020,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,GIC invests in a globally diversified portfolio spread across various assets classes. Its portfolio is constructed to take into account a range of possible economic scenarios.,3,1077,2017-07-03-T-020-S-01077
2017-07-03-T-020,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The construction of GIC's portfolio is subject to the Government's risk preference, which is expressed through a Reference Portfolio made up of 65% global equities and 35% global bonds. This is not a benchmark, but an expression of the risk that Government is prepared for GIC to take in its long-term investment strategies.",4,1078,2017-07-03-T-020-S-01078
2017-07-03-T-020,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On occasion, there may be a difference between the risk exposure of GIC and the reference portfolio. Such an adjustment allows GIC to lower its risk exposure, in times of market exuberance. Conversely, GIC may also increase its risk exposure when the opportunity arises. This is part of a disciplined, professional approach to long term value investing. In recent years GIC has been concerned with heightened-valuations in financial markets and has shifted towards a slightly more conservative portfolio mix to guard against rising volatility.",5,1079,2017-07-03-T-020-S-01079
2017-07-03-T-020,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Therefore, we evaluate GIC's long-term investment performance, not only based on its rolling 20-year rates of return, but also the risk it has had to take in order to achieve these returns. Such comparisons are available in GIC's annual report.",6,1080,2017-07-03-T-020-S-01080
2017-07-03-T-020,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Let me now move on to Temasek. Temasek is not a fund manager, but an investment company that owns its assets.

2017-07-03-T-020,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"One measure that the Government looks at is Temasek's long term Total Shareholder Returns or TSR, which measures annual changes to its net portfolio value after adjusting for any capital injections or dividends paid. The TSR must be viewed in the context of Temasek's risk-adjusted hurdle rate, which is a weighted average of the risk-adjusted cost of capital of all its investments. Temasek's risk-adjusted hurdle rate is published in its annual report.",8,1082,2017-07-03-T-020-S-01082

2017-07-03-T-021,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,asked ask the Minister for Finance what is the impact of GIC's reduced stake in UBS on the performance of the Government's investment portfolio in terms of annualised rate of return for five-year and ten-year time periods respectively and how much is the realised loss of the UBS divestment.,1,1086,2017-07-03-T-021-S-01086
2017-07-03-T-021,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"GIC's performance over five- and 10-year periods are published annually by GIC on its website. These figures reflect in aggregate, both realised and unrealised gains and losses of all investments, including UBS. Hence, the reduction of GIC's stake in UBS does not in itself change these figures. It only changed unrealised losses, which were already reflected in the performance figures, to realised losses.",1,1087,2017-07-03-T-021-S-01087
2017-07-03-T-021,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Png had asked what the realised loss of the UBS divestment was. It is not the Government’s policy to discuss details of specific investment transactions. I would like to reiterate that the investment performance of GIC should not be evaluated based on any single transaction. Rather, the Government’s focus is on GIC's performance on an overall portfolio basis, over the long term. While it is disappointing that the UBS deal did not turn out as expected, investing is about taking calculated risks in anticipation of returns. Some returns may materialise, some may not. It is not realistic to avoid any loss for every investment as that would require GIC to be completely risk averse.",2,1088,2017-07-03-T-021-S-01088
2017-07-03-T-021,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"What is more important and relevant is that the overall portfolio delivers creditable long term returns over and above inflation.

2017-07-03-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"One of the common feedback received is on noise nuisance. For such cases, HDB will inform flat owners of the complaint and advise them to remind their subtenants to be considerate. In most cases, the flat owners will resolve the matter quickly.

2017-07-03-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Singaporeans enjoy a significant housing subsidy when they buy a new flat from HDB, or a resale flat in the open market with a CPF housing grant. They can also buy a second new flat from HDB, but as second-timers, they are no longer eligible for the full subsidy which is meant for first-timers only. Hence the resale levy is imposed on all second-time buyers of HDB flats.",1,1094,2017-07-03-T-023-S-01094
2017-07-03-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Under the current resale levy policy which has been in place since March 2006, second-timers pay the resale levy upon the sale of the first subsidised flat or the collection of keys to the second flat, whichever is the later.

2017-07-03-T-039,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But as SkillsFuture is also an inclusive movement, there are over 650 private training providers that are part of the SkillsFuture Credit scheme. For these, competition between the training providers helps to keep a check on course fees. In addition, SSG scrutinises the proposed course fees using industry benchmarks to ensure they are reasonable when compared with other similar courses.",4,1186,2017-07-03-T-039-S-01186
2017-07-03-T-039,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"SSG will also enforce against any practice of profiteering.

2017-07-03-T-041,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"While there is no formal inter-ministerial committee to oversee the efforts to educate smokers on smoking hazards, MOH works closely with relevant government agencies and educational institutions to educate Singaporeans on the health risks of tobacco use and to help smokers quit smoking.",1,1194,2017-07-03-T-041-S-01194
2017-07-03-T-041,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For example, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) works closely with the Ministry of Education and Institutes of Higher Learning to incorporate anti-tobacco messages into the schools' curriculum and co-curricular activities. This is to raise awareness about the benefits of leading a tobacco-free lifestyle and to inform youths on the harms of tobacco smoking. In addition, Student Health Advisors are deployed to some schools to provide support and counselling to students on health issues, including smoking cessation counselling. HPB also organises interactive programmes, such as skits and workshops to discourage experimentation with tobacco products and teach students ways to refuse offers to smoke. Our outreach efforts have reached out to about 50,000 students in 2016.",2,1195,2017-07-03-T-041-S-01195

HPB also works closely with the Ministry of Defence on smoking cessation workshops to educate SAF servicemen on the harmful effects of smoking and encourage them to quit smoking. Smokers can call HPB's QuitLine or access online resources, such as the HPB HealthHub portal, for additional support to quit smoking. In 2016, these programmes reached more than 16,000 smokers.",3,1196,2017-07-03-T-041-S-01196

2017-07-03-T-042,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With the enactment of the Liquor Control Act in 2015, we have taken significant steps to control the supply and consumption of liquor in public places to mitigate public disorder and disamenities caused by public drunkenness. We have restricted the sale of alcohol at retail outlets and consumption of liquor in public places to 7 am to 10.30 pm daily. Stricter hours are imposed in the designated liquor control zones in Little India and Geylang.",1,1200,2017-07-03-T-042-S-01200
2017-07-03-T-042,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The result is positive. There is an island-wide decline of public order incidents related to liquor consumption, from 251 cases in 2014 to 135 cases in 2016. This includes offences like rioting, affray and serious hurt.",2,1201,2017-07-03-T-042-S-01201
2017-07-03-T-042,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We therefore see no need to set up Government-run liquor retail stores and to only allow such stores to sell liquor.

2017-07-03-T-043,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the average cost of building a multi-storey car park and surface car park respectively; (b) what is the monthly maintenance charge for a car park; and (c) what is the average subsidy for each car park if the monthly parking charge is insufficient to cover the replacement and maintenance cost.,1,1204,2017-07-03-T-043-S-01204
2017-07-03-T-043,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Construction costs vary for different car parks built over the years as they depend on factors such as the prevailing cost of construction materials and site-specific constraints. In general, it costs about three to five times more to build a multi-storey car park compared to a surface car park, on a per lot basis.",1,1205,2017-07-03-T-043-S-01205
2017-07-03-T-043,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On average, general maintenance, improvement and repair costs take up about 20% of yearly car park expenditure. However, parking charges do not cover only maintenance costs ? the bulk of expenditure for HDB car parks comes from building works as well as other operating costs such as car park management and enforcement. The total costs of building, operating and maintaining car parks have increased over the years, because of rising overheads in the construction industry, more capital expenditures for new and existing car parks, and additional repair works required to maintain an increasing number of ageing car parks.",2,1206,2017-07-03-T-043-S-01206
2017-07-03-T-043,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Last year, we estimated that without any increase in car park charges, HDB would incur a deficit of around $100 million annually in the coming years.

2017-07-03-T-044,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB design planning considers factors that affect the long-term cost of building exterior upkeep, including (i) accessibility of building features such as beams and ledges where high-rise litter may accumulate (ii) the number of such features in any given HDB block; and (b) whether such features have been incorporated for cosmetic versus structural integrity considerations.",1,1208,2017-07-03-T-044-S-01208
2017-07-03-T-044,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The accessibility and ease of maintenance of common areas, including exterior features, are key aspects that HDB considers in the design of its buildings.",1,1209,2017-07-03-T-044-S-01209
2017-07-03-T-044,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"External features such as ledges and beams are provided for a functional purpose. Concrete ledges or canopies are provided above windows to provide shade and protect flats from rain. For instance, without such canopies, rain water flowing down the building faأ§ade may enter the flats if the windows are open or not closed tightly. As for beams, external tie beams are required in some projects to ensure the structural robustness and stability of the building.",2,1210,2017-07-03-T-044-S-01210
2017-07-03-T-044,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Design-wise, HDB generally ensures that canopies are gently sloped to allow water discharge. In addition, the use of tie beams is minimised, and these are only deployed where necessary.",3,1211,2017-07-03-T-044-S-01211
2017-07-03-T-044,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"If a lot of high-rise litter is thrown by residents, it will inevitably accumulate on external ledges and beams.

Singaporean children have access to a range of government benefits that support their growth and development, regardless of their parent’s marital status. These include the Medisave grant for newborns, infant care and childcare subsidies and the foreign domestic worker levy concession. In addition, all Singaporean children have access to social assistance, education and healthcare subsidies.",2,1215,2017-07-03-T-045-S-01215
2017-07-03-T-045,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Last year, we reviewed and extended the Child Development Account, or CDA benefits to children born from 1 September 2016 to unwed parents. Unwed mothers of children born from 1 January 2017 are also now eligible for Government-Paid Maternity Leave. These benefits will support the child’s developmental needs, and the parent’s efforts to care and provide for the child. We also introduced the KidSTART programme last year, which will proactively identify low-income and vulnerable children aged six and below. These may include children of unwed parents. KidSTART will help to provide them with early access to health, learning and development support, and monitor their progress during their early years.",3,1216,2017-07-03-T-045-S-01216
2017-07-03-T-045,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Benefits such as the Baby Bonus cash gift and housing benefits are meant to encourage parenthood within marriage, which is the desired and prevailing social norm in Singapore.

2017-07-03-T-045,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Unwed mothers do adopt their own children, but for personal reasons. Our law places the child's welfare and interests at the heart of an adoption decision. We must not forget that such an adoption is a life-changing event because when an unwed mother adopts her child, the duties, obligations and liabilities of the biological father are terminated. In other words, there is no longer a parental relationship between the child and his or her biological father. The child would also not be able to seek maintenance from the father under the Women's Charter. An unwed mother who intends to adopt her own child may wish to seek legal advice to fully understand the implications of an adoption order.",5,1218,2017-07-03-T-045-S-01218

2017-07-03-T-046,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition to the monthly cleaning of the compactors by the public waste collectors, all premises owners are responsible under the Environmental Public Health (Public Cleansing) Regulations for ensuring that their refuse bin centres are kept in a clean and sanitary condition and in good repair. For example, most Town Council cleaners practise daily cleaning of the external surfaces of the compactors. In addition, the cleaning contractors of all hawker centres owned by my Ministry are contractually required to clean the refuse bin centres daily. Similar arrangements are also adopted by the Town Councils for hawker centres owned by the Housing and Development Board.",2,1221,2017-07-03-T-046-S-01221

2017-07-03-T-048,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The key condition for the Government to provide such a covered linkway from the gate of the condominium to a major public transport node, is that the condominium must provide a sheltered route within its compound from the residential blocks to the gate. This ensures a seamless, sheltered connection the entire way. It would not make sense for the Government to fund a covered linkway from the gate, if the walk inside the condominium is exposed to the weather anyway.",2,1231,2017-07-03-T-048-S-01231

2017-07-03-T-050,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"From the findings, the incident originated from human error by a staff. In addition, her supervisor and department manager did not fully recognise the potential impact of the error. As a result, there was a delay in escalating the incident to senior management and up to 72 packs of affected instruments might have been used on patients, before all affected instruments were successfully recalled.",9,1245,2017-07-03-T-050-S-01245
2017-07-03-T-050,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The findings also revealed procedural weaknesses and a lack of vigilance amongst some staff.

From January to May 2017, our MRT trains travelled 387,000 train-km between delays of more than five minutes. This is more than double the performance in 2016 of 174,000 train-km. It has also exceeded my stretched targets. It is a pleasant surprise and is greatly inspiring to our teams of engineers and technicians working in the trenches. In fact, three out of the five lines have exceeded next year’s target of 400,000 train-km. Among the three, two have exceeded the 2020 target of 800,000 train-km in the first five months of this year. We are determined to be among the best in rail reliability and we will get there.

Only well-managed and reputable FIs are allowed to operate in Singapore. Once admitted, FIs must continue to meet the necessary regulatory requirements and standards. In designing these requirements, MAS draws reference from global standards and best practices, consults industry and other stakeholders, and carries out impact studies. This allows MAS to consider potential spillover effects of regulations on the broader economy and financial system and finetune the regulations as appropriate. This is further complemented by on-site inspections and regular off-site reviews of FIs' operations to check that they are managing their risks properly. In this regard, MAS adopts a risk-focused supervisory approach, paying closer attention to FIs that are more systemically important.",2,1309,2017-07-03-T-062-S-01309

2017-07-03-T-093,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Under the Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA), no one is allowed to stage any temporary fair without first obtaining a permit from the National Environment Agency (NEA). This is to ensure that all fair operators put in place measures to address potential public disamenities and public health concerns such as cleanliness, food hygiene and waste management. For example, fair operators must have contracts with a licensed cleaning contractor to clean the fair site and a licensed waste collector to ensure adequate waste collection arrangements while proper supporting facilities such as washing facilities must be provided for food-stalls. The fair operator is also required to obtain written approvals from the relevant Government agencies and landowners. In addition, the fair operator is responsible for ensuring that the fair operates within the period that it is licensed and that the set-up of the stalls within the fair is in accordance with the approved layout.",1,1434,2017-07-03-T-093-S-01434
2017-07-03-T-093,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Besides issuing permits to the fair operators, the NEA licenses the individual operators of the food-stalls in temporary fairs to ensure that the food sold is prepared hygienically and safe for consumption. All food-handlers need to be registered with NEA and pass the mandatory Basic Food Hygiene Course (BFHC).",2,1435,2017-07-03-T-093-S-01435
2017-07-03-T-093,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"NEA will take firm enforcement action, including the cancellation of food-stall licences, against anyone found in violation of the EPHA.",3,1436,2017-07-03-T-093-S-01436
2017-07-03-T-093,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our schemes and policies are regularly reviewed to ensure their relevance. I would like to assure the Member that we monitor the situation closely and will introduce regulatory changes, if need be, to safeguard the environment and ensure public health.",4,1437,2017-07-03-T-093-S-01437
2017-07-03-T-094,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what measures and regulations are in place to prevent pest control companies from placing and using hazardous bait, such as poison, in such a way that the safety of other wildlife and vulnerable members of public could be harmed; and (b) whether the Ministry can enforce stronger rules to prevent the indiscriminate use of pest poisons.",1,1438,2017-07-03-T-094-S-01438
2017-07-03-T-094,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Vector control operators are regulated by the National Environment Agency (NEA) under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act (CVPA). All personnel involved in vector control work have to undergo mandatory training in the safe handling and use of pesticides before they are licensed or certified by the NEA. For instance, vector control personnel are trained to only dispense rat bait in rat burrows or in tamper-proof bait stations which other animals cannot easily access.",1,1439,2017-07-03-T-094-S-01439
2017-07-03-T-094,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Apart from regulating vector control operators, the NEA also regulates the use of pesticides to ensure that they do not pose any public health concerns. NEA's evaluation of pesticides is done in accordance with the World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) and only pesticides that are approved for use by the NEA can be sold in Singapore after they are registered, labelled and classified properly.",2,1440,2017-07-03-T-094-S-01440
2017-07-03-T-094,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"My Ministry takes a serious view of the indiscriminate use of pesticides and will take enforcement action against any vector control operator and vector control personnel who infringe the regulations. Any person caught conducting vector control work without a licence shall be liable for a court fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment for up to three months, or both. The NEA may also suspend or cancel the registration of any vector control operator or the licence of any vector control personnel in cases where there are serious breaches of its licensing conditions.",3,1441,2017-07-03-T-094-S-01441
2017-07-03-T-094,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"These penalties have proved to be a sufficient deterrence. Over the past five years, there have only been six incidents that required enforcement actions to be taken against vector control operators or personnel. Hence, there is no need to put in place stiffer penalties to prevent the indiscriminate use of pesticides.",4,1442,2017-07-03-T-094-S-01442
2017-07-03-T-095,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider (i) offering the new O-level computing subject in all secondary schools and (ii) introducing this subject earlier in the secondary school curriculum at Secondary 1 or 2.,1,1443,2017-07-03-T-095-S-01443
2017-07-03-T-095,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"The number of secondary schools offering O-level Computing (formerly known as Computer Studies) has increased from 12 schools in 2016 to 19 schools this year, with another four more schools joining in 2018. This has provided more opportunities for interested students to take on Computing as a formal subject at upper secondary level.",1,1444,2017-07-03-T-095-S-01444
2017-07-03-T-095,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"To support the offering of O-level Computing in more secondary schools, MOE has been training more computing teachers since 2015. MOE is monitoring the take-up rate of the subject to ascertain the demand from students and determine if the subject should be introduced in more schools.",2,1445,2017-07-03-T-095-S-01445
2017-07-03-T-095,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"It should be noted that admission to Computing-related courses in polytechnics and universities does not require O-level Computing. Hence, students without O-level Computing background are not disadvantaged when applying to such courses after secondary school.",3,1446,2017-07-03-T-095-S-01446
2017-07-03-T-095,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"At lower secondary levels, there is limited curriculum time to offer a new subject. Our main approach is to enthuse a broad base of students in computing and expose them to possibilities of technology through enrichment programmes and co-curricular activities. Learning to program is part of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in 41 secondary schools. In addition, MOE also partners IMDA to provide enrichment programmes like the ""Code for Fun"" and ""Lab on Wheels"", which have been well received by schools. As of March 2016, 117 primary and secondary schools have embarked on the Code for Fun programme, benefiting 34,000 students. There are also a number of secondary schools (33 schools in 2016) with info-comm clubs which tap on the support of IMDA to provide learning in areas involving coding such as app development and robotics.",4,1447,2017-07-03-T-095-S-01447
2017-07-03-T-096,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) for each of the years from 2011 to 2016, what proportion of students at each local autonomous university are Singapore citizens, permanent residents and foreigners respectively, with a breakdown of undergraduate and post-graduate student population in each case.",1,1448,2017-07-03-T-096-S-01448
2017-07-03-T-096,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"University places are planned first and foremost for Singaporeans, in line with the cohort participation rate target of 40% by 2020. A small proportion of places are then provided for international students as they add diversity and vibrancy to the university, and enhance the educational experience for Singaporean students.",1,1449,2017-07-03-T-096-S-01449
2017-07-03-T-096,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Over the past five years, international students have formed not more than 15% of the undergraduate intake at our publicly-funded universities. Permanent residents have comprised about 5% of the intake. In 2016, the numbers stand at around 10% and 5% for international students and permanent residents respectively.",2,1450,2017-07-03-T-096-S-01450
2017-07-03-T-096,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"At the postgraduate level, the nationality profile of students are not planned for, unlike undergraduate programmes, but depends on applications. On average, 32% of the intake across the various postgraduate programmes each year were Singaporeans. Permanent residents and international students comprised another 5% and 63% of intake respectively.",3,1451,2017-07-03-T-096-S-01451
2017-07-03-T-097,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) what is being done to ensure that our students will be relevant to the future economy when they graduate.,1,1452,2017-07-03-T-097-S-01452
2017-07-03-T-097,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Across the post-secondary education institutions (PSEIs), graduate employment outcomes continue to be strong, with around nine in 10 graduates securing employment within six months of their graduation. This is because MOE and the PSEIs work closely with industries to regularly update curriculum and pedagogy, to ensure that students are equipped with relevant knowledge and skills when they enter the workforce.",1,1453,2017-07-03-T-097-S-01453
2017-07-03-T-097,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In terms of curriculum, PSEIs frequently engage industry representatives to stay abreast with latest development in industries. PSEIs engage industry practitioners to undertake a good part of the teaching. They are also involved in the work of the Sectoral Tripartite Committees, which drive the development and implementation of Industry Transformation Maps.",2,1454,2017-07-03-T-097-S-01454
2017-07-03-T-097,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In terms of pedagogy, there is an increased emphasis to balance acquisition of academic knowledge and practical skills, especially through learning by doing. For instance, a large majority of PSEI students already go for internships. We have also rolled out the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme and the Work Study Degree Programmes, which are modelled upon work-learn apprenticeship programmes in countries like Germany and Switzerland.",3,1455,2017-07-03-T-097-S-01455
2017-07-03-T-097,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The employability of students is very much related to their competence, which in turns reflects their aptitude and enthusiasm for the discipline they have chosen. The PSEIs have also strengthened education and career guidance (ECG) efforts to support students in making informed decisions on their career aspirations. Students have access to a wide range of resources such as information on industries and growth prospects, as well as ECG counsellors or career coaches to guide students on career preparation and skills upgrading opportunities. PSEIs are also increasingly moving towards aptitude based admission that takes into account the students strengths and interests.",4,1456,2017-07-03-T-097-S-01456
2017-07-03-T-097,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MOE also requires all our PSEIs to measure employment outcomes of their graduates annually and publish the results. This helps students make informed choices, and focus the PSEIs on the industry relevance of their courses. From this year, the requirement will be extended to private education institutions offering degree qualifications.",5,1457,2017-07-03-T-097-S-01457
2017-07-03-T-097,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Students are also encouraged to continually upgrade their skills even after graduation, to stay responsive to a rapidly changing workplace. The PSEIs are expanding the range of short, skills-based courses they offer. Together with the programmes offered by private training providers, these broaden the learning opportunities for working adults to upgrade and deepen their skills.",6,1458,2017-07-03-T-097-S-01458
2017-07-03-T-097,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Collectively, these initiatives contribute to an education and training system that is responsive to industry needs and ensure that individuals remain relevant to the future economy.",7,1459,2017-07-03-T-097-S-01459
2017-07-03-T-098,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) in light of the recommendations by the Committee on the Future Economy, what further steps will be taken to retrain workers to ensure they have the requisite skills to secure jobs in the next 10 years.",1,1460,2017-07-03-T-098-S-01460
2017-07-03-T-098,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"To help Singaporeans better prepare for the future, we will be focusing on three areas within the SkillsFuture movement.",1,1461,2017-07-03-T-098-S-01461
2017-07-03-T-098,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, we will increase the range of training programmes available for workers to stay employable. The Post-Secondary Education Institutions (PSEIs), namely, ITE, Polytechnics and Autonomous Universities, include lifelong learning as part of their core mission, and have developed more flexible, bite-sized and industry-aligned modules targeted at adult learners. This is in addition to the efforts of private training providers. Later this year, we will also launch the SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace programme to equip Singaporeans with foundational digital literacy skills in key areas such as understanding of data, technology and cyber security, as well as cultivating a mindset for change and innovation.",2,1462,2017-07-03-T-098-S-01462
2017-07-03-T-098,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, we are enhancing our efforts in education and career guidance to help Singaporeans make informed decisions regarding skills development, training and jobs. Specifically, we will launch two initiatives, namely MySkillsFuture and the SkillsFuture Engage. MySkillsFuture is a one-stop online portal offering a suite of tools and resources that will enable Singaporeans to understand labour market information, search for jobs and training programmes, and chart their skills development and career pathways. Under SkillsFuture Engage, we will deliver career and training advisory to Singaporeans at the community level, including guiding them to use MySkillsFuture portal, and choosing the right training programmes and careers.",3,1463,2017-07-03-T-098-S-01463
2017-07-03-T-098,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Third, the PSEIs are working closely with MOM and WSG to expand the Professional Conversion Programmes. These programmes help mid-career adults to undergo skills conversion and move into new occupations or sectors that have good prospects and opportunities for progression.",4,1464,2017-07-03-T-098-S-01464
2017-07-03-T-098,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,We will continue to build on SkillsFuture efforts to enable Singaporeans to learn through life and continually upgrade their skills. We encourage Singaporeans to make the best use of the various programmes and initiatives.,5,1465,2017-07-03-T-098-S-01465
2017-07-03-T-099,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) in the past three years, what is the trend of students entering polytechnics versus junior colleges; (b) what percentage of polytechnic graduates has gained admission to local universities; and (c) whether there are plans to make more university places available for polytechnic students.",1,1466,2017-07-03-T-099-S-01466
2017-07-03-T-099,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the past three years, the proportion of P1 cohort admitted to the polytechnics and JCs has been about 47% and 28% respectively.",1,1467,2017-07-03-T-099-S-01467
2017-07-03-T-099,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The proportion of polytechnic graduates gaining admission to local universities has been increasing, in tandem with the expansion of university places to raise the university cohort participation rate. As a number of polytechnic graduates enlist in National Service after graduation, or choose to work before furthering their studies, we would not have the latest years' figures on the proportion of the cohort that gained admission into university, until a few years from now. However, if we compare the number of university places taken up by polytechnic graduates and the size of the polytechnic graduating cohort in a given year, this ratio was 25 polytechnic graduates in the universities to 100 polytechnic graduates, up from 23 to 100 in 2014.",2,1468,2017-07-03-T-099-S-01468
2017-07-03-T-099,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The profile of students admitted to the universities will continue to depend on student interest and quality. Whether you take the JC or polytechnic route, admissions to universities are based on merit and open competition among students.",3,1469,2017-07-03-T-099-S-01469
