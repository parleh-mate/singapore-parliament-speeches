2017-08-01-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Order. Before we move to the first item of business, I would like to inform hon Members that wi-fi has been enabled in the Chamber for Members' use. This is an extension of the wi-fi facility that Members have been using in other parts of the House since 2008. Members have given feedback on the usefulness of extending the convenience of wi-fi into the Chamber to enable speedier access to parliamentary materials in the Chamber. I hope this move will allow Members to work digitally, seamlessly and make greater use of electronic devices for parliamentary work.",1,1,2017-08-01-T-001-S-00001

2017-08-01-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked	 the Minister for Defence how is the SAF adding anti-terror operations to their priority, in addition to securing Singapore's sovereignty.",1,5,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00005
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mdm Speaker, the terrorism threat to Singapore remains the highest in recent times. While we do not have any specific intelligence on any impending plot targeted at Singapore, the number of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)-related attacks in surrounding ASEAN countries and other regions since 2013 has increased three-fold in the last four years. Both Al-Qaeda and ISIS-related terrorists have identified Singapore as a target, along with Malaysia and Indonesia.",1,6,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00006
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The ongoing Marawi crisis in southern Philippines indicates that extremist terrorism is now endemic in this region and it may take many years before that security problem is rooted out. Foreign fighters from countries like Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Chechnya were reported to be fighting in Marawi and more are expected to join them, including returning fighters from this region who are now in Iraq and Syria. Their stated goal is to establish a wilayat, or a province of the caliphate, supported by global terrorist financing and networks. Stashes of weapons, ammunition and large amounts of cash amounting to millions of dollars have reportedly been discovered during raids of terrorist camps in Marawi. If these terrorist cells are entrenched deeper in Mindanao or any part of ASEAN, they will launch attacks against our people in Singapore and other cities in the region. We must do all we can to prevent this from happening, to keep Singaporeans safe.",2,7,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00007
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),MINDEF and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) take this extremist threat to Singapore and Singaporeans very seriously and we have been making changes to deal with it decisively at various levels. Let me elaborate.,3,8,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00008
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"First, to counter the terrorism threat at its source. This requires an international effort and the SAF has been part of the coalition against jihadi terrorism. The SAF was in Afghanistan from 2007 to 2013 against Al-Qaeda, our longest overseas deployment to date, with close to 500 personnel deployed. Since 2015, the SAF has also deployed units as part of the multinational coalition efforts against ISIS. These deployments included Intelligence Fusion Officers, Imagery Analysts and air-to-air refuelling tanker aircraft to various parts of the Middle East. Right now, we have an SAF medical team in Iraq as an ongoing part of this effort.",4,9,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00009
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Second, we need to deal with geographically proximate threats in our region. If we wait till the problem comes onto our shores, for terrorists to attack us here before we respond, it will be too little, too late. For this reason, Singapore encouraged strongly the three littoral states − Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines − to initiate the Trilateral Maritime Patrol in the Sulu Seas and offered the help of the Republic of Singapore Navy's Information Fusion Centre to facilitate information-sharing. The SAF stands ready to assist in these patrols when invited.",5,10,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00010
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"I visited the Philippines two weeks ago, where I thanked Philippine Secretary of National Defense Delfin Lorenzana and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) for their decisive action in Mindanao and Marawi City. We discussed ways in which the SAF could help the AFP concretely and Secretary Lorenzana has accepted in principle our offers of  one, humanitarian supplies for the evacuees from Marawi, this will be flown in via the Republic of Singapore Air Force's C-130 transport aircraft; two, the use of the SAF's urban training villages for AFP troops to be trained in counter-terror; and three, a detachment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to enhance the AFP's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. MINDEF has been informed that President Duterte has accepted in principle Singapore's offer of assistance. Details of the implementation are now being worked out.",6,11,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00011
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Third, we must strengthen our defences at home, not only to respond to terrorist attacks but to prevent radicalisation of our own people and deal with the social consequences in the aftermath of attacks. After 9/11, the SAF reorganised its capabilities. We set up four task forces dedicated to homeland security − the Special Operations Task Force, the Maritime Security Task Force (MSTF), the Air Defence Task Force (ADTF) and the Island Defence Task Force. Our sailors, soldiers and airmen in these task forces conduct 24/7 operations to keep our air, land and seas secure. In recent years, in responding to the evolving threat from ISIS-related terrorists, further changes have been made to equip and train many more SAF personnel to deal with these threats effectively.",7,12,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00012
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The Island Defence Training Institute (IDTI) was opened yesterday by Second Minister for Defence Ong Ye Kung. And the IDTI will prepare active and National Service (NS) units to undertake Homeland Defence and Security Operations. It will equip soldiers with the necessary competencies to be deployed alongside their counterparts from MHA. From July this year, the IDTI will train approximately 18,000 soldiers from active and NS units yearly in homeland security operations. Soldiers will go through video simulation training to hone their thinking processes and application of Rules of Engagement, which include scenarios, such as coastal patrols, security checkpoints and the like.",8,13,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00013
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Beyond these organisational changes, the SAF has also systematically updated its tactics, techniques and procedures for counter-terrorism operations. We are now purchasing more new equipment that will provide SAF forces better mobility, more accurate situational assessments and precise capabilities to neutralise terrorists in urban settings when they strike there. Our soldiers will use more unmanned systems to improve surveillance and responses.",9,14,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00014
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"SAF will also enhance our air and sea defences. The ADTF stays sharp with regular Exercise Vigilance exercises and drills. The Singapore Navy's MSTF will lead Exercise Highcrest in October this year, with the participation of whole-of-Government agencies.",10,15,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00015
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),SAF and the Home Team are working well together and closer to deal with the terrorism threat. We have instituted a regular exercise framework to test and validate our joint operations. One example is the joint counter-terrorism exercise which aims to validate joint counter-terrorism plans in October last year.,11,16,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00016
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Lastly, the Defence Technology Community has set up a dedicated Counter-Terrorism office in the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) in October last year. That effort is already bearing fruit. Joint operations between the SAF and the Home Team are now enabled by a common Command and Control Information System, which provides situational awareness and interoperability. Engineers from DSTA and DSO National Laboratories are using data analytics technologies to pick up specific threats and provide early warning.",12,17,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00017
2017-08-01-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Will there be more joint exercises between the Home Team and SAF to help ensure that both forces synergise their efforts and arsenal against the threat of terrorism? Will there be a joint response from both forces should a terrorist threat, unfortunately, vest on our shores?",1,18,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00018
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mdm Speaker, the Member has pointed out a key challenge for security agencies across the world in dealing with counter-terrorism. Traditionally, I think, neither the home teams of countries nor the SAF, or rather the military in that sense, were geared up to deal with terrorism on this scale. And we have seen it in various scenarios  whether it is a truck that mows down innocent pedestrians; whether it is at the airport; whether it is in crowded places, we are not structured that way. And when you have multiple attacks, as occurred in France, you find security agencies having to mobilise beyond what the first line of defenders have to do, when their needs or demands are overwhelmed.",1,19,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00019
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, that is, indeed, a clear recognition that you have to prepare for these scenarios. It could be very small, it could be much larger. And across that spectrum, how do you scale up, scale down? How do you respond effectively, how do you coordinate effectively? You cannot do it by chance. You cannot wait and say, ""Well, let something happen then we learn.""",2,20,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00020
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The closest we can get is through, exactly as the Member says, different exercise scenarios. But even before that, we need to coordinate planning considerations. How do you plan together? How do you have a common understanding between the Home Team and the SAF, recognising that the Home Team are the first responders because they are in society and that has been their role? But how do you make sure that while they are responding, the SAF also is keenly aware of what happens to them? That is why I talked about a joint system now, a Command and Control Information System, which both the Home Team and the SAF now use, which was developed by DSTA so that you share the same picture and that makes a lot of difference, as well as having an understanding of when you can divide out responsibilities, when you can actually come together.",3,21,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00021
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, I would say that there is a clear recognition that we need to exercise more often together and, indeed, we have. I mentioned the joint counter-terrorism exercise. I talked about also an exercise in the maritime domain with different agencies. So, we are aware of this need to coordinate and integrate our responses, not only of our security agencies, but of our community groups. Because, as I have said, while our security teams and security agencies can exercise, what we need to pay attention to is the aftermath of attacks. And, Madam, I think that is a whole-of-society response.",4,22,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00022
2017-08-01-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Can the Minister share − apart from Singapore,1,23,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00023
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Let me answer the second question first. So far, the contributions to the Philippines do not lend themselves to that sense of a multinational effort because there is no central or prime mover for that. It very much depends on what the AFP says it needs and the relationships that the Philippines have with other militaries and other countries.",1,24,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00024
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"From what we know, a number of countries have been reported to be helping the Philippines, such as the United States. The Chinese have also contributed. If you consider the Trilateral Maritime Patrol in the Sulu Seas, which the Philippines does with Malaysia and Indonesia, then Malaysia and Indonesia. Members may have read that Malaysia also mobilised a humanitarian plane, under the auspices of AHA, which is the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management. And that is from our reports.",2,25,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00025
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We have good relations with the AFP and there is good personal contact between myself and Secretary Lorenzana. And we thought that it was right for Singapore to assist because, if this problem becomes entrenched and it gets worse, cities in ASEAN will bear the brunt and will be subject to attacks if these terrorist cells become entrenched there.",3,26,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00026
2017-08-01-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, We have a very successful SAF and defence force. Practically in every household, you will find a National Serviceman. How could the Government leverage on this advantage that we have to work with the community to form a strong defence against terrorism?",1,27,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00027
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mdm Speaker, let me thank the Member for that question. It is an important one. I think there are clear roles that security agencies should do because that is the primary responsibility and we have to have community groups.",1,28,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00028
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Let me deal with the first. As members of the security forces, I think the public rightly expects the Home Team, the SAF − whether they are National Servicemen or Regulars − to be able to protect Singaporeans. But we have to train them. You cannot just say, ""Well, go and protect Singaporeans."" And that was the essence of launching the IDTI. I mentioned this institute and you may have seen footages yesterday in the news. It is not easy to tell someone with arms and, sometimes, you are worried that, ""If you think this person is going to harm somebody else, if he is a terrorist, neutralise him."" Because you can make the wrong judgement. In a tensed situation, the outcome can become very negative. You have to put them through training. The better trained they are, the better they are equipped, the more confident they are.",2,29,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00029
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, in the IDTI, we are training 18,000 National Servicemen every year to do the rudiments. You have basically video simulation screens which are life-size and moving targets − which means people, some are ""hostages"" and you also have ""terrorists"". And if they make the wrong decision, in an instant, they will know it. You have to get them used to that. We have various simulations on how to do a proper search, which, traditionally, they were not trained for because the Home Team is better at it. And we recognise that.",3,30,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00030
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"But in the event that you have multiple attacks and you need the resources of the SAF, then at least, at the very least, you have them trained at the basic level. I do not think they can be as proficient as the average policeman because that is not what they do every day but, at least you have that. And also, in the change of our assets, how we are equipping for that, we have mentioned that.",4,31,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00031
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"But at the community level, Mr Gan's question is  how do you ensure that we can protect at the precinct level? And I think that is not only for NSmen who are from the SAF, Home Team or SCDF which they have some level of training. I think that is where many of our community exercises are now dealing with it − emergency preparedness, where you bring in communities and you have to respond. Because the problem with small group and lone wolf attacks is the rapidity of these attacks. And you have to deal with the situation before formal security agencies can mobilise.",5,32,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00032
2017-08-01-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I think there is great scope and need for our community agencies to come together. I know that many Members, including myself, have been doing this − bringing community leaders and saying, ""When we have an attack, can I depend on you for these resources? Can I depend on you for this? Can I depend on you to calm the community down, to speak to the community?"" And I think we need to continually do that.",6,33,2017-08-01-T-002-S-00033
2017-08-01-T-003,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui,"asked	 the Minister for Transport with regard to the collapse of the viaduct near the PIE exit to TPE (a) what is the cause of the collapse; (b) how does LTA assess and grade the contractors in the tender process, especially for companies with serious workplace safety lapses; and (c) what measures will be implemented to enhance workplace safety.",1,34,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00034

I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the family of Mr Chen Yinchuan, the worker who passed away, and pray for the recovery of the four workers still receiving treatment in the hospital.",1,43,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00043
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"LTA is working with MOM and BCA to investigate the cause of the collapse. Preliminary investigations suggest that the corbels, or fork-like structures, supporting the deck slab gave way. However, we will have to wait till the investigations are completed to understand why they gave way.",2,44,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00044
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Members have asked about LTA's procurement process for construction projects. LTA adheres to the guidelines issued by BCA, which consider both the price and quality of bids. BCA's guidelines for the price-quality ratio range from 60 40 for more complex projects, to 80 20 for simpler ones. For the construction of this viaduct, LTA adopted a ratio of 70 30, commonly used for projects of this complexity.",3,45,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00045
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As part of the overall quality score, LTA assesses the safety practices of the bidders, based on their past safety records, such as their demerit points from MOM, the safety performance of their ongoing projects and the robustness of their safety management systems.",4,46,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00046
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Tenderers who have had workplace safety lapses in the past would receive lower quality scores. If a bidder does not meet minimum overall quality requirements, his price envelope will not even be opened, and his bid will be disqualified. Two years ago, LTA further tightened the evaluation process, so that poor safety performance alone can lead to disqualification. Since then, 16 bids from 10 contractors have been disqualified for this reason.",5,47,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00047
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Over the past three years, LTA has called a total of 175 tenders for construction works, which received over 1,100 submissions. Out of these submissions, 69 were from contractors who had serious workplace safety lapses. Of these 69, only two bids were successful. Both these bidders had submitted the lowest price bid and received the highest overall price-quality score. For these two cases, the winning price bids were 27% and 6% lower than the second lowest bids.",6,48,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00048

2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"In this particular case, the main contractor, Or Kim Peow Pte Ltd (OKP) had a fatal workplace incident at Yio Chu Kang Flyover in 2015. MOM's investigations were still ongoing at the time LTA was evaluating OKP's bid for the construction of this viaduct in question and, hence, LTA did not disqualify OKP outright. Nevertheless, LTA gave OKP a low safety performance score in the evaluation of its bid. On the other hand, OKP offered the lowest tender price and also had a good track record in completing many similar infrastructural projects over the past 10 years. Overall, it obtained the highest score and was awarded the project.",8,50,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00050

It pertains to how the contract was awarded to OKP for the tender. While I recognise that the outcome of the earlier incident was not finalised, the fact is that there was a fatality in the Yio Chu Kang Flyover project and there were three injuries as well. So, my question is − notwithstanding the two-envelope system, notwithstanding that the outcome of the earlier incident was not finalised − I contend and I want the Ministry's view on this, on whether this has to be taken into account, regardless of whether the report is still outstanding.",1,52,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00052
2017-08-01-T-003,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The fact also is that the winning bid and the next winning bid were a massive 34% apart. I think these are alarm bells. I know we are always smarter with hindsight, but I think these are serious lessons, and serious enough that, going forward, the lessons should be put into practice. It should be documented and it should be instituted, so that future tenders on this two-envelope system adhere to the principle and intention of why we have a two-envelope system.",2,53,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00053
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Mr Seah for the supplementary questions. Let me explain why OKP was actually given the contract, in spite of the Yio Chu Kang Flyover accident. OKP was awarded the contract after emerging with the highest price-quality score amongst the four tenderers. The tender submissions were evaluated objectively and fairly, based on the price-quality weightages and tender specifications made known to all the tenderers.",1,54,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00054
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"While I understand that there are concerns with regard to the safety records of companies who are tendering for such projects, and although OKP has one fatality and some injuries at the Yio Chu Kang Flyover in September 2015, at the point in time when the tender was evaluated, like I mentioned in my reply, investigations were still ongoing. We did not really know what the exact cause was and what OKP's liabilities were. This was, in fact, taken into consideration when we evaluated the tender, and, as a result, OKP scored the lowest for quality, which includes safety performance, in the tender submission.",2,55,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00055
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"However, we do look at other factors. OKP had a good track record over the past 10 years for completing many similar projects and, prior to the Yio Chu Kang Flyover accident, OKP had achieved an accident-free record of more than 25,000 man-hours. Following the fatal accident at the Yio Chu Kang Flyover, OKP had also improved their safety standards with visible improvements. Since 2015, OKP did not have any work-site accidents, MOM fines or demerit points until the collapse of the current PIE-TPE viaduct.",3,56,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00056
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,We hear the Member's concern. We do take into consideration the safety records and safety performances of companies when they bid for projects.,4,57,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00057
2017-08-01-T-003,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"I thank the Senior Minister of State. I have some questions. For design-and-build tenders, I know a good track record is important, but how do we evaluate the technical competency of the project site team and the contractors, such as the one involved in the erection of the working platform and temporary works?",1,58,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00058
2017-08-01-T-003,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),There were also reports of 11 cracks that were discovered after the incident. Can the Senior Minister of State share the investigations that are still ongoing?,2,59,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00059
2017-08-01-T-003,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"The third question is whether there is a process in place to brief the site team for the temporary work, such as the loading, the PE design and the risk assessment for it.",3,60,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00060
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank the Member for her supplementary questions. First, allow me to run through with Members our tender evaluation framework with regard to price, as well as the quality.",1,61,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00061
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As I have mentioned in my reply, all public agencies adhere to the price-quality method (PQM) published by BCA, which evaluates both the price as well as the quality attributes for all tenderers. For build-only projects, agencies generally adopt a price-quality weightage of 80 20. In this case, which is a design-and-build project, agencies can consider price-quality ratios between 60 40 and 70 30, depending on the complexity. In this case, for the TPE-PIE project, a 70 30 ratio was considered, similar to other projects of similar complexity and nature.",2,62,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00062
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"BCA guidelines make it mandatory for safety performance to make up at least 15% of the quality score. However, LTA, in its internal guidelines, assigned 25%, so they are actually more stringent than BCA. So, 25% of the quality score must be attributed to safety performance.",3,63,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00063
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"In addition, LTA evaluates four sub-components for safety performance, namely, the safety records of the past two years, the robustness of the safety management systems, the safety and health performance in ongoing LTA projects and whether the company had won any safety awards.",4,64,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00064

2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As to the Member's question on the reasons and the cause of the accident, the investigation is ongoing; it is still premature to judge what is the exact cause. I think it is unfair to make any judgement at this point in time. Suffice to say that based on our preliminary investigation, it is the design of the corbels that could have resulted in the accident. LTA, together with BCA and MOM, has already done whatever possible to put proppings around the structure to ensure that the existing structure remains safe for any ongoing investigation and works.",7,67,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00067
2017-08-01-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer and I would like to raise a few supplementary questions.,1,68,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00068
2017-08-01-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Firstly, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that of the approximately 69 bid submissions over the past three years from contractors with a history of serious safety lapses, he mentioned two were successful. Would the Senior Minister of State happen to have information on whether of these two successful bids from such contractors with such a safety lapse history, were there any subsequent serious safety lapses on these projects after the contractor won the bid in these two cases?",2,69,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00069
2017-08-01-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"My second supplementary question is  in the event of a serious safety lapse, such as a fatality, to what extent would that shift the quality assessment of the contractor's subsequent bids? The background to this, Mdm Speaker, is I am wondering whether there is a risk that some contractors may already be pricing in the impact of safety compliance and whether this may shape contractor behaviour.",3,70,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00070
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Dr Tan Wu Meng for the two supplementary questions. On the first, where two bidders were eventually successful out of the 69 bidders who had a serious safety lapse, I do not have the details of the kind of projects and works that they have been involved in. I will be able to provide the information separately to him.",1,71,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00071
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As to the impact of safety records on quality performance, yes, I have indicated in my previous reply that safety forms a significant proportion of the quality score. In the case of LTA projects, it forms about 25%. While safety lapses may have happened, we also need to be cognisant of the fact that we need to go into the details of the accident − what caused the accident − before deciding on the score under the quality framework. At the end of the day, we need to look into all different factors and considerations and apply the PQM in determining who the eventual winner of the bid will be.",2,72,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00072
2017-08-01-T-003,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Senior Minister of State. I was just wondering whether there is a vicious cycle that is going on here in the sense that contractors, knowing that they will be scoring low for quality due to poor safety record, will be lowering their price bid in the next contract to an unrealistic level and, therefore, risking further safety lapses; and whether, therefore, a review of the PQM framework is on the cards after this accident.",1,73,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00073
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank the Member for the question. LTA does not bar contractors which have safety lapses or are blacklisted by MOM from participating in the tenders. In fact, their quality envelopes will still be opened and assessed objectively. Any safety lapses will then be penalised under the safety component accordingly. However, those with very low-quality scores may be disqualified and their price envelopes left unopened. In fact, from 15 July 2015 onwards, LTA has put in place a new policy where the LTA Board can veto bidders on the basis of very poor safety performance alone. For such cases, the price envelopes will be returned unopened. Since then, I would like to inform the Member that LTA Board has vetoed 16 bids from 10 companies for this very reason.",1,74,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00074
2017-08-01-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, it is important for LTA to have a thorough investigation, so that the root cause of the collapse can be identified and measures taken.

2017-08-01-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The second question is, will the Ministry work with MOM to let the contractor resume work at other areas except the viaduct construction, because the project is a big project and now the Stop Work Order is for the whole project?",3,77,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00077

2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"LTA is working with MOM as well as BCA to investigate the cause of the collapse. I would like to urge all Members to be patient, not to speculate what the cause is and let the investigation take its due course. Of course, the delay of the project after the issuance of the Stop Work Order will depend on the investigation process and the cause of the accident. Once that has been determined, all necessary precautions, as well as, if there is a need in re-qualifying the design and so on, will be taken into consideration before work can resume.",2,79,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00079

2017-08-01-T-003,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"We know that in the construction industry, it is typical for these main contractors to have multiple subsidiary companies. So, how are these taken into account, especially if the subsidiary companies had previous safety lapses, in the overall assessment if the award is being tendered by another company within this whole holdings?",2,82,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00082
2017-08-01-T-003,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"The second question is, because of this complexity or the scale of the project, it is typical to have multiple sub-contractors. How does the main contractor ensure that the sub-contractors actively take measures against all these safety lapses?",3,83,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00083
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Miss Cheryl Chan for the supplementary questions.

2017-08-01-T-003,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"A supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. The Senior Minister of State mentioned that prior to the award of the tender to OKP, they had a good 10-year track record. The most recent one, unfortunately, the findings were not complete and, therefore, it was not quite taken into account. My question to him is, while it is important to look into the 10-year track record, more weightage should be given to the recency effect, the most recent incident.",1,91,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00091
2017-08-01-T-003,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"I asked this earlier, he did not quite nail it down, I want to ask again. Would such things be instituted in future tender awards? This PQM really needs to be reviewed, taking into account that notwithstanding that most recent incidents have not been finalised, it must be taken as a factor, to be seriously deliberated and considered. I hope this will be factored in, going forward.",2,92,2017-08-01-T-003-S-00092
2017-08-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I thank Mr Seah for the suggestion and I agree that some of these factors are important to be considered in the evaluation of the bid. Indeed, the PQM guidelines have been dictated by BCA. LTA does review the guidelines and make necessary changes and amendments according to its needs.

2017-08-01-T-004,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"asked	 the Minister for Manpower in view of the recent construction mishap at the TPE-PIE viaduct (a) whether the Ministry will review the current blacklisting framework; (b) how can the Ministry work with BCA to debar blacklisted companies from working on projects rather than just bar them from hiring new workers or renew existing ones; and (c) whether companies need to prove that they have taken remedial steps, including improving worker safety training, before having the blacklist status removed.",1,94,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00094

First, the demerit points will last for 18 months, up from 12 months previously. Second, companies that accumulate 25 demerit points are ""blacklisted"" by being barred from hiring foreign workers. In the past, they could continue to hire foreign workers but at a higher levy. Since the review in 2015, MOM has issued about 2,400 demerit points to 223 companies.

2017-08-01-T-004,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Firstly, can the Minister of State clarify why was OKP not under BUS at the material time? Are we satisfied that there is no systemic failure of its safety management system?",2,104,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00104
2017-08-01-T-004,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Secondly, while a lot of demerit points have been issued to the companies, are we also satisfied that the current regime is tough enough to deter companies from even trying to adopt lower standards in their safety management?",3,105,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00105
2017-08-01-T-004,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the two supplementary questions.",1,106,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00106
2017-08-01-T-004,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"First, about why OKP was allowed to participate in Government projects despite it being involved in some accident. As explained by the Senior Minister of State for Transport just now, when LTA awarded the PIE viaduct project to OKP in November 2015, the investigation on the earlier September 2015 accident was still ongoing at the time. And following the September 2015 accident, MOM inspected all of OKP's worksites to check if the accident reflected a wider systemic failure of the company's safety management. However, no evidence of systemic safety lapses was found from the inspections. So, OKP was not placed under BUS following that accident. This was the situation in 2015.",2,107,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00107
2017-08-01-T-004,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"As part of the continual efforts to improve WSH performance, we have further strengthened our BUS programme in May 2016 to put companies on BUS immediately after a fatal accident. So, for any company with a workplace fatality now, Government agencies would have known that they are put on BUS and will have their bizSAFE status revoked. So, agencies can take this into account when assessing their upcoming tenders. This timeline explains why OKP was not put under the BUS programme for the earlier 2015 accident but was placed on the BUS programme following the PIE viaduct accident on 14 July this year.",3,108,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00108
2017-08-01-T-004,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"As to the Member's second question on whether the current regime is tough enough to deter companies from taking short cuts and to infringe WSH practices, while we would like to think that the current regime is tough enough to deter companies, as Members can see, the fatality rates in the first seven months of 2017 had fallen remarkably to four fatality cases as compared to 24 for the whole of 2016, and 27 fatality cases in 2015.",4,109,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00109
2017-08-01-T-004,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"But having said that, we are cognisant that, at the construction worksites, things can happen quite quickly and we are not taking this current situation lightly. In fact, we have stepped up our enforcement actions on many worksites to make sure that all these worksites follow the WSH regimes and measures carefully. As a matter of fact, MOM conducts 16,000 inspections a year on all the worksites in Singapore. The bulk of our inspections is concentrated on the higher-risk industries, like marine, oil and gas, as well as construction.",5,110,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00110
2017-08-01-T-004,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"So, while we cannot say for sure that the current regime will be able to 100% get the companies to adhere fully to the WSH regulations, standards and performance, we will closely monitor them. If there is a need to further tighten, we will continue to do so, as the reviewing of our safety regulatory framework is an ongoing effort.",6,111,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00111
2017-08-01-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"A supplementary question, Madam. The Minister of State said that OKP had some industrial accident but was not put under BUS because it was determined not to be systemic. So, I would like to ask what MOM considers to be a systemic problem for companies which had industrial accidents. How does it assess whether it is systemic or not? And would he tell this House examples of companies which have been found to have systemic problems and put under BUS?",1,112,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00112

2017-08-01-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Madam. Just one supplementary question for the Minister of State. To what extent are there safeguards in place against the directors of a company that may be under some form of blacklisting, be it under BUS or some other regime, from incorporating a new company and bidding for Government projects and, thereby, potentially evading their previous negative safety records? If there are no safeguards against them now, will the Ministry look into that and introduce some safeguards against them?",1,117,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00117
2017-08-01-T-004,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Madam, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. The records follow the individuals rather than the company. So, if a company director has infringed certain WSH regulations and all that, there is a record against him. That record will go with him, even if he sets up a new company. So, there is little chance that individuals can evade our system by setting up different companies to undertake Government or private sector projects.",1,118,2017-08-01-T-004-S-00118

2017-08-01-T-005,Sam Tan Chin Siong,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong) (for the Minister for Manpower,"Mdm Speaker, safety competency is a function of enforcement, awareness and training. On enforcement, MOM conducts more than 16,000 inspections per year, as mentioned earlier just now. These inspections resulted in companies taking remedial actions to rectify any safety gaps found in their worksites. On awareness, the Workplace Safety and Health Council, where SNEF and NTUC are represented, has conducted education programmes reaching out to 500,000 workers a year. On training, more than 150,000 workers undergo safety training every year. The Workplace Safety and Health Council is also partnering SkillsFuture Singapore to enhance the	Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) training curriculum of workers, supervisors and managers over the next two years. The Council also has the bizSAFE and CultureSAFE initiatives for companies, which build WSH management capabilities and foster a stronger culture of WSH.

2017-08-01-T-005,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"The larger strategic direction taken by MOM is four-fold. Firstly, we would like to create widespread awareness on WSH across the industry down to the workers, from management to the workers. So, creating awareness is one plank. The second plank is to step up the training to build worker, management and line supervisors' capability on WSH. The third is to continue with sustained enforcement actions and inspections at the different worksites. Whenever there are areas identified to be of higher risk because of new situations, we will calibrate our enforcement regime to make sure that we will pay closer attention on those higher risk sectors. Lastly, the penalty. From time to time, we will assess the situation and needs. When it is meritorious, we will consider stiffening the penalties, which we have done in the last one year or so.",2,125,2017-08-01-T-005-S-00125

This includes strengthening tripartite ownership for WSH. We think that it is important for the Government, the union and also the employers to come together to collectively tackle the WSH situation in Singapore. So, collective ownership, tripartite ownership, is one area where we are looking into. And the second area of review is facilitating the public release of incident learning reports on the root causes and recommendations of incidents with higher learning value. This is done so as to prevent recurrence of similar accidents.",3,126,2017-08-01-T-005-S-00126

KK Women and Children's Hospital and NUHS see about 160 to 190 Kawasaki disease cases per year. Kawasaki disease is also the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries.

On 25 February 2013, the patient, a one-year-old child, was hospitalised at Gleneagles hospital with high fever for three days and red eyes, besides other symptoms. The paediatrician who was on call at the hospital, Dr Chia Foong Lin, attended to the child and diagnosed the case as a viral infection.",2,135,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00135
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Two days later, on 27 February, or the fifth day of the child's fever, the child was noted to be fretful, had red lips and developed a rash. On 28 February, the following day, he had a spike of fever in the morning and red and cracked lips. Dr Chia considered the possibility of Kawasaki disease and looked for the full features of Kawasaki disease. However, she did not conduct any supportive tests for Kawasaki disease and did not share this with the parents. Dr Chia's diagnosis remained as viral infection as there were no full features of Kawasaki disease.",3,136,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00136
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"On 1 March, the fifth day in the hospital and the seventh day of the child's fever, the child was discharged by Dr Chia as the fever appeared to have settled. According to Dr Chia, the red eyes improved and no rashes were seen but his lips were still slightly red and cracked. The diagnosis by Dr Chia was again viral infection.",4,137,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00137
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"On 3 March, which was the ninth day of the child's fever, the child was reviewed by Dr Chia as an outpatient at her clinic. Dr Chia was informed by the parents that the fever had continued in the two days after discharge although, according to Dr Chia, the red eyes and the rashes had resolved and the child's lips had improved. The history of the progression of the child's symptoms and signs, including prolonged fever, red eye, rash and red lips were suggestive of Kawasaki disease which should have prompted Dr Chia to carry out supportive tests, but Dr Chia still maintained that it was viral fever and did not order any supportive tests.",5,138,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00138
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The next day, on 4 March, the child's parents decided to seek a second opinion and went to consult another paediatrician as the child continued to have high fever. On examination, she noted that the child was irritable and had a rash on the upper body. The second paediatrician also noted redness in the child's palms and soles, prominent lymph nodes on the right neck and discovered a heart murmur. All these were signs suggestive of Kawasaki disease. She ordered the blood tests which supported the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease and an echocardiogram which showed that the blood vessels of the heart was already affected. Fortunately, the child responded well from the treatment for Kawasaki disease and the fever settled.",6,139,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00139
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The child's mother then filed a complaint with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC). In accordance with the Medical Registration Act, the SMC convened a Complaints Committee.

2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"A DT was convened comprising two senior doctors and a lawyer. During its inquiry, the DT also considered the opinions of two expert witnesses. The DT noted that there were already well accepted international guidelines for the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease since 2004. Based on these international guidelines, the child presented with signs and symptoms which should be investigated further for Kawasaki disease. The DT concluded that Dr Chia fell short of the reasonable standard expected of a senior paediatrician by not ordering tests to support the diagnosis or discussing with the parents about this possible diagnosis which she had considered. The DT judged that this amounted to professional misconduct on her part.",8,141,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00141
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"In deciding on the sentence, the DT considered eight precedents relating to doctors who had missed or given a wrong diagnosis, failed to provide adequate advice and/or failed to provide adequate and timely treatment to patients. The DT noted that six of the precedents were dealt with by a suspension instead of a fine. The DT also took into account the seniority of Dr Chia and that she was an experienced paediatrician of 23 years' standing. After considering all the relevant facts and circumstances, including the aggravating and mitigating factors, such as Dr Chia's unblemished record, the many testimonials and character references and her contribution to society, the DT ordered a three-month suspension, which is the shortest suspension under the Medical Registration Act.",9,142,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00142

The High Court noted that Dr Chia had not pleaded guilty to the charge and that the disease faced was not uncommon. Taking these factors, as well as the precedents into consideration, the High Court found the order of three months' suspension to be appropriate. The appeal was then dismissed by the High Court.",10,143,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00143
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Dr Lim asked if MOH advocates doctors to send all cases for detailed diagnostic tests to avoid misdiagnosing rare medical conditions. The answer is no. Such defensive medicine practice deviates from good clinical practice. It will also unnecessarily increase healthcare costs. Dr Lim also asked if the Ministry should issue standard practice guidelines on diagnosis for all potentially rare illnesses. It is neither possible nor practical for MOH to issue guidelines for all rare diseases. Doctors would have to exercise their clinical judgement in such situations. However, in this particular case, there were already existing international guidelines which warranted further investigations to diagnose Kawasaki disease, given the symptoms and signs of persistent fever, red eyes, red cracked lips and a rash.",11,144,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00144
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Ms Tin asked if there have been international studies on defensive medicine, which is defined as a deviation of sound medical practice that is induced mainly by a fear of medical malpractice action. There have been a few international studies, mainly comprising surveys of doctors, which noted the high prevalence of defensive medicine practices overseas, resulting in unnecessary increases in healthcare costs. Other international studies have also suggested that a substantial fraction of malpractice claims are a result of failure of doctor-patient communication. There has been no local studies on defensive medicine.",12,145,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00145
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As part of their work, doctors are expected to exercise good clinical judgement to manage patients appropriately. Clinical judgement is dependent on the seniority of the doctor, the area of practice and experience, clinical presentation of each patient and the facts and circumstances surrounding each case. For cases which are complex or for which the treating doctors are unsure, they can also discuss with other colleagues on the most appropriate management of the case. In addition, medical knowledge is constantly evolving.

I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State regarding the blood test he referred to for diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. What is the exact blood test he is referring to? Because, as far as I know, there is no specific blood test for Kawasaki disease in the first place. Last of all is that it is very common. I mean, for all parents here who have children, to find a child with fever, with a rash. Does it mean that every single child with rash and fever has to be sent for a cardiac scan in future? I think that is the fear that we have now.",1,148,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00148

Frequently, we hear complaints from our residents, from our patients that the investigation costs are going up − tests are very expensive. In fact, every single blood test, every single scan, every single MRI you do, is expensive. Every single headache could be a brain tumour. Are we going to investigate every single headache with a scan as well? I think these are the pertinent questions that we are asking.",2,149,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00149

2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Dr Lim for the also very long and comprehensive comment, and the many supplementary questions. With regard to the first question, which is on the type of blood test that can be used in the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease, we are referring to C-reactive protein which is the inflammatory marker for any form of inflammation. Though non-specific for Kawasaki disease, it is a supportive investigation that helps in the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. And, of course, in cases where Kawasaki disease is highly suspected, there is also a need to order echo-cardiogram to assess the coronary vessels to look for any aneurysms or dilatation.",1,151,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00151
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The American Heart Association has come up with international guidelines in the management of Kawasaki disease as well as the evaluation of incomplete Kawasaki disease.

2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"If doctors were to follow the international guidelines issued by the American Heart Association, the definition of incomplete Kawasaki disease is defined as persistent fever with at least two signs that are suggestive of Kawasaki disease. So, in this case, the patient does have persistent fever, the patient has skin rash, bilateral sore eyes as well as cracked lips. So, this patient actually had more than two signs; he had three signs. Based on the international guidelines, supportive tests, such as C-reactive protein and echo-cardiogram, should have been ordered.",3,153,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00153
2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As to the Member's second comment on whether every child with fever or rash should therefore be investigated for Kawasaki disease, the answer is obviously no.

2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I also understand that there are many doctors who are concerned with the verdict and judgement of this case. My advice to doctors is that they should stay calm and not overreact. Secondly, do read and understand the proceedings of the DT and appreciate the rationale and considerations of the judgement. Because, very often, when doctors read the headlines, they will jump to the conclusion that, ""Oh, if I miss a fever and therefore miss a Kawasaki disease diagnosis, I will be suspended for three months"".

2017-08-01-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The advice to doctors is that we should fall back on basics first. Getting a good history and a thorough and proper clinical examination is critical in the practice of medicine. Consider any international guidelines available in the evaluation and management of the condition at hand. In the case of Kawasaki disease, the international guidelines on the evaluation of suspected incomplete Kawasaki disease and the diagnosis of management of Kawasaki disease from the American Heart Association is internationally well-known and accepted and has been there since 2004.",7,157,2017-08-01-T-006-S-00157

2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"First, new section 94A introduces mandatory participation in a marriage preparation programme for prescribed groups. We will mandate in subsidiary legislation that minor couples do so first. They will attend a pre-marriage programme approved by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), which aims to raise couples' awareness of the issues on marriage and to highlight available post-marriage support programmes and resources. A minor couple must complete the programme together before the application for marriage is made.",10,196,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00196
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"The specialised programme for minor couples comprises two components. One, premarital consultations to help them better understand, clarify and address any concerns that they and their families may have about the marriage. Two, marriage education workshops for the minor couples to learn essential skills and knowledge to build a stable marriage and family. Parents' involvement in premarital consultations, as well as parent education workshops to discuss their important supportive roles to the couple, are highly encouraged. MSF will regularly review the programme to ensure that it remains relevant and useful to couples.",11,197,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00197
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Second, under the new section 94B, parental consent will be required for a minor marriage, before the couple can make an application for solemnisation. Currently, only the consent of the wali, the lawful guardian for the marriage of a Muslim woman, is required. Going forward, consent of the parents or the guardians of the party who is a minor will also be required. There will be a list of the appropriate persons from whom consent must be sought in the various permutations, in the new Fourth Schedule. This move, Madam, thus reinforces the importance of parents' or guardians' support in a minor marriage as their guidance, especially in the crucial initial years of the marriage, is critical to help younger couples build strong marriage foundations for a lifetime.",12,198,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00198
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"It must be noted that this consent is separate from the role of the wali in a marriage contract and does not supersede the wali's approval.

2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"There may be instances where the consent of the appropriate person cannot be obtained because he or she is absent, inaccessible or under any severe disability or refuses to do so. Upon application by the couple, the Kadi, the person empowered to consider marriage applications and solemnise marriages, or his deputy, the Naib Kadi, must take due steps to satisfy himself that the consent of the person may be dispensed with. Importantly, if the appropriate person refuses to give consent, the Kadi or Naib Kadi must first give that person an opportunity to show cause as to why his or her consent should not be dispensed with. The Kadi or Naib Kadi then has the responsibility of deciding if there are good grounds to proceed with the marriage.",14,200,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00200
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Mdm Speaker, while we can do our best to strengthen marriages and families, not all marriages last the distance. Divorce rates are relatively stable, but we must guard against any rise in divorces. The Syariah Court's case records indicate that about 64% of its cases in the past five years involved at least one child of the marriage under 21 years old, with more than 85% of these involving at least one child aged under 14 years old.",15,201,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00201

2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"First, to require parties to attend a prescribed activity before commencement of divorce proceedings. The new section 46A will primarily allow the Syariah Court to ensure that couples who seek a divorce first attend its flagship Marriage Counselling Programme (MCP), to see if the marriage can be saved. Since the Syariah Court's introduction of the Programme as an administrative requirement in 2004, over 33,000 couples have been counselled and almost half of these marriages have been saved. So, I am pleased to note that the non-attendance rate for MCP has only been about 10%. The reasons for such non-attendance range from either parties being overseas, to no longer wanting to pursue a divorce. If the couple chooses to proceed with divorce, the Programme will be a platform for couples to discuss care and living arrangements for their children. Counsellors will be on hand to refer parties to specific programmes and services to address their other social needs, such as financial assistance or education support for their school-going children.",17,203,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00203
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Next, new sections 43A and 43B seek to enable the Syariah Court to refer parties for further counselling or a family support programme at any stage of their divorce proceedings. Where there is an issue of child custody or welfare, the Syariah Court may, where necessary, order a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional to examine and assess the child of the parties. The assessment will be treated as expert evidence. Another option available to the Court is to appoint a child representative, where necessary, to represent the interests of a child. Providing multiple expert but neutral layers will better protect the interests of the child amidst the divorce proceedings.",18,204,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00204
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, allow me now to move on to three proposals to strengthen our community's key institutions. For most local Muslim marriages thus far, we are accustomed to have the Kadi or Naib Kadi present to witness the solemnisation ceremony by a wali. But a small number have had their marriage solemnised by their wali without the Kadi or Naib Kadi being present, before requesting that ROMM register the marriage. During public consultations, there were serious discussions about the importance of better protecting parties to the marriage. The validity of the marriage will be impacted if the wrong wali has been appointed. The consequences are even more severe if there are children involved. There is also no protection for parties of an invalid solemnisation if there is a transfer of assets or monies, or if one party is entering the marriage unwillingly.",19,205,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00205
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Having considered this matter carefully, we seek to amend section 95 of the Act. Couples who wish their marriage to be solemnised by a wali must seek written consent from the Kadi or Naib Kadi, who must be present as a witness at the solemnisation. In so doing, the Kadi or Naib Kadi can verify that the appropriate wali has been invited to solemnise the marriage. The Kadi or Naib Kadi can also direct the couple to go through the required processes set out in AMLA, where appropriate, such as the new requirements for minor marriages, as earlier mentioned. Couples who refuse to comply will not be able to register their marriage.",20,206,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00206
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Next, for divorces, a new section 46B will allow, and therein encourage, men to apply as plaintiffs without first uttering the talak. The talak is generally perceived to be final in effecting a divorce, once the Syariah Court clarifies and adjudges that it is valid. However, it should not and must not, be seen as a quick and convenient solution. With this amendment, a husband who applies for divorce before uttering the talak can seek help with his marital woes and the Court may try to save the marriage by directing the couple to attend counselling. At the very least, the couple can have a safe space to discuss their post-divorce care arrangements for their children. Allow me to stress, Mdm Speaker, that this proposal does not affect the Muslim man's right to pronounce the talak if he still chooses to do so.",21,207,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00207
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Mdm Speaker, in Islam, a divorce is permitted as a way out of an odious companionship which can no longer achieve the objectives of marriage. However, the talak should not and cannot be taken lightly and must only be uttered when all avenues to save the marriage have been exhausted. This, Madam, accords with Islamic teachings that divorcing couples still have an obligation to treat each other fairly. We hope that Muslim husbands do not utter the talak frivolously and that couples seek appropriate help when they face marital woes.",22,208,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00208
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, we have seen the Syariah Court's roles widen beyond settling divorces amicably and delivering just outcomes, with its ""child-centric"" approach and added focus on counselling. It is thus best that the Court's resources are always used optimally, for the benefit of Muslims in Singapore. It would not be right for our Syariah Court to be used by those with few or no links to Singapore.",23,209,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00209
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"The third proposal, therefore, is to specify through section 35 of AMLA that at least one of the parties making an application at the Syariah Court must be domiciled or habitually residing in Singapore. This is for a period of at least three continuous years immediately preceding any application or before the commencement of any proceedings. For Members' benefit, this provision is already present in the Women's Charter and we are following the same parameters.",24,210,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00210
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Finally, Madam, allow me to outline a number of amendments to enhance the management of our Muslim assets, most notably our wakafs, or Muslim endowments, and our Mosque Building and MENDAKI Fund (MBMF).",25,211,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00211
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"In 2017, MUIS disbursed $3.1 million of the revenue generated from our wakafs to various beneficiaries, such as mosques, madrasahs and Muslim organisations. This amount is close to 3% more, or about $90,000, compared to the previous year. Of the total disbursement, more than $1.52 million was channelled to 27 mosques to help fund upgrading projects and to support mosque programmes. All these are a result of MUIS' management of the wakafs, which include careful planning to ensure maximisation of wakaf returns and attracting good tenants for wakaf properties.",26,212,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00212
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"So, we must continue to ensure that the wakafs are well-managed so as to maximise their potential. MUIS takes this responsibility very seriously and works closely with the trustees and those appointed to manage the wakaf, better known as mutawallis.",27,213,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00213
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"To enable MUIS to better safeguard against the mismanagement of wakafs, we will amend section 58 of AMLA to expand the grounds on which a trustee or mutawalli can be removed. This is to provide greater clarity and transparency, as well as to allow for more timely interventions to uphold the good governance of wakafs. Current provisions enable MUIS to do so when it appears that the wakaf has been mismanaged, or if there have been no trustees appointed. However, for these conditions to be met, the wakaf might already be in jeopardy.",28,214,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00214
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"The Bill, therefore, stipulates that a trustee or mutawalli can also be removed if convicted of any offence under section 64(11) of AMLA, which, among others, is committed when a mutawalli fails to furnish information or particulars as required by MUIS, or fails to allow MUIS' inspection of wakaf properties, accounts and records. Additionally, if the trustee or mutawalli has failed to comply with further rules related to wakaf, or terms or conditions imposed by MUIS as part of the appointment, he or she can also be removed.",29,215,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00215
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Secondly, to safeguard MUIS' statutory responsibility to administer all wakafs vested in it, the amended section 58 also states that any appointment of a new trustee to a wakaf will be void unless MUIS' prior approval in writing has been obtained. This is important because MUIS has to ensure that the individuals appointed as trustees are qualified to manage the wakaf. In some instances, MUIS saw disputes arise when trustees made unilateral appointments among themselves. Such trustee disputes, if left unchecked or unresolved, may adversely affect the management and upkeep of the wakaf.",30,216,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00216
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"For avoidance of doubt, the amended section 58 also specifies that a Court must not entertain or proceed with any proceedings relating to the appointment or removal of wakaf trustees and mutawallis. It is for parties to work with MUIS to address and resolve such matters. This is consistent with a High Court decision last year that the High Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over wakafs and that the power to remove or to appoint trustees lies solely with MUIS, as provided for by AMLA.",31,217,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00217
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"MUIS has established a wakaf dispute resolution framework to help address any wakaf issues or disputes that may arise. On written application to MUIS, disputing parties can undergo a mediation process conducted by a MUIS-appointed Wakaf Dispute Resolution Committee, comprising parties with legal, Syariah, and/or counselling backgrounds. Should a settlement agreement not be achieved out of this mediation process, an inquiry process will be launched and the Committee will put up a recommendation to the MUIS Council for consideration.",32,218,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00218

2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Thirdly, new section 61 seeks to allow MUIS to direct a portion of the income of the wakaf towards a sinking fund, primarily for the upkeep and development of the wakaf. For example, the sinking fund could be tapped on for carrying out building repairs or installation works, as well as the purchase of any property or asset to benefit the wakaf. This was something that many trustees and mutawallis have asked for. They see this measure as an important, long-term financial planning move for the continued viability and sustainability of the wakaf. It has been observed that many of the trust deeds of older wakafs do not specifically address the long-term upkeep of the wakaf, including that of the creation of a sinking fund to maintain it for the long run. Often, without sufficient reserves or savings set aside, the wakaf properties will fall into disrepair.",34,220,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00220
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to assure Members and stakeholders that MUIS is well aware that the income and revenue levels across all wakafs vary. We do not want this sinking fund to become a burden to the wakafs. Hence, the proportion of income to be directed to the sinking fund will be decided in close consultation with the trustees and mutawallis, with their wakafs' resources and needs of their beneficiaries being topmost considerations. I would also like to stress, Madam, that MUIS cannot be expected to tap on community funds to save those wakaf properties that have fallen into disrepair, especially where such predicaments could easily have been avoided with some financial discipline.",35,221,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00221
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Last but not least, Madam, allow me now to explain the need to better clarify the use of the MBMF in the Act, as currently covered in section 77 of AMLA. For our mosques, we want to specify that the MBMF can be tapped on for the purchase of new or additional land or property for existing and future mosques. It is already specified in AMLA that the MBMF can be used, and I quote, ""for the purpose of building mosques in Singapore and for purposes connected therewith"". Naturally, this should include the purchase or lease of land, but we see the need to make it clear and transparent in the Act.",36,222,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00222
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, as we enhance the ""hardware"" or the physical infrastructures of our mosques, we also need to ensure that the ""software"" of our religious life is strengthened. Our full-time madrasahs are one of the key pillars for this, as they train our next generation of religious teachers, or asatizahs, to guide our community. With more funding sources, such as the MBMF, the Dana Madrasah, or Madrasah Fund, Wakaf Ilmu and other grants from MUIS, our madrasahs are less preoccupied with fundraising. They have instead been able to improve the quality of education provided and concentrate more on teaching their students well. So, on this note, this Bill also specifies that the MBMF can be tapped on for building or maintenance works of any religious education premises or facilities, to ensure that our full-time madrasahs are sufficiently resourced to provide conducive learning spaces for their students.",37,223,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00223
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, to conclude, at the core of every review of the Act has been the impetus to uplift and strengthen our Muslim community and better facilitate its socio-religious life. The amendments we are proposing today seek to better protect Muslim families because they are the very building blocks of a strong and resilient community. We want to reinforce our institutions so that they are effective in serving our community. And we want to enhance the management of our assets so that the community continues to benefit from them and prosper. So, let us stay united in our commitment and resolve to develop a community of excellence, confident of its place in Singapore. And I hope the House will join me in supporting these efforts.

2017-08-01-T-011,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mdm Speaker, as shared by Minister Yaacob, the AMLA amendment Bill covers three broad areas covering steps taken to reinforce Muslim institutions, enhance the management of Muslim assets and strengthening Muslim families. In general, I am supportive of these amendments but would like to seek greater clarity in some areas.",1,226,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00226
2017-08-01-T-011,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On reinforcing Muslim institutions, the new amendment will allow men to apply for divorce as plaintiffs without pronouncing the talak. My question is  will the Syariah Court still require the pronouncement of talak at any point of time to be in accordance with Islamic law in the finalisation of the divorce? If the Muslim man's right to pronounce the talak is recognised under the Act if he still chooses to do so, how does this discourage the frivolous pronouncements of talak outside the Syariah Court? How does the Act compel the husband to file the divorce at the Syariah Court if there is pronouncement of talak outside the Syariah Court?",2,227,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00227
2017-08-01-T-011,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Next, the proposed amendments also seek to strengthen the trustee management of wakaf. I support all these enhancements and would like to make some suggestions. Would the Ministry consider having term limits for the appointment of a mutawalli or having a process in place for a mutawalli to relinquish his position upon reaching a certain age limit? This is to ensure there is good governance and succession planning in the administration of the mosque. I also support the establishment of a separate sinking fund for wakafs. Given that this amendment is intended towards a reserve for the future upkeep and development of the wakaf, I feel it is important to set a minimum percentage of the wakaf's annual net income to ensure sufficient sinking funds are available to achieve the intended outcomes. While the Bill allows the amount to be determined by the majlis after consulting the mutawalli of the wakaf, I would like to know whether the majlis has the final say on the percentage should there be any disagreement.",3,228,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00228
2017-08-01-T-011,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I would also like to iterate my support for the amendments to AMLA with regard to marriage and divorce. In terms of marriage, I am in great support for greater responsibility to be placed in involving parents for children being married under the age of 21. Marriage is a significant commitment with life-long impact on a person's life. Hence, parents and guardians should be empowered to play a more active role in such big decisions involving their children. The pre-marriage counselling sessions can also go a long way in ensuring that young couples making this huge transition in their lives can do so in a better informed manner, particularly with regard to financial matters affecting the household which, as I understand, becomes a major cause of friction in several troubled marriages.",4,229,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00229
2017-08-01-T-011,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On amendments in the Bill related to divorce, I welcome the move to adopt a more ""child-centric"" approach. I have come across cases during my Meet-the-People sessions where children are affected when the Court orders the matrimonial home of the couple to be sold. The proposed amendment will allow the Syariah Court, amongst others, to propose care and living arrangements for any child of the marriage, based on the child's interests, when there are couples intending to initiate divorce proceedings. I would like to propose that AMLA could be enhanced further to offer greater protection to the children of couples seeking divorce. This could include making sure that the children have a proper home before the matrimonial home can be sold. Madam, in Malay, please.",5,230,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00230

2017-08-01-T-011,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),Complicating the matter further are the various extremist threats which are linked to religion.

I understand this is meant for couples who are under the age of 21 years old.

In that period of time, I had the opportunity to interact with many couples who attended marriage preparation courses, as well as married couples who were facing marital challenges. Based on my experience, I believe that a marriage preparation course is necessary.

When I was initially assigned as the educator for the marriage preparation programme ""Bersama Mu"" ""With You"" organised by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports in 2006, I attended a discussion session about the ""Bersama Mu"" programme before it was officially launched. During that session, amongst the feedback received from the professionals and the asatizahs was the absence or lack of spiritual and religious values in the course syllabus.

Although he was a leader at that time, he did not use his position to force the armour to be returned to him. In fact, he used the judicial system to settle the matter. To make a long story short, the judge decided in favour of the Jewish man with the justification that Sayidina Ali did not provide concrete evidence that the armour was his. The Jewish man was truly impressed with the nature of justice portrayed by Sayidina Ali, to the point that the Jewish man admitted that the armour was not his, but that he had found it. The Jewish man returned the armour to Sayidina Ali but was rejected because Sayidina Ali said that the justice system has ascertained and proved that he was not the owner of the armour and he must respect the judge's decision.

2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Firstly, the amendment to section 35. The amendment to the Act under section 35 touches on divorce matters and aims to introduce requirements based on the period of residence. This is reasonable and should be supported. With this amendment, divorce can take place for Muslim couples who have resided in Singapore for at least three years. Hence, foreign Muslim couples who cannot fulfil this requirement are automatically not allowed to choose Singapore as the centre for their divorce. This amendment strengthens certain requirements and manages the issue of divorce from the perspective of foreign couples.",9,294,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00294
2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Second, the amendment relating to section 46B. The amendment to the Act under section 46B touches on divorce matters which will allow a man to apply to the Syariah Court for the divorce process to commence after pronouncing the talak to his wife. This is reasonable. Such actions will make the situation clearer and complete the divorce process. Although divorce is discouraged and undesirable, this kind of responsible action should be supported.",10,295,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00295
2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"However, not all divorce cases can be managed in a mature manner and end with a fair and equitable outcome. In fact, based on studies and feedback that I have obtained from Malay/Muslim social organisations, there are many divorce cases that end with the wives losing out.",11,296,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00296
2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Statistical information from random studies conducted by a VWO showed that, generally, men are the main cause of the problem of divorce within our community. Is this amendment sufficient and able to solve the problem that I mentioned? I do not think so.",12,297,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00297
2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"What we should emphasise is that men should act fairly and responsibly when divorce and its subsequent processes commence. From the moment the talak is pronounced, men should be mandated as the party that commences the divorce and its subsequent processes until its completion.",13,298,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00298

2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Madam, I will now touch on the third part, amendment to section 95. The amendment to the Act under section 95 touches on matters regarding marriage by a wali who should be approved by a Kadi from MUIS, which includes the biological father of the bride. I would like to voice my unhappiness that this amendment also includes and is imposed on the biological father of the bride.",16,301,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00301
2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"I agree and can understand why this amendment is proposed, especially if the wali involved is not the biological father of the bride. On the other hand, imposing similar requirements on the biological father is not only viewed as illogical, but it can be considered as a violation of a father's rights in the marriage of his daughter. Hence, I appeal that this amendment be given further consideration.",17,302,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00302
2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Amendment to section 58. The amendment to the Act under section 58 touches on the issue of wakaf management, which allows MUIS to manage disputes that may occur. Previously, disputes involving wakaf were usually referred to the High Court, but, now, it will only be referred to MUIS' office. Because the issue of wakaf is usually related to Syariah law, it is more appropriate for this matter to be administered by an authority like MUIS. This proposal hopes to resolve disputes in wakaf management quickly. Therefore, I think that this is a good move and positive development. I am confident that this will lead to a more proper and effective management of wakaf.",18,303,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00303
2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"The amendment to section 74 touches on the appointment of a mutawalli for wakaf management, which needs to be approved by the authorities. One difficulty faced regarding wakaf management is that it is a personal issue. Hence, how much should the authority be involved in this matter? If the appointed mutawalli is unable to perform the duty and role that should be played, should the authorities intervene and resolve it? Should a mutawalli be subject to specific requirements so that they are aware of their role and duty? What is a mutawalli expected to do when they take on this role?",19,304,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00304
2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"The proposed amendments to section 74 are complex. Without these amendments, the problem of wakaf mismanagement by a mutawalli who is unqualified and irresponsible will probably continue. It may even be more prevalent in the future if this issue is not managed immediately.",20,305,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00305
2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"On the other hand, the enforcement of this proposed amendment can be viewed as an intrusion into a private matter regarding wakaf management.

2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),I feel that the best solution to this matter is through education. Each mutawalli should be trained and taught about the responsibility and role that they should play. Any failure on their part to deliver what is expected of them should result in intervention by the authorities.,22,307,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00307
2017-08-01-T-011,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"The final point that I would like to highlight is about hibah in connection with HDB flats. There was a case in the High Court dated 11 July 2017 which featured someone who should have inherited an HDB flat in accordance with a hibah agreement, but was rejected by HDB on the basis that the agreement using hibah cannot be accepted by HDB and it contravenes HDB's rules. This clearly showed that hibah in connection with HDB flats is still not accepted. I would like to suggest that an amendment should immediately be made to AMLA and that synchronisation with HDB rules should be done, so that this issue of hibah in connection with HDB flats can be resolved.",23,308,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00308

On section 43A and B, can we be updated on how good the compliance rate is with counselling that has been implemented and conducted thus far? What are some of the more pressing reasons for defaulters and how are we able to work with the couples involved to reduce the rate in future cases, especially as we are making certain practices compulsory with this new amendment?

The procedures and processes highlighted are a necessity and help keep checks and balances in couples considering divorce. However, how do we ensure that the timeline for these processes and waiting times are within certain set limits and KPIs as, very often, we hear of issues and feedback pertaining to the long waiting and processing times which may drag on for months and, in some cases, even years? Perhaps, setting an average timeline or a range of timelines would be useful because the families tend to suffer during this waiting period. Despite being time consuming, I do feel that this counselling is important as it can be the point where couples are made to realise the potential for reconciliation, thus saving their marriages and families.",5,315,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00315

The Minister has elaborated earlier, but I would like to still enquire  are there specific guidelines which need to be adhered to with is new amendment? Can the Minister also elaborate on the ""education component"" of MBMF and what exactly it can be used for because there was mention of a Wakaf Ilmu and the Madrasah Fund?

I also support the provision to use MBMF, as stated in clause 19 to amend section 77. I agree with this provision which enables MBMF monies to be used for mosque maintenance works and educational facilities in these mosques, as well as in full-time madrasahs. However, I would also like to ask the Minister whether MBMF can also be used to procure land to build mosques and, if so, is there a prescribed limit, in percentage terms, to use the MBMF monies for this purpose.",6,337,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00337

2017-08-01-T-011,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"The amendments to section 95 are apt. I have previously interacted with women who married their husbands as the second, third or fourth wife without registering their marriage with ROMM and the marriage was solemnised by their own father or relative. This is because their husband's first wife did not agree for the husband to marry again. Hence, this marriage is unregistered and there is no marriage certificate.",11,342,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00342

2017-08-01-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The genesis of AMLA could be traced back to the time when Singapore was a British colony. During that period, there was an acknowledgement that whilst English law was to apply in Singapore, it needed to be appropriately modified to respect the religious beliefs and customs of the local inhabitants. The enactment of the 1880 Mahomedan Muslim Ordinance reflected the official legislative recognition of the status of Muslim personal law. This ordinance was replaced by the Muslim Ordinance and, subsequently, evolved into AMLA we see today.",2,353,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00353
2017-08-01-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I believe this historical perspective is relevant as it provides an insight as to why Muslims in Singapore are governed by a separate law in respect of certain matters like marriage and divorce.

2017-08-01-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Based on my observations of issues that I have come across in the course of my practice and my discussions with other lawyers, I would like to highlight two areas to be reviewed and included as amendments to AMLA.",5,356,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00356
2017-08-01-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),One issue relates to the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. I welcome the amendment to section 35 to require either party to a marriage to be domiciled in Singapore or habitually resident in Singapore for a period of at least three years before the Syariah Court has jurisdiction to hear matters. It is indeed important for there to be a connecting factor before the Syariah Court exercises its jurisdiction.,6,357,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00357
2017-08-01-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I would like to ask the Minister to consider amending the provision on jurisdiction further to grant powers to the Syariah Court to hear ancillary matters when a divorce had been registered overseas. Currently, in such situations where a divorce was granted by a court of competent jurisdiction overseas, the Syariah Court can make an order on nafkah iddah and mutaah, which are entitlements to the Muslim wife, but not an order on the division of matrimonial assets. Parties would typically have to go to the civil Court, the High Court, to obtain the appropriate orders. I note that there had been developments in this matter as the Court of Appeal in the case of TMO vs TMP had found that there is no lacuna in the law and that chapter 4A of the Women's Charter, which empowers the High Court to order financial relief upon divorce granted by competent courts overseas, can apply to Muslims. This decision is helpful in clarifying and confirming that parties involved in a Muslim divorce overseas have some recourse.",7,358,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00358
2017-08-01-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I believe though there is much value in resolving the root of the problem through legislation. In particular, it will allow for one Court − the Syariah Court − to deal holistically with all the ancillary matters, including nafkah iddah and mutaah. I understand the Muslim Law Practice Committee of the Law Society had put up their recommendations and had made an extensive argument in respect of this matter. I hope that these recommendations will be reviewed and appropriate amendments to AMLA be made.",8,359,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00359
2017-08-01-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The other issue which I would like to highlight relates to inheritance distribution in accordance to faraid principles. The underlying spirit or rationale behind the faraid principles is actually one of fairness. The ones who get a larger share are the ones who are supposed to care for the more vulnerable beneficiaries within the family. However, in practice, often what is seen, is an assertion of rights and entitlement to the share of inheritance, without an appreciation of the duties and obligations towards the other beneficiaries. Currently, the Syariah Court issues the Inheritance Certificate upon the provision of a statutory declaration. No determination or adjudication of rights, entitlements and obligations is done at the Syariah Court. If there is a dispute, the matter can be brought to the civil Courts.",9,360,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00360
2017-08-01-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"There is some dissatisfaction on the ground in respect of the current state of affairs, especially by those affected by the strict compliance of the principles and who do not seek the appropriate legal recourse. I feel that there is also a lack of knowledge and understanding of the nuances of Islamic principles on this matter. I appreciate that there is no simple solution. There may be several approaches to take and each comes with it, different challenges.",10,361,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00361
2017-08-01-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"One possible approach may be to grant powers to the Syariah Court or create a separate tribunal to oversee the issues relating to the inheritance distribution, including issues relating to the Muslim will, nuzriah, hibah and enforcement of the beneficiaries' duties. That would require appropriate manpower allocation and expertise. I note that, currently, the civil Courts, applying Muslim law, has jurisdiction to deal with matters involving a Muslim estate. I also note the legal position that the determination of rights and interests is subject to the general law in Singapore. There are, perhaps, other approaches in looking at provisions to allow Muslim dependants to claim against the estate or setting out detailed provisions in AMLA in relation to nuzriah or hibah.",11,362,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00362

2017-08-01-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In this regard, I wish to add that fellow lawyers, in particular those who sit on the Muslim Law Practice Committee, have expressed their desire to continue to be involved in discussions with the Syariah Court and MUIS to work on further developments of Muslim law in Singapore. I hope the appropriate division in the Ministry will follow up with them so that more ideas can be generated through discourse and possible collaboration.

So, I rise in support of the Bill. But I would like to raise questions on some areas which I feel we can enhance further.",1,372,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00372
2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"MUIS has, over the years, contributed significantly to the welfare of the Muslim community with their policies and programmes. They have been presiding over the wakaf dispute resolutions and it is certainly a wise move to clarify and strengthen their responsibilities and powers with regard to this. No doubt, this will help to streamline the resolution process. For example, the new section 58(7), which is intended to be seen as a clarification to section 63 of AMLA which specifies that the Court is only brought in if the Majlis or MUIS finds ""the meaning or effect of any instrument or declaration creating or affecting any wakaf or nazar is obscure or uncertain"".",2,373,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00373
2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"However, despite these changes, what happens if MUIS, one day, for example, becomes a potential litigant itself? Should there be a conflict of interest pertaining to MUIS, the prosecuted parties will certainly take issue with natural justice. Moreover, giving MUIS absolute responsibility could be seen as a move that denies the public transparency and access to wakaf issues.",3,374,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00374
2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In fair and responsible governance, it is wise not to grant any statutory board or organisation absolute authority, no matter how capable or reputable they have proven to be.

2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Aside from highlighting MUIS' authority in the management of wakaf matters, it would also be prudent to look into improving and standardising the management of wakafs across the country. MUIS could help to develop rules and policies relevant to the enhanced management and governance of wakafs. The various proposals to enhance the management of wakafs are to be welcomed, as accountability helps ensure that the wakaf is maintained and developed well.",5,376,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00376
2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"With clearer and better management policies, the frequency of conflicts would be reduced. I would also propose that the relevant parties in a dispute should be granted a more public channel to voice their grievances under the existing wakaf dispute resolutions framework. This will help to allay public concerns about transparency and accountability. In this case, can the Minister share if there has been any specific impetus that has created the need to specify further grounds for removal of a trustee or mutawalli? In addition, should disputing parties not agree with the Wakaf Dispute Resolution Committee and the eventual decision by the MUIS Council, would they have any other avenues for recourse?",6,377,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00377
2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"On a related note – I think the Minister mentioned it – I echo sentiments from the community to dedicate more resources from MBMF towards supporting madrasahs. The Minister mentioned just now about section 77 specifying adequate resources in a more timely manner, for terrorist groups are abusing misinterpretations and misunderstanding towards religious texts to incite hatred and violence. Religion remains a fundamental aspect of the lives of many young Muslims and madrasahs play an important role in training asatizah, who are potential powerful influencers with regard to religion and education matters. So, section 77 is very timely. Mdm Speaker, let me speak in Malay.",7,378,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00378

2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Ultimately, children are the ones hardest hit in divorces. It is, therefore, the right move to implement mandatory counselling or family support programmes for couples with children at any stage of their divorce. Engaging experts to assess and examine a child's well-being is a clear indication that the policy seeks to be child-centric.",9,380,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00380
2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But, while counselling and mediating sessions are good in theory, not all parties may be cooperative. I am pleased to note that an absence of one party at these counselling sessions will not result in a delay of the divorce proceedings. This is especially important when either party or children are at risk in cases of domestic violence. My concern, however, is that without both party's attendance and cooperation in a divorce case, it may be difficult to implement some support programmes. For example, a parent who has de facto care of the children may deny access to the other party, even if mutual support for the best interest of the children is recommended. Counselling only works if the relevant parties are willing to put their best efforts into it. For example, a marriage counselling session with just one attendee is unlikely to help the couple. Hence, I would like to ask whether there are consequences for non-compliance of an order to attend counselling.",10,381,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00381
2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In addition, I note that there is no distinction of categories of persons required to undergo counselling and mediation. I think a couple who has mutually and amicably decided to end their marriage due to personality conflicts, and a couple who is divorcing because one party has exhibited dangerous domestic violence tendencies, would require very different types of support for the involved parties and their children. My point is that different needs arise from varying circumstances and also the external amount of support they have access to, such as their family members. It would be more efficient to streamline the process by categorising, for instance, the types of conflicts and reasons for divorce and their possible needs before embarking on the counselling and support process.",11,382,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00382
2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Overseas divorces presided by a foreign Shariah court present another challenge as they could result in complex ancillary issues. In February this year, the Straits Times reported a case in which a man had divorced his wife in 2012 in the Johor Syariah Subordinate Court, allegedly without telling her. When the woman applied to the Singapore Syariah Court to divide their assets, the Court did not have jurisdiction to do so as it was not the Court that dissolved the marriage. Under Muslim law, it was only able to award her, against her former husband, an amount of maintenance and gift that was far less than the value of the assets that was up for division. The application for asset division was then brought up to the High Court, which also turned down the application.",12,383,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00383
2017-08-01-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"This is a classic case whereby, if both the Singapore Syariah Court and High Court do not have jurisdiction, the husband can avoid having the matrimonial property rightfully divided. This puts women in Muslim marriages in a vulnerable position. The local Syariah Court should be empowered to make orders on ancillary issues pertaining to overseas divorces. I feel that it is important to do so.",13,384,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00384

In fact, I think marriage counselling is very important for all couples, regardless of their religion. Divorce rates are on the rise and marriage and family expectations are vastly different from those of earlier generations. Some advice from parents may be rendered obsolete due to the circumstances of the current generation. Moreover, Muslim marriages are a little different in the sense that laws pertaining to them are governed by the Syariah Court and the awareness may be lacking among some young Muslims.",14,385,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00385

Nevertheless, I believe it is still ideal to have it. Unfortunately, it is human nature to believe one does not require advice until they encounter a situation where they need help. Perhaps, offering incentives could help to increase interest.",15,386,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00386

Let me emphasise that counselling goes beyond reconciliation and saving marriages. Counselling provides the safe space to discuss the implications of divorce and enables parties to receive proper guidance on self-care and post-divorce arrangements for the children of the marriage. As regards the timelines post-counselling, if the parties are amicable and come to an agreement on the divorce and ancillary matters, their case can be completed within three to six months. However, there are typically 30% of cases that are either acrimonious in nature or more complex with multi-faceted issues.

If one party deliberately tries to stall proceedings, the Court has the option to order a stay in proceedings until the defaulting party attends the prescribed activity, or even order costs to be paid to the other party. The conduct of parties often gives the Court insights into the parents' relationship with their child and, if there is a clear disinterest or lack of cooperation, such conduct could be relevant for the Court in its subsequent deliberations on custody and access orders. I would also like to assure Members that there is a ""triage"" system in place to determine the level of urgency that cases are accorded − irreconcilable divorce cases with a risk of domestic violence, for instance, will be expedited for the safety of the victim.",14,423,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00423

The Court eventually allowed the appeal for the wife to seek financial relief at the High Court, on the basis that chapter 4A of Part X of the Women's Charter can apply to Muslims where necessary.

Trustee management is critical to the management of the wakaf, because the accountability that comes with trusteeship helps ensure that the wakaf is maintained and developed well.

2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"The values within the Code are easily relatable to the wider community, such as recognising diverse opinions and schools of thought in Islam, not denigrating any racial or religious group and not advocating any idea that is likely to encourage extremism or violence. To answer Assoc Prof Fatimah's query, there are, indeed, processes in place to assess if an asatizah has breached the Code of Ethics. The Asatizah Recognition Board will assess the matter and will subsequently put up a recommendation to MUIS on the next course of action.",31,440,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00440
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Another aspect of the Rules is that all individuals who wish to teach or preach Islam must be recognised under the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS). Our asatizahs bear the heavy responsibility of providing the Singapore Muslim community with sound religious guidance amidst an increasingly diverse socio-religious landscape. They are also our leaders in preventing problematic ideologies and practices from taking root. The ARS thus seeks to raise the professionalism and quality of our asatizahs and ensure that they continue to be a key source of confidence for the community, one with strong professional qualifications and training to provide guidance on the practice of Islam in a modern, multi-religious and multi-racial society.",32,441,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00441
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, the battle against radical ideologies cannot be won by legislation alone. MUIS, together with its community partners, has been working closely and putting in much effort over the years to build the resilience of the Muslim community against threats and undesirable influences. These range from offering more customised religious education programmes and classes, to having outreach events and dialogues with parents and youths on complex, contemporary matters and providing counselling in ""safe spaces"" for those who require assistance or advice.",33,442,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00442

They remind me of the equally warm reception we received during the public consultations, where many of our stakeholders and community leaders saw this review as a step in the right direction. It was heartening that, from the very start, people saw this as an opportunity to work with the Government to strengthen our community. Many, indeed, came with valuable ideas and suggestions − some we have incorporated in this round of amendments, while some others we will continue to study with our partners to find the best way forward. What remains important is that we must continue working together, for we will always be stronger when we are united. And it is this very spirit and confidence that will see us through, no matter what the challenges are, to an even brighter future.

2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Thanks to the determination and cooperation between families and community organisations, the marriage and divorce statistics of the community have shown improvement. Although the number of marriages has increased, marriages involving minor couples have decreased and the divorce rate has remained stable. However, marriages involving minor couples are still vulnerable to higher risks. Therefore, a compulsory marriage preparation programme will be introduced, starting with minor couples. Parents or guardians must give consent before the couple can register to be married. This aims to provide a solid foundation to such couples in their early years in order to pave the way towards a lasting marriage.",37,446,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00446

Nonetheless, we must increase our efforts to prevent a rising trend of divorces. Therefore, the Syariah Court's jurisdiction will be expanded to ensure that couples who wish to divorce attend the Marriage Counselling Programme. The Syariah Court will also be given powers to appoint an expert who will represent the interests of a child whose parents are undergoing a divorce. This is important in order to ensure that the child's welfare is looked after in any divorce.",38,447,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00447
2017-08-01-T-011,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Mdm Speaker, in our efforts to reinforce Muslim institutions, I have tabled three amendments. First, couples who wish to register their marriage must obtain written consent from the Kadi or the Naib Kadi. The Kadi or Naib Kadi must also be present to witness the solemnisation of the marriage. This is to ensure that only the rightful wali is appointed so that the marriage is lawful in Islam. Second, a husband is allowed and encouraged to apply for divorce before uttering the talak. This will allow the Syariah Court to help save the marriage through counselling. We would like to stress that the utterance of talak is a last resort and should not be used frivolously. Third, in order to ensure that the Syariah Court's resources are used optimally, cases will be heard only if at least one party filing the application is habitually residing in Singapore for a period of at least three consecutive years.",39,448,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00448

In 2016, MUIS distributed over $3 million of revenue generated from wakaf properties to mosques, madrasahs and Muslim organisations. This is achieved due to careful planning by MUIS and close cooperation between the trustees and mutawalli or those appointed to manage the wakafs. In order to enhance capabilities in wakaf management, MUIS will be given powers to revoke the appointment of a wakaf trustee or administrator if there is any evidence of wrongdoing. This measure is important to ensure that the wakaf property is administered professionally and transparently. MUIS will also be given powers to direct that a portion of the wakaf's income be transferred to a sinking fund to upgrade and develop the wakaf property.",40,449,2017-08-01-T-011-S-00449

Public sector officers can get an additional four weeks of unpaid leave when they have children below the age of one. This will give parents the option to take more leave if they need to. In total, couples with at least one spouse in the public service can have up to six months of leave between them.

2017-08-01-T-024,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will (i) consider further measures to ban smoking at open windows of residential properties and (ii) review and mandate the provision of closed smoking rooms in residential properties for smokers to smoke so as not to affect non-smoking residents.,1,642,2017-08-01-T-024-S-00642
2017-08-01-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,My Ministry's long-term goal is to prohibit smoking in all public areas except at designated smoking areas to protect non-smokers from the harmful health effects of second-hand tobacco smoke.,1,643,2017-08-01-T-024-S-00643
2017-08-01-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the years, my Ministry has progressively extended the smoking prohibition to more public areas. In 2013, the smoking prohibition was extended to the common areas in residential buildings, including common corridors, covered walkways, lift lobbies and stairwells.",2,644,2017-08-01-T-024-S-00644
2017-08-01-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our regulatory ambit does not extend to prohibiting smoking within one’s own residential property. At the Parliament sitting in August last year, we had informed the Member that smoking within one's residential property, which is a private space, is not prohibited and beyond the Government's jurisdiction. The Government has no plans to mandate the provision of closed smoking rooms in residential properties. In this respect, we encourage smokers to be socially responsible and considerate when smoking so that their neighbours living in close proximity would not be affected by the wafting of second-hand smoke.",3,645,2017-08-01-T-024-S-00645
2017-08-01-T-024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Residents who are affected by the wafting of second-hand tobacco smoke from their neighbour's residences should try to reach out to them to resolve the issues amicably. Residents can also approach the Community Mediation Centre for assistance.,4,646,2017-08-01-T-024-S-00646
2017-08-01-T-025,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) whether the Ministry will consider regulating hire-purchase schemes that incorporate upfront cash back to hirers as these schemes contain features akin to moneylending.,1,647,2017-08-01-T-025-S-00647
2017-08-01-T-025,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) whether cashback features in hire-purchase schemes constitute a form of moneylending; (b) whether such schemes are de facto unsecured loans when goods depreciate quickly; (c) in 2016, what proportion of buyers have defaulted on their payments for three months or more; (d) whether such a market is sub-prime; and (e) whether additional regulation is needed.",1,648,2017-08-01-T-025-S-00648
2017-08-01-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Today, hire purchase schemes and moneylending activities are regulated under the Hire Purchase Act and the Moneylenders Act respectively.",1,649,2017-08-01-T-025-S-00649
2017-08-01-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Hire purchase is one of a range of options that consumers can choose from to finance their purchases. Hire purchase schemes are private commercial arrangements. We do not have information on the number of hire purchase schemes in the market and the default rates of such schemes.,2,650,2017-08-01-T-025-S-00650
2017-08-01-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,The various consumer financing options come with different terms and conditions to cater to the different needs of consumers. Some business schemes offer upfront cashback and gifts to attract consumers.,3,651,2017-08-01-T-025-S-00651
2017-08-01-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"However, consumers should be aware of the tradeoffs between the different schemes available in the market. For example, schemes without any upfront cashback or gifts typically have lower interest rates and the repayment period is shorter. Conversely, schemes with very attractive upfront cashback or gifts, come with much higher interest rates and a longer repayment period. The total amount that consumers pay for their purchases would be higher under such schemes, potentially more than double the value of the goods they purchase.",4,652,2017-08-01-T-025-S-00652
2017-08-01-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Hire Purchase Act specifies the minimum information that companies must provide to consumers in writing before they enter into a hire purchase agreement. This includes information on the charges for early settlement of the agreement; effective interest rates; interest rates for overdue instalments and administrative charges. We strongly encourage consumers to review the terms carefully and assess their ability to meet the financial commitments before signing the agreement. The Monetary Authority of Singapore will also be working with MoneySENSE, the national financial education programme, to raise consumer awareness on business schemes that come with upfront cashback.",5,653,2017-08-01-T-025-S-00653
2017-08-01-T-025,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"While upfront cashback payment to consumers does not constitute moneylending under the Moneylenders Act, it is still a form of credit extension to consumers. The Government is watching closely the practice of businesses offering significant cashback amounts with their schemes. We take a serious view of business practices that irresponsibly entice consumers to take up excessive credit and will not hesitate to take action or review our regulations, if necessary, to restrict such practices.",6,654,2017-08-01-T-025-S-00654
2017-08-01-T-026,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Finance (a) in the past five years, how many cases of illegal sales of contraband cigarettes have been reported and the sellers charged; (b) how many of them caught in such illegal activity are locals and foreigners respectively; and (c) whether the existing penalty is sufficient to deter such illegal activity or to encourage the sellers to work with authorities to locate the ultimate beneficiary.",1,655,2017-08-01-T-026-S-00655
2017-08-01-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Strong enforcement efforts and close-interagency collaboration have kept the peddling of contraband cigarettes in check. From 2012 to 2016, the number of peddlers caught remained relatively stable, averaging about 400 per year. About 80% of those arrested were charged in Court, while the rest were issued a composition sum or stern warning.",1,656,2017-08-01-T-026-S-00656
2017-08-01-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In the same period, the total number of contraband cigarette offenders caught each year, which includes smugglers, peddlers and buyers, fell by 29% from 28,502 in 2012 to 20,147 in 2016.",2,657,2017-08-01-T-026-S-00657
2017-08-01-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The Member also asked whether existing penalties are sufficient deterrents. In 2012, we enhanced the penalties for dealing in contraband cigarettes. Upon conviction, for first-time offenders, a minimum Court fine of $2,000 would be imposed, and the maximum Court fine is 20 times the amount of the taxes evaded. For repeat offenders caught with more than 2kilogramme of contraband tobacco products, mandatory imprisonment of up to six years was also introduced. To date, our penalties have been effective in keeping the contraband cigarette situation in check.",3,658,2017-08-01-T-026-S-00658
2017-08-01-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,Singapore Customs will continue to work with other enforcement agencies to deter the buying and selling of contraband cigarettes. We will also continue to actively engage the public to raise awareness on this issue.,4,659,2017-08-01-T-026-S-00659
2017-08-01-T-027,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Health (a) how many Pioneers currently receive payouts under the Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme; (b) what has been the number of applications each year since the scheme was introduced; (c) what percentage has been successful each year; (d) what has been the number of uncompleted applications each year; and (e) whether the Ministry assesses that the scheme has been effective in addressing the needs of Pioneers with disabilities.,1,660,2017-08-01-T-027-S-00660
2017-08-01-T-027,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme (PioneerDAS) was introduced in September 2014 as part of the Pioneer Generation (PG) Package for a special generation of Singaporeans. PioneerDAS is one of the measures amongst broader Government support for long-term care, which includes means-tested subsidies at senior care centres and nursing homes, the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund and the Foreign Domestic Worker Grant. The Government also provides public assistance, Comcare and MediFund for those who face financial difficulties and need more help.",1,661,2017-08-01-T-027-S-00661
2017-08-01-T-027,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"From its launch in September 2014 to end 2014, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) received around 6,700 applications. The application numbers in 2015 and 2016 were about 9,000 and 8,600 respectively. About 95% of applications have been approved.",2,662,2017-08-01-T-027-S-00662
2017-08-01-T-027,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To help more Pioneers, AIC has extended automatic PioneerDAS inclusion to Pioneers receiving payouts under ElderShield or the Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly, or those who qualify for the Foreign Domestic Worker Grant. This auto-inclusion has benefited an additional 15,000 Pioneers.",3,663,2017-08-01-T-027-S-00663
2017-08-01-T-028,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi,asked the Minister for Health (a) how safe are the public hospitals in terms of security protection; (b) whether the Ministry will consider providing 24/7 security services by the Home Team as it had done in the past; and (c) how prepared are the hospitals in tackling a terrorist attack in such open premises.,1,664,2017-08-01-T-028-S-00664
2017-08-01-T-028,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH has been working with MHA on the security protection of our public hospitals. Each hospital has put in place preventive security measures, physical security operations, contingency plans covering incident response and consequence management to deal with different scenarios and threat levels, including terrorist incidents. Assessments are carried out regularly on the competencies of the security personnel. In addition, there are programmes to raise security awareness among staff, patients and visitors. Hospitals also conduct regular training and exercises, including with the Home Team forces.",1,665,2017-08-01-T-028-S-00665
2017-08-01-T-028,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In the event of a security incident, our public hospitals are resourced with their own security personnel onsite who can provide immediate response to ""deny, delay and contain"", while waiting for the arrival of Home Team quick response forces where necessary. The plan also covers appropriate actions by staff, patients and visitors, including evacuation.",2,666,2017-08-01-T-028-S-00666
2017-08-01-T-028,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Our public hospitals are receiving ongoing support from Home Team agencies. They have participated in the Safety and Security Watch Group scheme with the Police and SCDF to strengthen the safety and security of their patients and staff on their premises and learn from good practices. The majority of public hospitals have also signed up as Project Guardian members and their security personnel are trained to react and complement Police response to an incident. The Police conduct regular patrols at public hospitals and their vicinity. These include patrols by the Emergency Response Teams, who are trained and equipped to respond to a terrorist incident. During periods of heightened alert, the Home Team may deploy additional forces to beef up the security of the hospitals.",3,667,2017-08-01-T-028-S-00667

2017-08-01-T-029,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether any study has been done to determine the preparedness of our population for any emergency.,1,669,2017-08-01-T-029-S-00669
2017-08-01-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Emergency preparedness is fundamentally about building confidence in our ability to respond to an emergency. To gauge the emergency preparedness of our population, we can look at three facets  first, awareness and knowledge of the types of emergencies that we may face and what needs to be done in each scenario; second, whether the population is taking active steps to pick up the skills required to respond in an emergency; and third, whether the population will stay united and resilient in the face of crisis.",1,670,2017-08-01-T-029-S-00670
2017-08-01-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In 2015, the National Security Awareness Survey (NSAS) found that our residents were generally aware of the range of possible emergency scenarios and were confident of our ability to respond to the emergencies as a nation. Between 80% and 90% of respondents felt that the Government is well prepared to deal with crises, such as a terrorist attack, communal riot, health pandemic and shortages of water, food and energy.",2,671,2017-08-01-T-029-S-00671
2017-08-01-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"While respondents generally felt that they were less prepared as individuals compared to the Government in dealing with crises, the NSAS findings suggested that they would be better prepared if they had encountered a similar emergency scenario before. For instance, our residents felt they were most prepared to deal with a health pandemic, likely due to their past experiences with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009.",3,672,2017-08-01-T-029-S-00672
2017-08-01-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the second facet of skills, our residents have been taking practical steps to prepare themselves to respond to an emergency. The 2015 NSAS found that more than 50% of our residents have a First-Aid kit at home; for those without a First-Aid kit, 80% of them knew where to find the essential items in their homes for use in first aid. There was also increasing alertness to suspicious behaviour, items and activities. Likewise, an increasing number of people are aware of what to do when they hear a SCDF public warning siren.",4,673,2017-08-01-T-029-S-00673
2017-08-01-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, on unity and resilience, the survey found that 90% of our people believed that everyone has a role to play in ensuring our nation's safety and security and were willing to help others during emergencies. About 80% also believed that we will stand united, regardless of race or religion, and that Singapore will continue to function effectively in times of crisis.",5,674,2017-08-01-T-029-S-00674

To help members of the public pick up useful skills, the Home Team and our partners have introduced various advisories, tools and programmes. These include the series of revamped Emergency Preparedness Days which is being rolled out to all constituencies to give residents the opportunity to observe a live terrorist attack exercise in their neighbourhood and pick up relevant emergency preparedness skills.",7,676,2017-08-01-T-029-S-00676

2017-08-01-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Besides preparing our community to handle terror attacks, we also conduct regular Safety & Security Watch Group (SSWG) exercises at commercial and industrial premises. In these exercises, businesses, their in-house security as well as their Company Emergency Response Team (CERT) practise their contingency plans with responders from the Police and Civil Defence. This helps businesses validate their workplace crisis response capabilities and ensure that they are able to undertake critical functions, such as basic fire-fighting, cordoning and evacuation, in the initial phases of an emergency, before the authorities arrive.",9,678,2017-08-01-T-029-S-00678

2017-08-01-T-033,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Each residential unit is designed as a fire compartment to prevent the spread of fire to adjacent units. Fire-rated entrance door, walls and floors constructed of concrete and masonry will act as effective fire barriers. Common corridors and lift lobbies are also designed to be naturally ventilated for quick smoke dispersal. An adequate number of exit staircases located at an allowable distance from the unit entrances provide a safe means of escape out of the building in the event of a fire.",2,703,2017-08-01-T-033-S-00703

2017-08-01-T-033,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For standalone residential blocks, fire alarm systems and sprinkler systems are currently not required by the Fire Code due to the low risk of fire spread. However, for mixed developments, where there is integration of different uses – residential, commercial, social, communal and carparks – sprinkler or fire alarm systems will be installed, where required, by the Fire Code.",4,705,2017-08-01-T-033-S-00705

2017-08-01-T-034,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mayflies are a type of small flying insects that are found in freshwater streams, rivers and reservoirs. They are not vectors, that is, they neither bite nor transmit diseases. In fact, mayflies are universally recognised as indicators of good water quality. They are also key for a balanced ecosystem as they are food for a variety of animals who live in our reservoirs. Mayfly larvae can only live in clean and clear water and they emerge from the water when they are adults to mate for a very short period of time. While mayflies can be found in all our reservoirs, they have been particularly abundant in Lower Seletar Reservoir.",1,707,2017-08-01-T-034-S-00707
2017-08-01-T-034,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB receives a handful of feedback through the year – December-March and July-September – on the emergence of mayflies around the HDB blocks in Nee Soon South near Lower Seletar Reservoir. Their emergence is seasonal and lasts for a short period of time, about one to two weeks, as each adult can only live for a few days. While mayflies may be an occasional nuisance, they are harmless insects that occur naturally in areas around our reservoirs.",2,708,2017-08-01-T-034-S-00708
2017-08-01-T-034,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB has provided advice to residents who wish to take measures to prevent mayflies from entering their homes. These include switching off their lights when not in use as mayflies are attracted to light, installing insect screens at their windows or drawing their curtains, if needed. PUB has been carrying out regular checks around Lower Seletar Reservoir to monitor the counts of mayflies. Routine fogging for general pest control and mosquito control are carried out around the reservoir grounds and this routine fogging will also kill mayflies.",3,709,2017-08-01-T-034-S-00709
2017-08-01-T-034,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I would like to once again assure members and residents of Nee Soon South that mayflies are harmless insects and an essential part of our natural aquatic ecosystem.

2017-08-01-T-035,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB was first alerted to a crocodile sighting in Sungei Sembawang on 10 March 2017. Follow-up inspections at the reported location were conducted, together with AVA, to confirm the sightings. However, during the joint-inspections, AVA and PUB did not spot any crocodile in the area. There are safety railings and ""do-not-enter"" warning signs installed along Sungei Sembawang to deter people from entering the waterway. As an additional precaution, PUB is installing wire mesh at the lower rungs of the railings at the reported location to act as a physical barrier between the water and the footpath. This will be completed by end August.",2,713,2017-08-01-T-035-S-00713
2017-08-01-T-035,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Before this recent spate of sightings at Sungei Sembawang, there have been four confirmed sightings in our reservoirs over the past five years. Currently, the crocodile has stayed within the waterway. Nevertheless, we are monitoring the situation with AVA and we will take steps to trap and relocate it, should the reptile venture outside its inland habitat. Notwithstanding this, should members of the public encounter a crocodile, they should remain calm and keep a safe distance away from it. The public are reminded to not approach, provoke or feed the animal. They should also not enter the waterways at all times.",3,714,2017-08-01-T-035-S-00714

2017-08-01-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Today, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) requires all manufacturers, importers and wholesalers of drugs to be licensed. To ensure traceability and supply chain integrity, they will need to keep records for every receipt and supply of drugs and comply with standards in distribution.

In addition, HSA carries out post-market surveillance on quality or safety concerns arising from drugs.",1,716,2017-08-01-T-036-S-00716
2017-08-01-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"HSA agrees that a standardised bar-coding system can further improve drug traceability. Unfortunately, there is yet to be an internationally harmonised bar-coding standard for drug manufacturers and suppliers. Given our small market size, imposing our own requirement for all drug manufacturers and suppliers to adopt a standard bar-code could lead to companies being deterred from bringing their drugs into Singapore or passing on the additional cost to patients. This would not be beneficial to Singaporeans.",2,717,2017-08-01-T-036-S-00717
2017-08-01-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"HSA will continue to monitor international developments in this area. At the same time, it will continue to improve on its current system on drug safety and traceability.",3,718,2017-08-01-T-036-S-00718

2017-08-01-T-037,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"From 2014 to 2016, about 30,000 CPF members have successfully applied for loans under the CPF Education Scheme to pay for their children's tuition fees. Over the same period, about 98% of outstanding loans due for repayment were fully settled.",2,721,2017-08-01-T-037-S-00721
2017-08-01-T-037,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked whether children can repay the outstanding education loan using their CPF savings instead of cash.

2017-08-01-T-037,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"We recognise that some students may find it difficult to repay the loan immediately after graduation. Hence, students are only required to start repaying the loan one year upon graduation or after leaving their course of study. This gives them some time to find a job before starting repayments. Students who face difficulty repaying the full loan amount can apply for deferment or choose to make payments via monthly instalments for up to 12 years.",4,723,2017-08-01-T-037-S-00723
2017-08-01-T-038,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider making it mandatory for employers to provide paid annual home leave to foreign domestic workers (FDWs).,1,724,2017-08-01-T-038-S-00724
2017-08-01-T-038,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Home leave arrangements, like those for rest days, are mutually agreed between FDWs and employers. In MOM's FDW Study 2015, 56% of FDWs said they were provided with home leave either annually or at the point of renewal of their work passes. In addition, some employers also grant additional compassionate leave to their FDWs to deal with issues arising from unforeseen family circumstances back home.",1,725,2017-08-01-T-038-S-00725
2017-08-01-T-038,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Making annual home leave compulsory for all may not be practical given that households have very different needs and home care arrangements. Unlike companies that have a pool of employees to cover for those on leave, household employers typically employ only one FDW and will have to make significant adjustments to look for alternative arrangements when FDWs go on home leave. At the same time, some FDWs might prefer to be paid more in lieu of annual home leave. As such, the current approach provides greater flexibility for both FDWs and employers to mutually agree to leave arrangements as part of the employment contracts.",2,726,2017-08-01-T-038-S-00726
2017-08-01-T-038,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Whatever the arrangements, employers are expected to ensure the well-being of their FDWs throughout their stay in Singapore.

2017-08-01-T-046,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"LUP was introduced in 2001 to provide direct lift access to flats and enhance convenience for residents, especially the elderly and less mobile. At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks where not all dwelling units have direct lift access. Among them, more than 1,000 blocks were initially found to be unfeasible for LUP due to cost or technical constraints.",1,762,2017-08-01-T-046-S-00762
2017-08-01-T-046,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions to help flats in these affected blocks achieve direct lift access. Some examples of solutions that have been successfully implemented include lifts that do not have a machine room at the top of the shafts, that is, machine room-less lifts, creation of new entry points to residents' homes and the use of smaller ""home lifts"".",2,763,2017-08-01-T-046-S-00763
2017-08-01-T-046,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"More recently, HDB has piloted new solutions like the Pneumatic Vacuum Elevator at Lorong 6 Toa Payoh and the Vertical Platform Lift at Petir Road, but both were found to be unfeasible.",3,764,2017-08-01-T-046-S-00764
2017-08-01-T-046,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Nonetheless, through the various innovative solutions, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks have benefited from LUP over the years. There remains about 150 blocks where it is still not possible to implement LUP due to prohibitive costs or existing technical or site constraints. This includes six blocks in Hougang SMC. Residents living in these blocks who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for housing and financing assistance. HDB will assess each request on a case-by-case basis to see how best to render help.",4,765,2017-08-01-T-046-S-00765

The current version of the software installed on 14 July is promising and has addressed the glitches encountered earlier. We still have some concerns over train-borne signalling equipment which the engineers are attending to. If there are no new surprises, we will be able to move to the next phase of testing as we inject more trains with shorter headways during peak hours. This will reduce waiting times and offer less crowded rides for commuters.",1,795,2017-08-01-T-055-S-00795

The B&R initiative and the Master Plan for ASEAN Connectivity 2025 reflect a convergence of interests between ASEAN and China. As such, ASEAN is keen to explore possible synergies, including how the B&R initiative can complement ASEAN's development plans, and vice versa, to maximise the results of our cooperation. As Country Coordinator for ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations until August 2018, Singapore is actively consulting both ASEAN Member States and China on how this will feature in our plans for the future development of the ASEAN-China strategic partnership.",3,828,2017-08-01-T-064-S-00828

2017-08-01-T-075,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Food waste is a waste stream of concern to my Ministry. In 2016, food waste comprised 10% of total waste generated in Singapore. This includes both avoidable and unavoidable food waste, such as peels, bones and shells.",1,881,2017-08-01-T-075-S-00881
2017-08-01-T-075,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"My Ministry is studying the various sources of our food waste to get a breakdown of this figure. In 2015, the National Environment Agency (NEA) launched a study on waste disposed of by households to better understand the mix of avoidable and unavoidable food waste. We are currently analysing the data that has been collected. A similar study on waste disposed of at commercial premises, such as food manufacturers, hotels and malls, will commence later this year.",2,882,2017-08-01-T-075-S-00882
2017-08-01-T-075,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,One strategy to manage food waste is to encourage the redistribution of surplus food. NEA and the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) launched a guidebook last year to help food retail establishments develop food waste minimisation plans. The guidebook includes guidelines on the proper handling and redistribution of excess food. Similar guidebooks will also be developed for food manufacturing establishments and supermarkets.,3,883,2017-08-01-T-075-S-00883
2017-08-01-T-075,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The private and people sectors have also developed initiatives which complement the Government’s efforts. For example, the ""11th Hour"" app matches businesses with unsold food with consumers looking for last-minute deals. We are open to other ideas which could address unmet needs. Individuals or organisations with ideas can consider applying for funding under the NEA’s Call for Ideas Fund.",4,884,2017-08-01-T-075-S-00884
2017-08-01-T-075,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"My Ministry will study the possibility of Good Samaritan laws in Singapore with relevant agencies, such as the Ministry of National Development and AVA. Such provisions which are present in countries, such as the United States and Canada, can provide greater clarity to potential donors of excess food.",5,885,2017-08-01-T-075-S-00885
2017-08-01-T-075,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"At the same time, my Ministry is mindful of the need to ensure that any food donated is fit for consumption. We thus need to strike a balance to ensure that food donors and food distributors exercise due care and practise good hygiene when distributing donated food. We will continue to work closely with our partner agencies on relevant measures to better manage food waste.",6,886,2017-08-01-T-075-S-00886
2017-08-01-T-076,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what more can be done to ensure that teachers and fellow students are able to identify and handle cases of students suffering from domestic abuse.,1,887,2017-08-01-T-076-S-00887
2017-08-01-T-076,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,Schools have systems that facilitate the early identification of students suffering from domestic violence or abuse. Teachers are equipped to look out for signs of distress in students and refer them to the school counsellor or other professional support where necessary.,1,888,2017-08-01-T-076-S-00888
2017-08-01-T-076,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Students learn how to recognise sexual abuse and harassment, acquire skills to protect themselves and understand the laws that protect them during the Form Teacher Guidance Period lessons in primary schools and Sexuality Education lessons. Students also learn that everyone has the right to safety and protection and to seek help from trusted adults, such as teachers and school counsellors.",2,889,2017-08-01-T-076-S-00889
2017-08-01-T-076,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"To further build trust and strengthen positive teacher-student relationships, some schools have deployed the same Form or Co-Form Teachers to a class for at least two consecutive years to help provide stability and a constant adult figure to students. Providing teacher-student interaction time also helps to ensure personalised attention on individual students.",3,890,2017-08-01-T-076-S-00890
2017-08-01-T-076,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Some students may still escape the school’s attention if they are unwilling to share their problems or are able to mask their problems well. Older students can help to keep a lookout for their friends as young people invariably turn to their peers for support and understanding. Training and resources are provided to help students cultivate good values and positive mindsets; advocate for student well-being, learn coping skills, encourage help-seeking behaviour and watch out for one another in school.",4,891,2017-08-01-T-076-S-00891
2017-08-01-T-076,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"MOE works closely with MSF which has introduced better screening tools and training for professionals, such as teachers and school counsellors. The tools enable them to detect concerns over a child's welfare or signs of abuse and, depending on the seriousness, either connect the families with community-based help or escalate the case to MSF for intervention. All current School Counsellors and Student Welfare Officers have already been trained. The training for teachers has started and is expected to be completed by end 2018.",5,892,2017-08-01-T-076-S-00892
2017-08-01-T-077,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) for primary and secondary schools, what are the current median and mean numbers of students in a class as defined by the grouping of students headed by a form teacher; and (b) what are the median and mean class sizes for remedial classes across primary and secondary schools respectively.",1,893,2017-08-01-T-077-S-00893
2017-08-01-T-077,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"In 2016, the average form class sizes in primary and secondary schools are 33 and 34 respectively. The median form class sizes in primary and secondary schools are 32 and 36 respectively. MOE does not track the size of remedial classes in primary and secondary schools.",1,894,2017-08-01-T-077-S-00894
2017-08-01-T-077,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"MOE provides schools with resources based on student and programme needs. Schools have the flexibility to deploy teachers in a targeted manner so that learning is more effective. Hence, even though form class sizes have generally remained above 30 across the levels, schools group students into smaller teaching class sizes based on learning needs or programme considerations. For instance, levelling up programmes, such as the Learning Support Programme for lower primary students, are conducted in pull-out classes of eight to 10, while the School-based Dyslexia Remediation programme is conducted in classes of four to six students. At secondary level, coursework subjects requiring closer teacher supervision like Design and Technology are conducted in classes of 20. Due to subject-based banding and the desire to offer a range of elective subjects to students, it is common to have teaching class sizes below 40.",2,895,2017-08-01-T-077-S-00895
2017-08-01-T-078,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what measures have been taken in the last three years to reduce the time spent by teachers on marking assignments and administrative work; and (b) whether the Ministry has considered measures, such as (i) consolidating and centralising tasks, such as marking and (ii) the use of more online tests.",1,896,2017-08-01-T-078-S-00896
2017-08-01-T-078,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"The well-being of our teachers is important and we have put in place a set of measures to guide schools in the allocation and management of teachers’ workload, which includes teaching and administrative responsibilities.",1,897,2017-08-01-T-078-S-00897
2017-08-01-T-078,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"As an integral part of their teaching responsibilities, teachers set assignments and assessments to find out whether students have learnt the knowledge and skills set out in the national curriculum. This is an important professional role of teachers, as it is by analysing students’ performance that teachers are able to identify students’ learning needs, tailor their teaching to meet those needs and give feedback to each student. To support teachers in setting and marking assignments, the subject syllabi are accompanied by MOE-designed teaching and learning guides that include guidelines for the setting of assignment tasks. In most schools, teachers work in teams to design assessments and there is careful deployment to manage the marking workload of teachers.",2,898,2017-08-01-T-078-S-00898
2017-08-01-T-078,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Teachers will deploy technology in assessment work when it is educationally purposeful to support teaching and learning. For instance, when multiple choice items are meaningful, it will be set and automatically marked by machines. Similarly, the use of digital quizzes in learning portals have enabled some basic assessment tasks to be set and automatically marked.",3,899,2017-08-01-T-078-S-00899
2017-08-01-T-078,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,We will also continue to incorporate greater use of technology in their administrative tasks and simplify work processes to help our teachers better manage their workload.,4,900,2017-08-01-T-078-S-00900
2017-08-01-T-079,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,"asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) how the cut-off points for the various undergraduate courses are decided upon; (b) given the declining cohort number due to declining birth rate and having more autonomous local universities, whether this will mean more places are being offered than demand; and (c) whether there are plans to offer more places to local students instead of them having to go overseas for their university education.",1,901,2017-08-01-T-079-S-00901
2017-08-01-T-079,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Cut-off points for each course is an outcome of the academic results of applicants and the places available. These may vary from year to year.,1,902,2017-08-01-T-079-S-00902
2017-08-01-T-079,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,A larger proportion of local students will be offered places in our publicly-funded Autonomous Universities. This is because the Government has committed to progressively increase the publicly funded university Cohort Participation Rate (CPR) from 30% in 2014 to 40% by 2020.The CPR for 2017 is 35%.,2,903,2017-08-01-T-079-S-00903
2017-08-01-T-079,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As our economy continues to diversify and do well, we can align industries’ changing demands for manpower with students’ aspirations to attain degrees. In planning for publicly funded university places, a primary consideration is the employability of our graduates.",3,904,2017-08-01-T-079-S-00904
2017-08-01-T-079,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In addition, our Autonomous Universities will offer more lifelong learning courses and more Singaporeans would be able to enhance their knowledge and deepen their skills at our universities throughout different stages of their lives and careers.",4,905,2017-08-01-T-079-S-00905
2017-08-01-T-080,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) how will the Ministry ensure that the cost of the modules and courses available for mature students at autonomous universities that lead to the award of degrees will be affordable; and (b) whether there are plans to extend some tuition subsidies to such students who may already have been awarded first degrees at subsidised rates.,1,906,2017-08-01-T-080-S-00906
2017-08-01-T-080,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Within the constraints of our budget, the Ministry of Education (MOE) is committed to ensure that education and training remain affordable.",1,907,2017-08-01-T-080-S-00907
2017-08-01-T-080,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Today, Singaporeans will typically receive a subsidy of 75% for full-time and part-time degree programmes offered at the Autonomous Universities (AUs). The subsidy rate goes up to 90% for those aged 40 and above undertaking degree programmes for the first time. We also make available education bursaries and loans to individual students, with lower income individuals receiving more.",2,908,2017-08-01-T-080-S-00908
2017-08-01-T-080,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Besides degree programmes, AUs also offer many industry-relevant modular courses that help adult learners update their skills and knowledge and stay employable and competitive. These courses are also subsidised, generally from 70% to 90% of the course fees. In 2015, the AUs delivered about 15,000 training places, many of which were offered as modular courses. MOE will work with the AUs to expand such offerings to support lifelong learning and subsidise such courses so that they are more accessible to adult learners.",3,909,2017-08-01-T-080-S-00909
2017-08-01-T-080,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"An instance where an individual finds that he is not receiving a subsidy is when he is taking a second degree. But given that resources are limited, we have to prioritise Government subsidies for those pursuing their first degrees. While we support lifelong learning strongly, budget constraints are still a reality and prioritisation on how we spend public funds is needed.",4,910,2017-08-01-T-080-S-00910
