2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Mdm Speaker, within the past few months, violent extremism has affected the lives of many in various societies. Turkey and Paris suffered terror attacks, leaving scores of people dead and many more injured. The threat of ISIS is spreading beyond the Middle East to Asia. Jakarta was attacked two weeks ago, leaving eight people dead. India arrested four students with links to ISIS who were planning attacks within Delhi, and over the weekend, Malaysia arrested seven suspected ISIS militants who were planning attacks in several locations in Malaysia. Singapore is no less vulnerable. In October 2015, two Singaporean teenagers were arrested and detained for being involved in terrorism-related activities. More recently, MHA arrested and repatriated 27 radicalised Bangladeshis in Singapore, who were planning to take part in extremist activities outside Singapore.",2,16,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00016
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Since 2011, over 25,000 fighters from 100 different countries have travelled to Iraq and Syria, with rising numbers of Indonesians and Malaysians amongst them. Our counterparts in Indonesia have identified Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian based in Syria, as the mastermind of the recent attacks in Jakarta. In fact, militant extremist groups have voiced their ambitions to establish a ""satellite caliphate"" within the region, to become the unifying force for Islamic State supporters.",3,17,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00017
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"The social fabric in our region faces the compounded challenges of returning Southeast Asian fighters, radical ideological narratives online and offline, and competing extremist groups for leadership. Scenarios like those attacks in Paris, Jakarta and others can happen in Singapore despite our strong security measures.",4,18,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00018
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"These events highlight one salient point – the nature of threats we face has changed in important ways. We are now faced with a battle of ideologies, and the ubiquity of social media has allowed radical ideologies supporting terrorism to invade the thoughts of people without extremists having to physically enter a society. There are some 46,000 Twitter accounts globally and at least 1,000 Facebook accounts in Southeast Asia supporting ISIS. As a result of such pervasive social media outreach, as many as 1,000 Southeast Asians have travelled to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria since 2011, including two Singaporean families that joined ISIS since 2014. Terrorism is closer to home than we think.",5,19,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00019
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Mdm Speaker, as the threat of ISIS to Singapore is very real, we need to continue to address the problem collaboratively, comprehensively, and at its source. Singapore was the first Southeast Asian country to join the counter-ISIS coalition in November 2014. The SAF had contributed to the counter-terrorism effort within our means and in niche areas of value to the coalition. Minister for Defence will be speaking on the SAF's contributions in greater detail. MINDEF will continue to support MHA, SPF and other social and security agencies in their counter-ISIS efforts and to strengthen Singapore's Total Defence, in the combat against extremism and terrorism. Internationally, our intelligence agencies will continue to work closely with their counterparts in the region to protect our borders.",6,20,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00020
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"However, a military solution alone will not be sufficient in the fight against radical ideologies and terrorism, which aims to exploit potential racial and religious fault lines and de-stabilise society by causing mistrust amongst different religions and races. We need a Whole-of-Society response to this threat of radical ideologies and terrorism. I would like to commend the efforts of Government agencies like MHA, MCCY and MUIS for their support of programmes that help to tackle radicalization and extremism head-on.",7,21,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00021
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Looking forward, MINDEF will continue to support MHA, SPF and other social and security agencies in their counter-ISIS efforts. In addition to what the Government must do, I would also like to highlight that each of us needs to pay special attention to strengthening our social and psychological defences, which are two of the five pillars in Total Defence. Conceived over 30 years ago, Total Defence has enabled us to face and overcome national challenges, and will continue to do so in the years ahead. But we will all need to continuously translate the ideas of Total Defence into effective actions.",8,22,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00022
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"The fight against violent extremism will not be a quick or easy one. It is an ideological war against terrorists whose goal is social destruction through fear and mistrust and not only physical destruction. To put it simply and directly, these terrorists are criminals who have exploited and misrepresented Islam and deceitfully portrayed themselves as practicing and religious Muslims. Scholars and Islamic religious leaders have noted that terrorists who claim to be motivated by Islamic religious ideology often turn out to have little and incomplete understanding of Islam.",9,23,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00023
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Unfortunately, such misrepresentation of Islam has caused anxiety and even fears in inter-group relations between Muslim and non-Muslim groups in Singapore. But while this inter-group tension is understandable as a natural human reaction given the misinformation, if left unaddressed, it will surely – and not necessarily slowly - lead to suspicion and one group blaming the other. Very soon, inter-group relations will deteriorate and tensions escalate and everyone in Singapore will suffer when the social harmony we are used to, abruptly erodes.",10,24,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00024
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Hence, every group needs to make the effort to understand the other group, and act and react in constructive and adaptive ways. Non-Muslims need to understand that terrorism is based on radical ideologies and teachings that are completely un-Muslim and unIslamic. To believe that violent extremism is Islamic and that terrorists are religious Muslims, our society will fall into the terrorists' trap to sow discord. All non-Muslims in Singapore can help preserve social harmony by doing small but important things such as correcting misconceptions or stereotypical and anti-Muslim remarks or actions by family members and friends, and also in social media.",11,25,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00025
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Our Muslim community must also act and act decisively – give the clear message and assurance that we denounce violence. A Turkish Muslim scholar recently wrote in The Wall Street Journal that terrorists are committing grave sins in the name of Islam, and scholars studying the primary sources of the Quran and the teachings of Islam have all dispelled any claims terrorists make of religious justifications of their cause. Muslims must therefore reject any forms of violence in the name of Islam. The outgoing Ambassador of Indonesia to Singapore, Bapak Andri Hadi, informed me recently that the family members and fellow villagers of the terrorists killed in the recent Jakarta attacks refused to allow the bodies to be buried in their village, totally rejecting and disassociating themselves from the dead terrorists.",12,26,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00026
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Indeed, each time a terror attack takes place, our Muslim community and religious leaders have repeatedly denounced the radical ideology articulated by terrorists and condemned the acts of these terrorist groups including ISIS, Al Qaeda and JI. For example, following the arrest and repatriation of the 27 radicalised Bangladeshis, Dr Mohamed Fatris Bakaram, Mufti of Singapore, publically denounced extremism and extremist acts that threaten the security, peace and harmony of Singapore and the world. Mufti Dr Fatris said, and I quote, ""they (the extremist groups) contradict the fundamental Islamic teaching of protecting the sanctity of human life and preserving peace and harmony at all times. The safety and peace of Singapore is of paramount interest to the Singapore Muslim community. We have a commendable tradition of living as inclusive and progressive Muslims within the context of Singapore's multi-ethnic and multi-religious landscape.""",13,27,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00027
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Every terrorist act carried out in the name of Islam will significantly affect all Muslims, potentially alienating them from their fellow citizens and deepening the misunderstanding about Islam as a peaceful religion.",14,28,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00028
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"We are fortunate that our painstaking effort for the past 50 years in building trust and maintaining social and religious harmony has brought us peace and stability. However, this effort is even more critical now. The ideological war confronting us is fought in the minds of our people, made more challenging with modern communication tools like social media. We need to increase our religious understanding and also build up our social and psychological resilience to reduce our vulnerability towards those who exploit the Internet and social media with false teachings. Our Muslim community needs leadership and guidance from our community and religious leaders and scholars to equip them with a moral and religious compass to help navigate the complex web of information in the borderless cyber world.",15,29,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00029
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"This will equip our Muslim community with a deeper understanding of Islamic teachings and discern it from the misrepresentations of Islam and the multitude of alternative extremist views that are readily available on the Internet. It also benefits the larger non-Muslim communities who will have greater awareness of the true Islamic values and teachings given our multiracial context, and be better able to understand and engage our Muslim community.",16,30,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00030
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"For example, some of you may be aware of calls for Muslims abstain from wishing Merry Christmas to Christians via SMS and WhatsApp messages that have gone viral. For those who did not know better might be taken in and believe that it is indeed un-Islamic to do so. Many of us are heartened that, as reported in today's Berita Harian, senior and respected scholars like Habib Syed Hassan Al-Attas the Imam of Ba'alwie Mosque in Singapore and other religious and community leaders have chosen to speak up and address this issue directly. We now know that the proposed ban on Christmas or other similar greetings has no Islamic basis. Habib Hassan said, and I quote, ""The purpose of greetings is to make the recipient happy and feeling of delightfulness. In Islam, it is strongly encouraged to make friends, family members and people happy regardless of race and religion. It is not wrong in Islam when a person greets and gives well wishes to a friend or acquaintance who is not of the same faith, as the intention is to make the person happy""",17,31,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00031

According to him, a Muslim greeting ""Gong Xi Fa Cai"" or ""Merry Christmas"" to a friend is not against Islamic teachings or traditions.",18,32,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00032
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"This occurrence of expressing a festive greeting, if taken alone may seem insignificant, but if it were to occur every other day and if the Muslim community does not have the religious ballast to fight the ideological challenge, one can only imagine the religious fault lines it could create in our society.",19,33,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00033
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"We cannot under-estimate how actions by the Muslims could cause non-Muslims to react. It is the natural process of human interaction. Similarly, actions and counter-actions of non-Muslims draw reactions from Muslims. As more attacks occur around our region, it is not unexpected for some non-Muslims to wonder if indeed our Muslims are becoming more religious and whether this means they have increasing propensity for terrorism.",20,34,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00034
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Non-Muslims need to know and they must be assured that religiosity per se is not the problem. It is the misinterpretation and misrepresentation of religious beliefs and teachings that is the source of terrorist thinking. At the same time, we also need our non-Muslim leaders to speak up on how non-Muslims should and should not treat Muslims. This is critical. Non-Muslims also look to the leaders in their various communities for guidance on what to do in such sensitive situations, be it religious or non-religious communities. Ultimately, it is about interacting and engaging constructively with the Muslim community as fellow Singaporeans, so that everyone in Singapore can continue to enjoy the social harmony and stability we have built together all these years.",21,35,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00035
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"This action-reaction effect applies to both positive and negative actions. We need to focus on generating positive chain reactions to preserve social harmony and build social resilience so that we remain a strong society. For this to happen, we must commit ourselves to share mutual respect and wider ideological and social spaces to facilitate positive interaction and deepen understanding amongst one another. We must guard against external influences that constrict our common spaces. As a society, we will only stand to lose if this happens.",22,36,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00036
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"The common social spaces that we share are the cornerstone of our multi-racial society. Religious and community leaders, including returning religious scholars, exposed to and potentially influenced by different societal structures, must be assisted to consciously re-orientate their worldview to be consistent with our societal values and make up – for our Muslim community, one that supports the tenet that Islam embraces and respects diversity – cultural, social, religious and political. Islam teaches that God identifies learning from one another as the primary goal of diversity and that respecting each human being as a creation of God, is respecting God. Thus it is critical that the moral and religious compass presented to our community reflects our deep appreciation of this diversity.",23,37,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00037
2016-01-26-T-005,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"In short, we must continue building social and community resilience against the spread of extremism. Extremists will continue to exploit the misunderstanding of Islam and seek to divide us along racial and religious lines. It is critical that, whether we are Muslims or non-Muslims, we all recognise that we have a major role to play in strengthening our social and psychological defences against radicalism. Our social cohesion depends on all of us having a proper understanding and trust amongst the different races and religions. Without social cohesion and social resilience against the threat of radicalism, all it takes is one hit for terrorism to sow deep mistrust and create irreparable fault lines in our society.

Ultimately, how we treat our people reflects very much on ourselves. How we care about the less well-off and the less fortunate will speak very much about ourselves.

Recently, the President of the Law Society, Mr Thio Shen Yi, had in his speech at the Opening of the Legal Year on 11 January 2016, brought up the issue of suspect's rights of access to legal counsel before the suspect's statement is recorded by the Police. As Mr Thio puts it succinctly and I quote, ""Justice and fairness are served because it is that lawyer's job to advise the suspect to tell the truth, to articulate any defences that they may have, to cooperate with the Police, to advise if no defence is available, but also to advise on the privilege against self-incrimination"". He mentioned that and I quote, ""An accused may be detained for days or weeks without access to a lawyer"", and ""we need to re-evaluate whether this is fair or desirable"".

In our legal system where the accused is innocent until proven guilty, we must give the accused an opportunity to have early access to legal counsel. Until he is proven guilty, he has all rights as every other citizen. As a democracy, we must value the rights of every Singaporean and guard them jealously. These rights must include his rights to early legal advice in a situation where the end-game is potential punishment by the Court.

Moving to another point regarding access to justice, I would like to refer to the Attorney-General (AG)'s speech at the Opening of the Legal Year as well. The AG made proposals for early disclosure of evidence in criminal cases by both the prosecution and defence. I support this proposal. This is a step in the right direction for our criminal justice system. Fair disclosure of evidence in criminal cases in common law countries are usually taken seriously. Discovery of obligations under our civil procedure rules have been in place since time in memorial. As the AG said and I quote, ""Disclosure may or may not affect the outcome of the case, but the fairness and openness of the process is important"".",9,67,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00067
2016-01-26-T-005,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Disclosure and, particularly, early disclosure of evidence promotes a transparent process and also potentially reduces legal costs. The accused is aware of the case he has to meet. Indeed, in some cases, he may be advised from the disclosure made that he has a weak case, and he may be advised earlier to take a certain course of action. Transparency in a criminal justice process will demonstrate to our citizens that evidence is taken seriously and that, in fact, evidence is submitted early and efficiently. This knowledge will surely strengthen public confidence in our criminal justice system.",10,68,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00068

It is heartening to see the continuing increase in the number of cases that are handled by volunteer lawyers under the Law Society's Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS). In recent years, it is also heartening to see many lawyers volunteering at our community legal clinics all over Singapore, giving legal advice to many needy Singaporeans, and also lawyers volunteering their services to do pro bono legal work under various auspices such as the Law Society, the Community Justice Centre and various non-governmental organisations (NGOs).",11,69,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00069

May I also suggest that the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) and the Government Ministries consider allowing their lawyers to spend at least some time doing some form of pro bono work? The AGC has a big pool of lawyers who are called to the Bar.

Once Internet banking is invented, it is hard to uninvent it. It is hard to protect our local banks by limiting the number of foreign banks', branches or ATMs because you go to the Internet, you use your smartphones, you will get pass it. So, therefore, our regulations should go with the type of consumer preference, which usually embraces the new economy and not against it.",22,104,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00104

In the last industrial revolution, it took 100 years before the steam engine was able to uplift somebody's life in Europe. In today's digital revolution, the effect is even more pronounced, because the winner can usually replicate their ideas digitally at virtually no cost and take most of the profit home.",25,107,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00107

2016-01-26-T-005,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"To me, the real story of Singapore is in the first 20 years of our Independence. This is the Singapore exceptionalism Deputy Prime Minister Tharman spoke so eloquently about at the St Gallen Symposium. It is about how we turned our perpetual disadvantages into a determination to succeed and innovate. Out of nothing, we created a multi-racial society, a contrarian growth strategy, an inclusive housing programme, a thriving metropolis, well-defended by all.",33,115,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00115

It is also about our people, including the community and business leaders, how they rose up to the challenge. Therefore, I am calling for an increased emphasis of our history and social studies on the first two decades, with the focus on Singapore's exceptionalism. It is critical that our children learn that they should continue to take risks, not take anything for granted, recognise the harsh realities of our surroundings. In short, we must make sure our children must learn about the spirit of 1965.",34,116,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00116

2016-01-26-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Before I come to my main speech, I just want to add my comments to the two points which the hon Member Mr Dennis Tan spoke just a couple of minutes ago. Unfortunately, he is not in the Chambers. He touched on social justice. Indeed, I think social mobility is something which this Government and, certainly, the People's Action Party, subscribes to and takes great pains to ensure this remains the case for every Singaporean, something which our Prime Minister, our Deputy Prime Ministers, and many of our Ministers have mentioned several times, that we should leave no one behind, and that we should build a more caring and inclusive society. The way many of our assistance schemes are designed is tilted to give more to those who have less. It is something which we continue to do over the years, not just last few years, from Year 1 – SG1 – to now – SG50. And now 51. I am sure we will continue to go on that route.",2,121,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00121

I handed out to over 1,100 recipients over 12 sessions. For many of them, I think education is indeed the most important area we want to invest in. It is the best way for each and every Singaporean to break out and create a better life for themselves – which is why we always see the Ministry of Education getting a large slice of the Budget, something which we all support.",3,122,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00122
2016-01-26-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The other point which Mr Dennis Tan made was about strengthening governance in national institutions. He exhorted it. I totally agree with him. In fact, I think strengthening governance is something that should take place in every organisation and we should all embrace it. If you are a public listed company, it matters. If you are a sports association, it matters. A religious institution, likewise. A Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO), a charity and, I dare say, also in the Town Councils. We all have a duty of care to all stakeholders in any organisation to make sure that governance is there.",4,123,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00123

2016-01-26-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Last year, I had a senior, although still young, civil servant observing one of my Meet-the-People sessions. The combination of youth and seniority is sometimes an indicator for high flyers, but it can be an unpropitious mix. This officer observed what we did that evening. At the end of the session, as we were sharing, he turned to one of my key volunteers, exasperated, and he asked, ""Why do you keep writing us these letters to make exceptions? You know that we cannot do that. You do not waste time writing; we do not waste time replying"".",6,125,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00125
2016-01-26-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Mdm Speaker, as a politician, I am very seldom speechless. And as a former Admin Officer, I am very seldom at a loss for ideas. But that night, I paused on both counts. Does our public service need to change? On the one hand, this high flyer is right. Some residents do sometimes ask me to write letters that are beyond the pale. One resident lives in a landed property and owns three cars. Unfortunately, her house is only big enough to have one car park lot. She expects the Government – that is me – to provide her with lots for her two other cars. If not, she told me, the Government is lousy and she would vote against me in the next election.",7,126,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00126
2016-01-26-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"My reply, given verbally, was quite a strong one. With hindsight, I was lucky that she did not video-tape me on her handphone. An MSF officer was not so lucky. I am sure you are all familiar with the incident that took place at the Social Service Office (SSO) at Boon Lay, where a man went to demand his monthly social assistance which was late for that month.",8,127,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00127
2016-01-26-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The SSO, knowing that this man was actually going to have another baby, had initiated an early review, and increased the amount of assistance for the family from $600 to $800 per month. This change, unfortunately, resulted in a delay of a few days in the crediting of the financial assistance to the recipient. Even as the MSF officer was trying to explain this, the recipient, loud and hectoring, demanded ""his money"". After several minutes of this, the officer was riled up enough to say, ""We do not owe you"". The whole exchange was put up on social media.",9,128,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00128
2016-01-26-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Two things were clear to me. First, the man seeking assistance intended to record everything because the recording started with his session. Second, there is a strong sense of entitlement and the tone he took was that the officer indeed ""owed"" him the money. Both sides were not right, but in this sense, my sympathies lie with the officer.",10,129,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00129
2016-01-26-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Mdm Speaker, I have noticed in recent years, that there is a rise of self-administered vigilante justice among members of the public. The weapon of choice – the handphone. Judge and jury – the social media public. This has to change. On the flip side, I have also seen some very bad responses by civil servants, the very few which give the Government as a whole a bad name. Some put on what they call an ""EQ face"" but their empathy quotient leaves much to be desired. This is not who we are. This is not what we dream of becoming. This is not Singapore.",11,130,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00130
2016-01-26-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The President in his Address noted that many Singaporeans are willing to contribute and share a part of their lives with one another. He invited all of us to participate in shaping our common future, to strengthen our bonds and deepen trust with each another. And implicit in his speech is the tension I spoke about – he said, ""Our individual aspirations may differ, but we all realised that we must work together to create our common future. This spirit was sustained through our SG50 celebrations, and profoundly deepened when we mourned the passing of our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew. The SGfuture dialogues and the Committee on the Future Economy are but two national platforms for us to make our future together.""",12,131,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00131

They are the people who help those of us who cannot help ourselves. The people direct public resources with their collective will, but individually, we have no special call on these resources, we cannot demand private use of this joint resource. We cannot demand rules to break on every occasion that benefits us, without care for fellow Singaporeans. We should have neither vigilante justice from the public or high-handed behaviour from the civil servants. This is not who we are as Singaporeans.",13,132,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00132

I do not know but I do know that our language is like us – we are Malay and Chinese and Indian – and we are ""others"" too. Our common space is large and our politics practical – not because we do not care, but because we care too much. We care too much to allow what makes us different to keep us apart.

It is said that the Singaporean is pragmatic, which has often been mistaken for not caring enough; for not having a particular political philosophy. The truth is we care too much – we care too much to allow blind ideology to prevent us from pursuing our clear vision. We care too much to let go of our brand of metaphysics – keeping our families safe, our jobs secure, our future bright.

It suggests that what unites us as Singaporeans is our support for one political party. I am sure that most Singaporeans believe that what unites us is not that.

What is a sunrise or a sunset industry will change, and change more frequently as the 21st century meanders on. Confident Singaporean citizens and companies will be able to seize opportunities in any new sectors that emerge. But when we talk about future-ready economic sectors, we should not forget those sectors where Singapore's small size and high population density force us to develop expertise.

Here, I refer to the private sector, civil society, alternative political parties and the citizens of Singapore themselves. How can we face the future as a developed country if we are dominated by a very powerful state that is, in turn, dominated by an entrenched, single political party? This structure creates too much dependence on a small group of people. The risk is too high.

The restructuring of the economy and increasing competition mean that our businesses and workers need be more productive, adaptive, and committed to continual upgrading. Organisations like the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry and MENDAKI SENSE have stepped up to partner national agencies like WDA and Spring Singapore to bring the full range of SkillsFuture support for training and skills mastery.

In truth, diversity is nothing new. The Malay/Muslim community has always consisted of various ethnicities and schools of Islamic thought. Our community's religious life has always been shaped by the basic principles of moderation, respect for differences, the promotion of inclusiveness, and openness to diversity.

The Government will continue to serve as a community arbiter. However, this will be an increasingly difficult job as we try to balance competing views and interests, and as our usual approach of negotiating sensitive matters carefully and discreetly is being challenged.

There was some measure of give-and-take during the discussions, with both sides eventually coming to an agreement on the three ""live"" music points and seven music-transmission points along the route.

Many of my colleagues here have spoken about them and I will reinforce some of those points. Not all these changes will have a big impact on us but some definitely will. If we are not alert to them, then we risk being left behind.",1,262,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00262

Other things will face non-linear changes brought about by disruptive technologies, that my colleague Henry talked about, the way cassette tapes or general cargo ships gave way to the iPod and container ships.",2,263,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00263

It did not succeed initially because robots then were not dexterous enough and were costly. Today, many of these shortcomings in robotics have been overcome. Foxconn now deploys 50,000 robots in China, and they call these robots ""Foxbots"". Other companies like Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) – a Swiss and Swedish joint venture, are also deep into robotics research and production. It now produces robots that can be sophisticated enough to do very micro-type circuitry assembly, and at low cost – each robot cost about the price of a car in Sweden, not in Singapore. ABB called their robots ""Yumi"" which stands for ""You and Me (the robot)"", collaborating in manufacturing.",3,264,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00264

But they know, the Chinese, that if they do not, other countries will. So, their peculiar domestic situation notwithstanding, China is embracing this new technology and if they are successful they will leap-frog others who are less nimble.",5,266,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00266

Sale of industrial robots in 2014 rose 56% in China from the year before.

They do not join unions who go on strikes once in a while, they do not take sick leave – maybe a couple of days a year for maintenance – they do not argue with their supervisors about work conditions, they live in the factories, literally, never once late for work. This is the type of competition that we can expect to face.",7,268,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00268

The US economy is about maybe 60%-70% consumption. Instead of ""Off-shoring"" manufacturing from the US and Europe to China, the buzz word now is ""Near-sourcing"". So, production for European consumption will take place maybe in Eastern Europe or Europe itself and Production for the US will take place in Mexico facilitated by NAFTA. This ""Near-sourcing"" will become even more pronounced because clean energy in the form of shale gas becomes readily available in the West. This will impact areas like Logistics and Supply Chain Solutions. Think change in shipping routes.",8,269,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00269

Mr Perera bemoans the low number of Opposition Members in this House. Yet, in the same breadth, he calls for open contests. He calls for more democracy. Let me remind him that in the last general elections, every seat, each and every one of the 89 seats was contested. That Singaporeans have voted for the PAP and also six other Opposition Members is the outcome of an open contest. I hope he and his Party will respect that outcome. We, on our part, are humbled by the outcome and will work even harder to do well for Singaporeans.",23,284,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00284

On top of that, the PAP Government also introduced the Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) scheme, so, like he said, different segments of society and their voices can be heard and be represented in this House.

2016-01-26-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Many were amazed that it was her first and last job. These days, it is not surprising for a worker to change jobs four to five times in his career. Some even take on jobs in different industries.

2016-01-26-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"To make sense of the fast moving dynamics and in response to changes at the jobs front, some workers have taken to a new earning option, that is, to freelance.

2016-01-26-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Many in our midst probably think that it is about having the courage to change course from being a salaried employee to becoming a freelancer. However, having spoken to many of them on why they decided to forgo jobs which provided them with a steady income every month, I am beginning to understand that it is about wanting to break free from becoming accustomed to a previously secured situation, and being oblivious to the need to adapt in view of rapid changes.",4,294,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00294
2016-01-26-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Freelancers want to adapt. Some look to freelancing to offer variety and scope of roles that their current jobs do not offer them as an employee.

I have met many who offer services in photography, copywriting, translation, web design, sports coaching, and the list goes on. There are also websites today that allow a freelance worker to be registered for assignments, connecting them to offers of jobs both locally and overseas.

2016-01-26-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Options for those who wish to pursue freelance work have also opened up. Some even see it as a viable long-term career option.

However, those who are in freelancing choose how to build their own security, overcome uncertainty and make adjustments, as well as collaborate with one another. Many are also refining their old skills and acquiring new ones to stay relevant, even before the Government announced strategies such as SkillsFuture. They do not wait for someone else to navigate the path ahead for them.

For some, freelancers are a source of talent pool. With no actual headcount, they can keep costs low, have access to worldwide pool of talent, and are able to obtain services anytime, anywhere. The number of new jobs created appears to be declining, but based on sharing by freelancers themselves, the demand and offers for freelance work seem to remain steady. Perhaps, companies are already making structural changes to how they assemble the resources needed to complete tasks in this changing environment.",14,304,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00304
2016-01-26-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"For these companies to work well with freelancers, they do not treat them as a cheaper option. Instead, they accord their appointed freelancers the same respect and treatment as they would to a business partner. They make reasonable demands, respect intellectual property, and make payment on time for the freelancers' services. For other companies contemplating the option of using freelances, it is therefore wise to adopt the same approach. They can only tap on the best services if freelancers are allowed to grow well, earn decently and sustain their businesses. I propose that high among the service buyers' priority must be to learn how to tap on the different capabilities out there, and treat freelancers fairly to achieve a win-win situation.",15,305,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00305

2016-01-26-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"For example, HDB housing loan eligibility for freelancers or the self-employed, even if it comes from an applicant who is about 30 years old, can appear to be conservative because they do not seem to have a regular income or able to produce an income pay-slip of six months or more. I was told that banks, when assessing credit card applications, also take on very conservative approach when it comes to freelancers who apply for credit cards. Our system to help Singaporeans apply for HDB housing and prepare for retirement has worked well for those who hold conventional jobs. As freelance work grows to become a popular career choice, it is timely to tailor policies to be more inclusive and to benefit the freelancers.",17,307,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00307

Many SMEs have told me that they have been struggling with rising rents. However, the overall situation has stabilised. In the third and fourth quarter of 2015, retail rentals fell by 0.3% and 0.1% respectively on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Likewise, office rental fell by 0.1% in both quarters, while industrial rental dropped by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2015. Nonetheless, the Government will do its best by working through the market to ensure that there is enough space supply to meet long-term needs.

In response, Sanwa invested heavily to automate and mechanise its production and quality control processes. Factory automation has also helped Sanwa perform highly repetitive tasks, and achieved higher levels of accuracy, reliability and efficiency.

Supported by Nanyang Polytechnic and SUTD, this consortium pools together capabilities of each member firm in developing additive manufacturing solutions for key customers in niche areas. Sanwa has shared with me that this collaboration has been successful because members did not see each other as competitors, and were willing to share expertise with one another.

Firmly believing in the market value of their business idea, the initial rejection, from what I know, according to the young founders of ShopBack, was actually helpful in making them work and think harder about their business ideas and eventually, they caught the eye of investors who provided them with further seed capital.

Often, in their state of busy-ness, they will conveniently forget or ignore what lies ahead of them as they progress in their life stages. However, it is imperative for them to be aware at an early stage of what it entails and be mentally prepared for life as a senior which involves often times discomfiting changes on various fronts − ranging from relationships with their families, preventive care and wellbeing both medically and socially, adaptations at the workplace and social acceptance in retirement.",23,370,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00370

Diversity adds colours to a society, but it is the communal strength that defines us as a community and a nation. We do not, and should not, hope for unity to shine through only when we have difficult times. As Singaporeans, we can and should aim to build solidarity at different levels within the society.

Increasingly, we have seen that it is a social and economic cost to our society when older people are shut out from mainstream life.

This way, we not only maximise resources, infrastructure, people, communication of policies and outreach; it also provides options for localised employment opportunities, promotes active ageing and lifelong learning.

We want to develop infrastructure and solutions that encourage active ageing and inter-generational bonding. By combining ideas from different disciplines such as healthcare, information technology, design and social behavioural research, we aim to provide better care and greater convenience for seniors in a home and community setting. The learning points from this project can be applied to other estates. This is a priority for Singapore as we need to be ready for an ageing population.",12,389,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00389

I met this 100-year-old lady who stays with her family in Toa Payoh North. She exercises regularly and joins her friends for outings and activities. She is more fortunate than some of her neighbours who are non-ambulant and require frequent medical assistance.

These include independent retailers who offer innovative contracts, such as supply of electricity from renewable sources and energy management solutions like smart meters and demand response. But this was not always the case. Previously, there were no independent retailers in Singapore because we did not have an electricity futures market for independent retailers to manage their risks. Setting up the futures market was a complex and difficult task. Earlier attempts had failed because power generation companies did not want independent retailers to enter the market and compete with their retail subsidiaries.",16,393,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00393

Today, we have a futures market with three independent retailers – CPvT Energy Asia, Sun Electric Power and Sunseap Energy. I am glad their entry has led to more competitive prices and more choices for consumers. This includes my residents in Bishan-Toa Payoh. Independent retailers submitted the most competitive bids in our Town Council's latest bulk tender for electricity supply.

The real income growth could have been worse for this group of workers if not for numerous interventions, such as providing Workfare Income Supplement, introducing mandatory Progressive Wage Models in low-wage sectors, making specific National Wages Council (NWC) recommendations for low-wage workers, and providing training to upgrade and deepen their skills. We must take bolder steps to address the widening income gap and, at the same time, ensure sustainability of our efforts and their outcomes.

Therefore, I strongly call for legislation on some sections of the recommendations. The dollar quantum wage increments should be made mandatory for employees in the 20th and 30th percentile, in terms of basic salary. Alternatively, the Government could explore making this mandatory in three industries – cleaning, security and landscape − by factoring these as part of the licensing conditions.",11,434,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00434
2016-01-26-T-005,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"There is another aspect that can bring about better pay packets for our workers. The Government can play a greater role in encouraging their service providers with many low-wage workers to give Annual Increments (AI) and Annual Wage Supplement (AWS). Government procurement officers can be more worker-centric by being more proactive to look into the welfare accorded to the outsourced workers by their potential service providers. All these moves, with the Government taking the lead, will create a ripple effect, gradually evolving to become an industry norm.",12,435,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00435

The nuances of this mechanism have allowed the stakeholders to take advantage of some loopholes. Eventually, this bad practice has ended up hurting the people who should be most protected – the workers employed on contracts for services. Therefore, we have to venture further into employing a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model as another tool to address our widening income gap, with greater emphasis on the human resource practices of the partners from the private sectors.",14,437,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00437

Many training opportunities to enhance skills or perform new jobs are made available with the government's assistance. It is important that these opportunities are used in order to help their employers make the necessary restructuring measures to improve their competitiveness. Currently, the number of Malay workers undergoing training for skills upgrading is still lesser than workers from the other communities. This can affect the ability of our Malay workers to get good jobs when Singapore's economy undergoes renewal.",20,443,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00443

Many of these are wizened and street-smart from years of hard knocks. They could represent an invaluable resource for companies trying to internationalise.

It is time to do away with generic Government support schemes that served more as subsidy schemes to help businesses defray fixed and equipment costs, rather than to address their underlying lack of competitiveness. Future schemes should focus on helping firms create new, innovative and differentiated products and services that are truly competitive internationally.

2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I agree with the first line of the President's Address that ""SG50 was a defining year for Singaporeans"". As we now move into SG51, we are entering a new era. Many citizens that I have spoken to, feel a sense of excitement and optimism. Yet, this is also tempered with some caution and concern, due to the new challenges that Singapore is facing.",2,475,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00475
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Externally, we are dealing with an increasingly borderless world that military strategists would term as volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous, or ""VUCA"". This VUCA world presents economic, security and environmental challenges to a small country like Singapore.",3,476,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00476
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"At home, we have a more pluralistic Singaporean society defined by a greater multiplicity of voices, perspectives and opinions on what is best for the country. The new generation of Singaporeans have to deal with education, transport, housing and healthcare landscapes that have evolved, and will continue to evolve, over the next few years. Indeed, we are not so much talking about a ""new normal"", but a ""New Singapore"".",4,477,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00477
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, I would like to highlight two areas that are important to help navigate this new paradigm that we are facing today. I would first elaborate on how we can develop the next generation of Singaporeans and imbue them with the resilience and the necessary life-skills to navigate this increasingly complex global and social landscape.",5,478,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00478
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, I would like to comment on how we can better strengthen our social fabric and community ties in this pluralistic society, so that we can tap on the collective wisdom of the crowd, while avoiding divisive forces that might segment our nation",6,479,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00479
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Our early leaders and Pioneers lived in a unique era where the exceptional circumstances that surrounded Singapore at that time produced tough and resilient men and women who were mature beyond their years. While it is impossible to replicate the exact same political climate and social settings of that period, I believe that it is important for us to imbue our youth today with the spirit of resilience that kept our Pioneer Generation going when things got tough.",7,480,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00480
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I have heard ""resilience"" being mentioned quite a few times in this august Chamber in the past few days. My ""resilience"" is defined by the American Psychological Association (APA) as ""the ability to adapt well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threat, or significant sources of stress."" Contrary to what many people would think, resilience does not require extraordinary fortitude and strength. In fact, it is a concept that can be taught.",8,481,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00481

2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Youths and young adults that had undergone the programme were found to be more optimistic; they were more likely to interpret setbacks as temporary and regard them as learning opportunities; and they were less likely to display depression-like symptoms later in life.

2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"While training our youths in resilience will prepare them to ride the waves of change and challenges that will undoubtedly come their way, we also need to give them the tools that will allow them to master their own future.

2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Since the early 2000s, MOE has been advocating a ""T"" shaped education where students are equipped with deep subject-matter knowledge and, concurrently, a breadth of other areas of knowledge that would give them the ability to operate across different fields. But we now need a new paradigm of learning. This is the concept of the ""I"" shaped graduate that some Polytechnic colleagues and I have been advocating.",12,485,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00485
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Allow me, Sir, to speak more on this concept. The horizontal bar at the top of the capital ""I"" is the breadth of knowledge that is embodied by the same horizontal bar that denotes the ""T"" shaped education mentioned earlier. The vertical bar in the ""I"" is the depth of subject matter knowledge and technical skills that will help our students master the key competencies of the field of their choosing.",13,486,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00486
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"What I believe is important and is currently lacking, is the horizontal bar at the bottom of the ""I"". I believe that the bottom stroke on the ""I"" should be anchored by life-skills. While there is currently no one recognised universal standard of what might constitute a ""life-skill,"" Ellen Galinsky, co-founder of the Family and Work Institute in the USA, gives us some insight. She highlighted seven essential life-skills that she believes could provide a useful framework that will help individuals to continue to grow and learn throughout their life. They are  (i) Focus & self-control, (ii) Perspective taking, (iii) Communicating, (iv) Making connections, (v) Critical Thinking, (vi) Willingness to take on challenges, and (vii) Self-directed and engaged learning.",14,487,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00487

The IB Learner Profile is designed to facilitate 21st century learning and aims to provide the platform for lifelong learning and to give its graduates all the characteristics that are necessary to succeed in a 21st century society. Ultimately, the IB aims to provide students with life-skills that make them  (i) Inquirers, (ii) Knowledgeable, (iii) Thinkers, (iv) Communicators, (v) Principled, (vi) Open-Minded, (vii) Caring, (viii) Risk-takers, (ix) Balanced, and (x) Reflective.",15,488,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00488

2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"As an educator, I was heartened to read about MOE referring to the concept of ""holistic education"" to develop ""life skills from a young age"" in its recent Addendum to the President's Address. I would thus strongly urge MOE to examine how we can incorporate such life-skills into the pedagogical content and curriculum of our schools as early as possible.",17,490,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00490
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The aim should be to go beyond broad and general statements in textbooks and to adopt a deep-rooted approach in building these skills into the whole learning experience. In this way, these skills will become second-nature to our youths by the time they reach adulthood.

2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, I would now like to move on to the second portion of my speech on strengthening our social fabric and communal ties in a more pluralistic society. Singapore has always prided itself as a multi-racial and multi-religious society where no one is disadvantaged or discriminated against because of the colour of their skin, or because of their faith. While we continue to work through various grassroots organisations and committees to ensure that Singapore remains a tolerant society, we also have to acknowledge the communal mix of Singapore today has changed over the years.",19,492,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00492
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Among us are foreigners, permanent residents and new citizens who have decided to sink their roots into our country, which highlights the social reality that the ""New Singapore"" is facing today. This reality was acknowledged by the President in his Address when he commented on how we are becoming more diverse, and posed the question as to whether we will ""remain a cohesive society, or will our differences pull us apart?""",20,493,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00493
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The oft-repeated message that Singapore has its roots as a migrant society and that immigrants need to be introduced in a calibrated manner to augment the low fertility rate, is something that has been absorbed into the collective consciousness of Singaporeans. What we need to do, however, is to think about how we can better integrate these PRs and especially new citizens into our social fabric. An emerging challenge today is not so much one of integration between ethnic groups, but perhaps one that is between Singaporeans and new citizens.",21,494,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00494
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"At a community event welcoming new citizens last year, I observed that there were quite a few new citizens who had trouble communicating because of their inability to speak basic English. Grassroots leaders have also provided feedback that some of the new citizens tend to not get involved in community activities, because they feel that they are not able to communicate with their fellow residents of different ethnicities.",22,495,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00495
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, my esteemed colleague, Mr Seah Kian Peng, earlier talked about how Singlish defines us as Singaporean. To respond to that, I would like to say, ""I double-confirm, agree, with what my brother say lah"". However, I would also like to add that English, specifically, standard Singapore English, is possibly the most common language that is used in Singapore. It is the main language of commerce, information and, more critically, of communication across the different ethnic groups. It is, in short, our lingua franca today. As such, it would be useful to explore how we can make it mandatory for potential new citizens to attain a basic level of English language proficiency before they are given Singaporean citizenship.",23,496,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00496
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),Another pre-citizenship requirement could be to consider mandating annual community service hours for the new citizens in their local neighbourhoods or with an Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) of their choice. This would allow them to develop a deeper understanding of the wider community and society that they are in.,24,497,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00497
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"For Singapore to progress as a country, I believe that we need to attract the best talent from around the world and bring in new knowledge and skill-sets that are not available locally. However, I would urge the Government to consider introducing language and other assimilation requirements for PRs before they are granted Singapore citizenship. These measures would undoubtedly help new citizens assimilate and integrate better into our social and community fabric, and that in turn would allow them to better contribute to Singapore's growth and development. This would also allow all Singaporeans to have what the President referred to as, ""a shared understanding of what unites and binds us to one another.""",25,498,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00498
2016-01-26-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, Singapore has achieved much in the last 50 years. On the horizon is a ""New Singapore"" that faces a set of radically new challenges that are different from what we once encountered. While we will adapt and adjust to meet these new challenges, let us also continue to hold true to our unassailable principles of democracy, meritocracy and equality of ethnicities and religions. This will ensure that Singapore will always be that special and unique place in the world that Singaporeans are proud to call home. Together, we will navigate these uncharted waters with courage and look ahead to SG51 and beyond. On this note, Sir, I support the motion of thanks to the President.",26,499,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00499

2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"His two main points under Legal Aid and the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme can be considered under the broad rubric of access to justice.

2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"I thought that I should share what has been done because sometimes, the perception is that that parameter of the $10,000 cap is too strict. In fact, what we have done over the last couple of years is to expand the coverage, even though the amount of $10,000 has not itself increased.",3,502,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00502
2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In 2013, we amended the Legal Aid and Advice Act to take into account the current cost of living. The net effect of the amendments was to expand the coverage of legal aid to include more vulnerable applicants. To qualify for legal aid, the individual must have an annual disposable income of $10,000 or below, and disposable capital of $10,000 or below. So, it is a double-barrelled test, meaning you have to meet both the income test and the capital test.",4,503,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00503
2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The thing about the income test is that most people have the impression that when we say $10,000 income, that means your gross income. They think that so long as you earn more than $10,000 per annum, that disqualifies you. What we actually look at is disposable income. So, you look at the gross income, minus off all the things which you can deduct, like the cost of living expenses, and so on, and you see what remains. What remains is the disposable income, and if that is $10,000 or less, then you would qualify.",5,504,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00504
2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"So, someone could have a gross income of $30,000, for example, but if after deducting all the items that are permitted to be deducted, your disposable income is, let us say, $9,000, then you would qualify.",6,505,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00505
2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"What we did in 2013 was to increase the deductibles, so that more people would qualify. Prior to the amendments, the coverage of legal aid was about 17% of Singaporeans and PRs. With the expanded means test, it was envisaged that legal aid would cover about 25% of Singaporeans and PRs, which would translate to about 300,000 additional persons who could be potentially covered under the Act. This extended coverage does not even take into account the Director's discretion to depart from the general means test in certain circumstances.",7,506,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00506
2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Just to reiterate the point I made earlier – although we have not increased the $10,000 cap, we have nevertheless increased and expanded the coverage of legal aid.",8,507,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00507
2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"I move on now to criminal legal aid. Mr Tan noted that more people had stepped up for pro bono work and called for others to step up as well. I should say here that we are completely in agreement that more volunteer, lawyers and others who are in a position to do so, should step up for pro bono legal work. What I want to do is to highlight what the Government has done in the last couple of years and to indicate that it is also our mission to encourage pro bono work.",9,508,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00508
2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In May 2015, the Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam launched the Enhanced Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS). Under the enhanced scheme, what the Government now does is it provides the bulk of funding, comprising $800,000 for start-up costs and an annual commitment of up to $3.5 million to cover operational costs, honoraria and disbursements. This is given to the Law Society. The Law Society is the organisation that runs the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. The lawyers deal with the Pro Bono Services office of the Law Society. But the funding now comes directly from the Ministry of Law, given to the Law Society. This increased funding enables increased legal aid. The increased funding covers the honoraria, operational costs and disbursements.",10,509,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00509

2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In 2014, there were 1,780 applications for criminal legal aid, out of which only 431 were granted. In contrast, I note, that Mr Thio Shen Yi SC, the President of the Law Society, mentioned at the Opening of the Legal Year in 2016 that last year, that is, in 2015, the CLAS lawyers helped 1,300 poor people accused of crime, an increase of 300% from 2014. The volunteer lawyers are paid an honorarium. It is not the same as market rate, but that honorarium goes some way towards defraying their legal fees. And the disbursements are covered. In effect, by providing the increased funding, my Ministry is supporting criminal legal aid.",12,511,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00511
2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"I should also say that there is another aspect of access to justice. I talked about legal aid and criminal legal aid. There is another category of cases, where it may not actually be necessary to have a lawyer because of the nature of the claim, but you nevertheless want to have your dispute resolved. Two very good examples of this are the procedures under the Prevention from Harassment Act and the Community Dispute Resolution Act 2015.",13,512,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00512
2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Those two Acts were specifically designed to allow individuals to make their claims in person, and not to have to incur legal costs and expenses. If you take these three things that I have mentioned, you can see that very slowly, what we have done is, we have been boosting and supporting legal aid, we have been boosting and supporting criminal legal aid, and at the same time, increasing access to justice by simplifying procedures and making it easier for individuals to have their disputes resolved.",14,513,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00513
2016-01-26-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Moving on to another point that Mr Tan raised, which is access to counsel, the rights of an accused person to legal counsel are set out in Article 9(3) of our Constitution, which states ""where a person is arrested, he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice"". Our Courts, in interpreting the Constitution, have determined that this right to legal counsel is to be exercised within a reasonable time after arrest and not immediately after arrest. What amounts to a reasonable time would, of course, depend on the circumstances of the case. I think it has been explained in this Parliament before that we need to strike a balance between the right of the accused person to consult his legal counsel and the public interest in ensuring that the Police is able to effectively investigate each case.",15,514,2016-01-26-T-005-S-00514
