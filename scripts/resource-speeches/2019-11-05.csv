2019-11-05-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the plans to provide student care centres (SCC) in Yishun South including pre-school centres; (b) what are the minimum criteria for private SCCs' operations to ensure that they provide acceptable standards of service; and (c) how often does the Ministry visit these centres to ensure compliance.,1,1,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00001
2019-11-05-T-001,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Mr Speaker, childcare centres provide full-day and half-day care programmes to children below the age of seven, while student care centres (SCCs) provide care and supervision to school-going children from seven to 14 years old.",1,2,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00002
2019-11-05-T-001,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"At the pre-school level, there are 67 childcare centres in the Yishun planning area. About a third are within the existing Nee Soon South ward at Yishun South. To ensure continued access to quality, affordable preschools, the Government will provide about 2,000 more Government-supported places in Yishun planning area over the next few years.",2,3,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00003
2019-11-05-T-001,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"For student care, there are four SCCs registered with MSF to administer the Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) scheme in Nee Soon South ward. Two of them are located in Primary schools and the other two in the community. Together, these four centres have enrolled about 400 students, with sufficient capacity to meet demand. In recent years, MOE has steadily increased the number of school-based SCCs. In particular, for Nee Soon South, Naval Base Primary School has had an SCC since 2007 and Peiying Primary School’s SCC was set up in 2019 to improve accessibility of SCCs. Both centres still have vacancies. MSF and MOE will continue to monitor the demand for SCC places and expand capacity where there is demand.",3,4,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00004
2019-11-05-T-001,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"SCCs that wish to administer SCFA are required to register with MSF. MSF requires registered SCCs, including centres operated by private entities, to meet stipulated standards. These include standards on, among other things, providing a clean and safe physical environment with appropriately sized activity areas, observing good safety, health and hygiene practices, proper supervision of students, and a structured daily programme that supports learning and development. For example, SCC premises should have at least three square metres of space per student, and at least one SCC staff who is trained in first aid should be present at all times during opening hours.",4,5,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00005
2019-11-05-T-001,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"MSF conducts audits on registered SCCs, which may include surprise checks, at least once every two years to ensure compliance with the above requirements. More frequent checks may be conducted as needed, for example to look into feedback and complaints received and where the SCC has weaknesses identified in previous audits. SCCs that do not meet requirements and fail to rectify the areas of improvement within the stipulated timeline can have their SCFA administrator status revoked.",5,6,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00006
2019-11-05-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Sir, I would like to thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his comprehensive reply. I have four supplementary questions.",1,7,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00007
2019-11-05-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"First, from the feedback from my residents is that for the school-based SCCs, most of the time, my residents are told that the places are reserved for children from lower income families. Is this true? Many of those from middle income families find that they have problems getting into school-based SCCs.",2,8,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00008
2019-11-05-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The second question is, I am glad to hear that there is such a requirement of three square metres per student. I would like to ask if there are audit checks to make sure that the SCCs adhere to such a requirement. The feedback is that it is always very cramped. They have visited the private ones and they say these are always very cramped, and the children, some lie on the floor, some lie on the table; and they look like they are not very well run.",3,9,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00009
2019-11-05-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The third question is, the feedback received from private operators is that HDB releases void deck space more for childcare centres, not so much for student care operators. Is there a plan for HDB to release void deck space to private operators for SCCs?",4,10,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00010
2019-11-05-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The last question is, I understand that MOE has plans for after-school care in every Primary school. I would like to ask if there is any timeline and whether we are on schedule?",5,11,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00011
2019-11-05-T-001,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Sir, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions and all the suggestions. Let me answer the fourth question first. I am happy to share with the Member that we are on track to have SCCs in all 185 Primary schools by 2020. So, this is good news.",1,12,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00012
2019-11-05-T-001,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"As it is today, the capacity in the Nee Soon South area, in particular, exceeds utilisation. If the Member has any requests or demands from any resident from her constituency, she may like to work with us to see how we can help.",2,13,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00013
2019-11-05-T-001,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"As for the question about three square metres, we do have audit checks. We have a framework where we work not only with operators, but also with parents and whenever we know there are some inconsistencies in the practices, we will be more than happy to look at it. We want to make sure that the child's time in the SCC is meaningful and has value-add, and that helps in the educational journey.",3,14,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00014
2019-11-05-T-001,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"For the question about the private sector, we take note of this feedback. At the end of the day, we work with the local community and the agencies to see how we are able to meet the demand. At this point in time, in Nee Soon South, the demand is less than the capacity that we have. We will continue to see how we can facilitate this whole process of providing every child a good start in life.",4,15,2019-11-05-T-001-S-00015
2019-11-05-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether he can provide an update on measures taken to rehabilitate and protect at-risk individuals and offenders to transform their lives and the results to date.,1,16,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00016
2019-11-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mr Speaker, the Government adopts a range of measures to support at-risk youths and youth offenders.",1,17,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00017
2019-11-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"First, we intervene upstream to address risk factors before offences are committed.",2,18,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00018
2019-11-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"In 2012, MSF appointed two Social Service Agencies to run ""Youth GO!"". Under Youth GO!, youth workers would conduct street outreach to engage at-risk youths and sometimes, it could be even late at night. Youth GO! workers reach out to around 300 youths each month and engage them in structured activities, which reduces risky behaviours and improves their relationships and life skills.",3,19,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00019
2019-11-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"MSF works closely with MOE to provide the Enhanced STEP-UP (ESU) programme, benefiting more than 600 youths each year. This programme supports youths who are at risk of dropping out and those who have left school, so that they can continue their education or acquire vocational skills for employment.",4,20,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00020
2019-11-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"MSF is also working with our partners to pilot a Localised Community Network (LCN) in Jurong West, to improve the coordination between various partners and provide more seamless support to the youths and their families. If this pilot works out, we can look to expand it. So, that is first – upstream.",5,21,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00021
2019-11-05-T-002,,,away from the criminal justice system as far as possible.,1,22,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00022
2019-11-05-T-002,,,"MSF appointed nine social service agencies to be what we call ""Integrated Service Providers"" or ISPs, which support youth offenders diverted away from the criminal justice system. ISPs run programmes to address offending behaviours and have worked with around 900 youths and families so far. On average, more than 80% of the youths satisfactorily complete their programmes. Arrests of youths aged between seven and 19 years old have fallen from around 3,100 in 2014 to 2,700 in 2018, a decrease of 13%.",2,23,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00023
2019-11-05-T-002,,,to involve families and minimise disruption to the youth's development.,1,24,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00024
2019-11-05-T-002,,,"Such interventions include probation and rehabilitation outside of residential facilities. MSF employs a family-focused approach to address the root causes of youth offending, such as weak family support. The average three-year recidivism rate of probationers aged below 16 years old has fallen. A 19.5% recidivism rate for cases closed from 2007 to 2009, improved to 12.5% for cases closed from 2010 to 2014.",2,25,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00025
2019-11-05-T-002,,,"MSF's Youth Homes run programmes to build our youths’ character and life-skills. Formal education is a key component as well, and the majority of those who sit for national examinations such as the GCE ""N"" and ""O"" Levels, attain passes above the national average.",3,26,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00026

2019-11-05-T-002,,,"We announced during the Committee of Supply this year that we are extending the period of post-care support in Youth Homes from two months to one year. The longer duration helps youths to sustain good habits and skills acquired during their residence and encourages them to continue their academic or vocational training. The Singapore Prison Service adopts a similar approach for youth offenders in prison, by staging support from the point of imprisonment, to their release and reintegration back into the community.",2,28,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00028
2019-11-05-T-002,,,"In addition, labelling someone as an ex-offender makes reintegration more difficult for him or her. Hence, our recent amendments to the Children and Young Persons Act or CYPA have also included enhancing the protection of youth offenders' identity and privacy.",3,29,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00029
2019-11-05-T-002,,,The Government is committed to protecting and supporting youth-at-risk and youth offenders. This is a continuous work-in-progress. MSF will continue to work closely with other Ministries and our community partners to steer at-risk youths away from negative behaviours and provide rehabilitative and post-care initiatives to break the cycle of offending.,4,30,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00030
2019-11-05-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I thank the Minister for the comprehensive answer. Indeed, I am very encouraged by the good progress that he has reported. I would like to ask one supplementary question, which is beyond all the efforts taken – both upstream and downstream – and attempts to re-integrate these at-risk individuals with their families and into society, I would like to ask what efforts are being made, in particular, for them once they are able to get into the job market. What efforts are there that are made to help them find suitable jobs? At the same time, are there any schemes which would allow employers to also be encouraged or incentivised to take on-board these individuals?",1,31,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00031
2019-11-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I thank the Member for his interest in ensuring that beyond the formal framework of supporting youth offenders in the institutions and in the one-year period immediately post discharge, what more are we doing. Sometime ago, we ran a pilot, working with the employment agencies in Government to provide a framework to help at-risk youths and youth offenders re-integrate into the workforce, and to help address any concerns that they may have in doing so. At the conclusion of the pilot, that effort was merged into the mainstream WSG framework so that employment agencies working with WSG are empowered to provide better support to at-risk youths and youth offenders.",1,32,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00032
2019-11-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We continue to keep a close eye on that front. With the support of the various social service agencies in the community, we will partner and look out for youths who start to struggle, even as they attempt to re-integrate back into society and back into the workforce. We would, of course, be very happy if the Member representing the enterprises that he does, is prepared to partner us in some future point in time, to continue this work of partnership to better enable youth offenders to find their place back in society.",2,33,2019-11-05-T-002-S-00033
2019-11-05-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the expected outlook for the net formation (formation minus cessation) of businesses by sector in 2019; (b) which sectors are seeing declining net formation trends and what are the likely causes for the declines; (c) what efforts are being introduced to ensure net formation remains healthy over the coming years; and (d) whether there will be a continued level of ""healthy"" cessation of businesses.",1,34,2019-11-05-T-003-S-00034
2019-11-05-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Sir, in the first nine months of 2019, the total net formation of business entities in the economy was around 9,900. This is about a quarter lower than the average of around 13,800 recorded over the same period between 2014 and 2018.",1,35,2019-11-05-T-003-S-00035
2019-11-05-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Most sectors saw a fall in the net formation of business entities during this period, including the transportation and storage, business services and construction sectors. Heightened economic uncertainties in the global economy and the resulting slowdown in the Singapore economy are likely to be factors contributing to this trend. MTI expects the net formation of businesses to remain subdued for the rest of 2019.",2,36,2019-11-05-T-003-S-00036
2019-11-05-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"MTI has several strategies to develop a vibrant eco-system for business. First, we are looking at ways to grow our economy and enable companies to seize new opportunities, both locally and overseas. This includes transforming our industries, developing new sectors such as agri-tech and precision medicine, and supporting our companies to tap on external growth opportunities.",3,37,2019-11-05-T-003-S-00037
2019-11-05-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Second, we are fostering a pro-enterprise environment by lowering the barriers of entry and exit for businesses. For instance, MTI launched the GoBusiness Licensing portal for food services on 31 October, which reduces the number of regulatory touch-points for businesses from 14 to one and the number of data fields required from more than 800 to below 100. Businesses can also benefit from lower licence fees and quicker processing time. We will extend this to other sectors, such as retail and environmental services, so that more businesses can benefit from the rules review and process re-engineering.",4,38,2019-11-05-T-003-S-00038
2019-11-05-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Third, we will continue to develop a vibrant startup eco-system. We established Startup SG in 2017 to provide start-ups with access to a wide range of local financial and non-financial support. These include Startup SG Founder, which provides mentorship and start-up capital grants to first-time entrepreneurs with innovative business ideas and Startup SG Network, which connects startup eco-system players.",5,39,2019-11-05-T-003-S-00039
2019-11-05-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Sir, Government measures are important, but they are not sufficient. To succeed in our goal of building a vibrant business eco-system, we need a collective effort from business owners, workers and Government to work in partnership to transform our economy and enterprises together.",6,40,2019-11-05-T-003-S-00040
2019-11-05-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive answers to my question. I only have one supplementary question. In relation to the continued level of ""healthy"" cessation of businesses, as stated in the last part of my original question, can the Senior Minister of State share whether MTI has any specific level of target in terms of the definition of ""healthy"" cessation of businesses? In relation to the economic cycle we are facing now, whether there is any good feel of ""healthy"" cessation of businesses going forward, in taking into particular consideration, the outlook of the economy.",1,41,2019-11-05-T-003-S-00041
2019-11-05-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I think in any economy, whether in good times or in challenging times, we will see firms entering and firms exiting. This is part and parcel of a well functioning economy. What we want is to ensure that, in the end, resources are being channelled into the more productive, more competitive firms. Firms that are able to offer better services, better products, better able to meet customers' needs. So, we do not have targets in terms of what are the levels of firms exiting the economy. But certainly, I think this process of allowing the churn – firms that are not doing well, exiting; firms that are more competitive, more productive, doing better, coming in – so that the resources – land, labour – these resources are then better able to be channelled to the more competitive and more productive companies.",1,42,2019-11-05-T-003-S-00042
2019-11-05-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Over time, if we do this well, then the economy will get stronger and stronger, the capabilities in our enterprises will get stronger and our workers will be able to get better jobs.",2,43,2019-11-05-T-003-S-00043
2019-11-05-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the impact of Dyson's cancellation of plans to build electric vehicles (EV) in Singapore and whether there are value propositions and opportunities to develop the EV business.,1,44,2019-11-05-T-004-S-00044
2019-11-05-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the question on electric vehicles and Dyson's decision was also raised by Mr Seah Kian Peng yesterday and the reply had been converted into a written answer. But, let me address Mr Liang Eng Hwa's question on a very similar topic.",1,45,2019-11-05-T-004-S-00045
2019-11-05-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Sir, Dyson's decision to wind down its electric vehicles business will not impact its presence and operations in Singapore. Out of Dyson's 1,200-strong workforce in Singapore, 20 employees are from their electric vehicles business. Dyson will redeploy the affected employees within the organisation.",2,46,2019-11-05-T-004-S-00046
2019-11-05-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Although Dyson will no longer pursue its electric vehicles business, it will continue to grow its core business in Singapore, develop battery technology for consumer products and expand research and development in areas such as sensors, robotics and artificial intelligence, which will also support the development of a smart mobility eco-system.",3,47,2019-11-05-T-004-S-00047
2019-11-05-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Other companies have also expressed interest in developing smart mobility solutions in Singapore. They value our highly skilled workforce, our strengths in advanced technologies such as robotics and automation and our strong intellectual property protection regime; and if I may add, our strong tripartite partnership. We will continue to work with these companies to harness the new opportunities for Singapore, for our companies, for our workers.",4,48,2019-11-05-T-004-S-00048
2019-11-05-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, can I ask the Senior Minister of State whether there were any issues of the lack of any specific capabilities or advantages on our part that contributed to Dyson's cancellation of the plans to build electric vehicles here in Singapore? Whether the electric vehicles industry is one that we want to grow or pursue; whether we do have plans to attract other electric vehicles industry players here; and also, whether do we have the necessary capabilities to support such an industry?",1,49,2019-11-05-T-004-S-00049
2019-11-05-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I thank Mr Liang Eng Hwa for his supplementary question. Is it due to a lack of capabilities? No. Dyson decided not to continue with its electric vehicles manufacturing, this is a business that they were thinking of going into and later they decided that it would not be viable, commercially, for the company to continue. So, they have stopped their plans to go into this area.",1,50,2019-11-05-T-004-S-00050
2019-11-05-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Singapore, we do have strengths, as I explained in my answer, in advanced manufacturing, in automation. Because people see Singapore as a place where you can do research and development, you have a skilled workforce, you have good intellectual property protection. This eco-system is what we are trying to grow, whether it is for manufacturing of electric vehicles, high-end equipment for precision engineering, for bio and medical technology equipment, things which require high skill and can produce high value, things which require a lot of intellectual property and knowledge-based, things which Singapore, with our trusted brand name, skilled workforce, we are well-equipped to play it.",2,51,2019-11-05-T-004-S-00051

2019-11-05-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The plans for the electric vehicles and any associated incentives that are tied to the electric vehicles project, if the electrical vehicles project is not going to continue, the incentives would not be given. I want to be clear that because the project has not taken place and the investments have not been made, the incentives have not been given. So, with the decision by Dyson not to continue with this electrical vehicles business, the incentives would therefore not be given for this project.",1,53,2019-11-05-T-004-S-00053

This year, we have expanded the criteria so that one in five resident households are eligible, doubling the proportion for the 2018 PTV exercise.",1,56,2019-11-05-T-005-S-00056

2019-11-05-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"The PTV application process allows us to directly engage and better understand each household's needs, which may go beyond transport costs. Through this process, the CCCs have been able to provide tailored support through other Government assistance schemes. We will continue to explore ways to streamline the process for future exercises.",4,59,2019-11-05-T-005-S-00059

2019-11-05-T-005,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. My first supplementary question is really a clarification, which is, whether there is any insight or reason for the quite large shortfall in the number of PTVs issued compared to the projected number initially. I am not sure that there was much insight into that at the moment.",1,61,2019-11-05-T-005-S-00061
2019-11-05-T-005,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The second supplementary question is, whether the various PT assistance schemes could be consolidated to support low-income individuals better to ensure no gaps in coverage. The reason is, as we have seen, the evidence suggests that right now, there may be gaps in coverage because there could be eligible families who are not coming forward for whatever reason; and it would be better to automatically give them some grants.",2,62,2019-11-05-T-005-S-00062
2019-11-05-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Sir, PTVs have been in existence since 2007, so, more than 10 years. The number of vouchers made available has increased over the years. For the latest exercise, in 2018, the number of vouchers made available was the highest amount at that point. The quantum and the numbers benefiting from the PTV exercise have also increased, although given that the fare increase typically follows a certain timeframe – for example, end of the year – therefore, the PTV take-up rate may not be reflective of the economic climate or the needs of low-income households.",1,63,2019-11-05-T-005-S-00063
2019-11-05-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"We respect the decision of each household to apply for the PTVs. When we look at the proportion, there is no discernible trend of whether it is decreasing or increasing, I think this depends on the individuals or the households' decision whether to apply or not. In fact, there are times when we advise residents to apply for certain social assistance schemes; the response is that they can cope and they do not see the need to go forth and apply for these schemes.",2,64,2019-11-05-T-005-S-00064
2019-11-05-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Having said that, we are committed to raise awareness of PTV exercise so that those who are in need are not deprived of it because of ignorance. Given this time, for the 2019 PTVs, we have raised the household income eligibility criterion. So, we expect more households to benefit and hopefully they can come forward to apply for the PTVs.",3,65,2019-11-05-T-005-S-00065
2019-11-05-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"As to the Member's second question about the consolidation of different assistance schemes, our fare structure does take care of different vulnerable groups. For example, low-income workers who are already on the WIS scheme can already qualify for the concessionary fare. Students, senior citizens and people with disabilities also enjoy concessionary fares. In fact, more than half of Singaporeans do not pay the adult fare, the full adult fare, so they are already taken care of under the concessionary fares schemes. But the needs of every individual or household could differ. It could go beyond public transport. That is why there are various other schemes available, some are automatic, some are upon application, so that tailored assistance could be made available to help these residents. We look forward to the local CCCs' support to help us reach out to these households so that help can be rendered to them.",4,66,2019-11-05-T-005-S-00066
2019-11-05-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Government will undertake a final environmental impact assessment study to consider the holistic impact of the Cross Island MRT Line before making a decision on which of the two existing alignment options to choose from.,1,67,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00067
2019-11-05-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Speaker, in 2013, LTA engaged a global specialist consultant to embark on a comprehensive and extensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for a segment of the Cross Island Line (CRL) near the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR). The study was divided into two phases with the first phase focusing on the environmental impact of undertaking site investigation works on the CCNR. The second phase of the study focused on the potential environmental impact of the construction and operational phases of the CRL. Together, they would provide a complete assessment of the environmental impact of the project.",1,68,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00068
2019-11-05-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Transport),"Findings from Phase 1 of the EIA concluded that the site investigations works, with the implementation of mitigating measures and controlled access, could be carried out with moderate impact on the few parts of the nature reserve where these works were to take place. They were gazetted in February 2016 and were widely reported in the media. The Nature Groups were also invited to observe the actual conduct of the site investigation works in the CCNR.",2,69,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00069

Phase 2 of the study was conducted based on a robust set of engineering schemes, which were independently reviewed by an International Panel of Advisors. The report concluded that both underground alignment options are feasible with appropriate mitigating measures. LTA has posted a copy of the report on its website for public viewing and feedback.",3,70,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00070
2019-11-05-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Transport),"In undertaking the EIA, LTA engaged with stakeholders for both alignments. These included discussions and site visits with the Nature Groups as well as local grassroots leaders and residents who may be affected. Their feedback has helped LTA develop a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate the potential impact during the construction and operation of the CRL. There are no plans for a further EIA.",4,71,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00071
2019-11-05-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. I have two supplementary questions.,1,72,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00072
2019-11-05-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"My first supplementary question is this  in assessing the impact of the Cross Island Line, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether the Government has evaluated, one, the animal population projections and two, the future impact of climate change for the critically endangered and endangered species in the CCNR and its adjacent forest, and whether this information will be made available to the public. The basis of my supplementary question is as follows.",2,73,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00073
2019-11-05-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"It has been reported in the EIA report, I believe, that various critically endangered species as well as endangered species of animals tend to be affected as a result. However, it is unclear whether the Government, whether by EIA or other studies, has tracked the population sizes of these species and, more crucially, whether there have been quantitative projections made to gauge how these population sizes may shift due to the construction. It is also unclear whether fairly established matrix used in conservation such as species richness or species evenness have been considered.",3,74,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00074
2019-11-05-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"For the long-term impact of climate change, factoring in this aspect will allow for better understanding of the true resilience of the eco-system in this area, which is important given that the effects of habitat fragmentation and loss will have long-term impacts on the eco-system in the area.",4,75,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00075
2019-11-05-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"My second supplementary question is this  even with mitigation, habitat loss and fragmentation at the worksite may result in the loss of eco-system services, such as carbon sequestration and natural heritage, currently provided by these areas.",5,76,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00076

2019-11-05-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The rationale for me asking this supplementary question is simply this  the idea is that when environmental degradation involving habitat loss and habitat fragmentation occurs, even if trees are replanted, the eco-system services provided by the original forest may either be lost or will take decades or more to be re-established to its prior magnitude and scale.",7,78,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00078

2019-11-05-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, the Member Mr Dennis Tan's Parliamentary Question was about the EIA but his supplementary question, if I understand correctly, is about the larger question about how a decision is arrived for the CRL alignment, and whether the EIA done thus far is sufficient.",1,80,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00080
2019-11-05-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"He has not provided a criticism of either the methodology or the process, or the experts, or the people that have been involved in the EIA. So, as far as the EIA is concerned, it is limited to the projected plans and designs of the CRL and its interaction with the Central Catchment Area. It is not designed to take a whole-of-economy or whole-of-biome approach. Those are things that having had the EIA, the stakeholders, the Ministry, the various agencies involved have to take into consideration including, for example, the economic impact.",2,81,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00081
2019-11-05-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"I just want to have some clarity. Is he suggesting that we redo the EIA because he fundamentally disagrees with the methodology and the findings? Secondly, is he advocating for a specific choice in the alignment of the CRL? Thirdly, I would just make the point that if the question is how might climate change or change in biodiversity interact with any given technical study limited to one specific part of our biome, that is a moving target. That would be something that you can never be satisfied you have done enough because the next study, say, two or three years henceforth, the climate will have changed. Factors affecting our biodiversity will have changed. These are things that academics have to continue to study even as we make our decisions about how to build our public transport system. So, perhaps, the Member might clarify what exactly he is criticising on the EIA and is he advocating for a specific choice for the CRL.",3,82,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00082
2019-11-05-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. My answer in short is no. I am not criticising but I have highlighted, firstly, in my Parliamentary Question to ask the Minister whether the Government undertake a final EIA study to consider the holistic impact. I have sought to explain ""holistic impact"". Perhaps, let me explain further about my second supplementary question in terms of what I mean by ""holistic impact"". I am asking if we have done, and if not, are we prepared to do a more holistic valuation of the worksite environment through eco-system service valuation techniques which assess the economic, cultural and environmental value of our natural capital.",1,83,2019-11-05-T-006-S-00083

From 1 February 2018 to 30 September 2019, 465 people were caught for the possession of vaporisers. The enforcement actions taken against these offenders depended on the merits of each case and included prosecution, composition fines or a warning.

Besides enforcement, the Health Promotion Board will continue to educate Singaporeans regarding the harmful effects of vaporisers and correct any misconception that vaporisers conclusively help with smoking cessation. At the same time, we will strengthen smoking cessation programmes so that smokers can access proven therapies and methods to help them quit smoking.",4,92,2019-11-05-T-007-S-00092
2019-11-05-T-007,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his answer. I have two supplementary questions. My first supplementary question relates to these illegal vapes also being sold in our neighbourhoods. Besides online sales, according to news reports last month, illegal vaporisers are also being sold in our neighbourhoods including busy shopping districts such as Orchard Road. Buyers and sellers, according to the news report, used code words such as ""cartridges"" or ""juices"" to facilitate all these under-the-table illegal sales. My first question is  can I ask that we also step up our enforcement in these areas especially in the neighbourhoods.",1,93,2019-11-05-T-007-S-00093
2019-11-05-T-007,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),My second question relates to a recent study done in the United Kingdom on adults attending the UK National Health Service's Stop Smoking Programme. I would like to ask what are the Ministry's views on this randomised controlled trial that compared e-cigarettes and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation.,2,94,2019-11-05-T-007-S-00094
2019-11-05-T-007,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"On the first point, to step up enforcement, we will do so. We have been working closely with online platforms such as Carousell and Instagram to stamp out online sale of vaporisers. With regard to physical sales, we have conducted intelligence, surprise raids, but we will take into consideration the Member's suggestions. If the Member has specific leads, please do share with us.",1,95,2019-11-05-T-007-S-00095
2019-11-05-T-007,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"On the second question, I believe the Member is referring to the study done in UK on adults attending National Health Service's Stop Smoking Services. That study involved 900 smokers with good motivation to quit. When combined with counselling, 18% of smokers in the e-cigarette group quit smoking at 12 months post-intervention. This is compared with 10% of smokers from the NRT group.",2,96,2019-11-05-T-007-S-00096
2019-11-05-T-007,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"However, in the e-cigarette group, 80% of those who quit smoking continued to use e-cigarettes 12 months later. This means that, overall, less than 4% of those in the e-cigarette group quit tobacco product use and their nicotine addiction totally.",3,97,2019-11-05-T-007-S-00097
2019-11-05-T-007,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,As there are concerns about the potential harmful effects of the long-term use of e-cigarettes – the Member may know about the debate in the US where e-cigarettes have been linked to lung injury – this raises the question on whether they would have been better off quitting using other more proven established methods.,4,98,2019-11-05-T-007-S-00098
2019-11-05-T-007,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"In addition, more than 30% of those in the e-cigarette group who failed to quit ended up using both e-cigarettes and cigarettes. This actually leaves them worse off than before, as a recent large study had shown that dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes are actually exposed to more toxins than persons who only smoke cigarettes.",5,99,2019-11-05-T-007-S-00099
2019-11-05-T-007,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"The Ministry's position is that there is currently limited evidence on the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation product but we will continue to monitor emerging evidence and studies like the ones mentioned by Mr Melvin Yong. Our regulation and public health policies are evidence-based and if there is robust evidence that any particular product can safely help smokers completely stop using tobacco or nicotine, we will be happy to consider these options.",6,100,2019-11-05-T-007-S-00100
2019-11-05-T-008,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Health (a) how many eligible CPF members used up the annual limit of the Flexi-MediSave scheme in the past year; and (b) whether this limit can be reviewed and increased in light of the older members who require frequent outpatient treatments.,1,101,2019-11-05-T-008-S-00101
2019-11-05-T-008,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, the Flexi-MediSave scheme allows Singaporeans aged 60 and above to withdraw up to $200 of MediSave each year to pay for their outpatient medical treatments at public sector Specialist Outpatient Clinics, Polyclinics, and General Practitioner clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). Around 136,000, or 16% of eligible Singaporeans fully utilised their Flexi-MediSave limit in 2018.",1,102,2019-11-05-T-008-S-00102
2019-11-05-T-008,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Health),"MOH regularly reviews our healthcare financing schemes, including Flexi-Medisave. Last year, MOH lowered the minimum age criteria for Flexi-MediSave from 65 to 60. The annual MediSave withdrawal limit for outpatient vaccinations, health screenings and chronic disease management was raised from $400 to $500. This year, MOH enhanced the CHAS scheme, including introducing a new CHAS green tier to cover all Singaporeans with selected chronic conditions, regardless of income. We also introduced the Merdeka Generation (MG) package which provides additional subsidies for MG seniors' outpatient treatments at CHAS clinics, polyclinics and public specialist outpatient clinics.",2,103,2019-11-05-T-008-S-00103
2019-11-05-T-008,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Health),We will continue to conduct regular reviews of our healthcare financing schemes to ensure affordability and also long-term sustainability.,3,104,2019-11-05-T-008-S-00104
2019-11-05-T-008,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. Let me share with the Senior Minister of State one of the reasons why I am asking this question. A few residents have approached me. I would like to say in this Chamber that residents were very thankful for the Flexi-MediSave scheme as it has helped them to allay some of their cost concerns. However, a few of them have highlighted to me their concerns regarding medical costs and have requested me to ask for a review of the $200. Because they tend to finish up the $200 for the year within just one or two visits. Some of these senior residents who are 60 and above would really appreciate if the figures could be reviewed. Can the Senior Minister of State share the timeline and how the review process would be? If there any plans to increase the $200 to slightly above, the residents would be very appreciative to MOH on that front.",1,105,2019-11-05-T-008-S-00105
2019-11-05-T-008,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I understand the point that is being made. But as I have mentioned right at the end of my response, we not just have to look at affordability but also at the longer term sustainability in the use of MediSave. So, we are guided by how residents use the amounts as offered. At this point in time, as I have mentioned earlier, more than eight in 10 of Singapore residents who are eligible to use the Flexi-MediSave do not use the full $200. So, that gives us an indication as to where we have scoped it and the right sizing of that amount at this juncture.",1,106,2019-11-05-T-008-S-00106
2019-11-05-T-008,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"But as the Member has pointed out, we recognise that there are people who rely on this and we will take this into account as we continue to review and update the amounts and the thresholds.",2,107,2019-11-05-T-008-S-00107
2019-11-05-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer and particularly the answer to the supplementary question about the scoping of Flexi-MediSave and MOH's position on reviewing the absolute amount. I am just wondering if MOH can look at increasing the ability to withdraw a higher amount through the Flexi-MediSave scheme for people who have sufficient balances in their basic healthcare sum. For example, if you are in the upper tiers, let us say, you have from $40,000 to $50,000 in your MediSave account. I think the pain point is the fact that you have this sum in your MediSave account post the age of 60 and you need perhaps an additional $100 or $200 but the scheme has that ceiling. So, would MOH be able to look at it from a different perspective and to parse the problem a little differently.",1,108,2019-11-05-T-008-S-00108
2019-11-05-T-008,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Again, I understand the Member's concern and I appreciate the point he is making and we will look at that. But the Member will also appreciate that what he is suggesting will require a differentiated ceiling for each person as to what the Flexi-MediSave limits might be. And that might, itself, present other challenges.",1,109,2019-11-05-T-008-S-00109

Just because you have the Flexi-MediSave withdrawal limits reached or maxed out does not mean you cannot also deploy other schemes. But that said, we will look at the suggestion, especially the one that has the basic healthcare sum as a relevant factor to consider in the context of the limits.",2,110,2019-11-05-T-008-S-00110
2019-11-05-T-009,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the foreign domestic worker levy can be waived for families with three or more young children who are below 16 years of age.,1,111,2019-11-05-T-009-S-00111
2019-11-05-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, the number of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore has increased substantially by about 40% in the last 10 years. In 2018, there were over 250,000 FDWs in Singapore. It is not sustainable for the population of FDWs to grow unchecked.",1,112,2019-11-05-T-009-S-00112
2019-11-05-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Manpower),"To moderate the demand for FDWs in Singapore, a levy has been payable by employers since April 1982. The levy is regularly reviewed and was last adjusted in April 2019 to $300 a month for employers without care-giving needs. However, families with care-giving needs continue to enjoy the FDW concessionary levy rate of $60 a month. This measure strikes a good balance between managing FDW demand and the need for continuing support for Singaporean households with children, seniors and persons with disabilities. Currently, there are no plans to further reduce the FDW concessionary levy.",2,113,2019-11-05-T-009-S-00113
2019-11-05-T-009,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Manpower),"The Government also provides other forms of support for families with children, some of which offer even more assistance to larger families. For example, the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, Child Development Account (CDA) and MediSave Grant for Newborns provide parents with up to $18,000 per child for their first and second child and up to $26,000 per child for their third and fourth child and up to $32,000 per child for their fifth and subsequent child. Parents with more children are also eligible for higher tax rebates and reliefs. As was announced recently during the National Day Rally, pre-school subsidies will also be substantially enhanced.",3,114,2019-11-05-T-009-S-00114
2019-11-05-T-009,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary a supplementary question. Our latest TFR for 2018 shows a number of 1.14. This is the second lowest TFR in the past decade. And given the heavy demands of work, many parents have found it to be a necessity to employ an FDW to help them to do household chores and look after their kids. I believe The Straits Times ran an article over the weekend on this particular subject.",1,115,2019-11-05-T-009-S-00115
2019-11-05-T-009,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"So, will the Ministry consider waiving FDW levies for families with more than three children in order to help them lower their financial demands and to encourage them to have more than three children?",2,116,2019-11-05-T-009-S-00116
2019-11-05-T-009,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, I want to thank the Member Mr Ong Teng Koon for his supplementary question and to assure him that families with care-giving needs, including parents of young children, will continue to enjoy the FDW concessionary levy. Some of these parents with young children are also staying with their grandparents – so, inter-generational households. In fact, inter-generational households may hire more than two FDWs with levy concessions. Just to give an example.",1,117,2019-11-05-T-009-S-00117
2019-11-05-T-009,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For example, a couple with two young children under the age of 16 years old can hire two FDWs at the concessionary levy. And if their parents are staying with them and the parents are above 67 years old, because that sometimes is the preferred arrangement – extended family – they will be entitled to hire an FDW at the concessionary levy. So, in this example, the household would be able to hire three FDWs to help the parents, especially when they have young children, whether two, three or more. Allow me to share a number. Over the last three years, in fact, the majority of our FDW employers, that is, about 80% of our FDW employers enjoy the concessionary levy of $60 a month, which translates into a saving of $240 a month per FDW.",2,118,2019-11-05-T-009-S-00118
2019-11-05-T-009,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"If Mr Ong would allow me to elaborate, the Government has committed additional resources and investments in pre-school education to give our young the best start in life. If you remember, a few months ago, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, during the National Day Rally, announced a series of measures to further boost pre-school education, for example, to increase the total number of Government-supported pre-schools from the current 50% to 80% over time. At the same time, he also announced that more middle income families will benefit from additional pre-school subsidies with the increase of the income ceiling from $7,500 to $12,000. I am saying that when young couples consider having children or more children, an FDW could be one of the considerations. But more often than not, a pre-school is also a key consideration.",3,119,2019-11-05-T-009-S-00119
2019-11-05-T-009,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"And to help families with young children financially, the Government provides many forms of support. I mentioned them earlier. In addition to those that I have mentioned, the Government also provides support, such as Primary and Secondary school subsidies as well as parental tax rebates and reliefs. A child entering Primary school in 2018 would have received more than $130,000 in education subsidies by the time he or she finishes Secondary school. And bigger families with more children will also receive more help from the Baby Bonus scheme as well as higher tax rebates.",4,120,2019-11-05-T-009-S-00120

I would remind Members that we only opened up the BTO market for singles to purchase 2-room units not that long ago. I remember when I started in MND in 2015, application rates were in the double digits.

I think there was a similar question that Mr Gan had asked, in fact, that is related, which is for young couples buying their first BTO flat in non-mature estates – whether we will give an additional chance, which we do, and whether that gives them assurance that within three times, they will be able to purchase a flat in a non-mature estate. The answer to that is indeed, through that additional chance, we are able to assure first-timers buying a flat in a non-mature estate, virtually all of them are able to do so within three tries today. That commitment continues. We will continue to ensure that for first-timers buying a flat in a non-mature estate, within three tries, through the processes that we have, they should be able to get an HDB flat.",1,134,2019-11-05-T-011-S-00134

2019-11-05-T-015,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"IHLs and other like institutions provide public spaces. When you have public spaces, you must ensure that your spaces are safe spaces for your audience, and your audience and the people attending those spaces will have many different views, be of many different persuasions – whether it is race, religion, sexual orientation and so on. So, the key thing is to work within the parameters that I have outlined, which is that they have to be respectful of our social norms and laws and they do have to exercise appropriate judgement and sensitivity, which means that there is an element of discretion. That element of discretion should not be decided based on just your own personal belief but from the view point of, ""This is common space"", you want people coming into the common space to be comfortable, and to take the decision appropriately. So, it depends on your audience. Some audiences may well be able to be much more accommodating, others may feel a little uncomfortable. The institutions will have to take that call.",2,164,2019-11-05-T-015-S-00164
2019-11-05-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,asked the Minister for Education whether the Government will review the policy regarding usage of the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) to permit withdrawals for tertiary studies at private universities.,1,165,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00165
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Education),"Mr Speaker, Sir, various Members, including Mr Zainal Sapari, had previously raised similar questions in this House. The Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) scheme was introduced in 2008 to provide additional financial support for post-Secondary education. Before 2016, we had restricted the use of PSEA to publicly-funded institutions, namely ITE, Polytechnics, Autonomous Universities and the Arts Institutions, NAFA and LaSalle, and also Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) courses. This is because being part of the publicly-funded system, we are assured of the quality of the courses. Further, the programmes are already significantly subsidised and extending PSEA support is a natural thing to do.",1,166,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00166
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Education),"The usage of PSEA was broadened in 2016. We included other approved skills development programmes and modular courses that are subsidised by our continuing education and training policy, and delivered by Government agencies and private training providers. Examples include the training programmes offered at BCA Academy and Digital Marketing in Hospitality offered at SHATEC Institutes.",2,167,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00167
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Education),"If there is any unused amount in the PSEA when the account holder turns 30, this will be transferred to his or her CPF Ordinary Account in the following year.",3,168,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00168
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Education),Quality and relevance remain the key considerations in deciding whether an education and training programme can qualify for PSEA usage. We need to protect the interests of account holders by ensuring that all courses eligible for PSEA support will meet quality standards and the needs of industries.,4,169,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00169
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Education),"Sir, there is a wide range of courses offered by Private Education Institutions (PEIs), with varying quality and learning outcomes. While SkillsFuture Singapore regulates these private commercial players, they are not part of the public education system and we do not extend public subsidy to them. Likewise, we do not have a blanket policy to allow the usage of PSEA for their courses.",5,170,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00170
2019-11-05-T-016,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.,1,171,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00171
2019-11-05-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. Four supplementary questions for Senior Minister of State.",1,172,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00172
2019-11-05-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, as he mentioned in his reply, any unused balance in the PSEA account will be transferred to the holder's CPF Ordinary Account (OA) by the time he reaches 31. I would like to ask he knows of the percentage or numbers of such students or young persons who have balances that are left and are transferred in this way. That is the first question.",2,173,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00173
2019-11-05-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question is, in his reply, I think he repeated the Ministry's stand that the restrictions on PSEA's use are due to concerns about quality as well as relevance. We have come across some residents who had appealed to use PSEA for degree programmes offered by foreign universities that have good international reputation and, in fact, who have collaborations within Singapore with Polytechnics and, in one case, an aeronautical university that has a collaboration with the Air Force. So, would the Senior Minister of State agree that such collaborations are signs that there is an acceptance of the quality of the university offering those degrees and, in a sense, also of the relevance of studies in such fields. That is why there are collaborations in Singapore.",3,174,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00174
2019-11-05-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The third question is, he mentioned also that PSEA is only allowed for Government-subsidised programmes as a natural consequence. Would he not agree that in the sense there is a certain perversion in that logic because a person with less resources would need a support if there is a lack of subsidies in that sense. So, I think that reason is not that convincing.",4,175,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00175
2019-11-05-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"And finally, perhaps he could elaborate a bit on the purpose of Private Educational Institutions (PEIs) in Singapore having the EduTrust mark because I believe some of these private institutions are collaborating with foreign universities to offer degree programmes. So, what is the relevance of the EduTrust mark? Is it not also a sign of quality assurance?",5,176,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00176
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I do not have the data on the CPF Ordinary Account transfer but if the Member could file a separate Question, we would provide the information to her separately.",1,177,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00177
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"As for the other questions from Ms Sylvia Lim, she first asked about the collaborations of different programmes. I think I have explained this in my answer which is that we look at both the quality and also the relevance. Some of these programmes that she mentioned are offered by foreign universities. We understand there is a range of courses offered globally. But it would not be possible for MOE to maintain a comprehensive list of approved overseas programmes because we do need to safeguard the usage of PSEA monies. For practical reasons, it is limited to local institutions. So, if you have a foreign university but they have a local institution and they run some programmes here, as I explained in my answer, some of them do qualify for CET funding. We are looking at the range of possible courses but based on the criteria of quality and also industry relevance.",2,178,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00178
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Ms Lim also said that she has some disagreement with the explanation about quality because these courses are not given subsidy, therefore, we should be allowing the students to use PSEA. I think we have to look at what is the objective that we are trying to achieve in the first place. If you look at the quality of the programme, there is a reason why they are not receiving public subsidy. The quality is uneven amongst the PEIs. For example, we have the Graduate Employment Survey that is done and if you look at the full-time permanent employment rate of their graduates, it ranged from 17% to 60%. There is also a spread in the median gross monthly salary from $2,300, to the highest of $3,200.",3,179,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00179
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"So, because of this, it is not possible to use this approach to say that just because a programme is not subsidised, therefore, you should allow students to use their PSEA. In fact, if you agree that quality of a course and the relevance of the course and the outcomes that the graduates are able to achieve are important considerations, then we should first and foremost, be looking at what is the quality of this course and does it offer students good employment outcomes. In the end, we should not forget that the student has to put in considerable amounts of resources, both time and money to be able to attend and complete the course. So, if the outcomes are not good, I do not think we should be sending mixed signals to confuse people that they are encouraged to sign up for this course when the outcomes are actually not very desirable. I think we do have an obligation and duty to signal clearly to students who are looking at options to consider what are the outcomes and therefore, please think carefully before you decide.",4,180,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00180
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I think the more important point I want to highlight is this  that there are alternative pathways available to students who wish to pursue further studies and to be able to upgrade their skills along the way. Going to a PEI is not the only option for someone who has completed ""A"" Level or Polytechnic. It is not the only means for young Singaporeans to be work-ready. We have very good employment outcomes for Polytechnic Diploma graduates and for many of them, after they join the workforce, there are still opportunities available for them to do their degrees on a part-time basis or on a full-time basis subsequently after they have started working.",5,181,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00181
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"We have also introduced new pathways, including the post-Diploma Advanced or Specialist Diploma for Polytechnic students and the Work-Study Diploma and Post-Diploma pathways that are now available to our students in ITE or Polytechnics. These are applied programmes that combine structured on-the-job training and institution-based courses. The good thing is that when they are under this programme, the Earn-and-Learn programme or the Work-Study Programme, they can earn a salary while they are working and also go back to school. For the students who are doing the Advanced or Specialist Diploma, it takes up to 18 months. For the new pathway that we introduced, where students would pursue a Work-Study programme leading to a Degree, it will take about three years for Polytechnic students.",6,182,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00182
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"So, I think it is important that we provide our students with a good understanding of what are the options, what are the pathways and what are the outcomes of the different pathways so that parents and students are better able to make good decisions on how they want to commit their time and resources.",7,183,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00183
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I think Ms Lim had one last question on EduTrust. EduTrust is something which the Committee for Private Education (CPE) awards, looking at the standards on corporate governance, administration and fee protection but this does not directly relate to the content of the individual programmes and the quality of the academic programmmes or their industry relevance. It is about whether the governance, administration and the fee protection, whether these elements are adequately provided. More to protect students from cases where, like in the past, some of the PEIs folded halfway through the course and the students were then left in the lurch because the money that they had paid, they could not get it back.",8,184,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00184
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"So, EduTrust is meant more for that purpose. It does not say anything about the quality of the course or the industry relevance or even the outcomes for the graduate.",9,185,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00185
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"I think we should separate the two and not mix it up. Getting EduTrust does not mean that you have good outcomes for your students. So, I will still go back to what I said earlier about the importance of looking at the quality of the course, the relevance and the outcomes in deciding where we should be encouraging people to pursue the different skills upgrading and training options.",10,186,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00186

2019-11-05-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Okay. One question. I would like the Senior Minister of State to clarify that he is not actually saying that currently, the courses that are offered by other universities such as reputable foreign universities that are available to students in Singapore, he is not saying that all of them lack quality or relevance. And I would like to ask whether in this sense, the Ministry would be open, at least, to looking at case-by-case appeals for the use of PSEA.",1,190,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00190
2019-11-05-T-016,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I think if Ms Lim listened to my main reply carefully, I ended by saying we do not have a blanket policy to allow the usage of PSEA for PEI courses. But I also mentioned in my reply that we do have private providers that we have allowed to qualify for subsidies. Let us not make classifications based on what type of entity you are as the main focus of our efforts. Let us look at the quality of the courses, the relevance to the industry and the outcomes to the graduates. If there are suitable courses that are offered by private training providers that can achieve those outcomes, I think it is certainly something that we can take a look at.",1,191,2019-11-05-T-016-S-00191

In the Global Competitiveness Index published by the World Economic Forum in 2019, Singapore maintained the top position for the efficiency of its legal framework in dispute resolution.

2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"A key change is the restructuring of the Supreme Court to establish a new Appellate Division of the High Court. The Court of Appeal is the highest Court of the land. It hears both civil and criminal matters arising from decisions of the lower Courts and tribunals. The decisions of the Court of Appeal form a body of authoritative law that has shaped our local jurisprudence. The Court of Appeal has experienced a growing caseload for both criminal and civil matters. In 2013, there were 314 civil and criminal matters filed to the Court of Appeal. In 2018, the number of matters filed to the Court of Appeal increased to 490. Overall, the Court of Appeal heard 56% more matters in 2018 as compared to 2013.",6,204,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00204
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In addition to the growing caseload, the Court of Appeal has also observed that the cases it is hearing are becoming increasingly complex. The Court of Appeal generally sits with no more than three judges to hear each case. In some of the complex appeals, the Chief Justice may convene an enlarged panel of appeal judges to hear the appeal. This is to allow difficult or novel issues to be considered with the benefit of the collective wisdom and insight of a larger pool of judges. There has been a growing number of written decisions issued by a five-judge bench of the Court of Appeal, which is itself indicative of the jurisprudential significance and difficulty of such cases. In 2015, by contrast, 4.3% of all reported decisions were issued by a five-judge quorum. By 2018, this number had increased to about 11.5%.",7,205,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00205

2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The prescribed categories may be amended by the Minister, after consultation with the Chief Justice, by order published in the Gazette. This will allow for the allocation of appeals between the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeal to be refined and also evolved, taking into account operational experience as well as evolving policy considerations. And obviously, as I explained earlier, on novel areas, which are currently prescribed, they may over time, not become novel anymore or it may well become settled with the passage of time. In those cases, there would be flexibility in moving cases or types of cases in and out of the Sixth Schedule.",25,223,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00223

2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me now touch on some of the transfer provisions and explain that to Members. To provide for flexibility in the arrangements, the Court of Appeal will have the power to transfer to itself any appeal that has been made to the Appellate Division and vice versa. The Court of Appeal has that power, not the Appellate Division, to transfer cases from the Appellate Division to itself or cases from the Court of Appeal to the Appellate Division. This can happen, notwithstanding the Sixth Schedule allocation of appeals.",27,225,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00225
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To give an example, the Court of Appeal may transfer to itself, an appeal which is ordinarily allocated to the Appellate Division, if the appeal concerns a dispute involving complex and novel points of law, and the Court of Appeal is satisfied that it will be more appropriate for the matter to be resolved by an earlier decision of the apex court, in other words, giving guidance at an earlier stage so that the law becomes settled on a key and important issue. The Court of Appeal may also consider factors such as whether there are conflicting judicial decisions on the point of law in question which merits clarification.",28,226,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00226
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Conversely, the Court of Appeal may also decide to transfer to the Appellate Division, an appeal which is ordinarily allocated to the Court of Appeal. For instance, an appeal arising from a case relating to constitutional law is ordinarily allocated to the Court of Appeal. However, if the General Division has already rendered its decision on the case and the only issue on the appeal is one of costs, for example, then the Court of Appeal may well decide to transfer the appeal to the Appellate Division. So, the overall subject matter may fall within, but the issue at stake between the parties, might well relate to something straightforward. In that scenario, the Court of Appeal can exercise its discretion to transfer it to the Appellate Division.",29,227,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00227
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As another example, an appeal arising from a case relating to contempt of court is ordinarily allocated to the Court of Appeal. However, if all issues on appeal relate to uncontroversial points of law, then the Court of Appeal may transfer the appeal to the Appellate Division. The same principles as I have explained will apply. Parties themselves may also apply to the Court of Appeal for the appeal to be transferred to the Appellate Division, if the appeal has not been filed to the correct Appellate Court. To be clear, after the Appellate Division has issued its decision on an appeal that has been transferred for its determination, it remains possible – although not the usual course – but possible for a party to bring a further appeal to the Court of Appeal. This will however be subject to the fulfilment of stringent criteria that I will come to in a while.",30,228,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00228

But, the principles on which leave will be accessed to be granted for appeals from the Appellate Division up to the apex court, those would be applied in a far more stringent manner.

2019-11-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Second, the channelling of cases to the new Appellate Division will free up the Court of Appeal to concentrate on appeals which are generally of wider public interest. Under the proposed changes, all appeals from criminal cases originally heard by the High Court, will continue to go on appeal to the apex Court. This is rightly so, as criminal cases heard by the High Court may involve sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty, and thus deserve scrutiny by the highest appellate Court.

In other words, will the introduction of a middle tier Appellate Division lead to cost escalation for appeals to the Court of Appeal, up from present levels?

2019-11-05-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to revisit one important issue on the staffing of the Supreme Court judiciary. The Constitution (Amendment) Bill provides at clause 2 that there are various categories of persons holding ""high judicial office"", which is the position today. Such persons are the Chief Justice, a Justice of the Court of Appeal, a Judge of the Appellate Division, a Judge of the High Court, a Judicial Commissioner, a Senior Judge or an International Judge. For some of these categories of judicial office holders, they are protected under Article 98(1) of the Constitution with security of tenure until age 65. Other categories, however, like Judicial Commissioners and Senior Judges, are appointed for short terms of one to three years.  As we have said in the past, in our view, having short-term judicial office holders is not ideal.",5,265,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00265

The judicial branch of the Government plays a vital role in the country's system of checks and balances between the Executive Government, the Legislature or Parliament, and the Judiciary. The courts are called upon to adjudicate disputes and must decide without fear or favour, regardless of who the parties are. To give assurance that the judicial branch is robust, security of tenure for judges is fundamental. Just as Members of Parliament are accorded with Parliamentary Privilege to ensure free debate in this House, Judges are accorded the security of tenure till retirement age; it is further provided by the Constitution that the office of a Supreme Court Judge must not be abolished during the continuance in office of the Judge.",6,266,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00266

In 2014, when the post of senior judges was created, it was mentioned that retaining judges past their retirement age would enable tapping on their expertise. To serve these purposes, we would like to repeat our call for the Government to review the retirement age of Supreme Court Judges, to retire later, say at 70 years old instead. In past debates, I do not recall the Government rejecting outright such a move and today, I would like to give further grounds for this from a manpower utilisation perspective.",7,267,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00267

Just looking around this House, there are several Members over 65, whom I need not name. Nobody thinks they are incapable of rational thought or are losing their marbles. At the national level, data from MOM shows that for 2018, the labour force participation rate of those aged between 65 and 69 is 45.3% – close to one in two persons. We see over 70s being cleaners and company directors. Being a Judge requires brain work but is not physically demanding. We believe extending the retirement age of Judges to 70 is entirely feasible, to let our Judges work longer with security of tenure, which will be superior to having short-term Judges.",9,269,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00269

2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I wondered whether the retirement age of Supreme Court Judges in Singapore had been designed with an express parliamentary intent. It seems that the retirement age Article originates in the Constitution (Amendment) Bill No 5 of 1969. The Bill inserted after Article 52 of the Constitution, 52F on the tenure of office of Supreme Court Judges. The original Article, and I quote, is  ""Subject to the provisions of this Article, a judge of the Supreme Court shall hold office until he attains the age of sixty-five years or such later time not being later than six months after he attains that age, as the President may approve."" The text has remained substantively the same since then.",4,275,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00275
2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The Explanatory Notes to the 1969 Bill state that this Article largely re-enacted the constitution of Malaysia's provisions on the Supreme Court, which were not present in the Constitution of Singapore. Our Constitution, of course, was originally designed for Singapore as part of the Federation. This was Minister for Law, Mr EW Barker's explanation to Parliament in the second reading debate on 12 June 1969. It seems that we have not then explicitly considered why the retirement age of Supreme Court judges is specified to be so. I note that the hon Member, Ms Sylvia Lim, has brought up this issue previously. I note also that the Malaysian constitution was amended in 2005 to raise the maximum age for a Supreme Court judge to 66 years.",5,276,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00276
2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),Today's Constitution (Amendment) Bill deletes and substitutes the retirement age provision in essentially the same terms.,6,277,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00277
2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The necessity to provide Supreme Court Judges with tenure and guaranteed terms of employment is not disputed. What is an issue is the basis for why the retirement age should be specified in the Constitution and is different from that applying to the rest of society. This may be viewed as inequitable anytime the age applying to the rest of society is lower or higher than that applying to Supreme Court Judges. For many decades the retirement age of 65 for Supreme Court Judges was considerably older than the norm in Singapore and is still higher than the general retirement age of 62 today. Of course, one key difference is that Supreme Court Judges are required to retire at that age, whereas workers outside are not.",7,278,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00278
2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I think more generally, there are at least two main purposes of having such an age limit.",8,279,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00279
2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"One is simply biological. While our wisdom might increase in years, unfortunately, our cognitive functions do not. The demands of high judicial office are exacting. It is obviously more graceful for a Supreme Court Judge to step down at the due time, than to be asked to retire on grounds of their loss of ability, or worse still, removed by a tribunal of their peers. It also assures us that no party has any reason to complain on the basis of age affecting the quality of jurisprudence, which is specifically prohibited by Article 98 of the Constitution. In this regard, Supreme Court judges are not too different from citizens in other jobs, except for the lack of discretion in when to retire.",9,280,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00280
2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The other factor which may be qualitatively important or different is the risk of ossification of ideas or principles in jurisprudence that fail to reflect contemporary values. We are all creatures of our time. Our formative years, our personal and professional experiences, contribute to the decisions that we make. It is no different for Judges. The central difficulty with those judicial systems that grant lifetime tenure, such as the Supreme Court of the United States, is that the composition of the court becomes determined by the longevity of the individual Judges. This is not logical unless longevity itself is a judicial virtue.",10,281,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00281
2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"It is an issue even in a system with a set retirement age such as ours because the age of first appointment can vary both across individual Judges and across time. This means that the average tenure of a Supreme Court Judge can change even if the retirement age does not. If Judges are appointed early in their career, the end result can be a more ossified judicial system without any intent that this be so.",11,282,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00282
2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Therefore, it seems useful to consider  what are the aims of tenure of Supreme Court Judges? Why should the retirement age treat Supreme Court Judges different from the rest of society? What is a desirable length of tenure that protects Judges against political or public interference and yet mitigates the risk of ossification in jurisprudence? If there is such a thing as an ideal tenure length, would it be better to appoint Supreme Court Judges for suitably long, fixed terms, rather than until a set retirement age?",12,283,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00283
2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I do not of course expect that these issues can be addressed directly in today's debate.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek a few clarifications from the Senior Minister of State on the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill. Section 29C(2) provides for an appeal from the General Division of the High Court to the Court of Appeal if the Sixth Schedule or any other written law so provides. Section 1 of the Sixth Schedule provides that for the purposes of section 29C(2), an appeal against the decision of the General Division in the exercise of its original or appellate civil jurisdiction is to be made to the Court of Appeal in the list of cases provided under A to J.",1,287,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00287

I am saying this bearing in mind that for any existing legislation hitherto requiring the Court of Appeal as the final court hearing any appeal, it may still be possible to amend the relevant law, making the new Appellate Division as the final arbiter.",2,288,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00288

I do wonder whether the Senior Minister of State can elaborate a little further on this. I would like to know what were the considerations behind the decision leading to the list of cases under the Sixth Schedule. For example, how does the Government arrive at the conclusion that it would suitable to have the Court of Appeal to hear cases under section 18(5) of the Maintenance of Parents Act and that it is not appropriate for such appeals to be now changed to, say, the Appellate Division instead.",3,289,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00289

Section 29(3) states that making a decision under section 29D(1) to so transfer the case to itself, the Court of Appeal must have regards to matters prescribed by the rules of the Court. In addition to what the Senior Minister of State has shared with us earlier, I would like to ask him whether he is able to share a little bit more as to what would be these matters of considerations which the Ministry has in mind.",5,291,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00291

I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State  one, what is the projected number of judges that would sit at the Appellate Division of the High Court at the inception of the division after the passing of this Bill and two, whether the Senior Minister of State has any estimation or projection as to the number of additional judges which the High Court is expected to have in the next five years after setting up the Appellate Division.",6,292,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00292

Currently, our Judicial Commissioners and older High Court Judges are contractually renewed and do not have tenure under Articles 95 clauses (2) and (5) of the Constitution, meaning that they do not have the certainty of staying on in the judiciary. They are instead appointed by the President with the concurring advice of the Prime Minister.",2,295,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00295
2019-11-05-T-017,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"A 2015 study by the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law on the appointment, tenure and removal of judges in the Commonwealth found that such renewable appointments ""place the career interest of a judge in conflict with the judicial responsibility for upholding the rule of law in cases involving the government or other powerful persons who may have influence over the renewal decision. Such conflicts of interest may pose a risk to both the actual and perceived independence of the judiciary.""",3,296,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00296

I believe in the late 1960s, there was a serious shortage of High Court Judges, resulting in a backlog of court cases. Parliament allowed Judges beyond the retirement age of 65 to stay on as ""contract Judges"", enabling the judiciary to hold on to experienced and able Judges. This Senior Judge scheme is still in place today.",4,297,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00297

However, this changed in the mid-1990s when the salaries of Judges were raised by pegging them to top earners in Singapore.",5,298,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00298

2019-11-05-T-017,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"First, our Constitution provides for the existence of different branches of Government that serve as a check and balance on one another. While Parliament has legislative power, the Judiciary has judicial power and the Cabinet has executive functions. The Parliament vests powers of the Executive on persons other than the Cabinet, such as civil servants of high authority. The Judiciary can make judgments on the constitutionality of legislation passed by Parliament. The Judiciary can also make judgments on the failure of the Cabinet to properly exercise executive functions. The Cabinet implements regulations and policies based on the legislation enacted by Parliament. It is therefore important for us to ensure that each branch has autonomy, so that they can fulfill these functions in the best possible way.

As the supreme law, all other laws passed must not contravene the Constitution. This is called constitutional supremacy. Therefore, Article 4 provides that any law enacted by the Legislature which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void. That would mean that in debating Bills, we should consider their consistency with our Constitution. Such constitutionally-informed debates can protect the electorate's rights and allow public institutions like the judiciary to fulfill their roles, in full view of the electorate.

Termed fundamental liberties, they are meant to be zealously safeguarded, with Parliament only being able to restrict these liberties in very limited circumstances.

At the same time, the quality of the judgments must be kept consistently high and in keeping with the hard-earned reputation for Singapore as a world class, independent court with exceptionally competent and committed Judges of the highest integrity; and in that regard I noted Senior Minister of State highlighting how well our Courts are rated in published rankings across the world.",6,324,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00324

For the overwhelming majority of cases, you only have a one-tier appeal. Only in cases where there are novel points of law of public importance will there be a second set of appeal to the Court of Appeal.

I am not sure whether that is an appropriate suggestion because there is a linkage between increasing retirement age and independence of the Judiciary. But I see this as two separate things. Based on how the Judges have been appointed, the appointment of Senior Judges as well as Judicial Commissioners are done on an ad hoc basis to clear workload as and when workload increases.

The proposed section 10(1) of the SCJA stipulates that proceedings in the General Division of the High Court dealing with civil cases should be before a single Judge. This is the same requirement that exists now. I note, however, section 18G of the SCJA allows the SICC, which is another division of the High Court dealing with international commercial cases, allowing for proceedings to be heard before a single or three Judges. The reason for having three Judges, amongst others, is a recognition of the complexity of the cases that SICC would have to deal with.",13,331,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00331
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"With the increasing complexity of cases and voluminous documents involved in local civil cases, I would respectfully suggest that, as a matter of policy, there should be no distinction drawn between the General Division and the SICC. It may be good to give the Court the discretion to decide which number is more appropriate having regard to all the facts and circumstances. I would be grateful for the Senior Minister of State’s views on this matter.",14,332,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00332
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Second, I note that there is a list of situations set out in the proposed Sixth Schedule where appeals are brought directly to the Court of Appeal, instead of the Appellate Division. I reviewed the list and I note that under paragraph 1(i) of the Sixth Schedule, there is a raft of legislation, from the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act to the Competition Act to Maintenance of Parents Act dealing with a diverse range of topics in respect of which it is stipulated that appeals are to be brought to the Court of Appeal. May I ask what is the policy ground for shortlisting these pieces of legislation?",15,333,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00333
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I note from sub-paragraph (j), it is stated that there would be a direct appeal to the Court of Appeal if it is so provided under a specific piece of legislation. May I also please ask what would be the policy governing the provision for such a direct appeal to the CA in future pieces of legislation that this House may pass?",16,334,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00334
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Third, further arguments. I note with the pleasure that the hon Senior Minister of State has clarified that he will be moving an amendment in the Committee stage of this Bill in respect of the proposed section 29B(2) of the SCJA which would clarify that the operative word there should be ""time"" and not ""date"". This would prevent controversy from arising once this Bill is passed and put into effect.",17,335,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00335
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),,18,336,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00336
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next, I note that the proposed section 29D of the SCJA provides that the Court of Appeal may transfer a right of appeal against an order made under a provision in the Land Acquisition Act. May I please ask what is the rationale for this reservation of right instead of providing for a direct appeal to the Court of Appeal?",19,337,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00337
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In this regard, I note that section 29(2) of the Land Acquisition Act provides for an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the decision of the Board on questions of law. What is the special characteristic of this provision, section 39(A) in the Land Acquisition Act which for some reason, I am unable to find in the statute book?",20,338,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00338
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Under the proposed section 29E of the SCJA, the Court of Appeal may transfer an appeal made under the Land Acquisition Act to the Appellate Division.",21,339,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00339
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Given that the legislative intent under the Land Acquisition Act is for the Court of Appeal to hear these cases, may I know what are the circumstances in which such remission is proposed so that it is made in a way that coheres with parliamentary intent?",22,340,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00340
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I believe the learned Senior Minister of State mentioned something about the situation where all the substantive issues are dealt with, dealing only with ancillary matters. Perhaps that could be a situation that is being contemplated.",23,341,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00341
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next, it is proposed under Schedule 7 of the SCJA that there are certain categories of cases which may be heard by a Judge or two Judges of the Appellate Division. This arrangement is different from the current Sixth Schedule which specifically states the circumstances in which the Court of Appeal will have a single Judge or when it will have two Judges. May I know why is there a necessity to reverse the policy? Also, who will decide how many Judges would sit in these circumstances? The learned Senior Minister of State mentioned about a configuration of Judges based on consent of parties. Is that what is being suggested in these provisions?",24,342,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00342
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),My questions will also apply to similar provisions that are proposed to be applicable to the Court of Appeal.,25,343,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00343
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next, Civil Jurisdiction of the Appellate Division is specifically provided under the proposed section 31 and 35 of the SCJA that the Appellate Division only has civil jurisdiction. May I please ask whether it is contemplated that the Appellate Division has jurisdiction to hear disciplinary cases involving professionals such as lawyers, doctors and so on which do not involve judicial review. Disciplinary cases brought in the Supreme Court are quasi-criminal in nature but generally invoke civil procedure. I welcome a clarification on this.",26,344,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00344
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next, dealing with appeals from the Appellate Division to the Court of Appeal, I note that leave is required; and it makes eminent sense for leave to be required, otherwise the whole rationale of dividing the workload would be thwarted.",27,345,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00345
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I note that the test is whether or not an appeal would raise an issue or point of law of public importance. However, my concern lies with the proposed section 47(4)(a) of the SCJA because it is stated there that leave may not be granted even if the appeal would raise a point of law of public importance. Sir, I would like to ask what are the specific circumstances in which the Court of Appeal may decline exercising jurisdiction in such situations?",28,346,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00346
2019-11-05-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Notwithstanding my comments, I support the amendments Bills to the SCJA, JRA and the Constitution.",29,347,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00347

2019-11-05-T-017,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"Mr Speaker, I am sorry, I just wish to make a clarification which is that the hon Member Mr Murali Pillai earlier suggested that I and Ms Ong had said that we had debated on the connection between fixed-term Judges and the independence of the Judiciary, but I think I want to clarify that I actually did not make those remarks. I think that there might have been some confusion there. I did not speak on fixed-term Judges in Singapore and independence. I believe Ms Ong did.",1,349,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00349

2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, I thank the Members for speaking. I am also grateful to Mr Pillai for his well wishes and also for his wide-ranging speech where he answered not just some other Members' questions, but also some of his own.",1,353,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00353
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Let me address the other questions now.,2,354,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00354
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Ms Lim asked whether the cost of appeal to the Court of Appeal would escalate given the introduction of the Appellate Division as a middle tier. I go back to my earlier point that the Appellate Division is not to be seen as a middle tier. In general, it will not add a further level of appeal in the vast majority of cases and it is not a level of appeal that has to be crossed before one gets to the Court of Appeal.",3,355,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00355
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The appeals from the General Division will be allocated in the first instance. So, you heard me say earlier that there will be two tracks, one of which goes direct to the Court of Appeal and the rest goes to the Appellate Division.",4,356,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00356
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Any further appeal from the Appellate Division will require leave. Mr Pillai, I think, answered that question, and leave will only be granted in very limited situations. In most cases, parties will not go through an additional tier of appeal after a decision from the General Division. As is the case today, there will generally be only one tier of appeal, therefore.",5,357,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00357
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The amendments before the House today also contain initiatives to lower costs of litigation for parties, to address Ms Lim's point directly. So, either by way of paper hearing, which will be quicker and also less expensive in the context of some cases. But all that is of course subject to the overriding discretion of the Court's assessment that it is appropriate for the administration of justice in a case for parties to proceed on a paper hearing.",6,358,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00358
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Murali Pillai asked about the expected increase in the number of Judges. We expect at least three Judges from the current High Court to be appointed to the Appellate Division, and additional appointments to the General Division may be made as may be necessary once the Appellate Division has been set up.",7,359,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00359
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Louis Ng asked how the restructuring of the Supreme Court would affect the doctrine of judicial precedent, or stare decisis. He also asked how persuasive a decision of the Appellate Division will be compared to that of the Court of Appeal.",8,360,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00360
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"It is quite clear, and the order of precedence as set out in the Bill, is as follows, from the highest to the lowest  first, decisions of the Court of Appeal, which remains the apex court of the land; next, the Appellate Division of the High Court; and then the decisions of the General Division of the High Court.",9,361,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00361
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In line with the usual principles of stare decisis, decisions of the higher Court are binding on the lower Court. Decisions of the Court of Appeal will therefore have precedence over decisions of the Appellate Division. This is regardless of whether the decision in question has been issued before or after the establishment of the Appellate Division.",10,362,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00362
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The decision of the Appellate Division will be binding on the General Division and the lower Courts. And the existing High Court decisions will not bind the new Appellate Division. They will have instead the same weight as a decision from the General Division after it is set up.,11,363,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00363
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Tan and Mr Pillai asked about the categories of appeals in the Sixth Schedule – how they are chosen, what was the thought process going into it. Mr Pillai also asked about the Land Acquisition Act. These will also be ordinarily allocated to the Court of Appeal.",12,364,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00364
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In my opening speech, I outlined the key considerations for allocating the categories of cases to the Court of Appeal directly. Just to quickly recap, these include cases which will have a likely substantial consequence for the individual or society, have involved significant public interest questions which will benefit from the guidance of the Court of Appeal, possibly also novel questions of law, complex cases and so on.",13,365,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00365
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I think it was Mr Dennis Tan, I believe, who raised the questions specifically on section 18(5) of the Maintenance of Parents Act. If Mr Tan looks at that section, it specifically provides for an appeal on the basis of public interest. I think one can understand why an issue which the Maintenance of Parents Act covers might be something that one channels directly to the Court of Appeal.",14,366,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00366
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Importantly, however, for Members to note, the ordinary allocation of appeals, whilst there is a default, is not rigid. Even if a case is ordinarily allocated to the Appellate Division, there is flexibility for it to be transferred to the Court of Appeal, if it requires a decision that the apex court of the land can usefully provide.",15,367,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00367
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The categories allocated to the Court of Appeal are also not cast in stone. For example, as I said in my opening speech, should there be novel questions that we put into the categories today, they may be resolved or settled with the passage of time. Those cases can eventually come off that list if it can be dealt with by the Appellate Division. If an initial area of law is more established or there is a new area of law, that can also be added to the categories.",16,368,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00368
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Next, let me touch the transfer powers of the Court of Appeal. Mr Louis Ng, Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Murali Pillai touched on them and raised some questions. As a starting point, the allocation of matters in the two tracks that I mentioned will apply generally, as a starting position. However, it is useful beyond the default allocation to allow the Court of Appeal themselves looking at the specific case and understanding the issues that are raised beyond just the label that is put on it, a discretion to transfer to itself or to the Appellate Division depending on its assessment of complexity, novelty and so on. The basis on which it seeks to do so – novelty, complexity, cases of general public importance and so on – would be amongst the factors that will guide the exercise of discretion in any such transfer exercise.",17,369,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00369
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At the same time, the powers of the Court of Appeal in doing so are not unfettered, and Members will note clauses 29D(3), 29E(3) and 47(3) of the amended SCJA which expressly require that the Court of Appeal have regard to the matters prescribed in the Rues of Court when exercising these powers. As I had mentioned, the relevant matters will be prescribed in the Rules of Court.",18,370,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00370
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Pillai asked specifically about the Land Acquisition Act. The transfer power in clause 12 which will introduce sections 29B and 29E of the SCJA refer to the Land Acquisition Act so that appeals under sections 29(2) and 38(2) of the Land Acquisition Act can be transferred in a manner similar to all the civil appeals.,19,371,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00371
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The land acquisition appeals currently lie from the Land Appeals Board. They do not lie from the General Division up to either Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal, but lie from the Appeals Board. So for that reason, they are set out separately from the Sixth Schedule which applies only to civil appeals from the General Division.",20,372,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00372
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Finally, clause 27(f) of the SCJA introduces a new section 39A of the Land Acquisition Act and that permits the Minister to allocate land acquisition appeals in the same way as all the other categories of appeals in the Sixth Schedule. So, I think Mr Pillai also asked what are the principles of that remission, and I think that is one of the questions that you answered yourself. So, thank you very much.",21,373,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00373
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On a related note, Mr Louis Ng, I think, asked about the transfer to the Appellate Division, should the case raise a matter of settled law. Mr Ng's point seems to be that where a case might appear settled or uncontroversial, the law may subsequently nonetheless be overturned. So, I think the question is how then do we determine that upfront.",22,374,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00374
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The reality is that in most cases, it will be clear if there are controversial points of law that ought to be decided by the Court of Appeal, and that would be flagged earlier rather than later. For example, when settled law is challenged by a party on appeal, the party first has to give notice of its position, file its case, outline its arguments, and the Court would be able to appreciate those arguments upfront.",23,375,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00375
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Further, in deciding whether to transfer an appeal, the Court of Appeal, of course, will also have regard to all the relevant circumstances, including the party's case which I have set out earlier, raised earlier on, and of course, understand the nature of the case. As Members who practise in the Courts know, the Courts very actively conduct pre-trial conferences to understand the nature of the parties’ dispute, understand the ambit of the disagreement, and to understand whether this would involve novel questions of law, or whether the parties are seeking a question to be overturned on a settled point of law.",24,376,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00376
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Nonetheless, despite all that, where the appeal has been transferred to the Appellate Division and in the course of that hearing, an unanticipated issue of law of public importance, novelty, complexity arises, the matter can still go on appeal to the Court of Appeal with leave.",25,377,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00377
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Ng and Mr Pillai raised questions about the power of the Court of Appeal to decline to grant leave for a further appeal from the Appellate Division to the Court of Appeal, even if a point of law of public importance is raised.",26,378,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00378
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me explain that. Under our proposed amendments, it is a requirement that the appeal ought to raise a point of law of public importance for leave to be considered. However, as Members would appreciate, this alone would not be sufficient as a criterion to grant leave of appeal.",27,379,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00379
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Other matters in the interest of the administration of justice were also considered. That in fact is the position today.,28,380,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00380
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Whether or not there should be further appeal should take into account the fact that the parties had had already a chance to raise their arguments, and nothing new is coming through in the application for leave to appeal. They raised the arguments before the Appellate Division, and the Appellate Division has reviewed them and decided on that point of law.",29,381,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00381
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In other jurisdictions, it is not always sufficient as well just to rely on a point of law of public importance to seek and obtain permission for leave to appeal and I will just cite one example. In Australia, section 35A of Australia's Judiciary Act provides that the High Court of Australia may, when determining whether to grant special leave to appeal, ""have regard to any matters that it considers relevant"" and that this shall include not only whether the appeal involves a question of law of public importance, but also other factors, such as whether the interests of justice require it. So, there is a degree of flexibility in the discretion given to the judge to assess a particular case and to assess whether, on top of the question of public importance, there are other reasons in the dispensation of justice for this to be heard on appeal.",30,382,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00382
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Murali Pillai asked whether the Appellate Division has jurisdiction to hear professional disciplinary cases. I think judicial precedent has clarified that the Court of Appeal has no civil appellate jurisdiction in disciplinary proceedings for lawyers. Rather, this is heard by the Court of Three Judges; I think doctors as well. This remains unchanged by the introduction of the Appellate Division.",31,383,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00383
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Murali Pillai touched on the minimum composition of the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeal in cases that may be heard by fewer than three Judges. Specifically, he raised the difference in the arrangement of the Sixth Schedule in the existing SCJA – I think the Member said – and the corresponding Seventh Schedule of this Bill. The change in the arrangement is one of drafting – trying to neaten up the provisions – and does not effect any change to the minimum number of Judges required to hear the categories of cases set out in the existing Sixth Schedule. For example, if there is a matter that is currently only heard by a minimum of two Judges, that will remain the case in the Bill. So, the Bill does not seek to change those arrangements.",32,384,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00384
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On SICC, Mr Murali Pillai asked about the difference in the number of Judges. This Bill retains the existing position, where a single Judge shall hear proceedings in the High Court, except as provided for in written law. And that one exception is the SICC, where proceedings might be heard by a single Judge or three Judges. Why? Because there are unique considerations behind the SICC. Although it is a Division of the current High Court and will be a Division as well like the General Division after the amendments, they apply to cases of international commercial considerations and they also have a panel of specialist commercial judges comprising not only Singapore Supreme Court Judges but also International Judges from a myriad of different landscapes, backgrounds and also legal systems. The strength and diversity of the panel are key advantages to attract parties to submit international disputes before the SICC, especially where the issues in dispute relate to foreign law or commercial practices in key jurisdictions overseas.",33,385,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00385
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On section 29B(2), again, we will be taking up the amendment. We wish to correct the word ""date"" to ""time"" and I wish to also clarify with Mr Murali Pillai that there is no missing word in between the two sub-provisions. It is a disjunctive provision.",34,386,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00386
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me now touch on the tenure of Judges.

2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"There are a couple of questions  first, on the retirement age; second, on the tenure of Judges being extended to the age of 70; and finally – I think that is Assoc Prof Walter Theseira's point – on what is the desired tenure.

2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In essence, these questions – save for Assoc Prof Walter Theseira's which I will address – relate to that of the independence of our Judiciary  one of tenure and one of retirement age. So, let me address the point.",2,391,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00391
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, by borrowing from Mr Murali Pillai's own speech where he answered the point by explaining that these are effectively two different things – to look at tenure and to look at the retirement ages of the Judges are two different things when you look at the issue of independence. Let me explain why.",3,392,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00392
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Government regards a strong and trusted Judiciary as the bedrock of the rule of law. I think that really brooks no dissent. This is the point that has been made by the Minister for Law previously and it is a point that is worth reiterating in the context of the points raised in this debate. The question then is, what does success look like for our Judiciary? Because, ultimately – whatever you might say about the retirement ages, the tenure – the key question is, how successful? What role have our Judges played? What benefits do we have from a strong, trusted Judiciary, an effective trusted Judiciary which is able to attract and retain the best legal talent that we have and which operates in a climate where there are no extraneous factors, no influences interfering with the ability of the Judges to perform their jobs? The question is  have we achieved that outcome?",4,393,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00393
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I think I have answered this earlier when I outlined some statistics, but I would say quite clearly so. I mentioned the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators ranking Singapore in the 97th percentile worldwide in terms of rule of law. It is a number but what does that mean? One integral aspect of the rule of law is an independent Judiciary which makes decisions based on facts and law and without regard to extraneous factors. So, clearly, we can see from the rankings that judicial independence in Singapore is strong and consistently so. Trust in our Judiciary is high. In a survey conducted by my Ministry – I cited this earlier – showed that 92% of Singaporeans have trust and confidence in our legal system.",5,394,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00394
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me look at some other legal systems, I think one that Ms Anthea Ong also raised. You look at the UK, where judges there have tenure until the age of 70. As you know, in 2016, there was this UK Attitude Survey. It was a stark reminder of how things could quickly go wrong if we are not careful. Let me just cite a few findings from the survey of UK judges. Forty-three percent of judges felt valued by the public. Seventy-four percent of judges felt that the remuneration does not adequately reflect the work they do. Sixty-one percent said opportunities for career progression was important but support for this was either non-existent or poor. Forty-seven percent of high court judges and forty-one percent of court of appeal judges – and these are judges in the UK system – said they intended to leave the Judiciary in the next five years. Two percent of judges felt valued by the government.",6,395,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00395
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We could go on. And as I have said, these are survey numbers. But they, overall, give you a sense and picture and they show that there is a system that is facing a serious problem of morale, recruitment and retention. So, is this a system which has tenure till 70 a better system? That is why I go back to Mr Murali Pillai's point. It is not about what age we ask the Judges to retire at and what tenure we give the Judges, but it is in the quality of the output and the quality of the performance that we measure our success.",7,396,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00396
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, whilst I do not disagree with Members that the broader philosophical issues on security of tenure, of course, the linkage to independence and so on are important, we must never lose sight of the practical factors that have allowed us to build a first-class Judiciary that we now have. We want to always ensure that the morale of the Judiciary remains high, that it continues to attract and retain persons of the highest calibre, legal talent of the highest scruples, so that the highest levels of public trust can be maintained.",8,397,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00397
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To this end, the Government ensures that remuneration for judicial appointment holders remains competitive so that we are able to attract and retain persons of high quality, ability, integrity and, certainly, of an incorruptible character. We are also firm about protecting our Judiciary from baseless attacks against their reputation, as reflected by the adoption of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act in 2016. Trust and respect in the Judiciary has been carefully and closely built up over the generations – and I think Members will agree – it has to be zealously guarded, for it can be easily lost if we are not careful.",9,398,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00398
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Let me now turn to Assoc Prof Walter Theseira's question on the differences in the age of retirement for Singaporeans in general and the tenure of office for a Supreme Court Judge.,10,399,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00399
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In Singapore, when we first introduced retirement age laws in 1993, employers were not allowed to ask employees to retire before 60. In 1999, we raised the retirement age to 62 and this is where it stands now. There were many considerations, such as the need to maintain a competitive economy in the face of an ageing population, providing an opportunity for older workers to earn a regular income and allowing employers to gain from the retention of experienced workers. I think Ms Sylvia Lim herself cited some studies – healthcare is better; life expectancy is better and so on. But I would respectfully suggest that the tenure for a Supreme Court Judge engages very different considerations – a very different set of parameters and issues to consider.",11,400,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00400
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Here, we are not so much concerned with economic competitiveness. Rather, the security of tenure for a Supreme Court Judge seeks to secure the independence of the Judge in judicial proceedings. So, retirement age laws in the context of the Employment Act, for instance, are not immediately comparable to the tenure of office of a Supreme Court Judge. I would not say they are irrelevant but they are not immediately comparable on a same set of paradigm factors.",12,401,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00401
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In fact, if we look at other jurisdictions, we will also find that there is also little relation between the statutory retirement ages for the general population and the security of tenure for a Judge. Ms Anthea Ong – or was that Ms Sylvia Lim, I could not quite recall – cited the example of the US. In the US, the Supreme Court Justices have tenure for life. In India and Malaysia, the retirement ages for workers, generally, is 60, while judges of the apex court in those countries all have tenure until 65. So, there is no direct correlation. I venture to suggest that it is for the reasons I have outlined. In Hong Kong, judges of the apex court have tenure until 65 as well, but there is no statutory retirement age.",13,402,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00402
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Next, on the desirable length of tenure and also extending tenure to Judicial Commissioners and Senior Judges. Again, we need to look at it in the context of our system – what we need to achieve in our system, what has worked for us and what we want to see happening.",14,403,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00403
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, it bears noting that there is no correlation between age per se and the Judge to make an independent and effective judicial decision. Neither is there any linkage between the age and ability to make a decision free from political or public interest. Rather, it is crucial that the system enables Judges to exercise powers free from encumbrances. So, systemically, structurally, how do we build a system that has that?",15,404,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00404
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"What we need to do, then, is to look at our unique circumstance and find our own balance. In this respect, we have achieved a balance between various factors  ensuring a good mix of tenured and non-tenured Judges, rejuvenating the Bench while leveraging on the wisdom and experience of the existing Bench, protecting the Judiciary from baseless allegations and assaults to their reputation.",16,405,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00405
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I do not think that there is much value in pointing to other jurisdictions which provide for tenure of up to 70 years or more, 65 or beyond, the whole variety of different systems and then for us to slavishly adopt those numbers as our own. Going back to the US, for example, the US Supreme Court Judges have tenure for life. Yet, there is a constant debate about the ideological leanings of the Court, whether they have taken into account extraneous considerations and whether it has been politicised. It also appears to be the norm now for the US Supreme Court nominations to attract significant controversy, with all kinds of allegations made. Is that the way we want to go about our Judges that we put on the Bench? Again, I think our answer is very clear.",17,406,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00406
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Then, we look at the other end of the spectrum. We have been talking about Supreme Court Judges and High Court Judges. Let us look at the Judicial Officers of the State Courts. Members who practise in the State Courts will know they deal with and dispose of 95% of all judicial matters in Singapore, but have no security of tenure. Yet, the 2018 Court Users Survey shows that 99% of respondents agree that the Courts independently carry out justice according to the law. And 100% of respondents agree that the Courts administer justice fairly to all in Singapore, regardless of race, language or religion. So, going back to my original point, while I do not disagree that, as a matter of principle, security of tenure is an important aspect of judicial independence, we do not have to be overly theoretical or dogmatic about it. We look at what works for our system and we attract and retain the best and finetune it in a manner that works for our system.",18,407,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00407
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For Judicial Commissioners, the scheme is an integral part of our system of appointments. It helps to manage temporary surges in caseload and enables both the prospective appointee and also the Chief Justice to assess suitability for permanent appointment.",19,408,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00408
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"It has been explained in this House before that not all lawyers will want an immediate appointment as a Supreme Court Judge. Some would rather come in first as a Judicial Commissioner for a short-term appointment. This provides the opportunity to ascertain whether the nature of the office of a Judge suits them, before the appointment is made on a permanent basis.",20,409,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00409
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"This has little to do with judicial independence or security of tenure. Being part of the Supreme Court Bench is a calling that not everyone will say or can say that they are certain about from the start. The Judicial Commissioner scheme therefore allows outstanding members of the Bar who are at the peak of their profession to contribute to the dispensation of justice and the development of local jurisprudence. If they decide that this is something they are called to do and they also have the suitable judicial temperament, then there is the long-term appointment that is possible with security of tenure.",21,410,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00410
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"One prominent example, of course, is our current Chief Justice who was first appointed as a Judicial Commissioner from 2006 to 2007 and returned to private practice thereafter. Five years later, he returned to the Judiciary and was made Chief Justice.",22,411,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00411
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"This brings me to my next point, which is that an immediate and permanent appointment as a Supreme Court Judge may not also suit all possible appointees, not only for the reasons of temperament, lifestyle and calling but also because under the Legal Profession Act, an individual who has held office as a Supreme Court Judge for more than three years, cannot then apply for a practising certificate. So, it is a career change altogether. In other words, an individual who trades a successful career as a lawyer to serve as a Supreme Court Judge cannot return to his former career after serving as a Supreme Court Judge for three years or more.",23,412,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00412
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"If we look at the practices of other jurisdictions, the appointment of Judicial Commissioners for fixed terms to the Bench is also not new. Similar arrangements exist in many other countries, particularly the Commonwealth countries, such as the UK, where the Lord Chief Justice may after consulting the Lord Chancellor, appoint a Deputy Judge of the High Court for a specified period.",24,413,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00413
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me now come to the Senior Judges. Senior Judges who sit in the existing High Court are scheduled to hear trials and applications, and they contribute to the disposal of cases by the High Court. Senior Judges may also deal with urgent applications such as Mareva applications and injunctions, and can also be assigned to hear appeals in the Court of Appeal.",25,414,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00414
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In terms of the issue of security of tenure, the Senior Judges we are talking about here, would have already been previously selected and appointed, and had a full career as a Supreme Court Judge. They would have served a long and distinguished career and from the perspective of the issue of independence and what they are influenced by, it is difficult to see why such Judges, who are re-appointed as Senior Judges, will suddenly start making decisions based on extraneous considerations simply because they are now appointed for a fixed period.",26,415,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00415
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"While we want to utilise the wealth of expertise and experience that these Judges carry with them, at the same time, there is also a practical need to allow a younger generation of Judges to have the opportunity to advance. This is also a point I think very graphically recognised by Assoc Prof Theseira when he talked about ossification. So, the system we have put in place strikes that balance – works for us, strikes that balance, allows for the appropriate renewal of the Supreme Court Bench in a fair and systematic manner, but also gives us the ability to tap on Judicial Commissioners and also to retain the wide ranging experience of the Senior Judges.",27,416,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00416
2019-11-05-T-017,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Government has made it clear before that it does not disagree with the fundamental point that security of tenure is important. But there is a need to take into account the unique circumstances that we operate in and in the manner in which we look after the success of the Judiciary. What is clear is that we are a small country, with a limited talent pool. When we find suitable talent, we have to ensure that first, this is a calling that they are certain about, and next, that there is room for advancement. Will this undermine judicial independence or will our Judges start making decisions that are affected by political bias? I believe the answer to this is eminently clear. The decisions of the Court are published and the public can judge for themselves.",28,417,2019-11-05-T-017-S-00417

2019-11-05-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or IBRD, is the main institution of the World Bank Group that lends to developing countries. In October 2018, the Board of Governors of the IBRD adopted resolutions to increase the capital of the IBRD by about US$60 billion. The IBRD intends to use the capital to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, more commonly known as the Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs. It does this, for instance, by supporting inclusive and sustainable economic growth through investments in infrastructure; as well as delivering higher climate co-benefits and focusing on crisis prevention.",3,480,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00480
2019-11-05-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"As a member of the World Bank Group, Singapore subscribes to capital of the IBRD. The Bretton Woods Agreement Act, or the BWAA, governs Singapore's subscription. In 2014, Parliament raised the threshold for our cumulative subscription to the IBRD for the first time since 1966 to US$672 million. Today, our subscription stands at US$671.82 million.",4,481,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00481

This amounts to close to US$186 million, which will bring our cumulative subscription since 1966 to about US$858 million. We are therefore seeking Parliament's approval to again raise Singapore's subscription threshold to the IBRD.",5,482,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00482

2019-11-05-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Paid-in capital is the amount that is actually disbursed. In this case, out of the US$186 million, Singapore is only required to disburse about US$21 million to the IBRD as paid-in capital. The remaining US$165 million of callable capital will not be drawn upon unless in extreme circumstances such as when the IBRD cannot meet its obligations on borrowings or guarantees. Historically, this has not happened. The IBRD is a triple A-rated institution with a long history of sound balance sheets. Nevertheless, the full increase in Singapore's subscription to the IBRD’s capital will be charged to the Consolidated Fund, as the callable capital represents an increase in the Government's financial liabilities.",9,486,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00486

IDA was started in 1960 and is replenished every three years. Governments are due to pledge their contributions for the next three-year tranche from FY 2021 to FY 2023 this December under the 19th IDA Replenishment exercise (IDA19).

2019-11-05-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"To support the IDA, Singapore contributed US$46 million during the 18th Replenishment exercise in 2016.

2019-11-05-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),This will enable IDA to channel more resources to countries in fragile and conflict-affected situations; support programmes that prioritise capability building and economic transformation; as well as enhance crisis response and pandemic preparedness.,13,490,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00490

We now propose to contribute up to US$70 million over three years for IDA19, which will bring our subscription component to up to US$1.3 million. As a result, we are also seeking Parliament's approval to raise the subscription threshold to the IDA from US$1.1 million to US$1.3 million.",14,491,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00491

The IFC is the private sector arm of the World Bank Group. It will leverage the additional capital to mobilise private sector investments in developing countries, creating markets to advance sustainable development.",15,492,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00492

We will be fully subscribing to the 8,612 shares allotted to Singapore in this IFC capital increase exercise. This amounts to US$8.61 million and will bring our total subscription close to US$9 million. The actual disbursement will be less than that, at US$7.44 million as US$1.17 million worth of shares will be allotted through the conversion of retained earnings. This subscription, however, is contingent on the passage of the Board of Governors' resolutions to increase the capital of the IFC. Voting for these resolutions is open until 18 March 2020.",16,493,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00493
2019-11-05-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In total, therefore, our fiscal outlay to the World Bank Group's capital raising exercises will amount to about US$92 million for the IBRD and IDA, and an additional about US$7.5 million for the IFC subscription. These amounts will be spread over the next three years or more and will be met from the Government Budget.",17,494,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00494
2019-11-05-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We are participating in the IBRD and IFC capital increase exercises as well as the IDA 19th Replenishment for the following reasons. First, it is important that we do our part as a responsible member of the international community by contributing to the efforts of the development institutions to alleviate poverty and boost shared prosperity. In 1966, Singapore joined the IBRD and subsequently received 12 loans from the bank for a variety of infrastructure projects – from port expansion and telecommunications to the capitalisation of then-Development Bank of Singapore and the construction of the National University of Singapore campus. Our final loan with the Bank was signed in 1975.",18,495,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00495
2019-11-05-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Having seen and experienced first-hand how timely financial support could accelerate development efforts, we moved from being a borrower to a donor and partner of the World Bank Group in the early 2000s. We are supportive of the World Bank Group's strategic directions for achieving the 2030 SDGs and are keen to join the international effort to supplement its resources to generate more targeted assistance to those in the region and beyond.",19,496,2019-11-05-T-020-S-00496
2019-11-05-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Second, the presence of the World Bank Group in Singapore benefits Singapore and contributes to our growth. As Members may know, the World Bank Group has an Infrastructure and Urban Development Hub in Singapore. In FY18, the IFC mobilised more than US$1.5 billion in private capital for the Asia Pacific region, three-quarters of which was done with the participation of Singapore-based banks and financial institutions. This has strengthened Singapore's status as a regional financial hub. Singapore companies and services have also benefited from the World Bank Group's advisory, project preparation, structuring and financing activities in the region. These activities add to the vibrancy of Singapore's infrastructure ecosystem and reinforce our position as a major infrastructure hub for Asia, creating opportunities for our businesses and our people.

2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Millions of dollars of public funds are involved. The High Court has found Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang to be dishonest and deceptive, and to have failed in their duty to the Town Council. Indeed, Ms Sylvia Lim has admitted under oath that she had lied to the public. Pending the appeal, if there is one, this House is entitled to ask  are Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang going to continue to have oversight and decision-making power over public funds in the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC)? And, what do those in charge of AHTC intend to do about the findings in the judgment? I should add that from February 2013 to September 2015, the Town Council included Punggol East and was known AHPETC.

Throughout this long time, the Workers' Party has consistently and repeatedly refused to take responsibility for the problems in its Town Council. This is lamentable. The Workers' Party town councillors have persistently resisted disclosure, offered countless excuses and made a litany of misleading statements – to the public, in Parliament and before the Courts.

And they removed the existing Managing Agent (MA) and appointed their friends in FMSS, though FMSS had less experience and charged more. This overcharging, abuse of public funds, was inexcusable. What they did was in breach of their fiduciary duties, at every turn.

2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,Annex 3 is a compilation of the Workers' Party's misleading statements. The Workers' Party misled their own Town Councillors.,1,589,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00589
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"They deliberately kept the decision to appoint FMSS away from a Town Council meeting. Instead they delegated authority to Ms Sylvia Lim, so as to keep the other Town Councillors in the dark. They concealed their true motives from the rest of the Town Councillors.",2,590,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00590
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The Workers' Party misled their own auditors. Most disturbingly, Ms Sylvia Lim asked Ms How Weng Fan and Mr Danny Loh to sanitise the report on FMSS' appointment as Managing Agent so it could, I quote, ""pass the auditors' eyes"". And she is a lawyer.",3,591,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00591
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,Mr Danny Loh was asked to draft the report. Ms How Weng Fan and Mr Danny Loh were the very officers and shareholders whose appointment was to be approved without tender. And here were Mr Low Thia Khiang and Ms Sylvia Lim asking them to draft the comment on a report concerning their own appointment.,4,592,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00592
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,The Judge considered this to be extraordinary and stated these actions cast serious doubt on their honesty and integrity.,5,593,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00593
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The Workers' Party misled the public. In the Town Council's press release on 5 August 2011 concerning the appointment of FMSS, they falsely asserted that there was no time to call a tender. The judge found that this misled the public and the very constituents the Members of Parliament were elected to serve. As the Judge put it, and I quote, ""There was a concerted attempt to cloak the appointment of FMSS with a veneer of propriety"", ""in order to camouflage its true motive"".",6,594,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00594
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The press release also falsely asserted that AHTC did not incur additional Managing Agent fees from appointing FMSS. Under cross-examination, Ms Sylvia Lim admitted that this was ""not accurate"", before finally admitting ""it is not true"", and that she knew it was not true. She then had to agree that she had lied in the press release, which was disseminated to all Singaporeans, including the residents of AHTC.",7,595,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00595
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The Workers' Party misled Parliament. The Judge found that it was not sufficiently urgent to justify waiver of tender. This means that when the Workers' Party told Parliament in 2015 that they waived tender because of urgency, they were misleading Parliament. Ms Sylvia Lim said in Parliament in 2015, I quote, ""For the first contract in 2011 for managing agent services, it was triggered as the incumbent Managing Agent, CPG Facilities Management, asked to be released from the contract with the Town Council for business reasons. There was an urgent need to put in place a computer system due to the termination of the former system in use.""",8,596,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00596
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The judgment was crystal clear on this, and I quote, ""There was no urgency or public interest that warranted the waiver of tender. It was neither CPG's announcement on 30 May 2011 nor AIM's withdrawal of the Town Council Management System (TCMS) that resulted in tender being waived."" In waiving tender, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang's, and I quote, ""conduct was improper and the attempt to cloak the same with a veneer of truth and credibility collectively leads to the conclusion that they had not acted honestly"".",9,597,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00597
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, why were there so many false and misleading statements? When one reads the record – the AGO report, the KPMG report, the PwC reports, three Court judgments – you will find misleading statements made by the Workers' Party Members of Parliament piling up.",10,598,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00598
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In sum, waiver of tender was not justified but they did this to appoint their friends. They knew that this was wrong and thus misled their own town councillors, misled their own auditors, misled the public and misled Parliament to hide their wrongdoing.",11,599,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00599
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang not only misled Parliament. They also knowingly allowed Mr Pritam Singh to mislead Parliament. Mr Pritam Singh said in 2015, and I quote, ""Where FMSS is a tenderer in a tender called by the Town Council, as was the case in 2011 for the Managing Agent contract, FMSS is kept at an arm's length and a China wall is built between FMSS and the Town Council"". We now know this to be false. The Court found How Weng Fan had been heavily involved since early May 2011, soon after the General Election, in setting up FMSS and in the plot to keep CPG Facilities Management in the dark.",12,600,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00600
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"She was even involved in the preparation of the FMSS letter of intent and, as I noted earlier, in sanitising the report on FMSS' appointment as Managing Agent, for the auditors. Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang knew very well they had not kept How at arm’s length. Yet, they let Mr Pritam Singh mislead this House without correcting him. When the Workers' Party leaders let their own Members of Parliament mislead Parliament on their behalf, what does this say about the Workers' Party's integrity and values?",13,601,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00601
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The Workers’ Party also misled Parliament that their safeguards for transactions with their friends were adequate. Ms Sylvia Lim told this House in 2015, and I quote, ""It was the policy that no cheque to FMSS of whatever amount could be issued unless either the Town Council Chairman or one of the Vice Chairmen co-signed the cheque. Thus, it was not possible for FMSS to pay itself unless it was authorised by the Town Council Chair or Vice Chair who have no interest in FMSS whatsoever.""",14,602,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00602

2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"These are half-truths at best because in reality, there was no standing instruction that co-signatures were required on cheques for payments to FMSI, the EMSU provider. In fact, these claims are entirely untrue. Ms Sylvia Lim admitted to the Court that she did not personally check that each payment was justified. Despite all the reassurances they gave, there were payments to FMSS without the requisite co-signature of members of the Town Council.",16,604,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00604
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, everything I have presented is based on objective facts, as established in Court, after having heard the defendants under oath. The Court found that Mr Low Thia Khiang and Ms Sylvia Lim had breached their fiduciary duties, had not been honest and questioned their integrity and lack of candour and transparency. Ms Sylvia Lim remains a Vice Chairman of AHTC while Mr Low Thia Khiang is a member of AHTC.",17,605,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00605
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"More than three weeks have passed since the Court judgment. The Workers' Party has been totally silent on this matter. So has AHTC. This is why I have to ask in Parliament, what does the current Chairman of AHTC Mr Faisal Manap intend to do? At the minimum, will he apologise to residents of Aljunied and Hougang for letting them down? An apology would be the first step, a belated recognition that they had let residents down and an intention to put things right. Is he going to require the Members of Parliament so severely judged and found wanting by the Court to recuse themselves from the Town Council’s affairs, pending the disposal of any appeal they may file?",18,606,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00606
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Very serious adverse findings were made against them – findings that go to the heart of the integrity of these Members of Parliament and the deceptive manner in which they conducted the Town Council’s affairs. How can they remain in charge of the Town Council's affairs as if it is business as usual? At the very least, should not the Chairman and other town councillors require them to recuse themselves from handling the Town Council’s financial matters, as called for in this Motion?",19,607,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00607
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Until the appeal, if any, is over, will Mr Faisal Manap remove Ms Sylvia Lim as a Vice Chairman? Or will he allow her to continue to be in a position where she can co-sign cheques on behalf of AHTC? If AHTC were a company, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang would, at the very least, have been interdicted – prohibited or restrained from acting – pending their appeal. Most likely, they would have been forced to leave the company a long time ago – when AGO and then KPMG made their findings – instead of being allowed to carry on, in the same roles and enjoying the same degree of financial oversight over public funds. If they were members of a professional body – and many Members of this House are members of professional bodies – their acts of dishonesty would have brought them before a disciplinary tribunal. As the earlier judgment of the High Court noted, they might have been exposed to civil liability or, in an extreme scenario, to criminal liability.",20,608,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00608
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In light of how they have misled this House and the absence of a response by the Town Council, I would like to know what, if anything, the Workers' Party's remaining Members of Parliament and Non-Constituency Members of Parliament propose to do about these findings pending any appeal. Will they at long last be conducting their own investigations or will they continue to duck, dodge and deny?",21,609,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00609
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"As Secretary-General and Chairman, respectively, of the Workers' Party, Mr Pritam Singh and Ms Sylvia Lim are responsible for party standards and discipline. Both are themselves involved in the AHTC problem. But it is still their duty to act for the Workers' Party. Will they apologise on behalf of the Workers' Party? Will they direct Mr Faisal Manap to do the right thing to protect AHTC's governance? Will they temporarily stand aside themselves and allow some other Workers' Party's Central Executive Committee (CEC) member to take charge of this matter – again a standard practice in the corporate world.",22,610,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00610

2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I hope that the Workers' Party will take action. There were other financial and governance lapses which occurred in AHTC. The Workers' Party has put them right, albeit after a very long delay and after denying and resisting for many years. In doing so, the Workers' Party has shown that they are, in fact, capable of taking steps to put their house in order when further obfuscation and delay at last becomes untenable. Last year, KPMG found that AHTC had finally resolved all the lapses flagged in past audits since 2013. I have detailed earlier how the Workers' Party initially resisted the appointment of any independent auditor, then resisted the appointment of a Big Four accounting firm. Finally, with the Court intervening and with the Government’s offering to pay for the accountant, KPMG was appointed.",24,612,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00612

2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"For this reason, we have always taken any accusations of dishonesty against political leaders very seriously. Certainly, the 4G PAP leaders intend to continue maintaining the high standards which we have achieved and upheld for so many years, since the PAP first formed the Government in 1959. For we must ensure that Members of Parliament, both Government and Opposition, are men and women of integrity. It is in the vital interest of Singapore and Singaporeans for Members of the Opposition also to be persons of integrity, and not people who cannot be trusted with public funds, much less national responsibilities.",36,624,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00624

2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Those who participate in politics must be honest and upright in order to win the trust of the people and serve them. They should admit their mistakes when they have done wrong and correct them, even at a cost to themselves. In many countries, the lack of integrity in politicians has become a norm. If the politician cannot be trusted, it will be difficult for him to build a relationship of mutual trust with hte public. If the public do not trust him, they will not believe that he can put public interest ahead of personal gains and make the best decisions in the interest of the people.",56,644,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00644

But now, after eight long years, we know that their deeds show the contrary. They appointed their friends to manage the Town Council at the higher cost than the previous Managing Agent. They concealed the real facts and manipulated the circumstances of this appointment, even to the extent of misleading their fellow town councillors.",63,651,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00651

They refused to give auditors documents, documents that might have shed light on their wrongdoing. Even after these facts were uncovered by independent auditors, they took no action. It took the Independent Panel that they appointed to finally bring them to Court to set things straight.

2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Clarifications for Deputy Prime Minister Mr Heng. The first clarification is  in his speech, he mentioned that millions have been lost, if I heard him correctly. My question to him is  is this a finding of the Court? Or does this remain an allegation? That is the first clarification.",1,658,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00658
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, he suggested or asserted that in the conduct of proceedings, not just this judgment that is being mentioned, but prior to that, the Workers' Party had taken the position that we do not owe any explanations to anyone and that we are not accountable. Does he not know that our consistent position has been that we owe statutory duties under the Town Councils Act? Related to that, is he aware that this judgment of the High Court actually makes new law? If he looks at the summary from paragraph 6 onwards that he handed out to the House just now, the Court actually goes into explaining why it is actually making a finding that fiduciary duties apply in the context of Town Councils which has never been the settled law.",2,659,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00659
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The third clarification is, he seemed to suggest that we had obstructed the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) in its work. I hope that he can clarify that because I do not think that the AGO actually said anything of that nature.",3,660,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00660
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Fourth, he kept repeating that we had hidden documents from auditors which, if produced, would have revealed the truth. Can he explain what exactly he is talking about?",4,661,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00661
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, I think towards the end, he mentioned that we had argued against the Town Council’s system. I do not know what he was referring to. So, could he please clarify?",5,662,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00662
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the point about the money has been lost. I have mentioned in my speech that the Court's findings have been very clear that you have contracts worth millions of dollars which have been awarded under circumstances for which it was not quite justified. The findings have been very clear in two auditors' reports and in the Court findings.,1,663,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00663
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,You mentioned that millions have been lost.,1,664,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00664

2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Let me go on to your second point that the High Court made new laws. No, in fact, the High Court judgment, and you are a lawyer; you have read the High Court judgment carefully. The High Court spent a lot of time looking at the question of what duties you owed – fiduciary duties that the town councillors owed to the Town Council, and the judgment was very clear on this point. The Court did not make new law; the law has been there.",2,666,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00666
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On the AGO's nature, you said well, in what way did you not reveal documents to the AGO. The fact is that there were many documents that were asked for, but the Town Council did not provide. Despite that, the AGO had important findings that merited actions. So, there were documents which were asked for which you did not provide.",3,667,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00667
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Fourth and finally, you asked about the auditors. Can I clarify what you asked about the auditors again? Your fourth point?",4,668,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00668
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Yes, Mr Speaker, what I had asked was. I think Deputy Prime Minister Mr Heng mentioned repeatedly that we had apparently hidden documents from auditors which, if produced, would have revealed the truth. I believed this phrase came out more than once. So, may I ask what he is referring to?",1,669,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00669
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Many documents were produced during the Court of Appeal hearing and also during the various Court procedures. It was only when the emails were produced that was revealed the truth on how FMSS was appointed. Do you not recall emails for which you had said that you had asked Ms How to hide the truth on their appointment? Those are important documents. At the end of it, while you argued about the Town Council system, you have earlier on in Parliament said that, in electioneering, you have talked about how the Town Council system disadvantaged opposition parties.",1,670,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00670

2019-11-05-T-023,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I would like to seek clarification from Deputy Prime Minister. Just now he said that when we co-sign cheques, he seemed to imply that one can encash a cheque with just one signatory under AHTC. You said that what we said that cheques had to be co-signed either by the Chairman or either one of the Vice Chair is not the truth. So, is the Deputy Prime Minister implying that cheques can be encashed with just one signature even though we set it up as two signatures must be there before we can encash the cheque under AHTC?",1,672,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00672

2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Yes, but you see, the main question that I have asked is  the findings are that even on the question of signature of cheques, Ms Lim has admitted that you have not gone through every transaction. So, I am just asking you to stick to the main point and not detract. I do not think that this is what we should be debating in this House – whether it is this path or that path – when the main issue that you ought to answer has not been answered.

2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,Let me explain why. The PAP Government is clearly excited about certain findings and comments contained in the High Court judgment issued on 11 October 2019. These are findings in relation to certain actions taken by some of us in the aftermath of the 2011 General Election.,2,683,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00683
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"However, as the Deputy Prime Minister himself pointed out, Singapore has a Court structure that subjects High Court judgments to possible appeal to the Court of Appeal. This avenue of appeal enables parties who are aggrieved by judgments of the High Court to seek review of the findings by the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal, consisting of at least three Judges of Appeal, will review the findings at the trial and may affirm, revise or vary the findings. If I might quote from the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, it is stated that ""the Court of Appeal may draw inferences of facts and give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been given or made, and make such further or other orders as the case requires"".",3,684,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00684

2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Accordingly, the Deputy Prime Minister acted prematurely in his decision to file the Motion and I ask the House to reject it. Whatever the trial judge has decided is subject to review by the Court of Appeal. This is a civil proceeding and involves novel points of law. In contrary to what I think the Deputy Prime Minister had suggested, it has not been decided as to whether any loss has been caused to the Town Council. And on this point, I should this in perspective by referring to the summary which Deputy Prime Minister Heng distributed earlier – Annex 1, paragraph 27 – where the Judge states or it is summarised quite clearly that the legal burden of proving list falls upon the plaintiff. So, this point has not been decided as to whether loss has been proven.",6,687,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00687

Sir, on the first point raised by Ms Lim, on the documents available to your own auditors. You would know that from the very first year that you had auditors audit your Town Council's accounts, Foo Kon Tan, and that is in 2011, 2012, four disclaimers were issued by Foo Kon Tan. The four disclaimers arose on the basis of incomplete documentation. They sought documents in relation to transactions that were entered int after the Workers' Party took over the Town Council. They were not made available.",1,704,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00704

And the basis of the majority of those 13 disclaimers rested on the basis that incomplete documentation, absence of information, and they were unable, as a result, to verify the accounts.",2,705,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00705

PwC, in particular, Ms Lim will remember, were appointed to audit the accounts on behalf of the AGO. Let me read to you PwC's report, just one paragraph from the report, and this is April 2017, some six years after FMSS had been appointed. PwC says, and I quote, ""No single email on matters in relation to the takeover of the MA and EMSU contract services by FMSS, including the termination of CPG, the award of contracts to FMSS and all FMSS' performance of works, were given to us for our review, though in our view, such emails ought to exist.""

It is not about one signatory or two signatories. It is about the entire system that you have set up as a result of what you have done – by putting FMSS as your Managing Agent, the General Manager and the Secretary in the Town Council being owners of FMSS, that entire system has been completely subverted.

The Standing Instruction for payments to FMSS to be co-signed by the AHTC Chairman or Vice Chairman was not a sufficient safeguard because there was no system, no system, to ensure that each cheque presented was fully verified by the independent parties. In some instances, there was no proper verification even by the conflicting parties. So, Mr Png well knows that we are not talking about one cheque here or two cheques there. We are talking about the entire system. The entire system on which you have sought to make payments to FMSS. This is what the judge has said.",7,710,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00710

2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Two clarifications on what Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong had just said. In relation to my query on whether we have ever been accused of hiding things from our own auditors, if I heard correctly, he basically was saying that the auditors had said that they had requested for certain documents which were not produced. That is not the same as hiding. Yes, we had poor record keeping. I accept that. I accept that we had poor record keeping. But that is not the same thing. And I think the difference would be clear to most reasonable people.",1,712,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00712
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The second point is, if I heard him correctly, he was talking about the work done by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2017. He would recall, because I think he was the lawyer acting for them at the time, if I remember correctly, that they were actually appointed by Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council. They were not our own auditors.",2,713,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00713
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"There was a question as to their Terms of Reference. They were told not to duplicate the work of KPMG and what they were asking was in relation to things that had happened before Punggol East even came under our charge.

2019-11-05-T-023,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"If Ms Lim wants to go into KPMG, then, let us go into KPMG. When KPMG was appointed, I think Ms Lim will remember that there was a media release that was given. Let me just find the media release. Yes, when KPMG was appointed, there was a media release dated 1 June 2016, where it said, ""AHTC's town councillors had decided that AHTC would focus its fullest attention on KPMG."" I think that is what Ms Lim had referred to, in terms of the duplication of work.",1,716,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00716
2019-11-05-T-023,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"But in a report dated 31 October 2016 by KPMG, KPMG itself noted difficulties in getting information and documents out of AHTC. Let me just cite two examples.",2,717,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00717

Not just one or two, but several documents and several email archives of persons belonging to AHTC and FMSS were removed.",3,718,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00718
2019-11-05-T-023,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, KPMG sought the cooperation of town councillors when they came in to do the audit. They wanted to have oral interviews so that they can ask questions and you answer. But Ms Lim will remember that she and Mr Low, and in fact, every single elected councillor of AHTC, refused to take part in the interview, refused to cooperate with KPMG.",4,719,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00719
2019-11-05-T-023,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, when we say information and documents are missing and the auditors are unable to verify information, that is what we refer to. A litany of these excuses, documents are missing, cannot find the documents. Or as you say, not providing documents to an auditor when they ask for it, is not the same thing as hiding it, then I do not know what is. Because they asked once in 2011; second time in 2012. Your own auditors Foo Kon Tan, AGO, PwC – PwC was appointed on behalf of AGO as well, initially – and then, now, KPMG. So, that is what we refer to, Ms Lim.",5,720,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00720

We helped them to uncover some of the lost emails as well. If there is anything wrong with the email, we were very transparent. We did not hide. In fact, they showed us the email. We explained why some of the hard disk were recycled. And some of the things were tagged wrongly as well, and we had to explain to them, if you go into the report, you can refer to KPMG. That part, I am very clear. We did not delete accounts on purpose.",1,726,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00726
2019-11-05-T-023,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,One other thing is that the Senior Minister of State kept referring to our auditors finding four points. I hope the Senior Minister of State is aware that Foo Kon Tan was caught lying in the two reports about the opening balance. That was reported in the AGO report.,2,727,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00727
2019-11-05-T-023,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The October 2016 report by KPMG records very clearly and I just gave two examples. I invite Mr Png to look at it carefully. It sets out the different employees whose emails had been missing, the archives are missing and it goes on to say that when they requested for the email profiles of certain persons, and when they received it, it goes on to say that they found out that those email profiles had just been accessed; and then, they said these were missing. Yes, they do not say you took it, but I think there is an inference in there.",1,728,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00728

2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Speaker, this has been such a long series of events that there are lots of documents. Mr Png asked about details of how you have resisted disclosures. Let me just read a number of reports to you. First, your own auditor Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton in their FY2012/2013 report, at page 4, says, ""The Town Council had not made available to us details of the project management service fees paid to a related party."" In the 2015 AGO report, it says, ""We note that AHPETC has entered into a number of related party transactions whereby substantial sums were paid to related parties in FY2012/2013. The Town Council, despite repeated requests, did not provide us with all the critical documents relating to these transactions"" and ""the AHPETC did not provide us with all the necessary and relevant accounting documents and information which are essential and critical for our work.""",1,731,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00731
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"These came fro your own auditors and the 2015 AGO report. The Auditor-General went to say, ""Since the commencement of our review in April 2014, we have made various requests for documents from AHPETC as part of our review of selected transactions. In our view, these documents such as documents which record the proper disclosure and consideration of related party transactions, RPTs, ought to exist as a matter of record. Notwithstanding numerous requests and reminders, AHPETC did not provide a number of the requested documents.""",2,732,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00732
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In the 2017 PwC report, and I quote, ""Despite repeated requests, no correspondence and/or written correspondence, including, importantly, emails in relation to amongst others, the takeover of the MA"", the Managing Agent, ""and the EMSU services by FMSS including the termination of CPG, the award of contracts to FMSS and all FMSS performance of works, were given to us. No single email was given to us for our review, although in our view, such emails ought to exist.""",3,733,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00733

My objection is that the judgment is being appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal may reverse the findings or review and vary the findings of the High Court. So, it is premature for the Deputy Prime Minister to file this Motion to call upon the House to do anything when the findings are subject to review. That is my objection.",1,737,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00737

So, the operative clause, of course, is the last one, where it calls upon AHTC to take certain actions.

I said this Motion is about what is expected of Members of Parliament  integrity, honesty and being truthful in Parliament. This House needs to agree on the principles that all Members of Parliament must adhere to and the standards of probity required of all Members of Parliament in dealing with public funds. There are serious issues of probity, accountability and the handling of public funds that must be addressed now even while the appeal is being dealt with.",1,745,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00745
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"There is a judgment of the High Court, which stands until the appeal is heard. The question is  what should be done, what should happen between now and the time when the appeal is decided? And that could be some time yet. So, in the interim, my question is  should the Workers' Party town councillors who have been found to have acted dishonestly and have been found to be in breach of their duties, whose conduct was found to be egregious, should they continue to have access to and control of public funds?",2,746,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00746

It is a serious and grave indictment of proper conduct and against various elected officials of the Workers' Party. They may say they disagree with the judgment – as I heard Ms Lim said earlier – or that they wish to appeal, as I heard Mr Faisal Manap said a moment ago which, of course, you are entitled to do.

But, clearly, this was not the case here. And do not take my word for it, look at what the Judge had found about that report. It said, ""It was not truthful and painted a wholly inaccurate picture"" and it ""sought to cloak the appointment of FMSS with a veneer of propriety”.",56,814,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00814

There were scenes of great disappointment of Singapore People's Party supporters at our coffee shops, post the General Election. We had to level up and reunite the community. It was a tough and stressful time for all of us then. I pay tribute to our team in Potong Pasir. They were stoic and unwavering in the heat. We came together with whatever we had to deliver our promise to the residents of Potong Pasir.",13,894,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00894
2019-11-05-T-023,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, after nine years, I am glad to share that we have, by and large, turned things around. This even includes the financial situation of the Town Council. In 2011, we had more than 400 households in arrears of Service & Conservancy charges for more than three months. Some were in arrears for years. The total amount then was approximately $350,000. What did we do? We visited these households, assisted them where required and put in place plans that were acceptable to their financial situation. Today, we have less than 100 such families in Potong Pasir Division in similar arrears and the total amount is below $100,000.",14,895,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00895
2019-11-05-T-023,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Mr Speaker, Sir, my experiences in Potong Pasir showed me that it is, indeed, a difficult ordeal when Town Councils switch political parties. It is the same in most corporate takeovers. But the stakes in Town Councils are much higher because we are dealing with the lives and well-being of thousands of families. We were clear in our minds that we had a heavy duty to discharge.",15,896,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00896
2019-11-05-T-023,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"There were no celebration or sweeping changes made in Potong Pasir post-General Election 2011. There was no time. Teething issues abound and serving our residents and ensuring that their lives are not disrupted unnecessarily were at the top of our minds. And more importantly, we must do it right and ensure accountability in our duties in the Town Council. It is in this context, Mr Speaker, that I fully support the Motion.",16,897,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00897

Again, our position is that some of these key findings, we are going to take it on appeal. And he rightly points out, we have consistently maintained these circumstances were the circumstances that we had to deal with in the aftermath of the 2011 General Elections. So, this is something that we are going to appeal on and we will also highlight to the Judge certain evidences that may not have been given proper weight, including, for example, the termination notice issued to us by AIM. So, that is just to round off that first point.",2,902,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00902
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"On the second point on whether the Town Council had been forthcoming with information for its own auditors, I recalled at that point in time a conversation which I had with our General Manager, who told me that, actually, the auditors were given full access to our IT system to search for any information that they wanted. So, I think it is important that I put on record that that was what I recalled when I asked her about the auditors' comment, that was what she told me.",3,903,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00903
2019-11-05-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Last of all, regarding the AGO audit, he did cite that the AGO had said that they had asked for certain documents which should exist. I would like to also point out to him that, in the light of the AGO's request at that time, I personally headed a physical search of the Town Council offices with the AGO team to try to search for some of these documents. So, I would refute any suggestion that we tried to hide things from the auditors.",4,904,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00904

A resolution of the House is not legislation, nor does it have any legal force. Given this, should the call for AHTC to discharge their responsibilities as proposed in part (iv) of the Motion – asking for this House to call for and influence AHTC to recuse the said Members of Parliament ""from all matters relating to, and oversight over, financial matters"" – be made by the Minister through the powers granted by the Town Councils Act instead of this House?",4,908,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00908

In addition, Mr Speaker, I am also uncomfortable with judgment being discussed in this House. A Court proceeding, as I understand accordingly to the Administration of Justice Protection Act, only concludes when all issues relating to the assessment of damages and Court proceedings are heard and finally decided. Therefore, it is clear that if a legal proceeding of this case is still afoot, the defendants are also entitled to launch an appeal, which we have just heard from Ms Sylvia Lim that they will be doing so. Given this, Mr Speaker, I am concerned that any comments that we make now, while possibly protected under certain parliamentary privileges, could still potentially fall under contempt of Court. Also, our debates are published in Hansard and the media. I worry that commenting on and acting from the judgment when the case is not concluded with finality, especially if this matter is brought to the Court of Appeal, may be perceived to be interfering with the due judicial process in the administration of justice.",6,910,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00910

The judgment does find a serious breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the hon Members Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang. The breach is because they had planned to appoint FMSS as managing agent without calling a tender. The learned Judge finds that the circumstances, including the argued difficulty of working with the previous ""PAP-affiliated managing agent"", were an excuse and not a justification for waiver of tender.",2,919,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00919

But that said, I will stand corrected, but I have not seen evidence in the judgment that this breach was motivated by personal self-enrichment on the part of the hon Members. This is not to excuse the breach of fiduciary duty. It is serious. But I have heard the hon Member Ms Sylvia Lim and noted their intention to appeal and I respect that.",3,920,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00920
2019-11-05-T-023,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The second principle concerns Parliament's role in effectively addressing this serious breach of fiduciary duty for the benefit of residents and Singaporeans. Part (iv) of this Motion calls on the Town Council to recuse Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang for financial matters. Sir, the Town Council is a political entity. It is led by the elected Members of that Constituency. This Motion essentially calls on the Workers' Party to undertake a certain course of action. The Motion is not binding on the Town Council. So, I am personally concerned that this part of the Motion has the effect of a political resolution.

And a suit has been taken by the charity or by the charity regulator against this trustee or fiduciary.

What would our friends from the Workers' Party expect if there were such a finding, if it ever were to reach such a stage that the High Court finding were to be made of one of my colleagues or one of the Members of the ruling party in this House? What would they be expecting? What would they be calling for? What would they require us to do? In fact, what would we expect of ourselves, no less?",15,938,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00938

At the very least, recuse yourself, not from all Town Council's duties but from financial duties for which the Judges' findings focused on. I do not think that is considered political. That, I think, is something that anyone in a company, anyone in an institution, anyone in the society, anyone in an organisation will do. And if they see us in this House not even doing that, then what do you think members of the public would think of the standards that we uphold here in this very House? Is it lower than in a company? Is it lower than in a charity? Is it lower than in society? Is it lower than in some other organisation in Singapore but outside this House?

Because I know them, I trust them. So, never mind what the High Court Judge says. I will trust them. I will not act."" Second, he says, ""Well, I am the Chairman of Town Council but the Independent Panel did not give me any advice, did not tell me what to do."" No less the Chairman of the Town Council – waiting for the Independent Panel to tell the Chairman what is the right thing to do.

How well we manage and run our Town Councils will reflect to the public, not just on our abilities but on what we stand for. But MND recognises the political nature of Town Councils and accept that political considerations can indeed go into the appointment of contractors for Town Councils. But such latitude must be exercised by town councillors within the boundaries of our laws. And public funds and residents' interests must at all times be properly safeguarded. So, yes, Town Councils are creatures of politics. It allows Members of Parliament to show politically to the public what they are able to achieve but certainly, at the very least, there are some boundaries and those boundaries are laws and also boundaries of ethics and of integrity.",20,943,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00943

But in this case, the Court found that the entire process had been deliberately subverted. Right from the start, the Workers' Party Members of Parliament were clear that they did not want to work with the incumbent Managing Agent, CPG or any other Managing Agent in the industry. And, so, they devised a plan to ensure that they will get what they want.",22,945,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00945

The late Mr Loh could confidently put up the capital as the MA contract was assured. But to ensure that FMSS was appointed, the Workers' Party knew that CPG had to be removed from the picture and they did not want to call a tender. And they wanted to hide this plan with the smoke screen.",23,946,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00946
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"The High Court found that ""steps had to be taken to ensure that this did happen without the true motivations being unfounded."" These steps include the following.",24,947,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00947
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"First, as early as 13 May 2011, the elected Members instructed Ms How Weng Fan to write to CPG to arrange for the taking over of the management of the Town Council. This was before the elected Members of Parliament met with CPG on 30 May 2011 and before CPG expressed any intention to be released from its contract. In fact, the High Court did not accept the point that any of this had to do with CPG's intention. And the fact of the matter was that the Workers' Party Members of Parliament had proceeded after the 2011 GE on ""an independent and simple-minded course of action"" to replace CPG. They did not review the CPG contract to satisfy themselves whether CPG was entitled to prematurely terminate the contract before meeting with CPG on 30 May 2011. That is first.",25,948,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00948
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Second, CPG was kept completely in the dark about FMSS. The Workers' Party Members of Parliament were concerned that if CPG was aware the details behind the formation of FMSS, they would whistle-blow and sound the alarm. The High Court found that there was a consistent and concerted effort to keep the true facts away from CPG's eyes which included postponing their second Town Council meeting to discuss the waiver of tender until after CPG's departure.",26,949,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00949
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"And third, an excuse had to be given to the other town councillors to justify the waiver of tender. A story was thus spun about the alleged urgency to appoint the new MA caused apparently by CPG's sudden announcement on 30 May that it intended to depart, the abrupt termination of the Town Council's system, the TCMS by AIM, and the lack of contractors who wanted to work for the Workers' Party.",27,950,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00950
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"But the fanning of this smoke screen was egregious because the case for urgency was completely manufactured. So, you see this is a deliberate matter. The Court found not negligence, carelessness or breach of contract but dishonesty and fanning of smoke screens. The public, our Parliament were all misled deliberately. The High Court found that the report prepared on the appointment of FMSS as Managing Agent for the Town Council, setting out the reasons for waiver of tender, under the instructions of Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang, was, I quote, ""not truthful and painted a wholly inaccurate picture"". Instead, the report sought to ""cloak the appointment of FMSS with a veneer of propriety"" and to paper over the cracks.",28,951,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00951
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"In fact, as Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong had pointed out, it is deeply troubling that Ms	Sylvia Lim had asked Ms How Weng Fan and Mr Danny Loh, whose conflict of interest was crystal clear, to examine such report to see if it would ""pass the auditor's eyes"". This serves to illustrate the lengths that the Workers' Party went to pull wool over the eyes of the other town councillors.",29,952,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00952
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"I say this to illustrate the key point that yes, there are civil cases and there are civil cases. But look at what the Judge found in this particular civil case and ask ourselves whether as fiduciaries or as town councillors, what is the right thing to do pending an appeal.",30,953,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00953
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Sir, as I have said, in this particular case, the Workers' Party not only appointed their friends by circumventing the proper process, a lot of which had been gone into detail by both Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong, but they also allowed their friends and supporters to reap a handsome profit at the expense of the Town Council. It is one thing to award contracts to friends for political reasons but another to allow them to reap a profit or to pay them more. The auditors, PwC and KPMG, have all previously found FMSS to have charged more than CPG. There appears to have been substantial double counting in the charging of fees and then when it came to the second Managing Agent contract, having only gained barely a year's experience in managing a GRC, it is astonishing that FMSS sought to put in even higher rates. The Workers' Party allowed them to do that.",31,954,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00954
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"The issue of damages, what needs to be recovered, is subject to further proceedings before the Court.

2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"But it is clear that residents' interests, public funds were abused as a result of the Managing Agent contracts with FMSS while FMSS in turn had profited handsomely.

2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, prior to the Workers' Party taking over, Aljunied Town Council, in fact, enjoyed a surplus. Within the first full year of Workers' Party's management, AHPETC, as it then was, ran an operating deficit of $1.5 million, which widened to a deficit of $2 million in the second year. In a short span of two years, the Town Council was run to the ground. In stark contrast, Workers' Party's friends in FMSS made $1.5 million in profits in the first full year, which shot up to some $3.2 million in the second year. It bears noting that FMSS had one and only one client, which is the AHTC.",1,958,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00958
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In other words, all profit came from the Town Council. How is it fair to the residents? How is this protecting the interests of residents and safeguarding public funds? It therefore comes as no surprise that the High Court had found the defendants to be in breach of legal duties, including their fiduciary duties of loyalty owed to the Town Council.",2,959,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00959
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"On that point, I was also surprised when Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned earlier in this debate that this case involved a novel point of law, of fiduciary duty. A town councillor elected by members, by electors, running a Town Council, a statutory entity, looking after public funds, has duties. She says statutory duties but in fact in Court, their lawyers argued that there is nothing that anyone can do if monies were lost except through the ballot box.",3,960,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00960
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"It would have been a different story, Sir, if they had ensured that their friends had charged fairly. Given the lack of track record and experience, there was simply no basis for FMSS to charge the same rates as CPG or more. Workers' Party should have ensured that they charged less, especially in circumstances where no tender was called. As I said earlier, this is to illustrate the seriousness of the findings and therefore why action should be taken in the interim to safeguard public resources until the appeal is heard.",4,961,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00961
2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The findings in the High Court judgment have now answered some of the key questions concerning FMSS that were raised by various accountants previously.

2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I come back to the core of today's Motion, which is  what is the Workers' Party going to do about this in the meantime? If the same had happened in the corporate context, the management would recuse themselves from running the company. In other Town Councils, errant officers step down. The general manager of Ang Mo Kio Town Council had to step down and face the music. He was charged and pleaded guilty eventually to corruption charges.",6,963,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00963

When I say I felt uncomfortable, I am talking about the fact that clearly as a non-legal trained person, I just feel uncomfortable that all these are being discussed so openly. And I am totally with Minister Desmond Lee's point. I am not disputing there is a need for action, which is why I brought up another pathway for that action to be taken instead of this Motion in the House. My discomfort comes from us discussing so many details about the judgment. Given that I am not a lawyer, I was just uncomfortable. That could be potential interference or perceived to be interference, given that. I am not concluding anything, Minister.",1,968,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00968
2019-11-05-T-023,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I understand. As I understand the position, Ms Anthea Ong is not saying that an appeal precludes a discussion of this. It is just that feeling of discomfort with all the discussions going on. Okay.",1,969,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00969

The High Court judgment has found that Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang acted dishonestly, in breach of fiduciary duty, that their conduct lacked integrity and candour, and that they were fully aware that their conduct was of questionable legality. That is the High Court finding. That is not the finding of any of the Members here.

I appreciate that Ms Sylvia Lim has said that they will be filing an appeal, as indeed that is their right to do so. That is not disputed. But the question is, between now and the time that the appeal is heard, what is the appropriate thing for a Member of Parliament to do? What is the appropriate thing for a town councillor to do?",5,973,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00973
2019-11-05-T-023,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"As all the lawyers in this room know, that a judgment, once given, until and unless overturned, the findings stand. So, in response to Ms Anthea Ong, this is not sub judice because we are not making any suggestion that the findings were right or wrong.

2019-11-05-T-023,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"What is the standard of conduct? Do you simply disregard what the judgment says or do you say, that pending the appeal, and whilst there is a cloud hanging over the heads of these town councillors, do they stand down? Do they wait, and then see what the Court of Appeal says? Or do they say, ""Well, in the mean time, it does not really matter if there is a judgment, I carry on as usual"". That is the issue.",7,975,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00975
2019-11-05-T-023,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,Why is this important? It is important because the Workers' Party's response to this important issue will tell you what are their values and what do they regard as good governance.,8,976,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00976

It does not matter if it is a civil servant, if it is the Head of Civil Service, if it is the Commissioner of SCDF"". It is a finding of dishonesty, of lack of candour, lack of integrity.

That is not what we are even asking here.",10,978,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00978

2019-11-05-T-023,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Members of Parliament are elected public figures, and so are Opposition Members of Parliament. So, the question is  what sort of governance do you hold to? What makes you different? Why do the same standards of conduct not apply to you, as to others? If the position that Workers' Party has advocated is the standard of governance, then, what it would mean is this. Imagine if you had a Workers' Party government, if there were to be a government official that has been found liable for something, does that person stand aside when there is an appeal pending? The answer would be no – you just carry on, business as usual.",12,980,2019-11-05-T-023-S-00980

That is true. The residents of Aljunied did give them a mandate to be their Members of Parliament. They gave them a mandate to run the Town Council. They did not give them a mandate to breach their fiduciary duties.

All that this Motion asks is that they do the appropriate thing, which is to recuse themselves from all matters relating to and oversight of financial matters in the Town Council pending the appeal.

However, I do wish to add that the judgment also raises the real prospect of the plaintiffs, namely Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council or AHTC's Independent Panel, filing an appeal against the judgment identified in the Deputy Prime Minister's Motion. This is because the plaintiffs did not succeed in many causes of action, some of which were either rejected or dismissed by the Judge.

Mr Low’s depth of Town Council experience and perspective as a long-standing opposition town councillor on estate matters is very useful for the ECLC.

Well, it depends. Is it a criminal matter? Is it a civil matter? What is the dispute? What is the substantive issue here? Those will be the considerations that will be relevant. So, I reject any suggestion that the Workers' Party will not have any moral authority to question an issue like that when it comes up. And we know one issue, for example, that came up, it was December 2016, if my memory serves me right, just a few days before Christmas, knowledge of a tri-factor prosecution involving Keppel Corporation, Brazil, the US and Singapore comes to light. Members of Parliament had slightly less than 48 hours to file a Parliamentary Question about this issue – slightly less than 48 hours. Not a single PAP Member of Parliament filed a question on the matter, probably one of the most serious corporate issues – corporate scandals – that had affected Singapore’s Government-linked company.",14,1000,2019-11-05-T-023-S-01000

It is a question of what is the standard of governance and what is the appropriate conduct? What is very clear is that the Workers' Party's standard of governance and conduct is very different from that of this Government's. That much is clear.",2,1004,2019-11-05-T-023-S-01004

The Motion calls on the Town Council to do certain things. So, the Motion, if passed, this Parliament is not forcing the Town Council to do anything, but it is calling upon it to do something. The response of the Town Council will, of course, be its own responsibility.

I do not know if I have heard him correctly, but in his speech, he was asserting that the Workers' Party Members of Parliament had allowed FMSS to charge very high rates throughout their entire incumbency as a Managing Agent. I think the import is that. But would he not agree that, actually, even in this High Court judgment, the trial Judge did not find any breach in the award of the second MA and EMSU contract. So, I would like him to confirm that and summarised at paragraph 12 of the Annex that the Deputy Prime Minister gave out earlier.",1,1012,2019-11-05-T-023-S-01012

But does he not agree that there is actually no case law on this point and this is the first case where a Judge has actually applied his mind to this issue of whether Town Councils in fact owe fiduciary duties.

2019-11-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for case law, I think the Member is really, playing lawyer. Certainly, case law on the legal duties of town councillors are few and far between. This case has generated jurisprudence on the front, but I think the key point is this. The findings of what had happened, being as they are, findings of fact, these findings will stand until they are reversed by the Appeals Court. Given the kind of findings of dishonesty, of subterfuge, of misleading town councillors, misleading the public and so on, found by the Court, what are the duties expected of a person in the shoes of a town councillor?",3,1017,2019-11-05-T-023-S-01017

Its Members set the tone – Members in this House – set the tone for politics that we have in Singapore. Singaporeans expect more from their Members of Parliament. If we let things go unanswered, Singaporeans will be right to ask what kind of a system we have today. Whether it is a clean and incorruptible Singapore that we have worked hard to maintain all these years, whether they can trust the people who they have elected to represent and serve them, whether the political leaders, whether from the Ruling Party or the Opposition deserve to be trusted.",3,1027,2019-11-05-T-023-S-01027

They have not explained why FMSS was allowed to charge higher MA rates than CPG even though FMSS was run by their friends and was close to the Workers' Party.

Given the severity of the judgment, is the Workers' Party prepared to have Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang recuse themselves from all financial decisions of the AHTC? This is the least that they can do, right? There is no admission of guilt involved, simply whether are you prepared to give your residents some reassurance.",8,1032,2019-11-05-T-023-S-01032
2019-11-05-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira and Ms Anthea Ong earlier on mentioned about your concern of whether this is a partisan debate. Let me remind Members of this House that it was not MND, it was not the HDB that sued the Workers' Party.

Members of the Workers' Party know in their hearts the answers. So, I urge the Workers' Party Members that, despite your recalcitrant stand today, after this debate, the Workers' Party and AHTC will reflect very carefully on what has happened in the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council and what the House have been discussing.

2019-11-05-T-027,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the cost of medicines in Singapore has increased over the last three years and, if so, what are the reasons; and (b) whether the Government will consider improving the affordability of medicines in Singapore by closing the gap between the prices of medicines here and those in neighbouring countries.",1,1076,2019-11-05-T-027-S-01076
2019-11-05-T-027,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Changes in the pricing of medications depend on several factors, such as whether they are patent protected, whether there are comparable alternatives, as well as the cost of development, production and distribution. Between countries, the prices of drugs may also differ significantly as suppliers take into account differences in market size, ability to pay, supply chain structure, competition and currency differences.",1,1077,2019-11-05-T-027-S-01077
2019-11-05-T-027,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We are taking various steps to manage drug costs. First, we are aggregating drug demand and integrating supply chain management across the public healthcare sector through the Agency for Logistics Procurement and Supply (ALPS) to achieve better economies of scale and create greater negotiating leverage. ALPS is consolidating functions, such as purchasing, storage, packaging and dispensing, so as to lower the cost of managing our drug supply chain. ALPS will also progressively streamline their system and deploy technology to improve supply chain efficiencies.",2,1078,2019-11-05-T-027-S-01078
2019-11-05-T-027,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Second, we are adopting value-based pricing approaches for drug purchases, especially for patented drugs. The Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) performs health technology assessment to evaluate the benefits of a drug. It then negotiates drug prices to levels commensurate with the benefits.",3,1079,2019-11-05-T-027-S-01079
2019-11-05-T-027,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Third, we are making efforts to ensure the appropriate use of drugs. We encourage doctors to recommend or prescribe drugs where there is evidence that it is effective for the patients’ specific conditions, and to avoid prescribing drugs where benefits are unproven or unclear. Where a less costly generic alternative is just as effective, we encourage the use of the generic version. ACE publishes guidances to help doctor keep abreast of the latest clinical evidence. MOH also tracks generic vs branded drug utilisation patterns in our public healthcare institutions to encourage the use of generics where appropriate.",4,1080,2019-11-05-T-027-S-01080
2019-11-05-T-027,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, MOH regularly reviews the drugs we subsidise in the public healthcare sector to add those assessed to be clinically effective and cost effective. Over the last three years, about 40 additional drugs were listed for subsidy. Where they apply, MediSave and MediShield Life also help patients pay for their drug bill. For those who are unable to afford, there is MediFund and the Medication Assistance Fund that can be tapped on to help the patient pay for their drugs.",5,1081,2019-11-05-T-027-S-01081
2019-11-05-T-028,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Health (a) when will the review of the pilot Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening programme be completed; and (b) how will the Ministry determine whether the pilot has been successful.,1,1082,2019-11-05-T-028-S-01082
2019-11-05-T-028,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH started a three-year pilot on Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) in 2017, to test for chromosomal abnormalities in pre-implanted embryos created through in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Under this pilot, women who are 35 years and above, or any woman with two or more recurrent implantation failures, or two or more pregnancy losses were recruited.",1,1083,2019-11-05-T-028-S-01083
2019-11-05-T-028,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Thus far, 298 patients have been enrolled under the pilot study. The pilot is scheduled to end in December 2019. MOH will evaluate the clinical outcomes from the pilot in consultation with experts before deciding if PGS should be a routine clinical service.",2,1084,2019-11-05-T-028-S-01084
2019-11-05-T-028,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The pilot study outcomes include comparing the embryo implantation success rates, pregnancy rates and live birth rates between women on IVF programmes who had received PGS with those who had not received any PGS.  The review will take into consideration the available international evidence concerning PGS testing, the ethical challenges associated with PGS and the regulatory framework that needs to be established for governing PGS.",3,1085,2019-11-05-T-028-S-01085
2019-11-05-T-029,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for each of the past five years, how many appeals have been received to request use of monies in the CPF Retirement Account to service HDB housing loans or purchase HDB flats; (b) how many of these appeals have been approved; and (c) whether CPF and HDB will work together to provide assistance to those whose appeals are rejected.",1,1086,2019-11-05-T-029-S-01086
2019-11-05-T-029,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Our CPF system aims to help members meet three basic needs in retirement – housing, medical care and day-to-day spending. The bulk of members' CPF contributions goes into the Ordinary Account (OA), which may be used to buy a home. MediSave helps them pay for MediShield Life premiums and major medical expenses not covered by insurance.",1,1087,2019-11-05-T-029-S-01087
2019-11-05-T-029,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The primary purpose of Special and Retirement Accounts (RA) savings is to ensure that members have a stream of retirement payouts to fund basic day-to-day spending. Generally, members can only use their RA savings for housing after setting aside their Basic Retirement Sum (BRS).",2,1088,2019-11-05-T-029-S-01088
2019-11-05-T-029,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"However, the CPF Board does exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis. Over the last five years, CPF Board approved around 80% of such appeals per year on average. These are mostly cases where some of members' OA savings had been transferred into the RA when they turned 55.",3,1089,2019-11-05-T-029-S-01089
2019-11-05-T-029,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To help members whose appeals were rejected, CPF Board works with HDB to assess if other more appropriate forms of assistance can be provided. For example, HDB may consider reducing or deferring the housing instalments to help flat owners who have difficulty repaying their HDB loan.",4,1090,2019-11-05-T-029-S-01090
2019-11-05-T-030,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government is reviewing the causes for the rising unemployment rate among PMETs and what measures are being considered to reduce it.,1,1091,2019-11-05-T-030-S-01091
2019-11-05-T-030,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The unemployment rate of resident PMETs, which is released annually, fell from 3.1% in 2016 to 2.9% in 2018. The 2019 PMET unemployment rate is not yet available.",1,1092,2019-11-05-T-030-S-01092
2019-11-05-T-030,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"However, latest available data suggest that there are still job opportunities for PMETs. As at June 2019, there were over 28,000 PMET job vacancies. Total employment grew by 22,400 in the third quarter of 2019, largely in Community, Social & Personal Services, Professional Services and Information & Communications, sectors where PMETs make up the majority of their workforce. From January to August 2019, Workforce Singapore (WSG) and its partners placed 11,700 PMETs through the Adapt & Grow (A&G) initiative.",2,1093,2019-11-05-T-030-S-01093
2019-11-05-T-030,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Nonetheless, there are PMET segments we are monitoring closely, such as mature PMET jobseekers, and those who are long-term unemployed. These groups may face greater challenges entering new jobs due to more cautious hiring and mismatches in wage expectations or skills.",3,1094,2019-11-05-T-030-S-01094
2019-11-05-T-030,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Under the A&G initiative, WSG provides a range of programmes to address such mismatches. For example, the Career Support Programme (CSP) provides salary support to employers who hire long-term unemployed or mature retrenched PMETs. There are currently over 100 Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) which provide employers with training and salary support to re-skill and hire mid-career local jobseekers. These programmes provide higher support to mature or long-term unemployed jobseekers.",4,1095,2019-11-05-T-030-S-01095
2019-11-05-T-030,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,WSG is working closely with economic agencies and companies to increase capacity for PCPs as well as to pre-emptively retrain workers at risk of retrenchment so that they can take on new jobs within their companies.,5,1096,2019-11-05-T-030-S-01096
2019-11-05-T-031,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) in each of the last five years, how many applications have been received for HDB rental flats by (i) divorcees (ii) bankrupts (iii) those who run into financial difficulty due to repayment of debt arising from business failures (iv) those facing debt repayment due to gambling and (v) those facing family disputes and refusal of help by family members; and (b) whether help has been and can be given to them to buy one- or two-room flexi flats with shorter tenures on an exceptional basis.",1,1097,2019-11-05-T-031-S-01097
2019-11-05-T-031,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"From 2015 to September 2019, HDB received about 10,300 requests from divorcees seeking to rent a flat from HDB. HDB does not specifically track whether rental applicants are bankrupt, in financial difficulties due to business failure or gambling, or facing family disputes.",1,1098,2019-11-05-T-031-S-01098
2019-11-05-T-031,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB has helped rental applicants with sufficient budget to buy short-lease 2-room Flexi flats on an exceptional basis, for example by exercising flexibility on the age requirement.",2,1099,2019-11-05-T-031-S-01099
2019-11-05-T-031,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,HDB will continue to offer public rental flats for households who have no other housing options and no family support.,3,1100,2019-11-05-T-031-S-01100
2019-11-05-T-032,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for National Development whether the HDB will review and enhance the programmes to promote neighbourliness and tolerances among neighbours and whether more can be done to reduce the disputes among neighbours.,1,1101,2019-11-05-T-032-S-01101
2019-11-05-T-032,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Encouraging good neighbourliness is not something that HDB, as a housing authority, can do on its own. That is why the Government has a multi-pronged effort to promote neighbourliness, including through the People’s Association, grassroots leaders and community partners.",1,1102,2019-11-05-T-032-S-01102
2019-11-05-T-032,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For its part, HDB actively promotes neighbourly behaviour through various initiatives. These include public education exhibitions at community and school events, as well as outreach by volunteers who share tips on gracious living during door-to-door visits. HDB’s Good Neighbour Award also recognises individuals who have gone the extra mile with their acts of neighbourliness.",2,1103,2019-11-05-T-032-S-01103
2019-11-05-T-032,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB recognises that the design of housing estates and flats can help shape and promote social interactions between neighbours. Hence, it has also paid more attention to such design details, including setting aside more community spaces like playgrounds and gardens, which have been effective in bringing neighbours together. HDB introduced the Lively Places Programme to facilitate and support ground-up community projects. Through the Programme, HDB hopes to encourage more residents to take greater ownership of place-making initiatives within the estate. These will promote greater collaboration amongst residents, and help in building closer neighbourly ties.",3,1104,2019-11-05-T-032-S-01104
2019-11-05-T-033,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether financial benefits from the Home Care-giving Grant, MediSave withdrawal for Long-Term Care, Elder Fund and CareShield Life will result in (i) a change of monthly household income for one's national means-testing status assessment and (ii) a change in eligibility for ComCare assistance and MediFund; (b) how does the Government ensure that residents who benefit from the long-term care schemes are aware about how they may jeopardise their eligibility for other social and healthcare assistance schemes; and (c) how are policies designed to minimise this negative effect of opportunity costs in terms of benefits received.",1,1105,2019-11-05-T-033-S-01105
2019-11-05-T-033,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Financial assistance from help schemes such as the Home Care-giving Grant, MediSave withdrawal for Long-Term Care, ElderFund and CareShield Life, will not affect the computation of household monthly income used in means testing.

2019-11-05-T-033,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"However, we will take into consideration various financial assistance schemes when determining eligibility for ComCare assistance and MediFund. ComCare assistance is for those who need it the most. ComCare assistance covers basic living expenses when other forms of financial assistance cannot sufficiently cover these. Where clients are still unable to meet their basic living expenses, which may include medical consumables, we will provide ComCare assistance. We will also refer them to agencies that provide subsidised or free day-care or home-care services if needed.",2,1107,2019-11-05-T-033-S-01107
2019-11-05-T-033,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Similarly, MediFund is a safety net for needy patients who are unable to afford their healthcare bills after exhausting other support means. Independent MediFund committees assess each applicant holistically. For disabled persons, the committees take into account their higher healthcare expenses and sources of support, including financial assistance from various schemes. This will help the committees provide more support to those who may not have access to these schemes, and ensure that no Singaporean will be denied appropriate healthcare.",3,1108,2019-11-05-T-033-S-01108

2019-11-05-T-034,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Those who require long-term care support can enrol in Day Activity Centres (DACs).

2019-11-05-T-034,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"SG Enable also administers various schemes that support persons with disabilities to live independently in their homes and the community. The Assistive Technology Fund subsidises up to 90% of the cost of buying, replacing and repairing assistive technology devices that help in independent living. To facilitate mobility, SG Enable provides transport subsidies to persons with disabilities, through the Public Transport Concession Scheme, Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) Transport Subsidies, Taxi Subsidy Scheme, and the Disabled Persons Scheme.

2019-11-05-T-035,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the training and communication plan to employers for the new safety requirements under the Work Injury Compensation Act; (b) how does the Ministry ensure that workers know who to approach when they encounter work injuries; (c) what is the number of times that errant doctors have been reported over migrant work injuries in the last three years; (d) what is the number of civil claims for such work injuries that have been won in the last three years; and (e) how does the Ministry ensure that the Singapore Medical Council and Law Society of Singapore support efforts to protect migrant workers in work injury cases.,1,1116,2019-11-05-T-035-S-01116
2019-11-05-T-035,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"MOM has been actively engaging employers to inform them about the new requirements under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA). We have advertised the new requirements on mainstream newspapers and social media platforms, and provided resources on MOM website to guide employers.",1,1117,2019-11-05-T-035-S-01117
2019-11-05-T-035,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Together with the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) U SME and Singapore Institution of Safety Officers (SISO), we have briefed close to 2,000 employers, HR practitioners and safety officers in the past two months following the passing of the WICA amendments. We have also worked with them to disseminate information regarding the new requirements to their broader membership base. We will be briefing more employers in the coming months.",2,1118,2019-11-05-T-035-S-01118

2019-11-05-T-035,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We will continue to refer cases of suspected professional misconduct by doctors and lawyers to SMC and Law Society of Singapore, respectively, for investigation and disciplinary action. We support their investigations by performing our own enquiry into workers’ complaints, and sharing our findings and assessments with the professional bodies. For instance, in cases of insufficient medical leave, we would advise the worker to get treatment at another clinic if they have not already done so. We would then share the first and second doctor’s prescription of medical leave with SMC, and provide them the assessment of whether the first doctor’s prescription seemed insufficient for the injury.",6,1122,2019-11-05-T-035-S-01122
2019-11-05-T-036,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry will consider extending from six months to one year the obligation on employment agencies to provide a 50% refund of the service fee for any premature termination of contracts with foreign domestic workers; and (b) whether there are other measures to ensure that families are less dependent on luck to find suitable matches and are not subject to repeated service fees.,1,1123,2019-11-05-T-036-S-01123
2019-11-05-T-036,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Foreign domestic workers (FDWs) play an important role in supporting families in their care-giving duties and domestic work. As it is costly and disruptive to families when they hire an FDW who is not able to meet their household needs, MOM recently announced a series of measures to better support employers in the hiring of FDWs.",1,1124,2019-11-05-T-036-S-01124
2019-11-05-T-036,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Firstly, to improve the chances of employers being matched with FDWs who can meet their household needs, employers and employment agencies (EAs) will be able to obtain more information on the work experience of prospective FDWs from October 2020. This includes information on the FDW’s previous job scope, her former employer’s residence type and household size, and the reasons for the termination of her past employment contracts. In addition, EAs will also be able to have access to the profiles of FDWs hired by employers who had changed five or more FDWs within a span of 12 months. This will allow the EAs to better customise their services for these employers who may need more help in selecting FDWs, such as making house visits to find out more about the unique household needs of the employers and training the FDWs based on these needs.",2,1125,2019-11-05-T-036-S-01125
2019-11-05-T-036,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Secondly, from October 2021, all EAs will be required to provide an option to refund at least 50% of the service fee charged to employers when the FDW’s contract ends prematurely within the first six months. This will encourage the EAs to improve their matching processes and take greater ownership in finding better matches for employers.",3,1126,2019-11-05-T-036-S-01126
2019-11-05-T-036,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In general, six months is a sufficient period for an employer to determine if his/her FDW meets the household’s needs. MOM’s records show that the large majority of FDWs who worked for at least six months continued to stay with their employers beyond one year. Hence, beyond the initial six months of employment, it would not be fair to attribute the subsequent breakdown of the relationship to a poor match by the EA and could result in higher service fees for employers.",4,1127,2019-11-05-T-036-S-01127
2019-11-05-T-036,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Lastly, despite best efforts to ensure a good match, there could invariably still be disputes between employers and their FDWs.

2019-11-05-T-037,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Health what are the considerations behind selecting the Gibraltar Crescent site as Singapore's first dementia care village given that the state bungalows on the site are required to remain intact and given the cost of retrofitting those bungalows to make them elder-friendly residences.,1,1130,2019-11-05-T-037-S-01130

2019-11-05-T-037,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In land scarce Singapore, suitable sites to test such pilots are not always readily available.

However, other education authorities such as that in the UK recognise that the educational needs of children with higher needs are better met in more specialised settings, and are setting up more specialised schools and units for children with SEN.",1,1190,2019-11-05-T-050-S-01190
2019-11-05-T-050,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In Singapore, we have adopted a multi-pronged approach, so as to cater to the diverse range of educational needs of students with SEN. Hence, around 80% of students with SEN, including many with dyslexia, Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), as well as the majority of students with sensory and physical impairment, are in mainstream schools. The rest who have moderate-to-severe SEN, are in Special Education (SPED) schools. That way, students with moderate-to-severe SEN can benefit from a highly customised curriculum and pedagogy, delivered by specially-trained SPED teachers, and supported by a range of allied professionals such as psychologists and therapists.",2,1191,2019-11-05-T-050-S-01191
2019-11-05-T-050,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Having well-trained staff is key to the quality of support for students with SEN. In mainstream schools, all Allied Educators (Learning and Behavioural Support) [AED(LBS)] undergo the Diploma in Special Education (DISE) programme at the National Institute of Education (NIE). In 2016, MOE enhanced the career structure, progression and development of AED(LBS), including creating higher appointments, such as Lead AED(LBS), Master AED(LBS) and Chief AED(LBS) to lead the fraternity at the school cluster, zonal and national levels. MOE enhanced professional development opportunities for AED(LBS) through modular training, conferences and milestone programmes, and offer scholarships and awards to AED(LBS) for further studies.",3,1192,2019-11-05-T-050-S-01192
2019-11-05-T-050,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The number of SPED teachers has increased by about 40% since 2014, to meet the needs of the growing enrolment of students with SEN. MOE and NCSS will continue to support mainstream and SPED schools in the recruitment of educators with appropriate skill-sets and aptitude to teach students with moderate-to-severe SEN.",4,1193,2019-11-05-T-050-S-01193
2019-11-05-T-051,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Manpower based on cases brought to the Ministry or Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) (a) what are the top three reasons that employers give for denying employees access to childcare leave; (b) how many cases have been brought to TAFEP in each of the past five years for denial of childcare leave; and (c) in how many of these cases have the employees obtained the childcare leave sought or employers changed their childcare leave policies following TAFEP's intervention.,1,1194,2019-11-05-T-051-S-01194
2019-11-05-T-051,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The vast majority of employers and employees have been able to work out mutually agreeable arrangements for the taking of childcare leave.,1,1195,2019-11-05-T-051-S-01195
2019-11-05-T-051,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In the past five years, MOM and TAFEP did not receive any case where an employee had applied for childcare leave and the employer had unreasonably rejected the application. During this period, MOM handled 15 cases where childcare leave was either not provided or under-provided in an employee’s contract. The main reason for employers not having fulfilled their statutory obligations was a lack of awareness of employees’ entitlements. In all 15 cases, MOM required the employers to rectify their childcare leave policies to comply with the law, and took enforcement action against them.",2,1196,2019-11-05-T-051-S-01196
2019-11-05-T-052,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Manpower what is being done to support mothers re-entering the workforce who may experience difficulty matching their employment hours with the opening hours of childcare services.,1,1197,2019-11-05-T-052-S-01197
2019-11-05-T-052,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To cater to the needs of working parents, including mothers re-entering the workforce, childcare centres are required to operate from 7 am to 7 pm on weekdays, and from 7 am to 2 pm on Saturdays. This arrangement meets the needs of most parents, without extending the working hours of childcare centre workers.",1,1198,2019-11-05-T-052-S-01198
2019-11-05-T-052,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"For families working shifts or on weekends, many of them arrange for other care-givers, such as grandparents and relatives, to help out. Some centres may extend their services, taking into consideration demand and resources. Currently, around 55 centres operate beyond 7 pm on weekdays.",2,1199,2019-11-05-T-052-S-01199
2019-11-05-T-052,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mothers, including those re-entering the workforce, may prefer some flexibility in their work hours to meet their care-giving needs. Through the Work-Life Grant and Tripartite Standard (TS) on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs), the Government encourages employers to provide FWAs such as flexible start and end times or telecommuting to help employees better manage work and family responsibilities. As at end-September, around 1,900 employers, covering around 450,000 employees, have adopted the Tripartite Standard on FWAs. Jobseekers who require FWAs may find a better job fit with an employer that has adopted the TS on FWAs.",3,1200,2019-11-05-T-052-S-01200
2019-11-05-T-052,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mothers looking for employment can also tap on Workforce Singapore (WSG)’s Adapt and Grow initiative, which offers a suite of employment services and programmes to help jobseekers to enter into new jobs.

2019-11-05-T-053,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"MOM together with the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council, has developed the WSH Guidelines on Managing Heat Stress in the Workplace. The guidelines inform employers to conduct risk assessments associated with heat stress and the precautionary actions they should take to prevent heat stress at work. These include acclimatising newly arrived workers who come from colder climates, providing regular rest breaks at shaded areas, making cool drinking water accessible, and educating workers on the symptoms and seriousness of heat-related disorders.",2,1204,2019-11-05-T-053-S-01204
2019-11-05-T-053,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The WSH Council has also been disseminating information on heat-related safety and health risks through its website, the WSH bulletin1, as well as collaterals such as the Heat Stroke Card. Heat stress is also included in the WSH Council's Total WSH Programme. Total WSH consultants are expected to advise companies on what they can do to protect workers from heat stress.",3,1205,2019-11-05-T-053-S-01205
2019-11-05-T-053,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Heat stroke and dehydration are already included in the types of work incidents that are reportable.

2019-11-05-T-054,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The unused monies of members who did not make nominations are transferred to the Public Trustee's Office (PTO) for distribution to the deceased’s next-of-kin in accordance with intestacy and Muslim inheritance laws. This was explained in MinLaw’s oral response on 4 November 2019 to Assoc Prof Daniel Goh. PTO reported that 88% of un-nominated CPF monies were distributed to next-of-kin in the last five years.,2,1209,2019-11-05-T-054-S-01209
2019-11-05-T-054,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In other words, about 98% of all unused CPF monies belonging to deceased members were eventually distributed by CPF Board and PTO in the last five years.

2019-11-05-T-056,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Under the Early Childhood Development Centres Act, kindergartens are licensed to provide half-day education programmes of six hours or less per session. As the provision requirements for kindergartens are for half-day education services only, kindergartens cannot provide care services for pre-school-aged children. Nevertheless, centres that wish to provide such before or after preschool care services can do so if they are licensed as childcare centres instead.",1,1218,2019-11-05-T-056-S-01218
2019-11-05-T-056,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Subject to the Early Childhood Development Agency’s (ECDA) approval, pre-schools may provide before and after school care (BASC) services during their operating hours for older children aged seven to below 14 years. This is mainly to cater to working parents who require after-school care support for their Primary-school going children, including those who may have siblings attending the pre-school where the BASC services are provided. The BASC programme must be run in a separate space from the preschool programme, and centres can enrol children only up to 10% of the centre’s accommodation capacity. The centre must adhere to stipulated safety, health, hygiene and supervision standards, to ensure the well-being of the children. To date, ECDA has not received any applications from kindergartens to run BASC services during their operating hours.",2,1219,2019-11-05-T-056-S-01219
