2020-02-03-T-001,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is Singapore’s response to the Wuhan pneumonia outbreak; and (b) what actions are taken to contain the spread to, and among, Singaporeans.",1,3,2020-02-03-T-001-S-00003
2020-02-03-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Health how prepared are the authorities to deal with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan and what can citizens do to help support the Ministry’s efforts.,1,4,2020-02-03-T-001-S-00004
2020-02-03-T-001,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the measures in place to prevent the entry and spread of the Wuhan virus in Singapore, aside from the temperature screening at the airport; and (b) whether there is an emergency response plan to handle the possible emergence of a Wuhan virus outbreak in Singapore.",1,5,2020-02-03-T-001-S-00005
2020-02-03-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide the latest update on the Wuhan virus situation; (b) what are the stepped-up precautionary measures taken; and (c) how are our contingency preparations and readiness for the possible scenarios ahead.,1,6,2020-02-03-T-001-S-00006

2020-02-03-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,All right. Let us proceed to Question No 7.,1,9,2020-02-03-T-001-S-00009
2020-02-03-T-002,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry will consider requiring all private and public hospitals to be equipped and manned to handle severe and multiple trauma cases in their accident and emergency departments as part of our nation’s emergency preparedness plan; and (b) whether we have sufficient emergency specialists and how many more will be trained in the next five years.,1,10,2020-02-03-T-002-S-00010
2020-02-03-T-002,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked the Minister for Health in light of the Lucky Plaza accident, whether private hospitals’ emergency departments should be upgraded for a tiered national accident and emergency system involving both public and private hospitals to make better use of medical resources.",1,11,2020-02-03-T-002-S-00011
2020-02-03-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Health),"Sir, with your leave, may I take Question Nos 7 and 8 together?",1,12,2020-02-03-T-002-S-00012
2020-02-03-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Please do.,1,13,2020-02-03-T-002-S-00013
2020-02-03-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, all public hospital Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments are equipped and capable of providing resuscitation, stabilisation and initial treatment for all life threatening emergencies, including trauma cases, for both adults and children. Public hospitals must also fulfill MOH's standards of trauma care. Overall, the eight public hospital A&E departments, spread out across Singapore, provide adequate coverage to cater to emergency services in Singapore.",1,14,2020-02-03-T-002-S-00014
2020-02-03-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"MOH has had on-going discussions with private hospitals about their capabilities in handling emergency care. Currently, private hospitals are not configured to provide the full range of emergency and trauma services required to manage all life-threatening emergencies or situations, involving patients with multiple or serious injuries. Over the last four years, MOH has been collaborating with Raffles Hospital for the management of non-life threatening and urgent SCDF ambulance cases.",2,15,2020-02-03-T-002-S-00015
2020-02-03-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"MOH carefully manages the training pipelines for emergency medicine and surgical specialists to ensure that there are sufficient capabilities to meet national needs. Currently, there are about 180 Emergency Medicine specialists and 240 general surgeons in Singapore.",3,16,2020-02-03-T-002-S-00016
2020-02-03-T-002,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I have one supplementary question. My concern, really, is whether all our urban areas and housing estates in Singapore will be able to have swift access to emergency services based on the existing locations of emergency departments across Singapore.",1,17,2020-02-03-T-002-S-00017
2020-02-03-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I had mentioned earlier, the public hospitals which are capable of handling all forms of emergencies and life-threatening services to both adults and children are spread out geographically across the island. There will be sufficiently swift access to these services should the need arise. In addition, the number of specialists who are in the pipeline and whom we are training currently, will increase by about 43% over the next five years. These specialists will add to the availability of services and will also add to the pool of emergency specialists who will be able to deal with such situations.",1,18,2020-02-03-T-002-S-00018

2020-02-03-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,9 To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether there is an upward trend of drug syndicates exploiting minors in the drug trade and how can our enforcement actions and statutory framework deter the syndicates from doing so.,2,20,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00020
2020-02-03-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the Ministry’s position on the research paper entitled “Costs of Drug Crime  Literature Review and Methodology” which calculated the detriment drugs cause to Singapore society; (b) whether the findings provide further impetus for Singapore to advance its war on drugs; and (c) what will be done to ensure that a tough and deterrent stance is taken against drug traffickers who push drugs into and within Singapore.,1,21,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00021
2020-02-03-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Can someone ask the Question on his behalf?,1,22,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00022

2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Mr Speaker, with your permission, may I take Question Nos 9 and 10 together?",1,24,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00024
2020-02-03-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,25,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00025
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Drugs destroy lives and impose immense costs on individuals and society. Besides tangible costs such as physical injuries, lost productivity and cost of incarceration, there are also very significant intangible costs, in terms of lost lives, pain and suffering, and untold misery to families.",1,26,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00026
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The research paper attempted to quantify the costs to Singapore of drug crime, both tangible and intangible costs. The researchers estimated costs of S$1.23 billion in 2015. This is almost certainly an underestimation, as there are other costs which were not included in the study, such as the number of workdays lost for victims of drug crimes. The report did not include this data because it has not been quantified.",2,27,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00027
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The high costs drugs impose on society is one reason why we must maintain our firm stance against drugs. We have put in place tough laws, and maintain intensive enforcement. In 2019, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), together with other Home Team agencies, conducted close to 1,500 drug operations across Singapore. The estimated market value of the drugs seized was about S$6.3 million.",3,28,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00028
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The CNB has not yet detected any trend of drug syndicates deliberately targeting young persons, be it selling drugs to children and young persons, or recruiting them into the trade.",4,29,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00029
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Nevertheless, we take this risk very seriously. We have strengthened our legislative framework and enhanced our enforcement powers to better protect young persons from being exploited and becoming victims of drugs.",5,30,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00030
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"In 2012, the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) was amended to provide for an offence for any adult who causes or procures any young person to traffic or import drugs. The minimum punishment for such an offender is 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. In addition, adult traffickers who are found to be trafficking to young persons would face tougher penalties. If the trafficker was found to be trafficking a Class A controlled drug to a young person, the minimum punishment would be 10 years' imprisonment and 10 strokes, double the normal rates.",6,31,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00031
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"In 2019, the MDA was further amended to provide more protection to children below 16 years of age and young persons from the harms of drugs. It is now an offence for an adult who possesses illicit drugs, knowing that a child is likely to be present in a place, to knowingly or recklessly leave the drugs or drug utensils within easy access of the child. It is also now an offence for an adult to permit or not take reasonable steps to prevent a young person from consuming illicit drugs in the adult’s possession. We will continue to tighten our legislation as needed.",7,32,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00032
2020-02-03-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the response. The question is, in light of the statistic that the highest number of new drug abusers are below 35 and in light of the growing calls, at least around the world – not in Singapore but around the world – to legalise recreational drug use, and in addition to that, this cost of drug crime study, how can we use these statistics and facts to bolster our position against drug trafficking into Singapore? And in addition to that, to assist drug consumers to rehabilitate and not be recalcitrant? So, deterring both the supply and the demand, in light of these facts and statistics.",1,33,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00033
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his questions. Indeed, the push for drug legalisation around the world is a cause for concern. As he may already know, in October 2018, Canada became the second country in the world, after Uruguay, to legalise the use of cannabis for recreational purposes. In January 2019, the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence also made six recommendations on the international scheduling of cannabis and cannabis-related substances.",1,34,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00034
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"We have now undertaken this study. We hope to add to the literature so that more are aware about what are the drug-involved crimes as well as drug-attributable crimes, and what the cost to society are. In time, the researchers are preparing for this paper for publication in international journals.",2,35,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00035
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"At the same time, we are also stepping up our education outreach. We understand that preventive drug education is definitely the first line of defence when it comes to drug control. The Member had mentioned some trends whereby young people are increasingly prone towards certain messages they may receive over social media about drugs. So, social media is a key platform for us to reach out to youths. The CNB has been developing content messages of strong deterrence, as well as evidence-based narratives on Singapore's drug policies through its social media accounts.",3,36,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00036
2020-02-03-T-003,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"At the end of the day, what we are going to do is going to be guided by research. At the same time, we are also pushing out our education outreach efforts to make sure that for high-risk youths and persons of certain segments, we reach out to them actively with the anti-drug message.",4,37,2020-02-03-T-003-S-00037
2020-02-03-T-004,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,asked the Prime Minister when individuals publicise complaints or petitions to Government agencies which may contain inaccuracies (a) what are the considerations behind whether Government agencies may publicly disclose identifying information and personal details of these individuals; (b) what safeguards exist to ensure that only the minimum personal information is disclosed to establish the facts of the case; and (c) what can be done to ensure that individuals with genuine grievances or unmet needs are not deterred from seeking help publicly,1,38,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00038
2020-02-03-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Speaker, Government agencies sometimes need to disclose personal data in the public interest, to counter inaccuracies about the Government’s processes or policies contained in publicised complaints or petitions, in particular, where it is the complainant who has called public attention to the case. Government agencies have to do so to correct inaccuracies and provide an accurate picture of what occurred so as to maintain public trust and to serve all citizens effectively. Otherwise, if citizens are misled about the Government’s processes or policies, they may become unnecessarily anxious or may make decisions that are detrimental to themselves based on the incorrect information, for example deciding not to seek medical treatment.",1,39,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00039
2020-02-03-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Prime Minister),"Such disclosure of personal data by Government agencies is limited in scope. First, personal data is disclosed only if the agency's clarifications would be disputable or insufficiently clear, without the disclosure of such personal data. Secondly, the personal data to be disclosed is specific enough to provide a full picture of the issue, to enable the relevant individual to challenge the Government’s account of the case, based on the facts provided, if need be. Third, care is taken not to disclose personal data that is irrelevant to the case. These considerations serve to safeguard personal data from unnecessary public disclosure.",2,40,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00040
2020-02-03-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Prime Minister),"However, on occasion it will be necessary to disclose the identity of the person involved in the case, even when the publicised complaint itself has been anonymised. This is to remove any ambiguity in the Government’s statement of the facts and settle any doubts over the matter conclusively in the minds of the public.",3,41,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00041
2020-02-03-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Prime Minister),"The Government is committed to putting citizens at the heart of all we do. Citizens have many channels to request for help from the Government and to give feedback. These include physical touchpoints such as service centres, and online channels such as the OneService app and emails of Quality Service Managers. The Government treats all feedback seriously, whether that feedback is conveyed publicly or via one of these channels. We will take the necessary action to address the issue and close the loop with the member of the public.",4,42,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00042
2020-02-03-T-004,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. Just one supplementary question. I am quite concerned we will discourage persons who are trying to get help because these cases can be publicised for reasons beyond the complainant's control. Someone may put up a private Facebook post and finds that it gets shared, and they do not know why it got shared. Will the Government consider a protocol where agencies first try to get the person concerned to agree to a statement put out by the agency that clarifies matters? And only if that does not happen, then as a last resort, the agency could clarify matters without that person's consent.",1,43,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00043
2020-02-03-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. The issue at hand is, of course, that these types of public declarations, whether anonymised or not, are going to be unusual in nature. There is something about the case or the complainant or the interaction, which does not quite fall into Standard Operating Procedure, nor lend itself to a protocol; otherwise, we would not be in this situation.",1,44,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00044
2020-02-03-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The second thing is that, as a result of this, it would be inappropriate for us to constrain the agencies' response to an inaccurate or outright false public statement. Thirdly, in a way, which as the Member had pointed out, may open itself to manipulation and further downstream ambiguity, disinformation, whether inadvertently or deliberately.",2,45,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00045
2020-02-03-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, I think I have articulated in my answer the principles under which public sector agencies are expected to operate; the principles which citizens can expect of Government in dealing with this matter. The bottom line is that should a complaint of this nature occur in public, associated with disinformation and which impacts the way in which Government processes Government policies that serve citizens are being misrepresented, we should expect agencies to reply in public and disclose information so that we can set the record straight; and make sure that Singapore and Singaporeans are well informed.",3,46,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00046
2020-02-03-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),Can I ask the Senior Minister of State if the Government has channels and measures for citizens who want to seek redress against Government for what they deem as unfair public disclosure since the Government is not bound by the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).,1,47,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00047
2020-02-03-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Certainly, there are many numbers of channels and feedback routes, which I have described in my previous answer. Citizens can approach their Member of Parliament, they can approach anybody and they can use any of these means, including a public discourse, should they wish to pursue the matter. PDPA notwithstanding and my answer notwithstanding, none of this prevents or is meant to discourage a citizen from seeking redress from a complaint. It is merely that, should a complaint occur in the public space and as a result of that complaint, the public has been misinformed, inaccuracies have been stated, then those inaccuracies need to be stated in the public in a way that is unambiguous and the facts robustly explained to everybody.",1,48,2020-02-03-T-004-S-00048
2020-02-03-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) by what date will the Ministry collect carbon tax payments for 2019 emissions; (b) by what date does the Ministry plan to publish the total amount of carbon tax payments collected for 2019 emissions; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider releasing a breakdown of revenue collected from each taxable facility when the data is available.,1,49,2020-02-03-T-005-S-00049
2020-02-03-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),The Carbon Pricing Act (CPA) came into force on 1 January 2019. The CPA gives effect to the carbon tax of $5 per tonne of carbon dioxide-equivalent (tCO,1,50,2020-02-03-T-005-S-00050

2020-02-03-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Minister for his reply. I am just hoping we can publish that data of what each company is paying. I think the public scrutiny on that, if you compare year by year, then I think the company's policy with regards on climate change will move much faster, if there is public scrutiny on that this.",1,52,2020-02-03-T-005-S-00052
2020-02-03-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The intention behind the carbon tax is to provide an economy-wide price signal. It is not meant to put scrutiny on facilities or companies. Therefore, what we do, by publishing the data on an economy-wide basis, I think would be more useful for the Government and the public to know which sectors we should be concentrating on and how we are going to move from there. So, we do not find it productive or correct to actually put any company under scrutiny because they pay their carbon tax or because they are compelled by the Act to do so.",1,53,2020-02-03-T-005-S-00053
2020-02-03-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I thank Minister for the reply but maybe as a step back, could we at least publish data based on facility type and size then, without naming the company. So, we know at least which industry is contributing more to carbon emissions in Singapore.",1,54,2020-02-03-T-005-S-00054
2020-02-03-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The number of companies that are affected by this Act is very small, around 40. But, they account for about 80% of the carbon emissions in our economy. So, even if you publish by facilities, you can actually do your Maths and make inferences on who is doing what; and I do not think that is what we want to get to.",1,55,2020-02-03-T-005-S-00055
2020-02-03-T-006,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Health (a) over the last three years, what have been the take-up rates of adult vaccinations recommended by the Ministry; and (b) how is the Ministry helping to raise awareness of adult vaccination, especially for those in the high-risk groups, such as the elderly and those with medical conditions.",1,56,2020-02-03-T-006-S-00056
2020-02-03-T-006,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Health),MOH established the National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS) in November 2017 to provide guidance on important vaccinations for adults. These vaccinations include catch-up vaccinations and vaccinations that high-risk adults should receive. MediSave may be used to pay for NAIS vaccinations.,1,57,2020-02-03-T-006-S-00057
2020-02-03-T-006,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Health),"To encourage take-up, some public healthcare institutions held vaccination awareness campaigns and conducted road shows and talks during the annual World Immunisation Week. Information on the NAIS is available on the Health Promotion Board's (HPB) HealthHub Portal.",2,58,2020-02-03-T-006-S-00058
2020-02-03-T-006,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Health),The NAIS also serves as a guide for doctors on the vaccinations they should recommend their patients.

2020-02-03-T-006,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Health),"We have been observing a steady increase in the take-up of NAIS vaccinations since its introduction, with more using MediSave to pay for them. Around 24% of adults between 65 and 79 take up the vaccination according to the National Health population survey 2019. In 2017, 39,000 adults use MediSave for flu vaccination. The number increased to 74,000 in 2018.",4,60,2020-02-03-T-006-S-00060

The subsidies are targeted to be rolled out before the end of 2020 and details will be announced at a later date. MOH is also planning a series of population-level vaccination awareness campaigns to increase the public's awareness on the importance of vaccination.",5,61,2020-02-03-T-006-S-00061
2020-02-03-T-006,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his reply.

2020-02-03-T-006,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Vaccination uptake is influenced by a number of factors. It includes awareness, importance of vaccinations, accessibility and affordability. MOH does not track data on vaccination rates across the different income groups, but we recognise that cost may pose a difficulty for those in a lower income groups. And hence, we hope to reduce the barriers for vaccinations and increase its uptake by extending subsidies for NAIS vaccinations.",1,63,2020-02-03-T-006-S-00063

Indeed, we have done some preliminary consultations as well as done a survey of the landscape of such issues in various countries, like New Zealand, Australia, UK. As I have noted earlier, I think the general view is that, because the duration and the type of medical leave or even light injury duties that are to be given, really varies widely depending on different persons, the different circumstances, whether it is the type and severity of the injury, the type of treatment required, rehabilitation, even the comorbidity and the fitness of the worker as well as the work requirements and work conditions.

I am asking because based on ICA's list of documents for REP application, current employment and income is needed for those who obtain their PR originally for work-related reasons, and some retired PRs may find themselves in a difficult position financially as retirees.

The State Courts see about 1,000 business-to-business debt claims each year. Approximately 75% of those claims, however, are eventually withdrawn, discontinued or have judgments entered in default. Based on the State Courts' experience, this is because such claims are frequently brought even though the debt is not disputed. Rather, the claims may be brought because there is poor documentation, wrong calculation of interest, or the debtor was simply seeking a breakdown of the debt or a repayment plan.

Sir, I want to say that I support the efforts of the Court to encourage parties to try to resolve disputes amicably before litigating the dispute. I am sure the Senior Minister of State is fully aware that most lawyers already issue demand letters with at least seven days' notice. In this case, the Protocol specifies a notice period of 28 days. May I ask the Senior Minister of State, how does the Court balance the interest of the creditors who themselves may be liquidity-strapped because they would need to give the debtors 28 days' notice? And how does the Court then balance the fact that some debtors do drag their feet and refuse to pay until they are sued in Court? So, how does the Court then consider the interest of creditors who are in that situation?",1,112,2020-02-03-T-011-S-00112

There are a variety of factors which come into play when the Court assess ultimately whether there should be cost sanctions against one or the other party, should there be non-compliance with the Protocol. So, if the creditor forms the assessment that this debtor has been dragging his feet, or is facing a series of claims which might cause the debtor to go into bankruptcy, thereby, triggering a series of other consequences, then, on those cases, the creditor may proceed, even without 28 days' notice.",1,113,2020-02-03-T-011-S-00113

Even as we assess the conduct of parties, it is to asses whether or not the action has been reasonable or otherwise. And in doing so, the Court will consider a series of circumstances, including those that I have outlined. That is how the Courts will then strike a balance between ensuring that the creditor has sufficient time to make known the nature of the claim, make known the details to support the claim so that the debtor can decide if he wants to enter into ADR, for instance, or maybe he decides to then seek upfront, the repayment plan from the creditor.",2,114,2020-02-03-T-011-S-00114

But as I had mentioned and I would like to go back to it, the 28 days is not written in stone.

2020-02-03-T-013,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry can review the policy concerning medical certificates issued by Ministry-approved TCM physicians and mandate its acceptance for medical leave claims across the board.,1,120,2020-02-03-T-013-S-00120
2020-02-03-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Speaker, under the Employment Act, all employers are required to grant paid outpatient sick leave to employees with medical certificates (MCs) issued by any medical practitioner registered under the Medical Registration Act (MRA). TCM practitioners can also be registered, if they fulfil the requirements of the MRA.",1,121,2020-02-03-T-013-S-00121
2020-02-03-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"This is already a wider recognition of MCs. Before April 2019, employers were only required to recognise MCs if they were issued by a Government or company-appointed medical practitioner.",2,122,2020-02-03-T-013-S-00122
2020-02-03-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),I should add that employers are free to go beyond the minimum provisions in the Employment Act and recognised TCM practitioners' MCs for the purposes of granting paid sick leave.,3,123,2020-02-03-T-013-S-00123
2020-02-03-T-013,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Sir, I have one supplementary question. I would like to ask the Minister how many TCM practitioners are registered with MRA? I have residents who told me that they go to TCM for treatment, but then because the MC is not recognised, so at the end, they just paid some money and got an MC from a clinic. They feel that they have to spend extra money and waste of time and waste of resources. So, I would like to ask how many of these TCM practitioners are registered with MRA, because Minister mentioned the MCs of only those registered with MRA are recognised.",1,124,2020-02-03-T-013-S-00124
2020-02-03-T-013,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I thank the Member for her supplementary question. From what she has asked, I gather her concern is really with regard to individuals, who are seeking to get the medical certificates because they feel unwell to work.",1,125,2020-02-03-T-013-S-00125
2020-02-03-T-013,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We have to take it in a broader context. There are more than 4,000 medical practitioners that are registered under the MRA. There should not be a concern that the individuals have no access to doctors who can issue valid MCs. People may consult TCM practitioners for any number of reasons, but the fact that the Employment Act requires MCs to be issued by an MRA-registered practitioner in order to be valid, has been known for quite a long time.",2,126,2020-02-03-T-013-S-00126
2020-02-03-T-013,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Employers are certainly free to do more than what the Employment Act requires, to recognise other medical certificates. But the practice adopted within the Employment Act is consistent with the Medical Registration Act. If I may quote to the Member, section 15 of the MRA states that ""no medical certificate or other document required by any written law to be signed by a duly qualified medical practitioner shall be valid unless signed by a person who is registered under the Act and has a valid practising certificate"".",3,127,2020-02-03-T-013-S-00127

2020-02-03-T-014,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, contrary to the Member’s concern, the workplace fatal injury rate was maintained at the historic low level achieved in 2018. However, preliminary data shows that the non-fatal major injury rate crept up slightly in 2019 when compared to 2018. More details will be released in the 2019 National WSH Statistics Report by end February 2020.",1,132,2020-02-03-T-014-S-00132

Sir, if you look at the Workplace Fatal Injury rate per 100,000 employees, we were at 4.9 in 2004, then down to 2.2 in 2010, and then 1.8 in 2014. And 2018, we had all time low off; 1.2, if you bring it down by 75%.",2,133,2020-02-03-T-014-S-00133
2020-02-03-T-014,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"And likewise, the major injury rate has also improved over last the five years at 20.0 in 2014 to 17.4 in 2018. So, we are seeing that overall, Singapore's workplace safety compares favourably with many developed countries. And our workplace fatality rate is the lowest in Asia, and is comparable to countries like Denmark and Finland. Improvements have also taken place against the backdrop of heavy reliance on foreign workers in sectors most prone to workplace fatalities such as the construction, marine and process industries. Much attention is put on helping newly arrived foreign workers to practise good Workplace, Safety and Health (WSH) habits.",3,134,2020-02-03-T-014-S-00134
2020-02-03-T-014,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"As outlined in our WSH 2028 roadmap, Singapore aims to achieve and sustain a workplace fatal injury rate of less than 1.0 per 100,000 workers by 2028. This is an ambitious goal reflecting our commitment to workers' safety. Amongst OECD member countries, only four have achieved this level of performance on a sustained basis.",4,135,2020-02-03-T-014-S-00135
2020-02-03-T-014,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"One key challenge in realising this aspiration is the risk of increasing ill-health among the workforce, including chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. If these are not well-managed, these conditions can contribute to work accidents. To reduce accidents in a sustainable manner, we will need more attention on supporting health, not just improving safety.",5,136,2020-02-03-T-014-S-00136
2020-02-03-T-014,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),Total WSH is part of our comprehensive approach to prevent and reduce accidents over longer term. Prevention of workplace injuries goes hand in hand with efforts to promote workforce health. This is so that fewer workers suffer from ill-health and even those with chronic diseases can continue to work safely and productively as long as they want.,6,137,2020-02-03-T-014-S-00137

2020-02-03-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, let me begin by saying this  the Government does not tolerate any form of workplace discrimination. In a 2018 survey commissioned by MOM, over 80% of job seekers did not feel that their gender, marital status, number of children, race, religion or nationality was an impediment in finding work. The majority of employees also felt that they were fairly treated in their organisation, in terms of their employment terms and benefits, training, career development and performance evaluation.",1,139,2020-02-03-T-015-S-00139

This is complemented by TAFEP's efforts to promote and advise employers on fair employment practices.,2,140,2020-02-03-T-015-S-00140
2020-02-03-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Rather than depend on perception surveys alone, MOM relies on other indicators too, for evidence of workplace discrimination. A good indicator is the number of complaints, which decreased from about 580 in 2015 to about 200 in 2018 and constitutes less than 1% of all complaints received. Discriminatory job advertisements have become rare and employment outcomes of groups such as women and older workers have also improved in the past decade. The employment rate of older residents aged 55 to 64 increased from 57% in 2009 to 68% in 2019, and that of female residents aged 25 to 64 increased from 64% to 73% over the same period. We have also seen that the adjusted gender pay gap has also narrowed over time, down from 8.8% in 2002 to 6.3% in 2018.",3,141,2020-02-03-T-015-S-00141

I believe the Minister of State mentioned that 80% of job seekers do not perceive any kind of discrimination. Just to clarify, was this a survey of both job seekers and those already in jobs? Did the survey cover both job seekers and those who are already in jobs about the perception of discriminatory HR practices? Or was it only job seekers? And if it covered both, was there any difference in the findings between those who are job seekers and those who are already in jobs about their perception of HR practices in their company?",1,142,2020-02-03-T-015-S-00142

MOM's survey or Fair Employment Practices are nationally representative and because they provide credible gauge of ground sentiment. So, we do this regularly, just to get ground-sensing. And the 2018 survey cover approximately 3,100 individuals and 3,400 establishments. As our surveys have shown, the majority of employers adopt Fair Employment Practices, but nonetheless, we recognise too that there will be minority of employers who deliberately circumvent employment principles and requirements.",1,144,2020-02-03-T-015-S-00144

The frequent feedback that I got from the Managing Council is that they are all laymen, not familiar, so they appoint the managing agent. So, they are asking whether will MND rank the managing agents because many of them also run into problems with their managing agents. Will MND rank the managing agents, that means categorise them?",1,165,2020-02-03-T-019-S-00165

So, the MAs' performance can be reviewed by the residents themselves and they can change the MA if they do not perform. So, technically, the measures are there. If the MAs are not performing, the residents can certainly take action. Because, ultimately, as the Member knows as well, you can rank an MA by company, but it is still down to the persons that they appoint, the persons that they hire to run every condo. You can rank an agency but it really depends on the team that they put in place. To ensure quality, we have got an Accredited Managing Agent scheme (AMA), which is administered by both the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (SISV), and the Association of Property and Facility Managers (APFM). So, the accreditation scheme exists, it is just that the details are important, that we pick the right managing agent and appoint them. For many MAs, you also have termination clauses if they are not performing too.",1,166,2020-02-03-T-019-S-00166

So, what MC is asking if MND can come up with certain qualifications, so that they can rank the MA accordingly, then at least it is a table of approved or accredited MAs for them to choose. The feedback is that a lot of the MCs told me that they are very disappointed with a lot of the MAs in the market. It is just, if I may put it in their language, in Hokkien ""tan jiak, tan jiak"", but then who suffer? Residents suffer, MC suffer.",1,168,2020-02-03-T-019-S-00168

Do refer to the scheme and maybe the MCs can work closer with the organisations – SISV as well as APFM who manage the scheme – to see how we can improve the accreditation scheme. But to get into ranking, the tricky part is, as I said, that it depends on the performance of the MA on the ground and, ultimately, it is down to procurement.",1,169,2020-02-03-T-019-S-00169
2020-02-03-T-019,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"In terms of procurement, you have the option of terminating if they do not meet certain KPIs. It is important to set the expectations upfront before you procure the services, and set what are the requirements, what are the specifications, that the MAs need to fulfil. The challenge is, again, ranking may work at firm level but it does not necessarily work on the ground. That is always a challenge but, really, if the condos would like to have some sense of which ones are accredited, perhaps if the AMA scheme is not well-known, then we can certainly work to keep condos more aware of what are the accredited MAs out there.",2,170,2020-02-03-T-019-S-00170

2020-02-03-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Mr Speaker, Singapore’s air quality was not affected by the recent fires in Australia as winds over Singapore were not blown from the Australian region. From November 2019 to January 2020, when the fires took place, air quality in Singapore was mostly in the ""Good"" and ""Moderate"" range. This level of air quality is comparable to the same period in previous years.",1,190,2020-02-03-T-022-S-00190
2020-02-03-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Similarly, Singapore’s food security has not been affected by the fires in Australia. Australia is an important source of commonly consumed food items for Singapore, such as meat, milk and sugar. While many parts of Australia experienced the fires, our food supply from Australia remained steady between November 2019 and January 2020.",2,191,2020-02-03-T-022-S-00191

Hence, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has been working with food importers to diversify sources across different countries and to adopt plans to mitigate against supply disruptions. Apart from this, we are encouraging Singapore companies to build food production linkages with other countries under our ""Grow Overseas"" strategy. We are also intensifying efforts to boost domestic food production under our ""30 by 30"" vision, to locally produce 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs by 2030.",3,192,2020-02-03-T-022-S-00192

2020-02-03-T-022,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I thank the Minister for his answer. Just two short supplementary questions. First, we hope that it does not happen in Australia, the bushfires, but if it continues to occur in future, is it conceivable that this could come to Singapore	– meaning that the winds change direction	– and is it conceivable for fires in Australia to reach Singapore, and in such an instance, what preparations do we need to make?",1,194,2020-02-03-T-022-S-00194
2020-02-03-T-022,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"My second supplementary question concerns food security. Again, I hear our vision of ""30 by 30"". My question is  given what is happening around the world, how are we on track to achieve it, and is there a need for this ""30 by 30"" vision to be, in fact, accelerated?",2,195,2020-02-03-T-022-S-00195
2020-02-03-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We have never had a situation where the fires in Australia would actually affect Singapore. We know where the fires, when they burn, affect us almost annually.

2020-02-03-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On food security  indeed, this is going to be one of the main topics of our Ministry's Committee of Supply (COS). To get Singaporeans to understand that beyond diversifying our food supplies, we really have to be serious about looking at growing the food ourselves. Because when we have a situation 20, 30, 40 years down the line, when everywhere in the world, food growing will be a challenge, we probably have to be prepared to know how to grow food now, to grow in ways that we do not normally or conventionally do. Because in Singapore, we are very constrained by water, by land, even by energy. So, these are the constraints that Singapore has to overcome but I am very confident that with technology and perseverance, we will get to the target of ""30 by 30"" that we set ourselves to achieve.",2,197,2020-02-03-T-022-S-00197

This makes up about 15% of the total number of tickets issued for smoking in prohibited places during that period. I urge smokers to be mindful of the health of others and not light up in smoking-prohibited places. Families and friends, and even members of the public, can help remind smokers to reinforce the right social norms.",1,199,2020-02-03-T-023-S-00199
2020-02-03-T-023,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"Over the same period, NEA took more than 2,200 enforcement actions against high-rise littering from HDB flats involving cigarette litter. This makes up about 76% of the total enforcement actions taken for high-rise littering during that period. High-rise littering is an anti-social act which affects safety as well as environmental hygiene.

2020-02-03-T-023,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for her replies. I just have two short supplementary questions. The first is regarding enforcement of smoking in common corridors and also in stairwells. I note the efforts of the NEA, but I still receive a lot of feedback from residents about recalcitrant smoking in stairwells and common corridors, which is probably a bit difficult to enforce, particularly at odd hours of the day or even at night. I was wondering whether there were any efforts to improve enforcement in these areas, perhaps use cameras that are already in some of the corridors put in by the Singapore Police Force.",1,201,2020-02-03-T-023-S-00201
2020-02-03-T-023,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The second supplementary question, I know is a common question. We still have much feedback about second-hand smoke coming from the smokers' own residences. And I know that the Senior Minister of State has replied on this but I was wondering if there was any update on any measures that we can take to mitigate this problem as well.",2,202,2020-02-03-T-023-S-00202
2020-02-03-T-023,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I am pleased to say that for the first question, at least I have an update. As the Member knows, we cannot constantly monitor all the 32,000-odd smoking-prohibited places or respond immediately to every feedback, especially given the fleeting nature of the act. So, to reinforce the no-smoking regulations, NEA has started deploying thermal cameras in public residential areas, particularly the common corridors, the lift lobbies, the stairwells, where there is persistent feedback on smoking issues. This is to enhance surveillance to curb unlawful smoking. The cameras are able to capture images of the smoking infringement as well as the date and time, and this allows NEA to follow up with investigations.",1,203,2020-02-03-T-023-S-00203

2020-02-03-T-023,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As regard the second question, I am afraid I do not have any updates on this. But let me say that smoking is already prohibited in many, many places. I said 32,000-odd places, and actually, there are very few areas where our smokers can smoke now. And we are mindful about enacting laws that are too intrusive. And, in fact, while as many have given us feedback – why do you not enact laws to prohibit smoking within their own homes, there are also many who tell us that they do not believe that the Government should intrude into one's private space.",3,205,2020-02-03-T-023-S-00205
2020-02-03-T-023,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, we continue to encourage our smokers to be civic-minded and in the spirit of building a socially gracious and civic-minded society, I think we should all try to resolve this amicably, as far as possible.",4,206,2020-02-03-T-023-S-00206

2020-02-03-T-023,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"In fact, I have just given feedback to NEA over the last few weeks. It looks like smoking in staircase is very, very common, and I received a lot of complaints. Lately, there is this resident who keeps saying that the smoke goes into her flat and she has young children. So, I have been talking to NEA, in fact, just last week. What is the solution? Are we going to have a national campaign about smoking at the staircase affecting the health of residents?",2,208,2020-02-03-T-023-S-00208

With regard to thermal cameras, we outsource it to a third party to provide this service. So, where there is persistent feedback on smoking issues in common corridors, lift lobbies and stairwells, we can look into the feasibility of providing such thermal cameras.

What this means is that the virus is carried within droplets emitted from an infected person over a short distance, such as when the person coughs or sneezes. If these droplets come into contact with the eyes, nose or mouth of an individual, directly or indirectly through hands that have come into contact with these droplets, the individual may become infected.",16,228,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00228

2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"The novel coronavirus could also transmit through surface contact. Let me explain. When a person sneezes or coughs, the droplets fall onto the surfaces of tables and chairs, for example, and the virus may remain alive for up to a few days. When someone else touches the surfaces of these tables and chairs, the virus can be transferred to his hand and if he then rubs his eyes or nose without washing his hands, he may become infected. So, we should wash our hands. This is also why we only quarantine the close contacts of confirmed cases. For more transient contacts, such as individuals that the confirmed cases may have walked past in malls or hotels, the risk of transmission is low.",18,230,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00230
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"For coronaviruses generally, the person is most infectious when he is displaying symptoms or what you call symptomatic, and this is likely to be the case for the novel coronavirus as well. There is evidence of limited spread from a person without symptoms during the incubation period. However, this form of transmission may be uncommon and has so far involved isolated cases only. At this point, the evidence still points towards higher transmissibility when the person is displaying symptoms.",19,231,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00231
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"As such, medical professionals both overseas and in Singapore have advised that the most effective way that we can protect ourselves is to practise good personal hygiene. We should regularly wash our hands with soap and water, and avoid touching our face with our hands.",20,232,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00232
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"These may sound simple, but are actually very difficult to do because all of us touch our face all the time. Even in a meeting that we had with the Multi-Ministry Taskforce while I was speaking I was touching my face until Minister Lawrence Wong nudged me with his elbow and said, ""Stop touching your face"". So, it is simple but effective in preventing all kinds of infection. Potential infection from asymptomatic persons in fact is less likely to be from coughing or sneezing directly because they do not have symptoms such as sneezing or coughing, but more likely by touching contaminated surfaces, for which masks offer no protection. Wearing a mask when we are well often give us a false sense of security instead and we are more likely to touch our faces when we constantly adjust our masks, which is one way the disease spreads.",21,233,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00233
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"At the same time, we need to protect others – our loved ones, friends, colleagues and fellow Singaporeans that we come into contact with. If we are sick, we should rest and recover at home as far as possible. If we do need to go out to see a doctor, for example, we should wear a surgical mask to protect others. So, this is when a mask is needed – when we are unwell and have to go out.",22,234,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00234
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Persons exposed to the virus may be well for a few days before developing symptoms such as fever or cough.

Our healthcare providers, especially our polyclinics and general practitioners are right at the front line. They are on heightened alert and stand ready to deal with cases as they emerge.

We will arrange for them to go to hospitals via a dedicated ambulance for isolation and testing. For contacts that are well, we adopt a risk-based approach. For close contacts, they will be put under quarantine for 14 days since their last contact with the confirmed case.

She was a veteran from SARS, and an Infection Control Nurse. Dr Soon immediately rose to the occasion when we activated NCID. She led her team to prepare the isolation rooms, held townhalls to update the NCID nurses and ensured that her nurses had adequate essential supplies, such as protective gowns and masks. Throughout this period, she was out of the house before sunrise and mostly back only after her family had gone to asleep. She had to cancel a family trip during the Chinese New Year period, but her family understood and was supportive. This included her daughter, whom she was pregnant with during SARS. Stories of such dedication like Dr Soon's abound in our healthcare community.",43,255,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00255

2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Secondly, there could be community spread locally. Despite our best efforts, this is a possibility that we must be ready for. The key to managing this is quick detection and limiting further spread, which calls on social responsibility from all of us. If the infected Singaporean wears a mask to protect others, and promptly sees a doctor and gets triaged for testing, the risk of further spread can be greatly reduced. Even if there is spread, quick action will help to limit its extent. Once tested positive, the Government will contact trace quickly, helping to reduce further spread to their close contacts. If the community spread becomes very extensive, we will need to consider measures to reduce human-to-human interactions, such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, paring down non-essential care services and introducing further infection control and monitoring measures, to slow the spread.",50,262,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00262

We also look ahead to anticipate as best as we can how the situation will evolve and prepare for the possibility that things can worsen. That is why over the past week alone, we have had to adjust and update our measures several times. We owe it to every Singaporean to do our very best to protect all of us from the virus.

2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Infectious diseases do not respect borders. The world is more connected than before, with more people flying around and travelling than ever. And we have to be extra vigilant on this front because Singapore is an international travel hub, with more than 68 million people using our airport last year. So, a virus that comes through our airport will not only impact Singapore, but it can also easily spread through us to other countries in the region. That is why we have to be extra vigilant.",5,276,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00276
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"To protect against such an infectious disease outbreak when it happens outside of Singapore, we have a series of drawer plans and measures at the border. They range from the screening of in-bound travellers, to placing high-risk travellers into quarantine, as well as restricting travel for those who have recently been at high risk countries. And then, depending on the nature of the outbreak, we will assess the risks and put in place the appropriate measures.",6,277,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00277
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"This is the approach the Taskforce has taken in dealing with this virus. We first implemented temperature screening at Changi Airport for flights from Wuhan. And then, we expanded the screening to all flights from China, and also to our land and sea checkpoints. As an additional precaution, and because not all who are infected will show symptoms, we deployed healthcare teams at the aerobridge for all incoming flights from China to identify and pull aside passengers who look unwell.",7,278,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00278
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"At the same time, it helped that China had moved swiftly to impose restrictions on its own outbound travellers. It cancelled outbound tour groups. All of these measures helped to reduce the flow of people from China to Singapore. Typically, there will be about 14,000 PRC travellers flying in from China to Singapore every day. After the Chinese imposed outbound restrictions on 23 January, this number came down sharply by more than 80%, just through the Chinese measures alone.",8,279,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00279
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Despite these measures, we recognised that there was still a flow of travellers coming in from China on a regular basis. We monitored this flow carefully and considered what additional actions were needed based on the evidence and risks. Early last week, when we saw the sharply accelerating trend of infection among the population of Chinese nationals from Hubei province, we knew we had to move. And that is why on 28 January, we decided to disallow all new visitors with recent travel history in Hubei.",9,280,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00280
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But shortly after that, the situation changed again. While the majority of confirmed cases in China were still linked to Hubei province, it was evident that the virus had spread to every region of mainland China and there was a high risk of widespread community transmission in other parts of China. And so, on 31 January, last Friday, we decided to take the additional precaution of disallowing all new visitors with recent travel history in the rest of mainland China.",10,281,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00281
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"As part of these travel restrictions, ICA is no longer issuing new visas to those with PRC passports and suspending all such visas. That is because the vast majority of such travellers coming in for short visits would have been in China recently. But if there are PRC passport holders who have not been in China in the past 14 days, then ICA will be prepared to issue them a short-term visitor pass or to extend their short-term pass.",11,282,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00282
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"And that is why I had emphasised earlier that the travel restrictions are not tied to nationality, but are meant to restrict all travellers with recent travel history in China.

That is our first line of defence at the border.",12,283,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00283
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Beyond border controls, our second line of defence is to identify and isolate the people with the virus, as well as all of the close contacts of the infected persons.

2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"As of last night, there are 524 persons under quarantine. Two hundred and twenty-two are in Government Quarantine Facilities (GQF), and 302 are serving quarantine at home. Persons under Quarantine are required to stay in their designated location at all times during the quarantine period. They cannot physically interact with others living in the same premise.",16,287,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00287
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"For each case, we will assess whether to quarantine the person at the GQF or to do so at the person’s home. In cases where the home is found to be suitable by MOH, then home quarantine would apply and we would use video calls, phone calls and regular spot checks to ensure that they remain in their assigned quarantined location. These are protocols that we have all worked out through SARs and fine-tuned over the years, as I mentioned. Persons who do not have a suitable residence for quarantine would then be housed in GQF and there are severe penalties for non-compliance of the Quarantine Order, including fines or jail.",17,288,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00288

Our assessment is that they are of lower risk compared to those who were recently in Hubei. So, for all such returning residents and long-term pass holders, we ask them to take a 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA) from the date of their return. This is one way to reduce their exposure when they are back and thus reduce the risk of community spread in Singapore.",18,289,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00289

They also need to minimise time spent in public places and contact with others, monitor their health and temperature daily, and avoid crowded places or social gatherings. We have put out guidelines on what an LOA means just to ensure that anyone who is on LOA knows what they are expected to do. They may resume normal duties or activities only after they have served their LOA, if they remain well.",19,290,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00290

Singaporeans must also do their part to cooperate. Some residents, upon learning that there is a person under home quarantine or LOA in the same apartment block, have asked that this person be moved elsewhere. We have also heard feedback of landlords stigmatising tenants based on their nationality, or worse, evicting PRC tenants who are taking their LOA.",20,291,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00291

The outcome would be completely counter-productive.

And that is why firstly, we slowed the supply of masks to retailers and prioritised the masks for essential services, namely our frontline healthcare workers. Secondly, for the general public, we decided to release masks directly from the stockpile to households, so that every family will have access to a mask should someone in the family fall sick and need to use one to see a doctor.",33,304,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00304

We mobilised the SAF and People's Association for this task and they all did a sterling job. Within a very short turnaround time, the SAF had completed the packing of over five million masks and delivered them to our collection points. Our PA staff and grassroots organisations then took over to set up collection centres at CCs and RC centres, and to man the collection counters. Even GovTech chipped in and came up with a ""maskgowhere"" website, where you can just key in your postal code to get information on where and when to collect the masks. The collection of masks started on 1 of February, on Saturday, and to-date more than 200,000 packs, or 15% of the total, have been collected. I would like to record my thanks to the SAF, to the People's Association and all who have been involved in the smooth and speedy execution of this on-going exercise.",34,305,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00305

Besides these specific sectors, we recognise that there will be knock-on impacts on related industries in the event of a broad-based slowdown.

2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I cited some examples of irresponsible behaviours earlier by landlords chasing out tenants on LOAs. Unfortunately, there are other examples, too – people hoarding and profiteering from the sale of masks; people spreading falsehoods online. Recently, a WhatsApp message has been going around with a list of places to avoid, completely ignoring the fact that any place exposed to a confirmed case will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, under supervision by NEA. But, still, a list of places to avoid is spread and that creates fear and a perception that people should avoid these places. Anti-PRC sentiment has also emerged amongst some groups. Online, you can see posts directed against PRC nationals. On the ground, you hear reports of discrimination against PRC nationals, whether it is landlords denying them their tenancy or service providers denying them service. Such actions are not helpful and they have no place in our society. We are bigger than this in Singapore and I hope all of us here in this House, regardless of political party, and every Singaporean will stand together and we will all do our part to confront and condemn such prejudice and discrimination wherever they exist.",40,311,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00311

They are not representative of the vast majority of Singaporeans. There are many more out there who have been showing us the best of Singapore at work. They are quietly helping their fellow citizens in their own ways. For example, at a recent house visit, I met a resident and asked if he had collected his masks and he replied that he did not need them and asked for his package of masks to be given to others who are in greater need of them. I am sure many Members here would have encountered similar residents giving such feedback.

2020-02-03-T-024,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"First, could the Task Force update us on how many Singaporeans remain in China?

2020-02-03-T-024,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"My second question relates to the state of the economy. While Mr Lawrence Wong has indicated that the Deputy Prime Minister will announce a slew of measures in the Budget Statement, however, can the Government provide an update at the moment of the scale of the impact on our economy so far and also the possible total impact for the coming financial year? And if the situation worsens, what can SMEs do, especially businesses which are affected at the moment by supply from China as well as their workers still being in China? What can they do in the short term?",3,320,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00320

Our Beijing Mission is in touch with them. So, in the last exercise, there were about 90-plus Singaporeans and four of them were unable to come back because they had already shown symptoms  one was hospitalised and three of them had shown symptoms and they were deemed not fit to fly. So, 92 came back. That was in the last exercise. The vast majority of this group had come back.",1,321,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00321

I think we are only seeing the initial brunt of it now because, with the viral situation continuing to grow, with the travel restrictions and the situation continuing to escalate, I am sure the impact will not only be for the sectors that are directly impacted, like trade, transport and tourism, but there will be knock-on impacts. China's own economy will slow down and the global economy will slow down. So, there will be an overall impact on the economy. That is why I said we are studying this very carefully to develop a series of measures and a strong package in the Budget to help companies and workers. In the interim, wherever we can, we will develop and quickly roll out initiatives to help firms without having to wait for the Budget. STB has already put up one set of initiatives and we are in the midst of studying if more can be done.",4,324,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00324
2020-02-03-T-024,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar),"Mr Speaker, I would like to pose two questions to the Minister for Health. First  what would his comments be for those employees who seek certification on being free from the novel coronavirus in order to go back to work? Second  is there a shortage of ambulance services right now because, lately, GPs have had to wait many hours for such services for emergency and novel corona suspected cases?",1,325,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00325
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,I would like to thank Dr Lily Neo for her two very useful questions. I can expect her to raise very important questions like these.,1,326,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00326
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"First, on the certificate for coronavirus-free individuals. Actually, there is no such thing as a coronavirus-free certification. The reason is because we test the patient based on his viral load and there is an incubation period during which the patient may have very low or zero viral load. But at the same time, because it is the incubation period, the virus may emerge later on. Therefore, at any point in time, when we test a person, when it is negative, it does not mean that he is virus-free. He may be virus-free at that moment, but he may already have been infected but is within the incubation period. So, it is not possible for our hospital or for any screening centre to give a certificate that this person is virus-free. We can only say that, for this moment in time, the test shows no virus detectable in his bloodstream. But the virus can emerge the following hour or the following day. Therefore, it is not possible to give a free-from-disease certificate, as what Dr Lily Neo was alluding to.",2,327,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00327
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I would also like to take this opportunity to urge employers not to send their workers to our hospitals for testing in order to certify their workers as virus-free. As I have explained, first, it is not possible for such certification to be issued; second, you are simply loading our hospitals unnecessarily. So, the best way to do it is to monitor yourself if you have been exposed to contacts, or, if you have come back from China, monitor your own health for 14 days. This is the incubation period. If there are any symptoms, wear a mask as you go to see a doctor and tell the doctor your travel history, that you have been to Wuhan or you have been to China, so that all these factors can be taken into account when we assess the patient. But please do not go to the hospital to ask for blood tests in order to get a certificate that you are free from coronavirus. It is just not possible for such certificates to be issued and you will just load the hospital unnecessarily.",3,328,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00328
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Secondly, Dr Neo asked about ambulance services. We have ramped up our ambulance services in order to respond to this outbreak situation. And these ambulances are used to convey those who are suspected cases because we want to make sure that they are protected and isolated while we are transporting them to hospital for testing. In the initial first few days, there were some organisational difficulties among the service operators. We have sat down and discussed with them and the logistics are managed better now. Sometimes, when there is a peak, it may take a while, few minutes, an hour, but we try to respond as soon as possible. We have also set up a hotline for the doctors to call. This is operated by our College of Family Physicians that we help to answer queries, whether it is ambulance or any other thing. So, we do recognise that, in the initial days, we do have some logistics difficulties in organising our ambulance responses. And every time we change our case definition, it is also quite natural that it will suddenly have a larger number of suspected cases because, when you change the definition, the definition will include a bigger catchment and, therefore, we will need to adjust our logistics support accordingly.",4,329,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00329

Are there any specific or additional measures in schools, particularly for pre-schoolers and Primary school children who may not always be aware or practise proper personal hygiene as we try to educate Singaporeans in this? And will there be a postponement or review of overseas school tours or trips seeing that there are other similar virus outbreaks beyond the 2019 novel coronavirus, for example, the avian flu or H5N1 virus outbreak in Hunan, China as well as in Chhattisgarh, India?",1,335,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00335

On the manpower requirements, yes, in fact there is a heightened need for manpower because of the intensity that we are going through – testing of the cases, quarantining them and managing them; and the management is quite intensive as you can imagine. We also need to look after the suspect cases to detect signs of infection when they occur. We require a lot of manpower and the rest of healthcare needs need to continue to be met.",1,336,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00336
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Therefore, we have been working with our clusters to ensure that there is sufficient manpower and to make sure that their schedules are also properly looked at. I reminded the group CEOs just recently that we need to plan for the long term. It is not dash to the end point because we need to be prepared that this may take months. Therefore, whatever duty schedules, rosters and so on have to be planned on a sustainable basis to ensure there is sufficient turnaround and sufficient rest given to our doctors, healthcare workers so that they are able to sustain in the long term. So, these are part of our plans. We do have contingency plans in place to ensure that we have sufficient manpower to cater to situations like these.",2,337,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00337
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In terms of volunteer manpower, yes, this is also part of the plan for our clusters, our hospitals to call back some of the volunteers. Some of those who are on leave also volunteered to come back and have said, ""Why not I come back and help to supplement the manpower"". So, I think, all these are in place and as we go along we will continue to augment our manpower resources.",3,338,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00338
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"But at the same time, part of the plan is to see how we can re-organise ourselves into an emergency crisis mode, an outbreak mode, so that we can operate differently. Some of the medical care that is non-urgent, some of the elective procedures, for example, may need to be postponed. We may manage them in a different way so as to lighten the load on our core medical manpower.",4,339,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00339

They have developed a package, a syllabus, to teach students about what the viruses are, how they are transmitted and what we can do about it to prevent transmission. The lessons covered are what both Minister Gan and Minister Wong have described just now, on how it transmits. Therefore, two things you need to do, which is that you need to wash your hands with soap and not touch your face. You just touch your face, Dr Intan. [",1,344,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00344

Indeed, fear is a greater threat to us in such a time as this. There are residents currently living near the Government quarantine facilities. And they have expressed concerns about being near the folks who are asked to stay in these centres. If things should get worse, there could be more quarantine facilities. Can I seek Minister's views and assurance that the residents need not be fearful of any spread from these centres, even as we all believe that we are all in this together?

Currently, most of the masks found in the marketplace and distributed are adult sized. There are parents and staff in schools who are concerned that should there be a need, is there a supply of masks of smaller sizes. Because some of the masks are so big, they cover the whole face of the children. I would like to seek Minister's views on that.",2,351,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00351
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I will ask Minister Lawrence Wong to answer the question on the quarantine facilities. On the masks, it is a more general question for children's masks. As we mentioned or explained multiple times, the mask is to protect the person not wearing the mask. So, the mask is prevent the cough and sneezes from the person who is sick. So, for that purpose, for younger children the mask can be used because it is just preventing them from spitting out their sputums or their sneezes, to prevent the droplets from going out. With some adjustments, the masks can be used for younger children. And if they really cannot be used, then what you should do is to use a handkerchief or whatever to cover the mouth to prevent it from spitting out and to observe hygiene  if you do that, please wash your hands.",1,352,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00352

2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I can confirm to Ms Denise Phua's question that there is no need to fear having a Government quarantine facility nearby or even having somebody within the same apartment block subject to home quarantine. Firstly, we have to be mindful that anyone who is in quarantine is not an infected person. They are not. They have been exposed so they are of some risk. Yes, they have been subject to some exposure perhaps through close contacts, perhaps they have been back home from China recently, particularly in Hubei, so we want them to be quarantined just to be safe. But we should not assume automatically that anyone in quarantine is infected. They are not.",1,356,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00356
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Number two, when they are in quarantine, there are strict protocols and procedures to ensure that they stick and they remain within the place of quarantine. I mentioned a few things that we do – phone calls, video calls, spot checks, a whole range of things for home quarantine. In the quarantine facilities, there are also strict parameters. These people will be within the location where they are quarantined. They will not be able to wonder about so easily.",2,357,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00357

I do not know if I have touched objects or places around me or contaminated, and if I touch them I might get sick. So, thirdly, whenever there is a confirmed case, there is a thorough cleaning and disinfection process to make sure the place is entirely cleaned and disinfected; and NEA supervises that.",3,358,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00358

In fact, this is critical because if the situation were to escalate, as Minister Gan said, we have to be prepared for things to get worse. We have to be prepared for more cases in Singapore even for community spread. If that to happen, we do need quarantine facilities and Singaporeans all have to cooperate and we seek their understanding that this is an essential part of ensuring that we can get through situation together.",4,359,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00359

My clarification is for Minister Lawrence Wong, on whether he can elaborate on what Singaporeans who are returning from China through Changi Airport can expect. The reason I am asking this is I have a resident who came back from Wuhan but through another airport and he is currently under home quarantine with his family. He told me that it was a very stressful experience for him and his family at the airport because he and his family with young children were basically kept in a locked room for about four hours waiting for vehicles to arrive to bring them back and so on. I wonder if the Minister could elaborate about what Singaporeans coming back through the airport, through the Chinese routes can expect, whether the processing time of four hours for example is normal or has it been more streamlined? And whether passengers coming from Hubei and other airports are treated differently?",1,361,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00361
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, anyone coming back from Hubei, Wuhan, basically Hubei province would be deemed to be of higher risk. And therefore anyone coming back, we would want them to be isolated and quarantined. There are these processes in place. Can we improve them, can we make the waiting time shorter? I am sure the agencies are going all out to see how it can be streamlined and improved, but we hope Singaporeans and travellers in this category would understand. First of all, for new arrivals we have already stopped the flow. But Singaporeans, PRs and long-term pass holders can still come back. And if you are coming back from Hubei, you are of a higher risk and we will want you to be isolated and quarantined.

For employees who have Leave of Absence in which employers pay for them when they are on leave but for the self-employed there is this element whereby if I am at home for 14 days I do not have the income. That may be some concern to the self-employed. So, perhaps we can consider some calibrated support for this group of self-employed individuals who may be on leave of absence. They will self-quarantine themselves at home but let us see how we can help them tide through this period.",1,364,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00364

There will be news of possible discoveries because scientists are working overtime to make sure to put in efforts to discover ways to contain the virus and treat the virus and also to prevent the virus through vaccines. So, I think vaccines and curative treatment are being looked into. But I think it will take time to develop the method and to also test the treatment to make sure that they are effective and safe for patients. So, I think it is not going to happen overnight. It may take quite a while before we see a curative treatment being determined.

It can have repercussions on our whole containment efforts and can be ultimately harmful to all of us. So, for specific actions, we will look at them and we will engage the landlord and we will see if tougher action needs to be taken.

2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, given the way the virus is spreading and the way the situation is unravelling, I think I believe China understands why some of these restrictions are needed. China itself has restricted its own people from travelling outside of China precisely because they do not want to spread this virus to other countries. So, they too, see the need and recognise the need for travel restrictions on its own people and to contain the virus in China. So, what we and many other countries that have put in place similar restrictions are doing, are really complementary to China's own actions. It is in all of our interest, be it China, Singapore or any other country.

2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The second question is  what are the protocols involved in a community spread. It depends on the different types of community spread. The first possibility is a very limited community spread, meaning it could spread from person A to person B, and then person B passes it on to person C. So, person C has no direct relationship to person A. And therefore, it is a secondary transmission. It is also a form of community transmission but this transmission is likely to then be quite limited to one or two generations. If we are able to react quickly, able to contain patient C and patient B, then we will be able to contain the spread. For example, if patient C is a contact of patient B, and we are able to trace patient C once we identified patient B, even it has been transmitted to patient C, then we are still able to say that patient C is probably contained. And therefore, the likelihood of a wide spread community transmission is less likely.",5,388,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00388
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"But there is a also a scenario which I mentioned in my speech, where there is widespread community transmission, meaning there will be multiple clusters of infection where there is no clear links to any source of infection. And therefore, you would then assess that it may be transmitting from one person to another quite directly and there is no way for us to have contact tracing for them because they have many, many contacts.",6,389,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00389
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In such a situation, you may then need to assess what is the landscape at that time, what are the risks that are involved. As I mentioned in my speech, we may have to begin to look at how we can reduce or restrict human-to-human interaction. One example is to cancel or terminate all the major gatherings where you have thousands and thousands of people, as well as to minimise the risks of transmission. There is also the possibility that we may suspend some schools or all schools, depending on the situation so as to minimise the interaction of children at schools as well as the parent interaction. These are all possibilities. But exactly which steps we are going to introduce will depend on the exact nature of the community spread.",7,390,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00390

2020-02-03-T-024,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The first one is, there is, of course, a Price Control Act (PCA) and there were reports of traders of masks who were profiteering, charging very high prices. I understand that the Price Controller has written to some of them. And, of course, as economists all know, using price controls has its downside and its risks. You can create ""black markets"" and so on. But for exceptional and crisis situations like this, is deploying the PCA to actually put price controls in place, using this legislation, something that the Government will consider, in future, just for limited periods of time?",2,394,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00394

There has been some discussion around around this. There could be some advantages to mailing out masks in terms of not encouraging people to cluster together and so on. I believe that there was an exercise in 2014 when some organisations mailed out N95 masks during the haze period. So, there is a precedent there. I just wanted to understand the thinking a bit more and whether mailing out of masks is something that might be done in future, if such cases arise.",3,395,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00395
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, as the Member would have read from the media reports, the Price Controller has indeed already a letter of demand (LOD) to one platform provider requesting for more information in order to assess the need for further action under the Price Control Act. Letters of demand (LODs) have also been sent to other e-commerce platforms like Lazada and Carousell to request information on any potential profiteers on their platform. So, we will not rule out any option at this stage.",1,396,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00396
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Price Controller is pursuing, investigating, getting more information and, if need be, more actions can be taken.",2,397,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00397
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But, as of now, I would say, looking at the prices, some of these platform providers have cooperated. I heard recently that some of them have even removed some of these listings with very exorbitant prices. So, anyway, the Price Controller is on top of this. It is following up on the matter and it will consider actions that need to be taken against profiteering.",3,398,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00398
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second supplementary question, we had deliberated over this and we felt that if you were to distribute masks via post, there may well be wastage because some households will not need the masks. Like I have mentioned earlier, even in the collection exercise, when we go around and residents come to us, they say, ""Actually, please, I do not need the masks. I am not going to collect it. You save it, either for your stockplile or you give it to someone else."" So, in that sense, a collection exercise would be a more prudent way of distributing masks.",4,399,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00399
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And to address the concern of people gathering together, we had decentralised the distribution points to void decks, RC centres. It is proceeding in a very orderly fashion. If you go to any of these collection centres now, there are no queues. There are designated times to pick up the masks so there is no large crowds at all in any of them. People are just picking up as and when they are free during the designated times. So, based on the exercise that we have done so far, I would say this distribution method is more effective.",5,400,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00400

2020-02-03-T-024,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker, my question is for Minister Gan Kim Yong. He mentioned that if there is widespread community spread, we may have to close the schools and I suppose even the pre-schools. But there are actually families where both parents are working and it is very difficult for them to take time-off to look after the kids and we do not know how long this will last. So, when we announce any school closure, will we also announce what are the alternatives that will be available to these parents?",1,402,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00402
2020-02-03-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I think Minister Gan is doing the right thing to paint future scenarios that are possible that we should be prepared for, so it is not as if we are going to do it straightaway, but I think it is something we have to consider, to prepare plans taking into account the considerations that Mr Yee Chia Hsing has mentioned.",1,403,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00403
2020-02-03-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Bear in mind that when SARS was at its height, we did suspend schools for a couple of weeks. If it comes to that, if we have do it, we have to do it. But I think we have to look at the data, look at the evidence, look at the situation and take into account all considerations before making any decisions.",2,404,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00404
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Speaker, maybe I can just supplement what Minister Ong just said. I think the question from Mr Yee highlights an important point, that for every measure that we contemplate about introducing, there will always be an impact on the society. And therefore, we have to evaluate and assess every measure very carefully, taking into account the impact on society, as I have mentioned in my speech. None of the decisions or measures are easy. We are always weighing the pros and cons, and eventually, we have to decide what makes sense for us.",1,405,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00405
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"So, I would assure Mr Yee that when we make a decision, whether it is school suspension or any other decision, we will always take into account the impact on individuals, on the society, on different groups of people. We want to make sure that for those who are affected, we do our best to help them address their concerns and their problems.",2,406,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00406

2020-02-03-T-024,Irene Quay Siew Ching,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching (Nominated Member),"I thank the Ministers. My question is  in the event if we need to step up to using N95 masks because there is wide community spread or for future viral outbreaks, how do you ensure that the public are fitted with the right model of N95 masks? Because what is being done in the healthcare institutions is we actually go for mask fitting test to ensure that there is optimal protection, because different models fit different face shapes and the public may not be aware of this.",1,408,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00408
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I thank the Member. I think it is an important question. Maybe I should explain that in the event of widespread community transmission, wearing N95 masks is probably not the solution. N95 masks are generally used by the healthcare professionals. We have used it for the haze. In fact, we have kept telling people that you do not need the mask for the haze. Anyway, people still wear them for the haze. Therefore, as Ms Irene Quay has mentioned, if you do not fit it properly, the mask really does not protect you. In fact, we are most likely going to introduce social distancing, as I mentioned, manage the crowd gathering, minimising human-to-human interaction, rather than to introduce the N95 mask for general use.",1,409,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00409
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"If need be, we will carry out the necessary education, to reach out to Singaporeans to explain to them how to protect themselves. I think to teach each of them how to wear the N95 mask to be as effective as in the healthcare environment is going to be quite difficult and you may end up giving them a false sense of security. And as a result, you may end up with more infections, which is counter-productive. I would say that the N95 mask is not going to be the main focus for outbreak control, if there is extensive community transmission.",2,410,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00410

2020-02-03-T-024,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"I have a question for Minister Gan. I read with concern the reports of infection of healthcare workers in China today. During SARS, we too had doctors and nurses working with infected patients, getting infected themselves. So, I think in today's context, can the Minister share  what measures are taken today to better protect our healthcare workers, especially those in the frontline taking care of the patients who are infected?",1,412,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00412
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Healthcare workers are one of our most important resources in a disease outbreak like this, and they are right at the frontline, they are facing the disease and the patients every day, every hour, and therefore we need to make sure that they have adequate protection.",1,413,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00413
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Despite the best protection, in some cases, healthcare workers are infected. In cases like in China, for example, and very often, this happens at the initial stage of the outbreak because healthcare workers are unfamiliar with the virus, they may not understand that it is infectious or it is as infectious as we are seeing, so therefore the precautions may not be adequate. As time progresses, when we get to know the virus better, I think the protection measures will be enhanced.",2,414,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00414
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For us in Singapore, we have stepped up our protective measures and I think, particularly because we have gone through the experience of SARS and several other disease outbreaks.

There is also a second person monitoring how you do it to make sure that you follow every step carefully. Once you miss a step and are exposed, you will have to be quarantined to make sure that you are not infected.",4,416,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00416

Our frontline workers, those who are in the Emergency Department, our General Practitioners (GPs), they are also very alert to the potential risks.

If they have potential risk of contamination, they will put them aside, give them a mask to wear so that they do not contaminate others.",5,417,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00417

Seventeen years later, I am still involved in managing patients at the frontline with this coronavirus outbreak. I have to say that we have been working with MOH over the years and I would like to applaud MOH on its communications, coordination and also performance now, 17 years down the line. I have to say that we are performing at top-notch. So, thank you to all the MOH staff and also all the people who are working long hours behind the scenes.",1,420,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00420

2020-02-03-T-024,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"The second point is essentially about publicity and also perhaps education for people who are coming forward. We have got employers who are saying that these two air-con repairmen have gone to the room where there was a suspected case. They are asymptomatic but the employers have asked them to come to the Emergency Department of a tertiary hospital to be assessed. Of course, we will assess and send them away to the GPs because we do not want to overload the hospital.",3,422,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00422

2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As I have mentioned earlier on, there is actually no way to certify a person fit for work and free of the virus. It has to go through incubation period to make sure that he does not have symptoms, then he can go back to work. So, if you are in doubt, you have been exposed, the best is to exercise precaution, exercise self-discipline, be socially responsible and make sure you wash your hands very regularly.

You can see the list getting longer and longer, because we do expect to see suspected cases emerging from time to time, going forward. Even though we have travel controls, we will continue to see suspected cases. For each suspected case, we will need to ensure that our medical staff wear all the protective gear, because they are by nature suspected cases. Many of the suspected cases turn out to be negative and therefore if you see some of our healthcare colleagues donning PPE at your shopping centre and so on, do not assume that this is going to be a confirmed case, because it may just be precautions that they have taken to inspect and pick up the suspected cases.

The first one is  what are we doing to encourage employers to be generous with respect to paid medical leave, paid family leave for workers who are sick, who may need to self-isolate, who may need to take care of a close family member who is sick? I am asking this because I will stand corrected but I am not sure right now that paid leave is actually mandated for self-isolation. I know it is for quarantine cases. We would not want employers to ask employees to take their own annual leave or no pay leave in such cases. That would be counter-productive.",1,430,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00430
2020-02-03-T-024,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The second question is  Mr Ang has already spoken about the financial constraints faced by self-employed persons who have to go on Leave of Absence, but I think the problem goes beyond that. Because even when self-employed persons have to go see the doctor or just take a day off work because they are not feeling well, they do not earn any income. I think this is another area where we can look into providing wage support, maybe medical cost support, because again, we do not want to be counter-productive here. We do not want people to have to choose between taking care of their health and earning a livelihood. That is an important area to look into.",2,431,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00431
2020-02-03-T-024,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Speaker, the treatment for persons who are on Leave of Absence is quite clear. We have sent out an advisory to employers that because this Leave of Absence is a requirement, they will have to find ways of supporting it. Whether the person who is on Leave of Absence is provided with additional leave or that duration of Leave of Absence is treated as paid vacation leave or sick leave, there are certain suggestions on how the employers may treat it.",1,432,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00432
2020-02-03-T-024,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"I think the Member's question also extends to persons who are not required to be on leave of absence, but either as their own unilateral sense that they should stay away, because they are not feeling well, or they have to look after someone who is on Leave of Absence. In those instances, I think we have to allow the employer to exercise some flexibility. If it is a situation where the employer has come into agreement with this individual, well and good. I think the employers know what to do. But there is really no requirement for a person to stay away from work if they themselves are not being asked to fulfill a Leave of Absence requirement. It is only something that they are doing on top of, so I just wanted to be clear on that.",2,433,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00433

Two short but slightly technical questions, I apologise. The first, Minister touched about it earlier. I think many Singaporeans are looking forward to the day when the first of the novel coronavirus patients are discharged from hospital. Could I just ask what are the criteria for discharge? Because there does not seem to be an international consensus on it, as far as I know.",1,436,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00436
2020-02-03-T-024,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The second was concerning transmissibility. One of the key hallmarks of the SARS virus was that there existed these subset of patients known as ""super spreaders"". So, if you look at this novel coronavirus, the ratio of transmission as we reported, about 2.2, which is, on the average, one will pass to about 2.2 persons. SARS was much lower, but then there are these ""super spreaders"" which caused a havoc in our healthcare sector. I was just wondering whether there is any information coming up from anywhere whether there exists such ""super spreaders"".",2,437,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00437

2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"First, the way I understand from my professional colleagues, that for patients, they will do two tests and both tests have to show negative, and they are usually one day apart to make sure that they are free of virus before they are considered for discharge.",2,439,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00439
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"But on top of that, at the end, doctors usually will make an assessment at the end of the day despite all the tests that we do, to assess and be confident that the person is well, does not look sick, does not have symptoms and generally are quite well, and maybe he will keep him for a while longer to make sure that there is no further deterioration before his discharge. Generally, our doctors are very careful. We can leave it in their hands to make a professional judgement when is the appropriate time to discharge patient.",3,440,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00440

2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The second question on ""super spreader"". Dr Chia is right that we are all looking out for the risk of a ""super spreader"" emerging. This is where one particular patient may infect tens or hundreds of patients that come into contact with him and so on. These are potential multipliers that will cause a major outbreak in the premises, in the locality. We are all looking out for such an incidence. So far we have not received any report of such an incidence. It may happen but it is not yet being detected. But we are all looking out for them. Sometimes, the ""super spreaders"", the patient themselves may be quite well. And therefore he is able to go around many places and spread a lot of potential contamination in the environment. Therefore, it is something that we are looking out for.",5,442,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00442

2020-02-03-T-024,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"First, the news on 30,000 work pass holders returning to Singapore has caused some anxiety to our residents because as the main bulk of this 30,000 work pass holders are living in our HDB flats. So, I would like to ask the Minister is there any way to monitor, to ensure that they comply to the 14 days of LOA strictly?",2,445,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00445
2020-02-03-T-024,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The second question is, for those who are returning and due to whatever reason they have no place to go back to, is there any help that is given or will be given to them? Just give an example. I receive one email from my resident. She is due to return on Wednesday but her husband does not want her to return to their home because the employer of the husband has imposed this rule that if any of your family member comes back from China, you have to stay at home as well. That is the reason, the husband does not want the wife. So, she is asking for help.",3,446,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00446
2020-02-03-T-024,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The third question, will we impose or is there any plan to impose travel restrictions for those who come from Hong Kong? Because Hong Kong is very near China and there is some concern among residents as well.",4,447,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00447
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, maybe the last question first. The travel restrictions that we have put in place apply to Mainland China. Hong Kong has fewer confirmed cases than Singapore. Maybe people might want to apply travel restrictions on Singapore then. I think our approach is to be looking at evidence, at the source of where the virus is, how widely it is spreading and which are the at-risk sources. Yes, I think we will not rule out more actions on travel restrictions, as we have said, but it has to be based not just on geographical proximity or distance but based on evidence on the nature of the virus, how widely it is spreading, at the risk. And if there are risks posed to Singapore and Singaporeans, we will not rule out other measures on travel restrictions.",1,448,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00448
2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the 30,000 work permit holders, I should clarify they are still in China now, they have not come back. Not all of them live in our housing estates. So, we are doing a tabulation, working directly with the employers to identify who they are, which sectors, where are their places of residence today. That exercise is underway now, so that we can be ready when these workers return, be ready to engage the employers, to be ready to engage the landlords; if some of them are living in dorms, be ready to ensure that our dorms are properly fitted out to have these workers living in more isolated areas without interaction and contamination with their fellow workers.

2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The question is what happens if employers need help because they say they are impacted by their workers who are coming back and unable to work, what happens if family members need help because somebody is in LOA within their home and then they too are impacted. I think these are all questions that we are anticipating. It is all part of the package of measures we are looking at to help companies, employers and households as well. So, we will, as I said earlier, put in place a series of measures to help those who are impacted and we will take all this into consideration in our package.",3,450,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00450
2020-02-03-T-024,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I agree with  Minister Wong that fear inflicts more damage sometimes than the virus itself. F-E-A-R is also false evidence appearing real so I am going to ask Minister Gan if I can go straight to the source of fear, which is the fear of death. Could he explain to us how death occurs from this virus? Because there is this panic and hysteria that the moment we ""kena"", we are just going to drop dead. So, it would be really useful if we can explain how death occurs from one who actually gets infected. What I understand is that most of the death cases right now from China have occurred in people who are elderly and who are at risk. It would be really helpful for us to know how the virus impacts us physically and that could lead to death.",1,451,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00451
2020-02-03-T-024,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"The second question I have is looking at the Fear Factor that impacts the economy and employment. There have been a lot of companies that are cancelling commercial activities and projects and events. Let me declare my interest, I am a founder of Hush which is a social enterprise, the Hush TeaBar, and even for us as a social enterprise, next three months, all the projects are cancelled and we are not the only one. I am wondering if the Government or MTI perhaps think that there may be merit to issue clear guidelines to companies in terms of cancellation or postponement of commercial activities and business events, because there is definitely a knock-on effect to SMEs and social enterprises.",2,452,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00452

2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I am not a doctor. So, it is very difficult for me to describe the process of death in medical terms, but I would try to explain how it causes death. Basically, when the virus attacks your body, your body will try to mount a response, a defence. And very often, you find that when your body is unable to respond adequately to eliminate the virus, your body will go into a shock, your organs go into overdrive and, therefore, you may begin to see organ failures and eventually, death will occur as a result. Therefore, because of this, chances are, if you already have underlying medical conditions, your body is already weak, your defences are weak and your organs may already be impaired, therefore, the risk of death is higher.",1,454,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00454
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"It is important for us to ensure that we continue to stay healthy. At the same time, what the hospitals will do is to provide supportive care to ensure that you have time for your body to recover, for your body to be able to fight the virus on its own until we are able to develop a definitive curative treatment. I think that is how the process will happen.",2,455,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00455
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Member is right, generally, coronavirus affect patients who have underlying conditions more, and, generally, the older people tend to have more underlying conditions and, therefore, they tend to affect the older people more. But there are also exceptions and even in this novel coronavirus situation, we see that there were some in the 30s and 40s, they are also infected, and some may not have underlying conditions.",3,456,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00456
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"At the end, it is also an issue of statistics. When you have large enough number of people who died, at the end of the day, there will be some who are not so typical, who not necessarily have conditions, but they have more severe reactions for a variety of reasons. So, it varies but, generally, coronavirus affects people with underlying conditions mainly because your organs tend to fail progressively as the disease progresses.",4,457,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00457

2020-02-03-T-024,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I think we have already put out the advisories based on today's situation, based on where we are today where there is no community outbreak within Singapore, community transmission. Events can continue but organisers take extra precautions. So, there is no need for cancellations; continue with the events. But if it is a large scale event, then you might want to take precautions like having having temperature screenings, which I think many event organisers are doing, and then putting out advisories to remind the participants that if they are sick, do not show up. If they have been to China recently, then make sure that they stay at home. Those sorts of precautions are useful and we continue to remind companies and event organisations of these precautions.",1,461,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00461
2020-02-03-T-024,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, my question is for Minister for Health. The official communication channel to the people who subscribe to the WhatsApp group quoted the Prime Minister saying that, ""Experts think that the Wuhan virus may be less deadlier than SARS"". So, can we have some verification whether this is true so far?",1,462,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00462
2020-02-03-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Sir, I mentioned in my speech that the fatality rates of SARS is about 10% and the fatality rate of this novel coronavirus is about 2% to 3% today. So, numerically, statistically, it is less fatal than SARS. But as I have said, it is still at the early stage of the development of the disease, the numbers will change over time.",1,463,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00463

At the same time, those who are confirmed cases today and, progressively, they may die because of the progression of the disease. So, therefore, both number will change over time. But as of today, based on our statistics, it appears to be less fatal, because fatality rate for SARS was 10% whereas the coronavirus is 2% to 3%.",2,464,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00464

We see residents coming down to give drinks, give food to the volunteers. I have a lot of new volunteers suddenly joining in, to say that they want to do their part. I also have an ex-grassroots leader whose both legs were amputated – as a result he cannot serve as a grassroots leader anymore – because of diabetes.

I think, first of all, if you look – the Member is a doctor – and we all know from a medical point of view, in the context of an epidemic and, particularly, when you are dealing with a global or a potentially global epidemic, it is most unwise to put people on commercial aircraft when they are potentially actively shedding virus. So, there was good medical rationale and that is why the Chinese authorities make, in my opinion, the right decision that these persons should not fly. If they did, it would have been contravening not only their own regulations but also WHO recommendations. So, we understand that.",3,474,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00474

But, specifically, now for the remaining Singaporeans because we will remain in touch with them, we will do our best to ensure that they have all the necessary treatment in Wuhan or in other places in China.",4,475,2020-02-03-T-024-S-00475

A variant of a GI can be a translation, or a transliteration, or any other variation of the indication constituting the GI. Let me give a hypothetical example to illustrate. Say, for example, that oranges grown on Pulau Ubin are known to bear a unique and highly-prized sweet and sour quality attributable to the natural environment of Pulau Ubin, and such oranges are known by the Chinese characters 乌敏橙 – in Chinese – oranges. Such oranges might be referred to in slightly different ways. So let me give you the different ways in which it could be referred to. For example, they may be referred or identified in Hanyu Pinyin as ""Wu Min Cheng"", which is a transliteration. Or they may be also known as ""Ubin Orange"", which is a translation of the words in Chinese. They could also be called ""Pulau Ubin Orange"", which is neither a translation nor a transliteration.

The end result of a successful opposition or cancellation of the registration of a particular variant is that the variant is not allowed to be registered or is removed from the GI Register. If the opposition or cancellation was against the entire set of variants, the end result is that the entire set of variants is not registered or is removed from the GI Register.",20,503,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00503
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"After the GI Registry commenced its operations, we found that certain types of QoR requests could achieve the same result as a successful opposition or cancellation. To illustrate the point, for instance, a QoR request could possibly be so broad as to result in a situation where the interested parties of a GI are effectively left with no rights in respect of a registered GI that they can enforce. This would render the GI registration nugatory. The QoR process was intended to enable an applicant to clarify the scope of protection conferred by the registration, and not to negate the GI registration altogether by wholly removing the rights conferred by registration.",21,504,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00504
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"Clause 5 of the Bill therefore clarifies that a QoR may not be requested, if the QoR request seeks a qualification of all the rights to be conferred in respect of a registered GI. For example, a qualification of all the rights conferred in respect of a registered GI may not be requested on the basis that the GI or variant is identical with the common name of the goods concerned in Singapore, as such a QoR would result in there being no rights conferred on a registered GI that can be enforced in respect of the registered GI or variant. This therefore makes it very clear that the QoR regime and the opposition or cancellation regime remains separate and distinct. They are meant as two different sets of parameters and protocols meant to apply to obtain two different sets of remedies. Applicants seeking to negate the rights conferred under the Act in respect of a registered GI or variant will not be able to use a QoR request as a substitute for opposition or cancellation proceedings.",22,505,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00505
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"Let me now touch on the third broad set of amendments which proposes further changes to the post-registration QoR process. Currently, QoR requests can be filed any time after the GI application is published. The requests are dealt with by the Registrar of GIs.",23,506,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00506
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"However, in the course of operating the GI Registry, IPOS has found the need to treat pre-registration and post-registration QoR requests differently. Pre-registration QoR requests relate to GI applications which are still pending before the Registrar. It would be more efficient for the Registrar to handle all pre-registration processes together, whether oppositions or QoR requests. In this way, the application for registration can be handled as expediently as possible. This also ensures that the applicant as well as third parties can have clarity about the protected rights as soon as possible.",24,507,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00507
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"On the other hand, once a GI has been registered – and this is the post-registration – there is no specified time frame for post-registration processes to be initiated. Each post-registration process can be independently managed. Further, GI disputes are often global in nature, with disputes around the world based on similar facts and issues. Given the desirability of taking into account the arguments and outcomes of disputes in other countries as well, when determining a post-registration QoR request, we therefore feel that the Registrar might not be the best forum for the determination of such disputes, especially when there is no longer an efficiency gain in doing so; in the same way as I have explained the pre-registration process.",25,508,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00508
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"The Bill therefore removes the post-registration QoR process. Nonetheless, we recognise that there may be disputes as to the scope of the protection conferred upon a registered GI post-registration. The Bill therefore provides that any post-registration applications for a limitation as to the scope of rights conferred in respect of a registered GI, will now be filed in and heard by the High Court, under a new judicial procedure called an application for a Limitation of Scope of rights in respect of a registered GI to be entered onto the Register.",26,509,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00509
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"The scope of such applications, and the grounds on which such applications can be granted, are set out in the new section 48(a), inserted by clause 7 of the Bill. Having these issues dealt with by the Courts would also give the opportunity for Singapore decisions to be cited by courts in other jurisdictions. The changes I mentioned previously providing that a QoR request cannot be used to negate the registration of a GI or a variant, will also apply in the context of this new procedure for application for a Limitation of Scope of rights.",27,510,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00510

2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, the regime protecting geographical indications in Singapore has been developing robustly in the past year. In April 2019, the Geographical Indications Act 2014 came into effect, and, along with it, the registry of geographical indications started operations.",1,514,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00514
2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This was in line with our international obligations under the European Union-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. Under the Schedule of the Geographical Indications Act 2014, the categories of goods that a geographical indication may be registered under relate to foodstuff or agricultural products. For countries where there are a lot of exports of such items that qualify for geographical indication, geographical indications help build up the reputation and quality associated with the produce in a different country. Although Singapore is not an agricultural exporting country, geographical indications are still relevant to us. Why? Singaporeans enjoy and consume foods from all over the world. Therefore, geographical indications add assurance relating to the unique flavour and authenticity of the product.",2,515,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00515
2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill makes the geographical indications framework clearer through two key avenues – the qualification and limitation of rights, and variants of geographical indicators. At this juncture, I declare for the Hansard record that I am a lawyer and some of my work relates to intellectual property rights.",3,516,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00516
2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"On qualification of rights before registration, clause 5 amends the law so that qualification of rights can only be made after publication but before registration. After registration, clause 7 inserts a new section to provide for a very similar process post-registration, albeit the term ""limitation of scope"" instead of ""qualification"" is used. Would the Minister elaborate on why the process, which in substance appears the same, has been bifurcated into pre and post registration?",4,517,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00517
2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The process is important as it sets out more clearly what is protected and what is not protected. This clarity facilitates better usage and protection of geographical indications by providing a better indicator for those who may be concerned over a potential infringement. Further, clause 5(d) and the new section 48(4) in clause 7 delineate when a qualification or limitation is appropriate and when a notice of opposition is appropriate. This provides needed guidance and ensures that the more appropriate process is used in any given circumstance.",5,518,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00518
2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The other main group of amendments relate to variants in a geographical indication. Variants play an important role in the intellectual property right of geographical indications. When a product's reputation and market expands across the globe, it and its geographical indication would probably have to be translated or transliterated in order to be represented in a different language. By protecting other forms such as translations and transliterations, we protect the essence of the geographical indication such that merchants are unable to circumvent the protection of geographical indications by simply changing the form in which it is presented.",6,519,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00519
2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),This affords a more complete protection and assists in establishing a global market. It not only helps preserve authenticity and quality of products related to the geographical indication but also makes them more accessible to people who speak a different language.,7,520,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00520
2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In relation to this, the illustration in the Explanatory Statement for clause 2 refers to ""Lion City Apples"" as a variant for ""Apples of Singapore."" I must say a much less exciting example than ""Pulau Ubin Oranges"". I do like the ring of ""Pulau Ubin Oranges"". Would the Minister explain under what circumstances would a nickname for a place be recognised as a variant under the Geographical Indication? For official nicknames used widely and even at national celebrations such as a National Day Parade, it is clear that it is quite well known and accepted. However, there are times when the nickname may not be as widely known or accepted. Under those circumstances, would such ""unofficial"" nicknames be accepted?",8,521,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00521
2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Clause 3 allows an application for a variant to be separate from the main application or together with it. This flexibility is welcomed and allows for the accommodation of market forces – for instance, where the demand for goods change such that the geographical indication should be translated into a different language in order to have the full benefit of the intellectual property right in question.",9,522,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00522
2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),Clause 4 of the Bill clarifies that variants need to fulfil the criteria of geographical indication in order to be registered. This ensures that variants are not a back door option for registering what was otherwise not registrable.,10,523,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00523
2020-02-03-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, geographical indications help guarantee the origin of a produce or food product, implying a certain standard or quality to it. In short, this Bill makes the regime clearer. Therefore, I support the Bill.",11,524,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00524
2020-02-03-T-027,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the geographical indications or GI (Amendment) Bill seeks to clarify a number of technical points relating to the GI Act of 2014 which came into force in 2019. In particular, it prescribes how the act should be interpreted in respect of variance of a GI as well as clarifying the legal procedure by which an appellant can seek to qualify or limit the scope of the rights conferred by the registration of the GI. Through bringing about these certifications, the Bill is a significant step in the right direction.",1,525,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00525
2020-02-03-T-027,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I have a few questions and suggestions for the Minister and respect of this Bill.

2020-02-03-T-027,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"GIs are terms which are used to inform consumers that a product, mostly food and drink comes from a particular place. The GI Act of 2014 established a new system of registration in Singapore to improve, the certainty of protection given to GIS with effect from 1 April 2019. This had been part of Singapore's compliance with the Singapore European Union Free Trade Agreement where some 100 applications have been protected under the GI Act. Perhaps the most famous example of a GI is champagne. Other examples are Tennessee whiskey, Pinggu peaches, Darjeeling tea and Parmesan cheese. Essentially, GI's must identify goods where the qualities, characteristics or reputation of the product should be essentially due to the place of origin.",3,527,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00527
2020-02-03-T-027,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),GIs help consumers gain assurance that the product they are buying and body the geographically grounded characteristics and bar reflected in the product name.,4,528,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00528
2020-02-03-T-027,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"My first question would be, as a Singaporean consumer purchasing a product where a GI has been registered in Singapore, how can they obtain some degree of assurance that the product they are purchasing is a genuine GI product, as it were, rather than a product from a different region that has usurped the name protected under the registered GI? No doubt, once the GIs are registered, producers and traders of the GI products will be able to request customs, authorities to ""detain, suspect infringing goods which are imported into or exported from Singapore"", as IPOS declared in the media report.",5,529,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00529
2020-02-03-T-027,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"But the ability of producers and traders of GI products to in force their rights may be uneven on the ground. Can IPOS consider working with GI rights holders, industry associations and other stakeholders to create an easy-to-use directory entirely funded by GI rights holders which will list legitimate products bearing the GI by brand, product type and retailer? Industry stakeholders will be strongly incentivised to fund such a directory.",6,530,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00530
2020-02-03-T-027,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, GIs represent an opportunity for local farming and food processing entrepreneurs to brand Singaporean products for enhanced competitiveness in export markets while also potentially contributing to the tourist experience for inbound tourists into Singapore who may seek good quality local food. In fact, it is not uncommon for tourist authorities to promote local foodstuffs and where they can be obtained. The Food and Agricultural Organisation, Asia Office said, as quoted in a media report by Food Navigator Asia, and I quote, ""As the industry moves towards globalisation and bringing local products to the world, local or ethnic products are increasingly becoming a target for GIs as these are often the most popularly searched by tourists. It is becoming increasingly important to differentiate your products from the pack. The time for uniformity in F&B is gone and GIs are going to be a big contributor to this.""",7,531,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00531
2020-02-03-T-027,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In this context, I have two other questions. Firstly, how many applications have been made for local geographic indications (GIs) to date? According to the same media report I cited earlier, and is confirmed by the Senior Minister of State, 140 GI applications have been made to IPOS since the GI Registry has been opened in April last year but it is unclear how many are for local GIs.",8,532,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00532
2020-02-03-T-027,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, will the Government consider working with local farming and food processing entrepreneurs to support their efforts to register GIs? Developing Singaporean GIs could be an avenue to boost the economic and job creation potential of the local food industry.",9,533,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00533

2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The GI system that is being set up – and you have seen it operate in the last year or so – is obviously designed to achieve the purposes for which Mr Perera has outlined  to give a platform to recognise local producers, to give a basis on which to differentiate and to distinguish food products in particular and to operate a system on which you can say that something is domain to the location and that, is itself, is a distinguishing feature. And so, the purpose of this regime is really to set up an environment that promotes all of these and allows protection to be given to producers so that they can then leverage on the GI, or rather, the name of a product linked to the geographical location, in the context of Mr Perera's point in Singapore as well.",2,536,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00536
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Let me just address the queries that have been raised.,3,537,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00537
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked why the process is being bifurcated into a pre- and a post registration. This is something that I outlined earlier, but let me just reiterate the concept and also the paradigm by which this is to be operating.",4,538,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00538
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In handling these pending applications, it is in the interest of parties that the Registrar moves as quickly as possible to reach a registration decision, so that all parties are clear about the protection that is accorded. In this context, the Registrar that handles the pre-registration QoR request together with the GI application will enable an efficient and expedient processing of the matters.",5,539,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00539
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the other hand, after the GI is registered, post-registration matters can be independently handled. We have therefore removed post-registration QoRs for registered GIs.",6,540,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00540
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The new Limitation of Scope process is dealt with by the Courts and not by the Registrar. And as Mr de Souza knows, it is common for the GIs around the world to be based on similar facts and issues. There may be competing interests; there may be disputes on the factual circumstances and matrix which give rise to the GI and they often involve similar, if not, identical parties, as Mr de Souza will know. Therefore, there may be decisions by foreign courts which would provide guidance and indeed, it would also guide the nature of the decision in Singapore and vice versa. And in this context, it will be an opportunity for Singapore jurisprudence to be used in other countries as well. Given the above, the Courts, we feel, will be better placed to adjudicate on these matters.",7,541,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00541
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr de Souza also asked about ""Lion City Apples"" and the use of the nickname, and I think circumstances under which the nickname for a place would be recognised as a variant of a GI, and under what circumstances that nickname could then be accepted.",8,542,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00542
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For a variant to be registered in Singapore, just as it is with any application for registration of a GI in Singapore, the applicant seeking to register a variant must show that the variant has obtained recognition or registration as a GI in its country of origin.

2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The suggestion that there may be a set-up that is used, funded by GI rights holders so that there can be a proper categorisation by brands and so on, is something we can consider. I think that is a useful suggestion insofar as it takes the debate further on how branding can be better organised, how there can be searches and ultimately, leading to better enforcement and policing of those rights.",11,545,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00545
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The second point Mr Perera raised which I think I agreed with earlier is that this entire platform that the GI Act has created is indeed useful for Singapore producers because Singapore producers can then leverage on our own geographical location and indeed, there are several special places within Singapore whose names are very well associated with certain types of foods. And, to that extent, that can be used.",12,546,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00546

2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Will the Government consider working with these producers? Certainly. I think what we do see is that the reforms that we make, not just in this Bill itself but generally in the context of the IP space, we see this as an opportunity for local producers, local companies to take advantage of the laws that we set up. As I have mentioned on more than one occasion, I believe, we ensure that the laws that we set up have, in other words, to be very much pro-business and centred on the needs of the user. And so, if we are able to have a platform where producers, manufacturers can take advantage of and protect the GIs, then certainly, we will encourage them to do so and to see what further assistance can be offered so that there will be even more Singapore producers beyond the examples that Mr de Souza and myself have outlined which are illustrative only, I might add.",14,548,2020-02-03-T-027-S-00548
2020-02-03-T-027,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, I will agree with the Members that the general point is that GIs continue to be relevant and maybe even increasingly relevant to Singaporean businesses as they add assurance to the unique flavour and identity and, of course, also authenticity of the product.

Instead, it controls the movement of hazardous waste via the Prior Informed Consent or PIC procedure. This is in recognition of the legitimate transboundary movements of hazardous waste as defined under the Convention, such as for proper recycling or disposal. Besides controlling hazardous waste, the Convention also imposes the PIC procedure on some non-hazardous waste streams, namely household wastes and residues arising from the incineration of household wastes. These waste streams are defined as ""other waste"" under the Basel Convention.",3,574,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00574

2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, researchers have discovered plastic debris at the deepest point on earth, the Marina Trench. On seemingly pristine ice floes near the Northwest Passage, scientists too have discovered plastic filaments and beads. In fact, in May 2019, United Nations estimated that 100 million tonnes of plastic have been dumped in the oceans thus far. Vivid and graphic pictures have become iconic symbols of the impact plastic has had on marine life and have rallied nations around the world to strengthen regulations relating to the global trade in plastic waste.",1,591,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00591
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill is based on the amendments made to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal in 2019 to target plastic waste. This treaty was acceded to by Singapore in 1996 and was implemented in 1998 by the enactment of the Hazardous Waste (Control of Export, Import and Transit) Act. The amendment to the Convention classified plastic waste more clearly. Certain annexes of the convention require prior informed consent before importing such waste can be initiated. Annex IV does not require prior consent and previously classified only non-harmful plastic without specifying whether they were immediately recyclable. Following the changes to the Convention in 2019, two kinds of plastic waste are subject to prior informed consent  plastic waste mixed with hazardous materials, such as PET bottles containing pesticides, and plastic waste that can be recycled only after undergoing the cleaning process due to contamination of foreign materials. This is reflected in clause 7.",2,592,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00592
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Additionally, clause 4 of the Bill allows our law to directly reference the prescribed website of the Secretariat of the Basel Convention as to what is considered hazardous waste. Previously, the Minister had to declare it so via notification on the Gazette.",3,593,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00593
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),Would the Minister explain how Singapore handles our plastic waste? Do we have the capacity and capabilities to deal with our plastic waste?,4,594,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00594
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides tackling the way plastic waste is handled, we can also reduce the amount of plastic pollutants released into the environment. Although it has been said that ""only a miniscule amount of microplastics is discharged into the sea,"" would the Ministry elaborate on what are the likely sources for the microplastics found on the Singapore beaches and what will be done to reduce it?",5,595,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00595
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One commonly discussed source for microplastics is microbeads. Microbeads do not disappear even though they get flushed down the sink and out of sight. Plastic microbeads have been banned in personal care products and cosmetics in United States and United Kingdom. While plastic straws are needed by some for medical conditions, some personal care products and cosmetics have been able to substitute plastic microbeads with biodegradable microbeads or even natural alternatives. In 2016, it was reported in the Straits Times that National Parks was ""currently looking into assessing the status and impact of marine debris and microplastics on Singapore's marine environment” and that ""the National Environment Agency [was] monitoring international developments in legislation and domestic research on microplastics."" Would the Minister kindly provide an update on the findings and whether any updated studies have been done since then to understand the impact of microplastic on Singapore’s marine environment?",6,596,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00596
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Even though Singapore treats our used water such that a substantial portion of microbeads and microplastics are dealt with, would it not be better if there were less plastic to deal with by reducing the use and/or release of such plastics into the water? Instead of merely removing plastics, we should work towards reducing them. Firstly, this conserves resources used to make plastics. Secondly, this reduces the energy needed to process its waste. Thirdly, with less plastic in our used water, there would be less incinerated ash to be disposed of. Fourthly, there will be less microplastics potentially released into the environment. Fifthly, we would be encouraging responsible use of plastics and would also deter the thinking that someone else will clean up the consequences of our actions.",7,597,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00597
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Taking into account these issues, what is the Minister's view on the question of whether we should ban the use of microplastics or microbeads in personal care products and cosmetics?",8,598,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00598
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),This Bill addresses one part of the problem related to plastic waste but the bigger question is how are we tackling this pollutant holistically? The effect of plastic contamination is felt across national borders. Plastics and toxic-contaminated plastic in the water can enter the food chain when marine life ingest it. Another possible way is via larvae of insects such as mosquitoes and then their being eaten by other creatures in the food chain and so on.,9,599,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00599
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Research combining the results of more than 50 studies globally have estimated that an individual ingests about one credit card worth of plastic each week. As much of our food is imported from overseas, how does the Ministry monitor the level of plastic pollutant in our food and its impact? Is there a level beyond which the plastic pollution in the food is unacceptable? In other words, how is Singapore working towards food security and less dependency on other countries specifically in relation to seafood and other food products from the marine environment and ensuring the plastic contaminants in such food remains low or negligible?",10,600,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00600
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Additionally, as the economic impact of plastic pollution on marine ecosystems is estimated by the UN Environment Program to be at least US$8 billion a year, it would make sense for nations including Singapore to work towards reducing plastic pollution, not just by reducing new entrants, but also looking into innovative possibilities to remove what has already entered the marine environment. How has Singapore contributed to innovative solutions to clean up the ocean? What is Singapore doing to encourage a global push to adopt a good plastic waste management system that reduces plastic pollution? This indirectly contributes to Singapore's food security if our food sources are threatened by other countries’ plastic pollution.",11,601,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00601
2020-02-03-T-029,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Looking at the facts, plastic pollution is a problem that we need to address. Even though half of all plastics ever manufactured have been made in the last 15 years, there are already around 100 million tonnes of plastic in the oceans, 80% to 90% from land. In 2019, it was reported in National Geographic that plastic production has increased exponentially, from 2.3 million tonnes in 1950 to 450 million tonnes or estimate by 2015 and that is expecting to double by 2050.",12,602,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00602

Even worse, our plastic waste per capita has been increasing, by about 20% over the last 15 years. So, even as we today sharpen our policies regarding the import and export plastic waste, I would like to ask the Minister for more details of how we ourselves are disposing of our own plastic wastes.",4,607,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00607

The reasons, of course, include costs, convenience and, perhaps, hygiene. What is often not factored in is the cost we all pay for the long-term damage on our environment. I appeal to the Ministry to work more closely with F&B providers to come up with a viable and sustainable, nation-wide solution. Due to higher costs and manpower constraints, if left to the free forces of the market, food and drinks sellers and establishments will actually have very little incentive to opt for durable, washable utensils or participate in the use and collection of reusable ware for customers who do takeaways. I also hope the Ministry would take firmer, which may perhaps be unpopular, steps to ban or severely restrict the use of certain types of single-use plastics and the most common example would be straws.",13,616,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00616

According to NEA, only 7% of the 40,700 tonnes of plastic trash that was recycled last year was processed locally and the rest was shipped overseas. It appears difficult to know what happens to the trash afterwards. How do we know they are recycled or dumped properly? A 2018 Business Times news article reported that ""much of the plastic that is logged as recycled is shipped overseas – to China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia – where, if it cannot eventually be properly sorted and processed, it is incinerated or tipped into the sea.""",4,622,2020-02-03-T-029-S-00622

The responsibility is on the manufacturers to pack their products in sustainable materials. How should we encourage the manufacturers to improve on their products so that potential issues and concerns are addressed from the production stage to ensure that they are environmentally-friendly? Perhaps, the Ministry can consider using both the carrot and the stick to bring about improvements.

They control and in fact, design the architecture of the terms on which they come and reach a settlement on their dispute. It is attractive for businesses who wish to resolve their commercial disputes with an outcome that is mutually acceptable to both sides whilst preserving their long-term relationships and leaving open the possibility of working together in future. The conciliatory nature of mediation reduces the instances where a dispute leads ultimately to a complete termination of commercial relationships. Mediation therefore complements other modes of dispute resolution, as it can be used in conjunction with litigation or arbitration, and increasingly, it often is embedded into the system and it appears in both types of dispute resolution mechanisms.",14,709,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00709

2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),This is a landmark Bill. It represents a significant major step for cross-border resolution of commercial disputes. This is with the hope that businesses will benefit with more certainty and assurance.,2,736,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00736
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Sir, it is also about our Singapore branding, our badge as a global arbitration and mediation hub. Singapore had a major role in drafting the document. And what more, the Singapore Convention on Mediation was opened for signature on 7 August 2019, our Bicentennial year, and also named after us. It is an honour indeed.",3,737,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00737
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Mediation is now getting more popular and thus more frequently used at both domestic and international platforms. Reading through the Bill, there are some unique pointers unlike other multilateral enforcement regimes, such as that it does not operate based on reciprocity between member states.",4,738,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00738
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"I have, Sir, several clarifications and queries.",5,739,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00739
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Firstly, under section 6, subsection 4, pertaining to the certified translation into English of the settlement agreement if it is in other languages. Can the Senior Minister of State clarify if the service will be provided by a list of approved vendors globally or the parties involved will have to source for this themselves?",6,740,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00740
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Next, can the Senior Minister of State please outline if the courts of signatory countries will handle applications to enforce or clear parties involved?",7,741,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00741
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Some major nations have not ratified the Convention. Are there specific reasons or considerations for this? With a Bill as this under the umbrella of the United Nations, it would be excellent to have as many nations come on board and if not so, the reasons, perhaps could be addressed adequately. I believe there are also some inconsistencies with the fundamentals of commercial mediation in the Western jurisdiction. Perhaps the Senior Minister of State is probably more well-versed with this, and if it is possible, perhaps he can enlighten us on some of the possible reasons for this.",8,742,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00742
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Can I also clarify with the Senior Minister of State that as long as a settlement is intended and will result from mediation, then that commercial case will qualify for enforcement under the Convention, regardless of its place of origin or the nation of origin?",9,743,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00743
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Sir, mediation is an art, with the science part of it as well. The mediation industry is variable across different countries and jurisdictions. Its recognition is also variable. For example, in the UK, it has a well-known reputation and history of being strong in arbitration.",10,744,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00744
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"What is important in considering this Bill is the fact that mediation will be driven very much by the local framework, culture and emphasis. Mediator recognition, training and qualifications also vary across the globe. Cultural diversity will exist and we know that ""culture can, indeed, trump strategy"". In view of all these factors, how do we ensure some degree of consistency and standardisation?",11,745,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00745
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Another concern is on the requirement of having ""the mediator signing the document"". A mediator's document is quite different from a witness' statement in Court, for example. In some places, the mediator may not be comfortable to have his or her name and documents appear and be utilised in a Court of law. Mediators may disagree to sign the Settlement Agreement and, if they are not comfortable with this, to be also subpoenaed as witnesses. How then should these cases be handled?",12,746,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00746
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Some cases or disputes put up for mediation may span a period of time, maybe even years, and agreement may not have been reached at the first sitting. If an agreement is then eventually reached, how can we prove that it is actually settled through mediation and not due to other platforms, alternatives and various permutations of interventions, during the course of the matter in question?",13,747,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00747
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),Another query I have on this is  will an agreement arising from mediation now be enforceable with the passing of this Bill? Can the Minister please clarify as well?,14,748,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00748
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Finally, will two parties in dispute seeking enforcement apply to the Courts of the State or country whereby the majority of the assets are located or can this be otherwise? Who can decide on this? And what if both parties are at loggerheads pertaining to this?",15,749,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00749
2020-02-03-T-030,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"So, these are some of the clarifications I have. Pending these, I support the Bill.",16,750,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00750
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as an accredited mediator with the Singapore Mediation Centre as well as a Fellow in the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators. I rise in support of this Bill, which seeks to enhance the dispute resolution landscape within Singapore, by giving greater recognition towards mediation and international commercial settlement agreements.",1,751,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00751
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"The benefits of mediation are four-fold. First, mediation accords parties greater control over the outcome and resolution of the matter, which contrasts with long-drawn Court trials, where the outcome of a case rests in the Judge’s hands. Second, the contents of parties' disputes are kept confidential, unlike litigation where parties' dirty linen and affairs are often aired in Court. Third, legal costs are reduced, as parties no longer have to pay for their lawyers' fees and Court fees once a settlement has been reached. Lastly and most importantly, parties' relationships are preserved and this is essential where parties wish to continue business relations with each other.",2,752,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00752
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"As Singapore recognises the benefits of mediation and continues to develop its position as a leading global dispute resolution hub, mediation institutions and schemes will take on an increasingly important role. At present, we have the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC), which has mediated over 4,000 matters to-date. The settlement rate is approximately 70%, with more than 90% of the settled disputes resolved within a day. To-date, the SMC has received positive feedback. Many individuals have saved time and costs and would likewise recommend the SMC to others involved in disputes.",3,753,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00753
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Apart from the SMC, we also have the International Institute of Mediators (Singapore) Limited (iiM), which was established as a result of its founding members’ commitment to develop and promote the mediation profession on a global basis. Aside from the regular mediation sessions conducted by its members, the iiM additionally provides education and training for those who aspire to become trained mediators.",4,754,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00754

This is one of the many initiatives illustrating the Labour Movement's commitment towards its freelancer members, ensuring that they have an appropriate avenue for amicable dispute resolution. With this collaboration, NTUC UFSE members will be able to enjoy discounted rates for mediation services provided by iiM.",5,755,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00755
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Turning now to the international commercial sphere, with the increasing prevalence of global and international trade between countries, coupled with Singapore’s open and highly developed free-market economy, the need for cross-border mediation resources and enforceable international settlement agreements becomes particularly crucial. It is against this commercial backdrop that this Bill is commendable.",6,756,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00756
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Under the new Bill, international commercial settlement agreements may be recorded as an order of Court which can then be more readily enforced in the same manner as a judgment by the High Court. This is an improvement from the long-standing position where mediated settlement agreements are typically only binding contractually between parties and not directly enforceable as a Court Order. By the same token, the settlement agreement may also be invoked by a party as a defence against a claim that has already been settled. This prevents settled disputes from being re-litigated, which saves parties’ time and costs as well as judicial resources.",7,757,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00757
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"While the Bill is no doubt commendable, I have the following questions and clarifications for the Senior Minister of State. The Bill only applies to international commercial settlement agreements resulting from mediation and does not extend to settlement agreements concluded for family, inheritance and/or employment disputes.",8,758,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00758
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"First, is there a reason why the Bill is not extended to these other areas of dispute? If so, would the Minister be willing to share the reasons? Also, does the Minister foresee that there should be a similar Bill covering these other areas, given today's globally interconnected world, where many individuals opt to work around the globe, having assets typically situated in different parts of the world and where transactions cut across borders?",9,759,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00759
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Second, given the growing freelancer community and, especially for those who look to venture overseas, whether digitally or in person, would the Bill also cover intellectual property rights?",10,760,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00760
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Third, I understand that the Court retains the discretion to refuse the application to record the agreement as a Court Order if there was a serious breach by the mediator of the applicable standards. What are some examples of serious breaches by the mediator which would warrant the Court’s refusal of the application? And is it necessary to refuse enforcement, especially if commercial entities have been properly advised and have the freedom to enter into such settlement agreements?",11,761,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00761
2020-02-03-T-030,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Fourth, we do see a greater trend towards mediation over the years, especially with the implementation of the Mediation Act in 2017 and the various mediation institutions in Singapore. I have also seen some choosing mediation over litigation, while others opt to use mediation in conjunction with litigation. Would the Minister foresee a further increase in disputes resolved as a result of the new Bill and, if so, to what extent? Would the Minister also be able to share some of the views and concerns of the legal fraternity as well as the business community, in response to this new Bill? Sir, clarifications notwithstanding, I stand in support of this Bill.",12,762,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00762

2020-02-03-T-030,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"As a representative of the business community, I strongly believe in the benefits of mediation. I constantly advocate mediation as the initial avenue for dispute resolution as the flexibility and advantages that mediation offers are wide-ranging. The benefits of mediation vis-à-vis arbitration and litigation are frequently cited to be time and cost efficiency, confidentiality, non-confrontational character and, many times, the business relationship may continue after a mediation settlement is reached.",2,764,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00764
2020-02-03-T-030,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"I believe I can say that, lawyers apart, one of the most stressful things in life for the everyday man on the street would be to be hit with legal matters, especially a full-blown litigious trial. The stress, worry and uncertainty are exacerbated by a largely adversarial process that takes much time and, indeed, resources away from the real business of doing business.",3,765,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00765
2020-02-03-T-030,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"Hence, the business community will benefit if mediation becomes a widely-accepted and recognised avenue for dispute resolution. With mediation, the options for settlement are wider in scope than the monetary compensation available through arbitration or litigation and parties have a chance to negotiate settlement options without prejudice to their legal rights and in a non-pressure cooker atmosphere.",4,766,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00766
2020-02-03-T-030,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"The confidential nature of mediation also protects companies from unwanted public scrutiny. Most business relationships are complex and forged over time and, as such, I believe most would seek to preserve the relationship where possible. As the awareness for mediation grows, I see this as a cost- and time-efficient option for companies to resolve disputes.",5,767,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00767

2020-02-03-T-030,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"The team at the SMC has shared that 90% of mediation cases are concluded within one day. This is really amazing, as compared to the significantly longer processes of arbitration and litigation with the corresponding higher professional service fees that one would have to pay.",7,769,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00769
2020-02-03-T-030,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),It is my hope that more trade associations and chambers will take the lead in spreading what mediation is and help our society to be one that is less litigious. It is in this context that I firmly place my support behind this Bill.,8,770,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00770
2020-02-03-T-030,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"Perhaps the main reason why companies hesitate to consider mediation as an avenue of dispute resolution was the lack of an enforcement mechanism, especially in the event of cross-border interests. As there was a lack of a cross-border framework for mediated settlement agreements, parties are only able to seek enforcement of the settlement agreement under contract law. By passing this Bill as a step towards ratifying the Singapore Convention, mediation will now be further seen as one that does not waste time and one that can produce desired outcomes.",9,771,2020-02-03-T-030-S-00771

Hon Members of the House, as we approach the end of a long sitting in Parliament, you must be running through your minds the many tasks you need to complete to tomorrow, as you tick off those that you have accomplished today. You may cheer in the thought that you have achieved several goals, but nevertheless berate yourself for not attaining others. And you probably feel frustrated and annoyed at your lack of efficacy in that regard. Because ultimately as human beings, we are often our own toughest critics. We set lofty targets for ourselves, and feel like losers when we do not meet them. We take our own shortcomings and inflate them, diminish our best efforts and magnify our failures.",1,791,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00791
2020-02-03-T-032,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Alas, failure is very much on the minds of students in Singapore, as revealed by the PISA Rankings announced in December. While our 15-year-old students came in second worldwide in reading, math and science, we came in first for a fresh indicator. The PISA test introduced a new measure to assess students’ fear of failure where compared to students from other countries, we have the highest percentage of students, 78%, agreeing or strongly agreeing with the phrase, ""When I am failing, this makes me doubt my plans for the future"". Tellingly, 72% of Singapore students also worry about what others would think of them if they fail, reflecting the resounding weight of failure on their sense of self-worth.",2,792,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00792

Mid-year examinations for Primary 3 and 5 and Secondary 1 and 3 students are being progressively scrapped, and all graded assessments and examinations at Primary 1 and 2 have also been removed to give young pupils two test-free years. Report books no longer state the class and level rankings of Primary and Secondary school students, and marks for each subject are rounded off and presented as whole numbers, without decimal points, to minimise the intense focus on marks. Instead, teachers now provide qualitative descriptors on their pupils' learning.

2020-02-03-T-032,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Indeed, there is yet more that we can do to lessen the achievement orientation and downplay the fear of failure, both symbolically and practically, particularly at the operational level.",6,796,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00796
2020-02-03-T-032,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"First, let us cast our eye on our students’ everyday learning environments. I am assured that most of our teachers work hard at their jobs and do their best to instil excellence and industry in their students. However, a small minority engage in microaggressions in the classroom where they use questionable tactics and harsh measures to motivate under-performing students. As distressed students and parents have shared with me, these include reading out the names and test scores of every student in class in order of highest to lowest scorers, thereby prolonging the ordeal for those at the bottom of the pile. Another often mentioned practice is the flashing of the work of poor performers on the screen and using these as examples of what not to do, with the identity of the ""incompetent"" student being made clearly known to everyone.",7,797,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00797
2020-02-03-T-032,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Teachers have also been known to taunt students with disparaging comments such as ""you’re too stupid to take this course"" or ""why can’t you do something so simple?"" In more extreme situations, some teachers promise the entire class a fast food treat if everyone in the class scores above a certain threshold. When some pupils fail to attain that magic score, the teacher then denies everyone the treat and the disappointed class then chastises and ostracises the under-performers. Such tactics not only shame the poor performers but also create a toxic environment that promotes dog-eat-dog hostility rather than peer-to-peer support.",8,798,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00798
2020-02-03-T-032,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"I believe that these teachers are fundamentally well-intentioned and seek only to spur on their students. And their actions are really symptomatic of the broader pressures that teachers themselves face in delivering results. Be that as it may, such teachers must be made to realise that these destructive methods of highlighting failure and under-performance can demotivate students and lead them to lose interest in the subject. They can also demoralise the students and at worst, inflict long-term damage on their self-esteem. As worries about the mental health of young people are on the ascent, we must not dismiss such microaggressions in the classroom and do our utmost to educate our teachers on their harms. I therefore propose that we better prepare and empower our teachers to be proactive and sensitive in helping students manage failure and deal with setbacks. Our schools must feel like safe spaces in which to fail, and to try again.",9,799,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00799
2020-02-03-T-032,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Second, even as we have de-emphasised class rankings in report books, teachers are communicating actively with parents about their children via a range of mobile apps and digital platforms including Parents Gateway, ClassDojo, Remind and even WhatsApp. In research for my book ""Transcendent Parenting  Raising Children in the Digital Age"", we captured screenshots from parents’ phones where teachers would message parents of their children's performance in individual tests and assignments. Some would also include the highest, lowest and median scores for the assignments, thereby allowing pupils to place where they stood relative to everyone else. Yet another teacher messaged the parents that 30 pupils had scored full marks for a spelling test. If our average class size is 33-34, how would the three or four kids who missed out on a perfect score feel? I reckon that those kids and their parents must have felt like failures.",10,800,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00800
2020-02-03-T-032,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Furthermore, apps like ClassDojo also allow teachers to assign a score to children's in-class performance and this is also communicated to the parents, thereby allowing parents to ""track"" how their children are faring in class. My research also showed that some parents obsess over these scores and interrogate their children about what went on in school, even though these scores are disguised as gamified rewards.",11,801,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00801
2020-02-03-T-032,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Some may argue that it is parents and indeed students themselves who are keen to know how well they are doing. However, we can collectively reshape the culture of achievement orientation if there is an overall shift in emphasis from relative performance towards individual performance, and where qualitative feedback is prioritised over quantitative metrics. Fundamentally, if we want to reduce the excessive focus on grades in our education system, we must ensure that this is practised consistently and across the board, not just in report books but also in everyday teacher-parent communication.",12,802,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00802
2020-02-03-T-032,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Third, another setting in which our students feel the fear of failure most acutely is in the collection of PSLE, ""O"" and ""A"" level results. Many students and families are on tenterhooks in the days leading up to these fateful moments. Those who have performed beyond or up to expectations will be relieved but those who have not will find the entire exercise excruciating. Besides the seemingly interminable wait for the results, there is also the awkward trudge out of school where friends will demand to know how well you have performed. Some students have been known to call the walk out from the school hall to the school gate the walk of shame. Others hide in the toilet until the coast is clear!",13,803,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00803

An already difficult experience exacerbated by the prevalence of smartphones to capture and broadcast everything via social media? Let us not forget that our young lead very public lives where they have an online image to maintain and live up to, thereby adding to their social anxiety around such watershed events. I reiterate that the PISA measure found that a sizeable majority of our students worry about what others would think of them if they fail.",15,805,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00805

By turning off the glaring spotlight on the collection of results for high stakes examinations, we also send the important signal that ours is a culture of lifelong learning that does not end with attaining these certificates.

As they say, there is nothing to fear but fear itself. Failure can be instructive and rewarding, providing us with feedback and valuable experience for future undertakings. But it is the fear of failure that holds us back.

Failure teaches us valuable lessons and learning to bounce back from setbacks is one of the most critical life skills that our students can learn. My response will elaborate on three points  first, the value of failure and what our teachers are doing to inculcate a growth mind-set in our students; second, the systems changes that MOE is making so that students can develop to their fullest potential; third, our collective effort in re-shaping societal attitudes, helping students to learn from setbacks and grow in confidence. Parents, alongside educators, also have an important role to play.",1,814,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00814
2020-02-03-T-032,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"First, on the value of failure. MOE has looked into the PISA findings that Prof Lim mentioned earlier. In MOE's studies, students report that they are stressed by high expectations from themselves and others. At the same time, the PISA findings also indicated that our students have higher levels of self-efficacy, which reflects confidence in one's ability to get things done, compared to peers in other top-performing education systems.",2,815,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00815
2020-02-03-T-032,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"Hence, the fear of failure may actually be a reflection of the strong achievement motivation and expectations of our students. Just like stress, a healthy level of concern about failure is not a bad thing – in other words, we do not always have to fear the ""fear of failure"". Nonetheless, we agree that excessive fear of failure is undesirable. It can lead to risk-aversion, anxiety and a reluctance to try new challenges.",3,816,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00816
2020-02-03-T-032,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"As everybody can attest to, experiencing failure is an unavoidable part of life. In fact, some successful entrepreneurs will tell you that it is actually an essential stepping-stone on the way to success. Hence, we must teach our students how to get up when they fall and to manage the challenges and stressors that they may face, whether in school or in life.",4,817,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00817
2020-02-03-T-032,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"Today, our schools and teachers provide opportunities for students to face challenges and openly discuss success and failure. Schools promote a supportive learning culture, whereby positive teacher-student relationship and peer support are emphasised. Our teachers are trained to use different means to motivate their charges. They use role models and positive peer examples to encourage the class to excel. Teachers also help students to see that there is no need to be overly anxious over ""failures"". Instead, they are just setbacks that provide useful learning points and feedback in their lifelong journey, and the ""try-fail-try-again"" approach can provide a richer learning experience. There may be instances where these can be done better and we note the feedback given by Prof Lim.",5,818,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00818
2020-02-03-T-032,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"Developing resilience in the face of failure is also proactively inculcated as part of Character and Citizenship Education, or CCE, that all students experience. Through CCE, students learn about a growth mindset, and understand that their abilities can be developed through dedication and a never-say-die attitude. Beyond classroom lessons, our students reinforce these skills through CCA interactions, inter-school competitions and even student-body elections. These experiences enable them to overcome challenges, taste success and learn from setbacks.",6,819,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00819
2020-02-03-T-032,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"At this point, let me share the thinking behind the collection of national examination results. First, it is important that when students receive their results, regardless of whether it meets their expectations or beyond, that they have the support of their closest friends, teachers and school counsellors at hand. So, it is important that they are present. Second, we have seen that this is the juncture where many students look to their teachers for timely and relevant advice regarding their next phase of education. To avoid undue pressure, we had stopped announcing the top PSLE scorer and the academic banding of Secondary schools. Some schools also give out results at the classroom level, rather than in the school hall. We will continue to review how schools release results, in the best interests of students.",7,820,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00820
2020-02-03-T-032,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"Moving on to my second point, indeed, I fully agree with Prof Lim that we should nurture a culture of lifelong learning and thank her for her support in the changes we are making at MOE. New pathways, increased porosity between them, and a greater diversity of programmes cater to the diverse strengths and aspirations of our students, and give them the chance to chart a different path, or to try again. As a result, experiencing temporary setbacks certainly does not curtail future opportunities in their educational journey, nor does it equate to being a failure in life. Let me share a few examples.",8,821,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00821
2020-02-03-T-032,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"We have introduced Direct School Admission (DSA) to our Secondary schools and Junior Colleges, and different forms of aptitude-based admissions for our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). These pathways recognise our student's achievements beyond examinations, and supports them to develop and pursue their strengths and interests. It mitigates the high stakes of examinations and reduces an overemphasis on academic results.",9,822,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00822
2020-02-03-T-032,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"We have also increased porosity between pathways. In Secondary schools, the pilot for Full Subject-Based Banding, or Full SBB, has started. This marks our move away from stream labels, so that students are less likely to impose a self-limiting mindset on themselves. Instead, they can discover and develop their potential, and take a combination of subjects across different levels that cater to their strengths.",10,823,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00823

By 2030, all Nitec students will have the opportunity to upgrade to a Higher Nitec over the course of their careers, and can progress further through work-study diplomas or full-time programmes. Working adults can return to full-time studies at the Polytechnics via the Early Admissions Exercise. Among Polytechnic graduates, many go on to pursue a University degree. University graduates may further their education through a specialist diploma in a Polytechnic.

One of the students I have met, over the years, is Alif Adam, a Ngee Ann Polytechnic graduate who now runs an e-commerce business in fitness wear. Alif dropped out of Junior College twice, before he found his footing in Polytechnic where he discovered his natural talent as an entrepreneur. While pursuing his Diploma in Advertising and Public Relations, he took advantage of the school's work-study entrepreneurship programme in Jakarta, a $5,000 Kickstarter grant, and with his parents' blessings, eventually launched his company three years ago, which now boasts an international client base.

Our education system is increasingly one where our students can customise their goals based on their own definition of success. They can take advantage of many ""bridges"" and ""ladders"" in their lifelong journey of learning. Our schools and our teachers also create a supportive environment where our students feel safe to challenge themselves, rather than hold back due to a fear of failure. All of these will help students to be more resilient, self-reliant and innovative.",13,826,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00826

We, as a society, should also start to redefine how we measure success and react to failure. By showing timely support and seizing teachable moments, we can provide a nurturing environment for our children to be comfortable with confronting failures. For example, as parents, when our children do not perform as well as expected, we could emphasise that what matters more is how they pick themselves up. Recognise effort, and not just the outcome. Encourage reflection and a growth mind-set. Guide our children to turn their disappointment into a source of motivation to do better the next time and to never lose belief in themselves.",14,827,2020-02-03-T-032-S-00827

I just wanted to ask if the Ministry was opened to even exploring the option of giving all students the choice of checking their results online.

And, at the same time, we want to make sure that there are opportunities for the kids to get guidance during that process. I have seen and I have heard, because I have my own children, even after the results are out, the kids do get together and support one another. And, to me, that part is critical because that is where you continue to build the bond, the support and go through that educational journey with your friends.

2020-02-03-T-034,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In 2019, Singaporeans made about 24.9 million overseas trips. Over the last five years, the number of overseas trips has shown a gradual increase of about 0.2% per annum. We do not have data on the average number of days Singaporeans spent overseas.",1,845,2020-02-03-T-034-S-00845
2020-02-03-T-034,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Over the last five years, tourist arrivals grew at an average rate of almost 5% per annum, to more than 19 million tourists in 2019. Their average length of stay is 3.4 nights.",2,846,2020-02-03-T-034-S-00846

2020-02-03-T-035,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of China's economic growth at its lowest in 30 years (a) what is the near-term impact on Singapore's economy and jobs situation; (b) how will it alter Singapore's investment in China and Singapore's participation in the Belt and Road Initiative; and (c) what are the future measures to diversify our economic exposure.,1,848,2020-02-03-T-035-S-00848
2020-02-03-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Chinese economy grew by 6.1% last year. Even though this is its lowest rate of growth in the past 30 years, it is still higher than the average growth rate of 1.7% among advanced economies, and 5.6% among emerging and developing economies in Asia.",1,849,2020-02-03-T-035-S-00849
2020-02-03-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"China's slower growth is not expected to have a large impact on the Singapore economy. While China is our largest trading partner and top destination for our outbound investments, it does not account for a disproportionately large share of our well diversified economy. For instance, China accounts for 13.4% of our total trade, compared to other major trading partners like Malaysia (11.1%) and the US (10.3%). We will continue to ensure that our economic relations with foreign partners are balanced and diversified, and that we are not over-exposed to any one foreign country.",2,850,2020-02-03-T-035-S-00850
2020-02-03-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We will continue to strengthen our economic relations with China, as well as our other trading partners. Bilaterally, we have been working closely with China to deepen our economic linkages. For example, the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (CSFTA) Upgrade Protocol that entered into force on 16 October 2019 keeps the agreement up to date by improving trading rules and investment regimes for our companies.3 We are also cooperating with China on international initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).",3,851,2020-02-03-T-035-S-00851
2020-02-03-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Singapore is an early supporter of the BRI. This year marks the 5th anniversary of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative, which is a priority demonstration project under the BRI that brings Southeast Asia and China closer together. In addition, Singapore can also leverage our position as a trusted financial hub, to enhance the sustainability of BRI projects by intermediating financial needs in Asia to tap on opportunities in third country markets.",4,852,2020-02-03-T-035-S-00852
2020-02-03-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Even as we continue to deepen our engagement with China, as a small and open economy, we must remain open and connected to the rest of the world. We currently have an extensive network of 25 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with 64 trading partners which collectively account for more than 85% of global GDP and more than 90% of Singapore's trade. We will continue to expand and diversify our trade linkages through new FTAs with economies such as the Eurasian Economic Union, the Pacific Alliance, and the Southern Common Market in South America (Mercosur). We will also pursue new forms of partnership to facilitate digital economy activities and digital trade. We have recently concluded negotiations on our first Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA) with New Zealand and Chile, and have also embarked on bilateral DEA negotiations with Australia.",5,853,2020-02-03-T-035-S-00853
2020-02-03-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To help Singapore companies venture into overseas markets and take advantage of these FTAs, we will continue to support companies in going overseas and conquering new markets. We will enhance our support for companies and grow our network of overseas centres to provide Singapore companies assistance in business advisory services, business matching and market set-up overseas.",6,854,2020-02-03-T-035-S-00854
2020-02-03-T-036,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will consider installing noise barriers along the stretch of Kranji Expressway (KJE) running adjacent to the residential units along Segar Estate and Blossom Residences; and (b) what is the estimated cost of installing such noise barriers on a per metre basis.,1,855,2020-02-03-T-036-S-00855
2020-02-03-T-036,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"To reduce traffic noise along this stretch of the Kranji Expressway (KJE), the Land Transport Authority will implement a low-noise pavement mix for the at-grade section by 1Q2022. Trials have shown that this low-noise pavement mix, is more effective in reducing noise for residents than vertical noise barriers.",1,856,2020-02-03-T-036-S-00856
2020-02-03-T-036,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Noise barriers which cost about $4,000 to $5,000 per metre, are not suitable for this stretch as it will hinder the visibility of on-coming traffic.",2,857,2020-02-03-T-036-S-00857

2020-02-03-T-037,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether any investigation has been carried out in respect of the piracy incidents in the Singapore Strait in and after December 2019; (b) whether the Government has identified the persons or groups responsible for the reported incidents and where they originate from; (c) what action has been taken by any of our government agencies to date; and (d) what are the Government's plans to prevent similar acts of piracy.,1,859,2020-02-03-T-037-S-00859
2020-02-03-T-037,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In December 2019 and January 2020, there were 12 incidents involving piracy and armed robbery against ships in the Singapore Strait. As none of these incidents occurred within Singapore territorial waters, no investigations were required of our agency. If an incident happens within Singapore territorial waters, the Singapore Police Coast Guard (PCG) will investigate where necessary.",1,860,2020-02-03-T-037-S-00860
2020-02-03-T-037,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) works with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and the PCG to closely monitor vessels around and within Singapore territorial waters. Should any suspicious vessel enter Singapore territorial waters, our maritime agencies will respond robustly to safeguard Singapore's security. MPA regularly broadcasts alerts to vessels to be vigilant when travelling along the Singapore Strait, and issues shipping circulars to advise them on measures to prevent and counter piracy and armed robbery. Such measures include surveillance and detection systems, access control measures, and radio and alarm procedures in the event of an attack.",2,861,2020-02-03-T-037-S-00861
2020-02-03-T-037,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As the Singapore Strait does not only include Singapore territorial waters, the fight against piracy and armed robbery requires strong collaboration among all regional partners. The RSN conducts joint coordinated patrols with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand through the Malacca Straits Patrol (MSP), to ensure the safety and security of the Strait of Singapore as well as the Strait of Malacca. The MSP holds regular meetings to enhance coordination, review the conduct of operations, and share intelligence and information.",3,862,2020-02-03-T-037-S-00862
2020-02-03-T-037,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Singapore is also part of a region-wide initiative, the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia, or ReCAAP, which serves to be the information hub in Asia. We encourage the shipping community to provide timely and accurate reporting of incidents to ReCAAP focal points and the nearest coastal state or authority, so that remedial actions can be taken promptly by the respective littoral States.",4,863,2020-02-03-T-037-S-00863
2020-02-03-T-038,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"asked the Prime Minister in light of the recent personal data breach involving the Ministry of Defence, how is the Ministry working with Government agencies to ensure that their third party contractors adopt high standards of cybersecurity and that cybersecurity competency is an essential criterion for awarding of Government contracts.",1,864,2020-02-03-T-038-S-00864
2020-02-03-T-038,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),Third party contractors of Government agencies handling personal data are required to implement cybersecurity and data protection measures. Penalties may be imposed where there are contractual breaches or acts contravening the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).,1,865,2020-02-03-T-038-S-00865
2020-02-03-T-038,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee (PSDSRC). These include measures to strengthen the management of third party contractors that handle data on behalf of the Government, such as incorporating data security and governance requirements into the contract with the third party, and regular audits to ensure compliance. These could have helped to prevent or mitigate similar data incidents. The high standards of data protection that the Government places on itself must also extend to these third parties.",2,866,2020-02-03-T-038-S-00866
2020-02-03-T-038,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),Investigations regarding the recent personal data incidents involving third-party vendors contracted by MINDEF are still underway. GovTech will work with MINDEF to identify any gaps and address them across the public service and its third party vendors.,3,867,2020-02-03-T-038-S-00867
2020-02-03-T-039,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Defence (a) what new tactics have been designed by those responsible for the rise in actual and attempted piracy and robbery cases in the Singapore Strait and its surrounding waters; (b) what measures can be deployed to deter and eliminate such threats; and (c) how will the revised Standard Operating Procedures signed at the 14th Malacca Straits Patrol Joint Coordinating Committee Meeting address the rise in the number of piracy and robbery cases in the straits of Malacca and Singapore.,1,868,2020-02-03-T-039-S-00868
2020-02-03-T-039,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The number of piracy and sea robbery incidents occuring in the Singapore Strait fluctuates considerably from year to year. For example, in years, 2014, 2015 and 2019, there were 48, 104 and 31 such incidents. But in the remaining years over the last decade, the average was around 12. It is therefore difficult to conclude if there will be a persistent increase from the 2019 figures alone, although our maritime agencies are monitoring this closely. What we have determined is that the tactics and modus operandi of the perpetrators remain the same, consisting of petty crime involving the theft of crew belongings, engine parts, or scrap metal. All perpetrators are based and operate outside Singapore's territorial waters, and therefore we are working with our neighbours to share information and collect intelligence, so that Singapore can be better prepared to meet such threats.",1,869,2020-02-03-T-039-S-00869
2020-02-03-T-039,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Against specific incidents, our national maritime agencies can only act in our territorial waters, which we did in two of these incidents, where the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and Police Coast Guard (PCG) boarded these ships to rule out any residual security risks, prior to their entry into Singapore's ports.",2,870,2020-02-03-T-039-S-00870
2020-02-03-T-039,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"For incidents outside our waters, Singapore has longstanding cooperation with navies and coast guards of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to deal with transnational maritime piracy, robbery and other security threats. Most recently, at the 14th Malacca Straits Patrol (MSP) Joint Coordination Committee meeting, the navies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand revised the MSP Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to enhance the region's ability to tackle sea robbery in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. This included a commitment to quarterly exercises to sharpen information exchange processes, as well as an updated set of suspicious contact indicators to assist investigation efforts of sea robbery incidents. Beyond regular conduct of sea and air patrols under the MSP, joint training and exercises as well as information sharing strengthen understanding and collaboration to deal with maritime incidents together.",3,871,2020-02-03-T-039-S-00871
2020-02-03-T-039,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The RSN's Information Fusion Centre (IFC) shares information with our neighbours on a regular basis to aid them in deterring possible perpetrators and successfully responding to sea robbery attempts. For instance, on 18 January this year, the IFC was alerted of a sea robbery incident involving a tugboat towing a barge. The information was shared via the IFC with the Indonesian authorities as the incident had occurred in their waters, which led to the successful arrest of the criminals involved.",4,872,2020-02-03-T-039-S-00872
2020-02-03-T-039,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"On a day-to-day basis, the RSN also works alongside other local maritime agencies such as the PCG and Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) through the Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre (SMCC).

2020-02-03-T-039,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Nevertheless, we agree with Members that additional measures are useful to prevent the further rise in incidence of sea robbery and piracy. We want to step up deeper sharing in information and intelligence with maritime and enforcement agencies within Malaysia and Indonesia. The Maritime Security Task Force (MSTF) is also making plans to restructure itself, including beefing up its assets to deal with such incidents at sea. That review is expected to be complete in the next few months.",6,874,2020-02-03-T-039-S-00874

2020-02-03-T-041,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"When Secondary one students fail to report at their new schools, their respective primary schools will be informed and asked to contact the students and their parents. If they had been absent without good reason, the Primary school will counsel and urge the students to report for school, or the parents to send them to schools. Should the students have any difficulties or are caught in special circumstances, the schools will work with relevant Government agencies and community groups to resolve the issues they are facing.",1,881,2020-02-03-T-041-S-00881
2020-02-03-T-041,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For Secondary school students who are absent on any given day, all schools have in place a system to contact their parents to find out the reasons for their absence.

School counsellors and Student Welfare Officers may also work with the family and other community partners to encourage them to return to school.",2,882,2020-02-03-T-041-S-00882
2020-02-03-T-041,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In addition, we have organised after-school programmes and activities that engage these students by building friendships and relationships with mentors and trusted adults, and generate healthy peer support. Last year, more than 70 Secondary schools have set up after-school centres offering such programmes, and these have benefited more than 3,000 students. This has been scaled up to 120 Secondary schools this year. As a result of coordinated whole-school efforts, the number of Secondary school students who were absent without valid reason for 60 days or more has stabilised at around seven per 1,000 students for the past three years.",3,883,2020-02-03-T-041-S-00883

Schools will identify students who show early signs of absenteeism and refer them to a designated UPLIFT Town-Level Coordinator (TLC) in the Social Service Office. The TLC will then connect the students and their families to suitable local programmes and resources, to build protective safeguards around the student and family earlier, so as to encourage the student to attend school regularly.",5,885,2020-02-03-T-041-S-00885

2020-02-03-T-044,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The bulk of the social media impersonation scams reported in 2019 involved victims revealing their credit card details to a scammer masquerading as a friend or relative. The scammers subsequently used the details to make purchases on various online shopping platforms. In other cases, the scammers impersonated friends or relatives of the victims to ask for loans, which were paid into the scammers' bank accounts.",1,899,2020-02-03-T-044-S-00899
2020-02-03-T-044,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"These scams mostly originated from foreign jurisdictions. It is difficult to identify the scammers, as they operate on the internet using false identities. Hence, convictions are very difficult. Where available, the Police will share information with foreign counterparts to aid their investigations and to trace the stolen funds.",2,900,2020-02-03-T-044-S-00900

In some of these cases, investigations surfaced local parties involved in the movement of the stolen monies, but these local parties did not have knowledge of the actual scams. There have been no prosecutions so far, due to the reasons I shared earlier.",3,901,2020-02-03-T-044-S-00901

2020-02-03-T-044,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Anti-Scam Centre, or ASC, plays two roles in the fight against scams. First, the freezing of suspicious bank accounts that are detected to be involved in scams, typically within a day of notification. Second, obtaining banking information on those accounts, usually within a few days. The quick freezing of bank accounts has increased the recovery rate of victims' funds, from around 4% to 8% prior to the ASC's formation, to approximately 35% today. So far, three local banks and seven foreign banks have started working with the ASC on this. The ASC would like to bring more banks on board.",5,903,2020-02-03-T-044-S-00903

While many licensees already have systems and processes in place, NEA has emphasised to all of them the need to strengthen their systems and uphold high service standards. NEA's follow-up inspections showed that all licensees are complying with these new requirements. NEA will take firm action against any licensee for non-compliance, including suspension or cancellation of the funeral parlour licence in the case of egregious offences.",4,913,2020-02-03-T-046-S-00913

The E&C sector contributes to about 3% of our GDP and employed about 26,000 workers in 2018. However, the industry sector is also a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing about 60% of Singapore’s total emissions in 2017. Around three-quarters of the industry sector's emissions are from the refining and petrochemicals sector.",2,919,2020-02-03-T-047-S-00919

From 2019, facilities in the manufacturing, power generation, waste and water management sectors which emit 25,000 tCO2e or more annually must pay the carbon tax. The current tax rate is set at $5 per tCO2e for the first five years. We will review this by 2023, with the intention of raising the carbon tax rate to $10 to $15 per tCO2e by 2030, taking into account international climate change developments, the progress of our emissions mitigation efforts, and our economic competitiveness.",3,920,2020-02-03-T-047-S-00920

From 2021, these emitters must also establish facility-wide energy management systems and conduct energy efficiency opportunities assessments, which must be submitted to the NEA. To incentivise companies to adopt more energy efficient technologies, the Government also provides funding support which has been increased from the previous cap of 30% to 50% of the qualifying costs since January 2019.",4,921,2020-02-03-T-047-S-00921

2020-02-03-T-048,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"As for the impact of digital finance on businesses and individuals, it is generally positive, because it brings about greater convenience, more accessibility, and in some instances, lower pricing, to banking and financial services. However, it can also mean that consumers are more exposed to products with higher risk, and which requires them to have a higher level of financial literacy.",5,929,2020-02-03-T-048-S-00929

2020-02-03-T-048,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"First, e-payments. We have been driving e-payments because it enhances consumer convenience and business efficiency. Today, more than three out of four Singaporeans between 20 and 75 years old have registered for PayNow, and an estimated 60% of active businesses have registered with PayNow Corporate.

MAS has issued guidelines for e-payments user protection and technology risk management by financial institutions. Financial institutions have to ensure that they implement robust cybersecurity measures. Parliament also enacted the Payment Services Act, so that we have fit-for-purpose regulations that set cyber hygiene standards for different payment services licensees. For consumers, MoneySense is also stepping up education to users, to practise good cyber hygiene, such as setting strong passwords and keeping them secure, and being vigilant against phishing and other scams.",8,932,2020-02-03-T-048-S-00932

2020-02-03-T-051,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"It is important to continue our efforts to reduce the social stigma of mental health conditions such that persons with mental health conditions will face less risk of discrimination. To this end, efforts have been made to increase awareness of and de-stigmatise mental health conditions. For example, the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), in partnership with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), has launched an anti-stigma campaign called ""Beyond the Label"", which seeks to facilitate conversation about mental health, positively influence the public's perception of individuals with mental health conditions, and to educate and equip the public to support them in their recovery. MOH also works with partners such as the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) to educate specific target groups regarding mental well-being, such as through workplaces and schools. MOH has also implemented initiatives under the Community Mental Health Masterplan in 2012 to better identify individuals at risk of mental health conditions and support them with appropriate referrals to access care. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) recently revised their guidelines for job application forms to state that declarations on mental health conditions on job applications forms are discriminatory and should be removed unless there is a good reason to require that information. This was a positive step in de-stigmatising mental health conditions in society.

If the purpose of the data is to persuade MOE to treat the issue seriously, I want to assure Ms Ong that MOE does not need persuasion, because schools are at the frontline in confronting this issue. On the other hand, tabulating and publicising such data can have other implications, such as heightening suicide risk in vulnerable youths.

We need to watch out for possible suicide contagion and intervene when necessary. As for the bereaved families, it is most difficult. We can only do our best to be supportive, to listen and do whatever that is within our means to help. We also partner community agencies, such as SOS, which specialises in rendering such support to the bereaved. Grieving involves many stages. There may be a stage where the bereaved needs someone to blame, and if it is the school, so be it.",7,969,2020-02-03-T-055-S-00969

We are not aware of any divorces undertaken by HDB flat owners purely to circumvent the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) or to avoid buyers' stamp duties.,1,1075,2020-02-03-T-079-S-01075
2020-02-03-T-079,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Following a divorce, the treatment of the matrimonial HDB flat, as stated in the Court Order, is still subject to HDB's rules. Regardless of whether the flat is to be retained by one party or sold on the open market, the parties must satisfy the prevailing eligibility conditions. For example, if the parties wish to sell the flat on the open market, they must have fulfilled the MOP by the divorce date. If the MOP has not been fulfilled and neither party is eligible to retain the flat, the parties would need to surrender the flat to HDB. Depending on the circumstances of the case, HDB may consider granting a special exemption for the divorced couple to sell their flat within their MOP.",2,1076,2020-02-03-T-079-S-01076

2020-02-03-T-080,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"SERS involves compulsory acquisition and is done only on a limited basis, after taking into consideration various factors such as the redevelopment potential of the site, and the availability of suitable replacement sites nearby to rehouse the home-owners involved.  Given these restrictions, we do not expect many more sites to be eligible for SERS. This is why the Government has announced a new Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) to more systematically redevelop and renew our older HDB towns.",2,1079,2020-02-03-T-080-S-01079
2020-02-03-T-081,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry and SLA will look into findings by NUS Business School researchers that property developers could be exchanging information about Government land sales which had led to imputed losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars due to lower winning tender bids.,1,1080,2020-02-03-T-081-S-01080

In any case, MND has looked at the 103 GLS tenders awarded during the period referenced by the NUS study. For all of these tenders, multiple bids were received, ranging from three to as high as 23 bids for each site. More than 80 per cent of the tenders had five bids or more. All tenders were awarded to the tenderers with the highest acceptable bids, and these were broadly in line with or higher than independent estimates of the market value of the sites.",2,1082,2020-02-03-T-081-S-01082
2020-02-03-T-081,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In the event there is reason to suspect any collusion or freak result, the Government will take the necessary actions, including closing the tender without award, or take enforcement action should there be any infringement of the law.",3,1083,2020-02-03-T-081-S-01083

NEA has disallowed their usage for dine-in meals at all seven new hawker centres, and at five existing hawker centres which have adopted the use of common crockery and centralised dishwashing services under the Productive Hawker Centres programme. In addition, from September 2018, NEA does not allow new cooked food stallholders who commence their tenancies at existing hawker centres to provide disposables to patrons for dine-in meals. NEA works closely with the Hawkers' Associations and our appointed operators to ensure that these stallholders do not use disposables for dine-in meals. NEA does not collect statistics on the number of stalls that provide disposable utensils for dine-in customers.",1,1101,2020-02-03-T-086-S-01101
2020-02-03-T-086,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"NEA is actively engaging the remaining stallholders to phase out the use of disposables for dine-in meals. Some concerns that stallholders commonly cite are the cost of reusable crockery and the cost of manpower required to wash crockery. On this front, we are working to introduce centralised dishwashing services at more hawker centres, and we have a grant scheme in place to defray some of the costs. We will continue to engage stallholders through the Hawkers' Associations to encourage them to switch to reusables.",2,1102,2020-02-03-T-086-S-01102

The GFA is taken from ""as-built"" information submitted to the building authority when the schools were developed or upgraded, and is further verified by MOE's Managing Agents prior to tender calling. Tenderers also visit a typical Primary school, Secondary school and Junior College to familiarise themselves with the nature and scope of services expected of them.",1,1105,2020-02-03-T-087-S-01105

2020-02-03-T-087,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The existing cleaning contract generally does not allow for price adjustments due to temporary changes or marginal discrepancies in GFA. Tenderers know that the numbers in the specifications serve as a guide, and it is in the interest of all parties not to have a tendering system that is too exact and detailed, as that will add administrative burden to everyone and can end up creating more disputes. However, if a new category of school infrastructure is added to an existing school site, such as adding a MOE Kindergarten, the price would be adjusted to include the new areas to be cleaned.",3,1107,2020-02-03-T-087-S-01107
