2015-02-23-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the total and average amounts of subsidies given by the Government for public transportation for each Singaporean in the past five years; (b) how do such subsidies compare with those in all the major cities in the world; and (c) whether such subsidies can be sustained or increased without it being a burden to taxpayers.,1,1,2015-02-23-T-001-S-00001
2015-02-23-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mdm Speaker, the Government subsidises public transportation through its funding of the infrastructure and start-up costs of the rail and bus network. These include the rail tracks and systems such as signalling and power systems, MRT and LRT stations, bus depots, ticketing systems and the first set of trains for new MRT lines. We have also been buying new trains to expand capacity and subsidising higher service levels for commuters under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme which would otherwise have required fares to increase by more than 15 cents per journey. In addition, the Government has started providing direct fare subsidy to lower wage workers and persons with disabilities since last year. In total, about $14 billion has been deployed to the public transport system over the past five years. Another $26 billion has been committed for the next five. This works out to close to $4 billion per year over 10 years.",1,2,2015-02-23-T-001-S-00002
2015-02-23-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),,2,3,2015-02-23-T-001-S-00003
2015-02-23-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"It is not appropriate to compare the amount of subsidies between countries as there may be vast differences in ridership, income, service levels, coverage and operating costs. To the Singapore commuter, what is most pertinent is that our fares are affordable. The Government has committed to ensuring that this will remain so.",3,4,2015-02-23-T-001-S-00004
2015-02-23-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),,4,5,2015-02-23-T-001-S-00005
2015-02-23-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"As Mr Gan rightly pointed out, while keeping fares affordable, it is also important to ensure that the burden on taxpayers does not become excessive. Thus, we will still need to review fares regularly and keep to a public transport system that we can sustain financially.",5,6,2015-02-23-T-001-S-00006
2015-02-23-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance over the past 10 years (a) how many public sector projects with an approved value of S$100 million or more each have overrun budgeted costs by at least 50%; and (b) what is the combined value of the cost overrun from all of these projects.,1,7,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00007
2015-02-23-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,asked  the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what is the basis for selecting S$500 million as the cut-off point below which public sector projects need not be subjected to the Gateway Process; (b) whether there are plans to extend the Gateway Process to projects between S$100 million and S$500 million; and (c) whether there are plans to make available to the public the reports of completed public sector projects made by the Value-for-Money Review Office.,1,8,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00008
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 2 and 3 together?",1,9,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00009
2015-02-23-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,10,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00010
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Mr Yee Jenn Jong asked for data regarding major public projects. Let me first outline the approval framework for major projects funded by the Government.,1,11,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00011
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"A system is in place and has been strengthened over the years, with emphasis on fiscal prudence, transparency and accountability. It involves rigorous assessment of proposals by the Ministry in charge of the project as well as MOF. The system also subjects projects of higher value and risk to greater scrutiny; proposals must pass several rounds of reviews by specialists before tenders are called and works allowed to begin.",2,12,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00012
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Examples of projects exceeding $100 million which Mr Yee asked about include the construction of hospitals, waterworks and MRT projects like the Downtown and Thomson Lines. After a major project proposal by a Ministry or Statutory Board passes its review by MOF, budget approval must be obtained from the Development Planning Committee or DPC which comprises three Ministers before it is allowed to proceed. The three Ministers are the Minister for Finance, Minister for Trade and Industry, and the Minister overseeing the Ministry which submitted the project proposal.",3,13,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00013
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"If a project is estimated to cost above $500 million, it is put through the Gateway Process where it is subject to a series of further reviews before it is submitted to the DPC for budget approval. These projects are reviewed by the Development Projects Advisory Panel, which comprises senior public officers and industry practitioners with deep technical expertise and experience in major infrastructure development. The reviews seek to optimise the overall design, space take-up and cost-effectiveness of the project, and include the Value Management workshops which bring key project stakeholders together to refine the project design. This process helps to ensure that projects draw on the relevant expertise and best practices within and outside the public sector.",4,14,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00014
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The Gateway Process described above is mandatory for all projects with estimated budgets exceeding $500 million. Complex major projects of smaller values may also be subject to the same process before they are allowed to proceed. One example is the Goh Keng Swee Centre of Excellence.,5,15,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00015
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We have found the Gateway Process to be highly relevant in providing a useful second opinion to agencies' project plans. For example, the Gateway review of the Singapore University of Technology and Design campus project helped to reduce the footprint of the campus, thus freeing up land for other purposes. This was achieved through the re-routing of a service driveway and the relocation of the tennis courts to the roof of the indoor sports hall instead of on the adjacent ground.",6,16,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00016
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The process I have outlined above ensures that project proposals submitted to the DPC for approvals have been carefully assessed. Therefore, the budgets approved by the DPC are best estimates, which, for projects such as the construction of hospitals or MRT lines, are generally determined by broad cost norms of projects with comparable scope and design.",7,17,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00017
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"When a tender is eventually called by the Ministry or Statutory Board in charge of the project, there is also independent assessment before an award decision is made. To ensure impartiality and transparency, the tender approving authority comprises individuals who are neither involved in project proposal or implementation and officers handling procurement must declare and excuse themselves if there is conflict of interest, for instance, if they are related to any of the bidders. This helps to ensure that the tender process is a fair and transparent way for true price discovery.",8,18,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00018
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Given the complex nature of major projects, there can be material changes to the project scope or design between the time budget approval is obtained and when tenders are called. The tender prices may also exceed the original budget estimates by more than the acceptable thresholds specified during the approval process. Further, for major construction projects, there may be price fluctuation clauses for key materials, so that contractors do not have to bear the financial risks when those prices change in response to market forces. This means that it is quite possible that the budget needs adjustment after approval if there are sharp increases in material prices during the construction phase.",9,19,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00019
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"For higher value projects, any cost increase exceeding 10% or $100 million, whichever is lower, will be scrutinised again by MOF to ensure that there are valid reasons for the budget revisions. For proper accountability, the agency must also seek re-approval from the three Ministers in the Development Planning Committee.",10,20,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00020
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Taken together, there is a well-functioning system of checks and balances to ensure prudent use of public funds. Cost increases from the original budget must also be justified and documented before projects are allowed to continue.",11,21,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00021
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In the past 10 years, there had been 12 public sector projects with original budgeted cost of $100 million or more which experienced more than 50% increases in project costs, with a majority of these occurring between 2007 and 2010. The total value of cost increases was $13 billion, of which nearly 80% was attributable to the Downtown Line and Marina Coastal Expressway. To put this amount in context, this is out of over $100 billion in expenditure for public infrastructure over the same period.",12,22,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00022
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"One key reason was the sharp increase in construction costs as a result of global demand and supply factors which drove prices of materials and resources significantly above cost norms used in the original budget estimates. This factor alone contributed to almost half of the cost increases. As was fully explained by the Minister for Transport in Parliament in 2012, market prices for key materials such as steel bars and concrete spiraled upwards by 60% and 14% respectively from late 2007 to mid 2008, leading to higher costs for the Downtown MRT Line.",13,23,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00023
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The project budget for the Downtown Line was also increased to accommodate one more station as well as to provide for more entrances and underground links to improve connectivity and access for commuters.,14,24,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00024
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Unforeseeable findings are another key driver of cost increases. When conducting detailed soil investigations for the Marina Coastal Expressway, for example, LTA discovered that certain stretches of the proposed Expressway would have to be built in soil conditions that were weaker than originally thought. To ensure safety during construction, LTA had to put in more robust and deeper temporary structures and perform additional works to improve the soil.",15,25,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00025
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In all of the above projects, MOF independently scrutinised the cost increases and verified them against the prevailing industry data. The relevant agencies then sought re-approval from the Development Planning Committee. In other words, they had to go back to the Development Planning Committee, explain the process of verifying the items that led to the cost increases that had already been scrutinised by MOF, and then proceeded, only if the DPC had granted re-approval.",16,26,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00026
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In addition to the introduction of the Gateway Process in 2010, the Centre for Public Project Management was also set up in 2011 to improve cost management for major projects. In recent years, we have seen fewer cases of tender prices being significantly higher than their original budget estimates.",17,27,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00027
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Mr Yee has also asked if there are plans to make public the reports of completed public sector projects by the Value-for-Money Review Office. These reports are part of the public sector's internal processes to help identify learning points and best practices. They include sensitive information such as internal tender deliberations and cost norms that could result in less competitive bidding from tenderers if revealed.,18,28,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00028
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Nonetheless, like other internal documents, such as internal audit reports or project approval papers, these are made available to the Auditor-General's Office, or AGO, for their regular review. Where there are concerns in relation to irregularities or extravagance or waste in the expenditure of Government agencies, AGO has the authority to conduct audits and will report the matter publicly and table their reports to Parliament if warranted.",19,29,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00029
2015-02-23-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the very comprehensive answers. I just have a couple of supplementary questions. The first is on the Gateway Process. I understand that other governments, such as the Australian government, also have some sort of a gateway process, and their cut-off is at $30 million for projects and $50 million for programmes. I was wondering if our $500 million threshold is set a little too high.",1,30,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00030
2015-02-23-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Also, for those projects below $500 million, I understand the Senior Minister of State said that some projects are also subjected to a similar process. Given that there are some projects that are above $100 million that have also significant budget overruns, is the current process effective without this Gateway Process, and should we extend the Gateway Process to maybe a lower threshold?",2,31,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00031
2015-02-23-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Lastly, on the Value-for-Money Review Office report, I was wondering if it is possible for certain sensitive information to be de-sensitised. For example, tender prices and so on may not have to be put in, but perhaps the key lessons learnt so that public projects could be more accountable to the public and for people to look at to see what are the learning points for everybody.",3,32,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00032
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Madam, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. I should add that although there are occasions where the project costs are higher than originally estimated, there are equally projects with cost savings. In other words, the utilised budget is actually less than what was originally estimated. One that I can think of immediately is LTA's own provision of barrier-free accessibility to current MRT and LRT lines. The utilised budget was almost $30 million lower than the original approved budget of $116 million. It turned out that it was only $87 million when the original approved budget was $116 million.",1,33,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00033
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The point that I am trying to make is that it is not always the case that actual project costs are higher than the budgeted estimate. When we think about the process that we would subject major project proposals to, we have also got to weigh the time as well as the significant administrative resources that will have to be put in, in order to fulfil the review requirements appropriately and to make sure that the reviews are thorough. So, if you want to do a proper job of the reviews, you have got to set aside the proper resources.",2,34,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00034
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As a result, the approach that we adopt is to look at project proposals based on value and also the risk that could be involved. As I had mentioned in the reply earlier, the Gateway Process is mandatory for projects that have an estimated budget of $500 million or more, but if there are projects of smaller value, we do not hesitate to put them through the Gateway Process if we assess that the risk involved is significant as well.",3,35,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00035
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As to what the appropriate threshold would be, I think we have to look at our own situations and also look back at projects for which tenders have been called and compare them against our estimates. So far, it appears that this $500 million threshold works reasonably well for us. But we take the Member's suggestion into consideration. If there is a need to revise the threshold, we would consider doing so.",4,36,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00036
2015-02-23-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Member's other question relates to Value-for-Money or VFM Review Office reports. I should say that while the VFM reports are not publicly published, it does not mean that the findings and learning points are not shared within the Government. In fact, there is a very deliberate effort to share the findings and learnings through forums such as Cabinet meetings, Committee of Permanent Secretaries meetings, Director of Finance meetings and agencies' own internal forums. The Centre for Public Project Management also collates best practices in managing infrastructure projects and shares those across the public service through various physical and online platforms. So, in response to the Member's question, there is a very deliberate effort to make sure that the learnings are shared. We will continue to do so to make sure that best practices continue to be adopted across the public sector.",5,37,2015-02-23-T-002-S-00037
2015-02-23-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many constituencies have benefited from HDB's Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) from 2007-2014; (b) which are the constituencies that have benefited from NRP after 2011; and (c) what is the total amount of monies disbursed for NRP from 2007-2014.,1,38,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00038
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for National Development),"Madam, since its launch, 100 projects have been selected for the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme or NRP, benefiting 22 constituencies.",1,39,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00039
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for National Development),,2,40,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00040
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for National Development),"However, selection of projects is not by constituencies, but at the Town Council or TC level. This allows MND to ensure a good geographical spread of projects, while at the same time better meet the preferences of the TCs. As part of the selection process, TCs are required to nominate and prioritise their preferred precincts and MND will strive to meet them within the limits of the approved NRP budget. Since 2011, 41 projects have been selected, with each TC getting from one to five projects each. The only exception is the East Coast TC where all eligible NRP blocks had already been selected.",3,41,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00041
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for National Development),,4,42,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00042
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for National Development),"From FY2007 to FY2013, about $150 million has been disbursed under the NRP.",5,43,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00043
2015-02-23-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"I have four supplementary questions in regard to the NRP. What was the first constituency chosen as the first batch or sites to have undergone NRP in 2007, and when were these flats built? Can the Minister of State let the House know who are the people comprised in the Committee to decide which sites in a constituency are eligible for NRP? Why is Toa Payoh Lorong 8 first, although some of the flats were built as early as 1974? What is the timeframe for public consultation by residents for feedback for NRP?",1,44,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00044
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Madam, perhaps I can clarify. The Neighbourhood Renewal Programme or NRP was announced in 2007. The NRP focuses on blocks and neighbourhood improvements, and is implemented on the neighbourhood basis, if it is more than two or more constituency precincts. It is meant for blocks that are built up to December 1989 but have not undergone any Main Upgrading Programme or MUP, or Interim Upgrading Programme or IUP, or IUP Plus. So, we do not do NRP for precincts that have already undergone some of these upgrading programmes.",1,45,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00045
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The question was what were the first few constituencies. I do not have the details of the breakdown by constituency from when we started out 2007. But just to say that, as I had mentioned earlier, we give it by Town Council. We ask the Town Councils to nominate. When we started out, we were trying to see how to implement the projects. So, at that point in time, not all Town Councils may have received or selected their nominated precincts.",2,46,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00046
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Since 2011, we have started ramping up. At that point, LUP was coming to the tail end of the programme. By 2011, we were able to select at least one nominated precinct by each of the Town Council.",3,47,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00047
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"On the timeframe, the challenges in NRP are that it works differently from the LUP and the other upgrading programmes. Because residents are not required to pay and the works are done externally, NRP requires a lot more consultations because of the space that is being upgraded. There is a two-stage consultation process  one is the public consultation; and the other is the consensus-gathering stage. The engagement process is very critical. First, it really depends on the size of the precinct that has been nominated and selected. Secondly, it really depends on the level of consultation and the extent to which the residents can find consensus in terms of the kind of works that they would like to have. This would engender greater ownership for the works done.",4,48,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00048
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"It is very difficult to say what is the average timeframe. It usually takes four to five years in total, from nomination to completion. But some may complete earlier, depending on the consensus built by the residents on the kind of works that they want to have.",5,49,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00049
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The other objective of the NRP is to encourage greater community spirit in the community, so that neighbours come together and come to the realisation of the kinds of things they can and want to have and, at the same time, meet the various needs of the demographic profiles of that particular neighbourhood.",6,50,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00050
2015-02-23-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"I have another supplementary question for the Minister of State. As mentioned in my Parliamentary Question, under (b), what are the constituencies that have benefited from NRP after 2011?",1,51,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00051
2015-02-23-T-003,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Madam, as I have said in my reply, we do not select the projects at the constituency level. We select them based on those nominated by the Town Councils. As of now, 22 constituencies have benefited from the NRP projects. All TCs have nominated since 2011. At least one project by each TC has been selected since 2011.",1,52,2015-02-23-T-003-S-00052
2015-02-23-T-004,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there is an increase in the public transport operators' operating costs last year; and (b) what will be the projected increase for the next two years.,1,53,2015-02-23-T-004-S-00053
2015-02-23-T-004,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mdm Speaker, both operators had seen higher operating expenses last year as can be seen from their most recent quarterly reports. For SBS Transit, for the period January 2014 to December 2014, operating costs increased by 11.8% or $98.6 million over the same period in 2013. SMRT's operating costs during the period April 2014 to December 2014 increased by 3.3% or $27.6 million, over the same period one year ago.",1,54,2015-02-23-T-004-S-00054

2015-02-23-T-004,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Transport),"It is not appropriate for my Ministry to project the two operators' costs, given that they are publicly listed companies. However, generally speaking, while public transport operators are seeing lower energy costs today, other operating costs such as salaries for bus drivers and other public transport workers may continue to rise. We also expect their operating and maintenance costs to rise when LTA tightens the operating standards from 2016.",3,56,2015-02-23-T-004-S-00056

Every employer must look for the potential in their people, and put time and effort into developing this potential with them. It also means looking out for mid-career Singaporeans who are temporarily dislocated, and helping them to get back in, get retrained where necessary and contribute their worth. And it matters greatly too when employees are empowered. The most innovative companies find that ideas come from people from all across the enterprise – whether for an improved workflow, a new colour or design, or a better way to reach customers' hearts.",46,118,2015-02-23-T-007-S-00118

We do not have the long tradition of collaboration in countries like Germany and Switzerland, where it, in fact, started with medieval guilds and companies join forces to develop skills for the whole industry. We do not have that long tradition. We have to develop our own tradition and find practical means to deepen collaboration, industry by industry.

Changi is part of the lifeblood of our economy. T5 will be almost as large as T1 to T3 combined. It is a critical investment that will yield benefits for decades to come. It will enable Changi to keep its role as a leading hub for international transit, and create connections to emerging cities in Asia and globally. We are starting now, but the whole project will take more than 10 years.

It provided some support for the homeless or those suffering from malnutrition. By the end of this year, we will have 24 Social Service Offices or SSOs in our HDB towns to disburse social assistance and coordinate social services for those in difficulty. That is 24 ""Hock Lee Pors"", closer to the ground and each providing a wider range of social support for Singaporeans who fall into difficult times. Plus we will have many more Senior Activity Centres and Eldercare Centres to provide recreation and care for our seniors near their homes. So, it is a transformed landscape of social support – we have enhanced not just the schemes, not just the subsidies, but the network on the ground, close to where people live.",61,133,2015-02-23-T-007-S-00133

It will be a major new feature in our social security system. While Workfare systematically enhances the incomes of the bottom 20% to 30% of lower-wage Singaporeans during their working years, Silver Support will supplement incomes for 20% to 30% of seniors in their retirement years, with greater support going to the least well-off among them.

We are collecting more revenues because of the tightening of foreign worker levies, but we are more than flowing it back to the businesses. Most of this support is targeted at our SMEs. This year alone, the amount that we will flow back to our SMEs is expected to be more than one-and-a-half times the additional foreign worker levies that they will pay.

2015-02-23-T-007,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The first pillar, home ownership. The first strength of our social security system is that the vast majority of Singaporean households are homeowners. And over 80% of our lower-income households, those in the bottom 20% of incomes own their homes. However, many are asset-rich and cash-poor in retirement, which is a problem if their children are not supporting them.

In its early days, when most Singaporeans did not own homes and wages were low, the CPF worked more like a savings scheme for home ownership. From the 1980s, we began rebalancing the CPF system towards retirement and healthcare needs. In recent years, we raised interest rates on the Special and Retirement Accounts, and introduced an extra 1% interest to benefit the lower- and middle-income groups. With growing life expectancy, we introduced CPF LIFE to provide assurance of lifelong payouts.",193,265,2015-02-23-T-007-S-00265

We have also increased subsidies significantly at our public healthcare institutions for all lower- and middle-income Singaporeans, besides our Pioneers. MediShield Life will now give all Singaporeans protection against large medical bills and here, too, we have introduced substantial Government support.

Just looking at his total contributions coming out of his wages, he could have accumulated about $50,000 in his CPF. His current CPF balance would be lower, as he has probably tapped on his CPF to buy their flat. His wife was a homemaker for much of her life and has little CPF. They should be able to receive up to $750 per person every three months, or $1,500 for the two of them together.

Many can also choose to get cash by unlocking the value in their homes, such as by using the enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme or the Silver Housing Bonus, or by renting out a room or the whole flat.

2015-02-23-T-007,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Hence, we have designed our system such that we have lower overall taxes than most countries, but nevertheless maintain a highly progressive regime. The higher-income group makes a significant net contribution into the system, which enables the lower-income group in turn to get significantly more benefits than the taxes they pay.",326,398,2015-02-23-T-007-S-00398

2015-02-23-T-007,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Our first move was to make our property tax regime more progressive. In Budget 2010, we moved from a flat owner-occupier tax rate for residential properties and introduced progressive tax rates which tax properties with higher annual values more. In Budget 2013, to further increase progressivity, we added more tiers of tax rates and we also introduced progressive tax rates for non-owner occupied residential properties. These changes were made over two years, with the latest tax rate schedule taking effect from 1 January 2015.",329,401,2015-02-23-T-007-S-00401

2015-02-23-T-007,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Nevertheless, we have been making our income tax regime more progressive in recent years. In Budget 2011, we reduced personal income taxes significantly for the middle-income, without changing the tax rates for high-income earners. We have also introduced and enhanced negative income taxes for our lower-income groups. Workfare, which is a negative income tax, was introduced in 2007 and enhanced in 2012. Likewise, this year we will be introducing Silver Support, also a negative income tax, for those in retirement who had low incomes.",332,404,2015-02-23-T-007-S-00404

Companies can also do their part. For example, the RENEW (REcycling Nation's Electronic Waste) programme by StarHub, recycling company TES-AMM and DHL makes it easier for Singaporeans to recycle their electronic products by providing e-waste recycling bins across Singapore.
