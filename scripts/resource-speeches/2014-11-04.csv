2014-11-04-T-001,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs),"The measures under consideration include restricting public consumption of liquor and the hours for retail sales of liquor. MHA will consider public and industry feedback, and take into account the experience from the alcohol restrictions imposed in Little India following the riot in December last year. We have also been studying the practices in foreign jurisdictions. In states like South Australia and Texas, for example, the consumption of alcohol in public places is not allowed at times when problems associated with alcohol consumption are more significant.",3,4,2014-11-04-T-001-S-00004
2014-11-04-T-001,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs),"In deciding on the measures to adopt in Singapore, we will balance the diverse interests of various stakeholders including residents and businesses.

Let me start by explaining the rationale and criteria for the two commemorative events that the Member had asked about.",1,9,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00009
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)","The marker on the fight against Communism commemorates Singapore's long struggle against the violence and subversion of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) from 1948 to 1989. It pays tribute to all those who braved Communist violence and intimidation, and especially those who lost their lives and made sacrifices to secure a non-Communist future for Singapore.",2,10,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00010
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)","In June 1948, a state of Emergency was declared when the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) launched an armed insurrection in a bid to establish a Communist regime in Malaya, including Singapore. Eight thousand civilians and security personnel were killed or wounded during the insurgency in Malaya and Singapore. In Singapore, at least 28 civilians and security personnel, including 11 police officers, were killed as a result of Communist violence. Many others survived Communist attempts on their lives, although some suffered serious life-altering injuries.",3,11,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00011
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)","One such person was Abdul Wahid Baba, who was a young 21-year-old Police constable on duty in Geylang when Communist gunmen shot him in September 1950. He was paralysed from the waist down, but the tragedy did not stop him from reclaiming his life and contributing to society. Despite being wheelchair-bound, Abdul Wahid went on to represent Singapore at the Paralympics and Pacific Games. He passed away in 2011 at the age of 83.",4,12,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00012

He personally witnessed the violence of the Communists, especially immediately after the war and confronted pro-Communist activists in the trade unions, where he worked in the 1960s. Mr Nathan will be the guest of honour at the event to unveil the marker. That is on the marker to mark the fight against Communism.",5,13,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00013
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)","The other marker is the Konfrontasi memorial, and this will honour those who lost their lives and suffered, as well as those who fought during Konfrontasi. It will remind us of a significant episode at our birth as a nation that threatened our very existence.",6,14,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00014
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)","As Members would know, Konfrontasi was a campaign using armed forces waged by President Sukarno of Indonesia from 1963 to 1966, to oppose the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. During this time, the First and Second Battalions of the Singapore Infantry Regiment (1 SIR and 2 SIR), the only two regular army units that we had, were deployed elsewhere in Malaysia. Home-front defence was entrusted to the Singapore Volunteer Corps (SVC) and the Vigilante Corps (VC). The VC was established in 1964. Within two months, more than 10,000 people had volunteered.",7,15,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00015
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)","During Konfrontasi, Singaporeans experienced dark days of insecurity. In Kota Tinggi, soldiers from 2 SIR were injured and killed in combat. But civilians were targeted too. In Singapore, there were at least 42 bombing attempts. Thirty seven bombs exploded, claiming seven lives and injuring at least 50 others.",8,16,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00016
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)","Both conflicts – the struggle against Communism and Konfrontasi – not only claimed lives but fundamentally threatened Singapore's sovereignty and security. Had the Communist side won, we would be living in a totally different Singapore today. Likewise, if Sukarno's campaign to ""crush Malaysia"" had succeeded. So, it is important to have tangible landmarks to help younger and future generations of Singaporeans understand how we got here, and why it was critical that our forefathers supported and fought for the security and future of Singapore. We should honour the memory of innocent civilians who became casualties, as well as brave defenders who sacrificed life and limb to protect our way of life. These landmarks will also remind us to stay vigilant, and maintain a strong defence to safeguard our peace and security.",9,17,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00017
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)",The Member also asked about the significance of the dates and the sites chosen for the landmarks. The marker on the fight against Communism will be unveiled on 8 December this year. December will be the 25th anniversary of the signing of the 1989 Haadyai Peace Agreements between the CPM and the governments of Malaysia and Thailand. The agreements marked the formal end to the campaign of violence and subversion by the CPM and its satellite organisations to replace the legitimately elected governments of Singapore and Malaysia with a Communist regime that lasted four decades.,10,18,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00018
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)","We will place the marker in the Esplanade Park along Queen Elizabeth Walk. This is a central and prominent location in the Civic District, close to other historical memorials, namely, the Cenotaph, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial and the Tan Kim Seng Fountain, which have been collectively gazetted as a National Monument. By putting these markers and memorials together, we create a larger sense of Singapore's history and the context of our early years.",11,19,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00019
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)","The Konfrontasi memorial will be located opposite MacDonald House, on the Dhoby Ghaut Lawn. This reminds us of the events of 10 March 1965 – a date remembered by many as the darkest day of Konfrontasi, when a bomb planted by two Indonesian saboteurs exploded at MacDonald House, killing three innocent civilians and injuring 33 others. Mdm Elizabeth Choo and Ms Juliet Goh died at the scene, while Mr Mohammed Yasin bin Kesit died two days later from his injuries.",12,20,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00020
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)","In recent months, the Home Team has received feedback from some retired police officers. They recalled episodes of Communist violence, assassinations, student demonstrations and labour strikes, and asked that recognition be given to those who fought the Communists. The idea for the Konfrontasi memorial was suggested by the Singapore Armed Forces Veterans' League earlier this year. In fact, even before that, members of the public had written letters suggesting various commemorative efforts for the MacDonald House bombing.",13,21,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00021

As Singapore prepares to celebrate 50 years of independence next year, it is important to reflect on our collective past and the struggles that we underwent to build today's safe, secure and prosperous Singapore. The Government and the people must continue to work together to instil in all of us, especially the younger generation, an awareness of the history that underpins our shared identity as a nation.",14,22,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00022

2014-11-04-T-003,Tan Tai Yong,Prof Tan Tai Yong (Nominated Member),"I thank the Minister for explaining the rationale for the establishment of these markers. The Minister may be aware that there are also efforts by students in our schools to find, for instance, the locations where the Maria Hertogh riots and the Hock Lee bus riots had occurred. This is no mean task, given the rapid physical changes that are happening in Singapore. So, I want to ask the Minister if there are plans to incorporate some of these ground-up, organic initiatives by members of the public as we seek to commemorate significant events in our history.",1,24,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00024
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I share very much the Member's suggestion that the efforts to commemorate our history ought to incorporate a very strong ground-up element. I would first say that even for the two markers that are being proposed, these were markers that had been initiated also through extensive ground-up feedback, suggestions from the communities that were involved and were affected. The Government's efforts now to have these two commemorative markers are, in many ways, a response to the community feedback.",1,25,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00025
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Member is absolutely right that there are many other ground-up efforts and we are very keen to support these ground-up efforts and initiatives. At the school level, for SG50 next year, MOE has been discussing with the schools to do quite an extensive heritage trial to let the students initiate these. This project will be student-initiated. They will look at history from their perspective and they will find markers or historic sites which they would like to commemorate. These will be done as part of an SG50 event for the schools. This will range from Primary schools to University students. That is something that is already happening at the school level.",2,26,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00026
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"At the community level, there are quite a number of community groups that are very interested in marking the historic sites within their respective communities. A good example is a community group from Queenstown. They had come together and put together and documented the history of Queenstown, our first satellite town. The town has just celebrated its 60th anniversary recently and they had put in place markers to document and commemorate some of the historic sites. These were supported by the National Heritage Board (NHB).",3,27,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00027
2014-11-04-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"NHB will continue to support these ground-up community efforts, both in the community and within the schools. We have also launched a heritage grant scheme so that our support also comes in the form of providing resources. I am happy to say that since the scheme was launched in July last year, NHB has committed almost $3 million in funding to a range of over 90 projects, initiated by individuals and community groups to collectively strengthen our sense of history and heritage. We will continue to support these ground-up efforts.",4,28,2014-11-04-T-003-S-00028

A recent WHO report on shisha smoking stated that the misconceptions, together with the social nature of shisha smoking, have contributed to an increase in shisha smoking globally, particularly among young people, which raises further concerns that shisha smoking may serve as a gateway to cigarette smoking.",2,31,2014-11-04-T-004-S-00031

The National Health Survey 2010 showed that 7.8% of young adults aged 18-29 years smoke shisha at least occasionally, compared to 1% among older adults. The Student Health Survey found that the proportion of students who used alternative tobacco products, including shisha, had increased from 2% in 2009 to 9% in 2012. In another study conducted by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), three in five, or 61.1%, shisha smokers wrongly believed that smoking shisha was less harmful than cigarettes.",3,32,2014-11-04-T-004-S-00032

However, as a transitional measure, existing licensed tobacco importers and retailers who import or sell shisha tobacco will be allowed to continue importing and retailing shisha tobacco until 31 July 2016. This allows such importers and retailers ample time to deplete their stock and restructure their businesses away from the shisha business. My Ministry will also continue to enhance public education efforts on the harms of shisha smoking.",5,34,2014-11-04-T-004-S-00034

The Parliamentary Secretary has quite correctly pointed out the two greatest risks  first, the misconception that shisha smoking is fairly innocuous whereas there is an increasing body of evidence which tends to show that it may be as dangerous as the normal forms of tobacco smoking. The other big concern is, of course, it might be a gateway to —",1,35,2014-11-04-T-004-S-00035

Through HPB and its partners, we will continue to share and engage the public on the harmful effects of shisha and its addictive nature. For example, we have engaged community organisations as well as schools, ITE, Polytechnics, Universities and we have shared with them online materials as well as printed resources on the harmful effects of shisha.

2014-11-04-T-005,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The next supplementary question is  will the Ministry set a plan for a more ambitious target to have all Primary schools to have school-based SCCs and, if so, by when?",2,57,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00057
2014-11-04-T-005,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Lastly, I would like to know whether there will be any plan jointly by MOE and MSF to look at how to encourage more operators and teachers into this sector. For example, there are some schemes in the pre-schools, such as training grants, set-up grants and fee subsidies for all Singapore parents. So, while there are some schemes currently in place for SCCs, would the Minister agree that the support level for student care is currently far less than what is given out in the pre-school sector, and it may be hard to encourage operators and teachers into this sector under the current arrangements?",3,58,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00058
2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I thank Mr Yee for his question. I think the Member's first two questions are similar, which is what is our view on the number. As I have mentioned, first, we got to look at this in perspective. We have over 300 SCCs in the community already. When we started, we had less than 50. I announced at successive Budget debates, during our Committee of Supply debates, a very steady expansion in our SCCs in our schools. I have also mentioned how we look at the needs in the school on a localised level and we expand it steadily. So, the Member's question as to whether we have a view of how many more SCCs we need, the answer is yes, we do. And where there is a demand, we will try and meet those demands. But any expansion has to be done taking into account the need for quality and affordability. This is not an area where you expand in a haphazard way.",1,59,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00059
2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"As to the Member's third question as to whether we could look at schemes to encourage more operators and teachers to get into this area, this is a subject that we are studying. We will see what we might do.",2,60,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00060
2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"But let me say that the student care centres, apart from those that are school-based, the value that they bring is not just in providing an after-school care service. The value that they bring is in working with our schools. We are also looking at the very operational aspects of it, as to how we can enhance the value if they are based in the schools.",3,61,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00061

2014-11-04-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thank you, Madam. While I appreciate the effort by MOE to increase the number of student care centres – 40 as stated by the Minister – clearly from the demand that we see on the ground, we need these faster and we need even more centres. I know of centres that have 30 places, but they have a waiting list of another 50 students. I hope that the Minister sees that we can speed this up and provide more places.",1,63,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00063
2014-11-04-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The second question is whether we can better harness the VWOs, both the capabilities that they have and the passion that they have for getting into student care. We used to have this in the past and I thought we should look at further incentives or even some concessionary rates for them to use the void deck space for student care centres. The schools may not all have the space for student care centres, or to gear up so quickly. In conjunction with the schools ramping up capacity, maybe the VWOs can also play a part.",2,64,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00064
2014-11-04-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thirdly, would MOE consider having MOE-run student care centres? I understand that most of these are handed out by way of GeBIZ to private commercial operators. Similar to how MOE runs the MOE Kindergartens, MOE can look at doing their own student care centres as well.",3,65,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00065
2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I thank Mr Liang for his follow-up questions. First, whether we can speed up the setting up of student care centres, I would like to do things as quickly as possible. But I think the key, as I had mentioned, is that we got to ensure that quality is maintained. To the extent that these operators and the staff are coming into contact with our students, we want to ensure that the right people are attracted to this sector and that they are doing the right things.",1,66,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00066
2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On whether we should work with VWOs, in fact, some of the VWOs which are operating in the student care centres – whether in the community or school-based ones – have done a good job. We are indeed looking at how we can work with VWOs in expanding these student care centres.",2,67,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00067
2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On the Member's third question on whether MOE should run the student care centres ourselves, MOE has a very big plate already. We have many issues to tackle. What I would like to add is that many of our schools do run programmes for our students after school. As a school system, compared to many other school systems in the world, we run a very large number of programmes in our Primary and Secondary schools – CCAs, club activities, having students stay back in the library to study and so on. We run a very large number of programmes. Therefore, even though students may not be in a student care centre, many of them do stay back in the school and are provided with a wide range of enrichment and other activities.",3,68,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00068

I can empathise with the demands that many of us make on MOE for cheaper, faster, better facilities. So, I am sorry to add on to the Minister's load. I would like to enquire if MOE can consider conducting a study of the needs and the very vocal demands of families of the students with more challenging requirements – those with special needs, whether in mainstream schools or special schools.",1,70,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00070
2014-11-04-T-005,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"There have been quite a lot of demands for that, but the solution is really not easy. I would like to ask if the Minister can consider starting a workgroup to look into various more innovative solutions, perhaps, a continuum of solutions that involve enrichment centres, parents pulling together with their helpers and so on. We want to come up with solutions that can address this need to keep the children better occupied after official school hours, whether they are special needs or not, whether they are in mainstream schools or not. I would like the Minister to consider that.",2,71,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00071
2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I thank Ms Denise Phua for her suggestion and we will certainly look into that.

2014-11-04-T-005,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Thank you, Madam. I would like to ask the Minister a question. Firstly, I understand the move to have more school-based student care centres. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry is open to considering on a case-by-case basis, perhaps, to give adequate support to VWOs setting up student care centres within communities, especially with rental blocks.",1,74,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00074
2014-11-04-T-005,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Why I am saying this is because, currently, an example that I know of is Brighton Student Care Centre. It is located at one of the largest rented blocks in my area – about 500-600 units in the block. For the subsidy that they are benefiting from, there is a great disparity between what they are able to receive versus what a school-based student care operator may get. This is causing quite a financial strain on them, even as they are doing this not for profit and even as they are doing this to serve the community to help the lower income families. So, I hope that the Minister will be open to considering at least on a case-by-case basis to provide adequate support for some of these VWOs trying to provide student care services within the community.",2,75,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00075
2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I thank Ms Tin Pei Ling for her suggestion. I have visited some of these centres as well. Indeed, many of them are doing a good job. We will study this together with MSF on what we can do – whether the solution is in the student care centre or in some other form, we will look at it and see how we might enable the students, whatever their background, to continue to make progress.",1,76,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00076

Therefore, for parents who are working, they do not have the peace of mind. They would like to have school-based care centres. A lot of my residents feel that because some centres are not in the school, it incurs additional transport and, sometimes, it is not convenient as well. I would like to ask the Minister, is there a plan to have school-based student care centre in every Primary school? If there is not, what is the reason? If there is, what is the plan and timeline?",1,78,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00078

2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Indeed, Mdm Speaker, I have responded to that question. As I have said earlier on, we have to look at it in perspective. In 2011, we started with about 50 centres. I visited several of these school-based centres myself. I have seen the details of the operations and I appreciate what they could do for our students as they work with our schools. That is the reason why I have a very deliberate policy of expanding the number of school-based student care centres, taking into account the needs and demands, not just in school-based centres but also in the community. There has been a steady expansion, which has allowed us to maintain quality.",1,80,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00080
2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Now that the school-based student care centres have been seen to benefit many students, the demand has grown. The more we do, the greater the demand! I am cognisant of this. I have a lot of empathy for working parents and how they would like better facilities. At the same time, we have to look at the different phases in which our schools are undergoing in terms of infrastructure and demand, and the community-based centres which are already serving some of these schools. Any expansion has to take into account a number of these factors. Most important of all, I want to ensure that the quality is maintained.",2,81,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00081
2014-11-04-T-005,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We will continue to work hard on all these. As I said to Mr Liang earlier on, I would like to do it as fast as possible, like all Members here.

I would like to know whether these are dedicated for student care services or do they also include tuition centres with only a limited space for student care. In the MSF list that I went through, many of the centres that are listed as student care providers are actually tuition centres.",1,84,2014-11-04-T-005-S-00084

2014-11-04-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how can the issue of graduate under-employment be mitigated; and (b) what measures does the Government plan to put in place to ensure that the situation does not worsen.,1,87,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00087
2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Mdm Speaker, graduate under-employment is an issue that many governments worldwide are grappling with, including in developed economies where graduates are experiencing challenges in securing jobs which match their skills and expertise.",1,88,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00088
2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"In many countries, graduate under-employment is due in a large part to a high or increasing proportion of degree holders entering the workforce, at a time where their economies are unable to generate sufficient good jobs for these graduates. This is exacerbated in cases where there is a mismatch between the courses of study and the skillsets required of the jobs available. The disruptive effect of technology on the nature of jobs also means that graduates who are unable to update and upgrade their skills may face challenges staying relevant in their fields.",2,89,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00089
2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Singapore's resident graduate under-employment rate is low and stable, at 2.3% in June 2013. While we are not facing the unemployment and under-employment problems in other countries, we will not be immune to these trends. The proportion of degree holders in our workforce has been increasing. We are seeing increasing access to private educational institutions or alternative routes which offer degrees of varying quality, despite their sleek packaging. Those who spend time and money going to these institutions may bear a greater risk of under-employment. The market has begun to differentiate between degrees that carry their full worth in knowledge and skills, and those that are essentially paper qualifications. We should encourage our young to pursue their interests and go for substance when considering their education and career paths.",3,90,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00090
2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We will also need to keep up our efforts at ensuring that graduates have the skillsets to take on quality jobs. Our first strategy is to keep our economy vibrant and competitive, so that enough quality jobs can be created. This means we must press on with our restructuring efforts, as well as to continue to grow industries which offer good jobs and, therefore, good opportunities for all Singaporeans. We need to attract the right companies to invest and grow their businesses here.",4,91,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00091
2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"At the same time, we need to help individuals to equip themselves with the skills to take on the quality jobs of today and also of tomorrow.

2014-11-04-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"First, how can the Government help to mitigate competition for jobs from foreign PMEs? Many Singaporeans feel that they are sometimes passed over for jobs they can do because foreigners come cheaper, without the need for CPF contributions and are free of National Service obligations, to name a few. Would the Minister consider implementing labour market tests already in place in other countries, such as Hong Kong, so that Singaporeans with relevant qualifications and experience are given priorities for jobs that they wish to do before companies resort to hiring foreign executives? So, that is the first supplementary question.",2,95,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00095
2014-11-04-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"The second is whether the Government would consider launching a targeted internship programme with special incentives for companies to provide Singaporeans with relevant experience, especially for young graduates and mid-career executives seeking a change in industry so that they can gain the necessary experience and exposure to be fully deployed in the future.",3,96,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00096

2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to the first question on competition, as I have mentioned a couple of times in the House, the truth of the matter is that foreigners compete with us whether they are in Singapore or not. This is the effect of globalisation. It does not just affect Singapore but it affects many countries in the world. In a large part, you will find that companies go round the world in search of where they can operate most effectively and on the most cost-effective basis.",2,98,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00098
2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Singapore, as we know, is not the cheapest place to operate but there are a lot of strengths operating in Singapore. Companies are attracted here for a number of reasons. In fact, just last week, I had a meeting with the US-ASEAN Business Council and one gentleman shared that when he relocated here, it was one of the best decisions that he made because they have access to Singaporeans who are well skilled, hardworking, talented and capable. One of the pluses here is that we also do have access to a diverse workforce. Many of the companies that are established here – both foreign and local – are multinational in nature. Some of them are global headquarters, some are regional headquarters. They are looking at diverse workforce because that affords them that diversity in exposure and talent for them to be able to reach out to the world. When they are here, they create opportunities for Singaporeans.",3,99,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00099
2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Foreigners here do compete with Singaporeans, but having them here does keep the economy competitive. But at the same time, on a net basis, it benefits us because it generates jobs.",4,100,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00100
2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We are mindful that there are concerns about competition. We have taken a number of steps over the years. For example, the way we have structured the employment pass, the entry-level salary regime and the tiered salary regime which takes into account age, experience and the salaries required. Those are measures we put in place to help to even out the playing field for Singaporeans. The Fair Consideration Framework was also put in place to ensure that those companies who do want to apply for employment pass would have to make those jobs available in the Jobs Bank so that Singaporeans do have access to apply for those jobs as well. If companies are found to be carrying out practices which are less than fair, we will investigate and follow up accordingly.",5,101,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00101
2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Importantly, the best solution is to ensure that the economy is vibrant and is doing well. We are not doing too badly on that front. In terms of specific initiatives, there are existing programmes to help graduates. We have the Professional Conversion Programmes or PCPs. It basically supports job seekers to re-skill themselves, obtain necessary job competencies to take on new jobs.

We are quite open to exploring new ideas and initiatives to help our graduates at different levels to be able to continue to find jobs. The concerns expressed by Ms Foo are something that we track closely in terms of unemployment and also under-employment. And by and large, I think the numbers are low but I would say this  ""low"" does not mean there is no unemployment.

When engaging many young PMEs with diploma as well as degree and above qualifications, anecdotally, the concerns are more on non time-based under-employment. I wish to ask the Minister whether his Ministry could consider doing a more detailed study or survey to understand whether non time-based under-employment is really an issue or the magnitude of it.",1,106,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00106

Be that as it may, one of our biggest concerns, and I have flagged this up previously, is the increasing proportion of people who are pursuing higher education and special degrees at private education institutions and also at overseas education institutions. We are not at the stage where it is quite as chronic as in some other countries I have cited before, such as Taiwan and Korea.",2,108,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00108
2014-11-04-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"But looking at the profile of our population and the increasing access to these institutions, that is one big concern going forward. I would add that the concern is not about degrees not being important. The concern really is pursuing degrees from institutions which have less than desirable standards. In these cases, as I have mentioned earlier, you would run the greater risk of under-employment.",3,109,2014-11-04-T-006-S-00109

2014-11-04-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Mdm Speaker, when Mr Yee alludes to the fact that the unemployment rate of 7.4% is high, I am not very certain what his reference points are, but there are a few perspectives. One, does he mean that it is high compared to other countries? Secondly, is it high because it is higher than the overall unemployment rate? Or is it high because it has increased significantly from the past? Let me address these three perspectives.",1,112,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00112
2014-11-04-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Firstly, across all educational levels, our youth unemployment rate has remained low, and, in fact, very low by international standards. Whether compared with the advanced economies, such as the US and EU, which are facing youth unemployment rates in the double digits, or with other developed Asian economies such as Hong Kong and South Korea, we are faring pretty well.",2,113,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00113
2014-11-04-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Secondly, youth unemployment across all countries is typically significantly higher than the overall unemployment rate. This pattern is similarly reflected in our unemployment rate of 7.4%, which is non-seasonally adjusted, for degree holders below the age of 30, compared to the overall unemployment rate amongst degree holders, again non-seasonally adjusted, of 3.6% in June 2013.",3,114,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00114
2014-11-04-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We will find this pattern repeated across all the different countries. And there is a reason for this. This is mainly due to the fact that new graduates joining the job market, as well as the higher incidence of job switching amongst young graduates, as they figure out what exactly they want to do, rather than any systemic difficulty in securing employment. So, you will find these trends typically across most, if not all, countries. About nine in 10 of our young degree holders from the local Autonomous Universities are able to secure a job within six months of graduation. The median duration of unemployment for resident degree holders below the age of 30 is also not long – at about five weeks.",4,115,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00115
2014-11-04-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Thirdly, the rate has come down from 2009 and has remained largely stable for the recent few years.",5,116,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00116
2014-11-04-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The Government will continue with a comprehensive approach to keep both overall unemployment and youth unemployment rates as low as we can. First, it is crucial – and I think it is important for us remember – that we do need to maintain a strong and vibrant economy so that businesses have a conducive environment to operate in and, in turn, create quality jobs for our young people and, in fact, for all Singaporeans. Secondly, we do need to ensure that our education and training system continues to equip Singaporeans with industry-relevant skills to prepare them for the job market. We know that trends are evolving, technology is evolving quickly. So, this is where the commitment to lifelong education for Singaporeans at every educational level is particularly important.",6,117,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00117
2014-11-04-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"MOM will also continue to monitor the unemployment rate, as I mentioned to Mr Patrick Tay earlier, and also under-employment rate, of young degree holders and, frankly, for Singaporeans at every level. We will continue to work closely with tripartite partners to help young degree holders access quality jobs, and facilitate their career development and progression.",7,118,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00118
2014-11-04-T-007,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for the answer. I would like to just look at the data. The Minister said that we are actually doing very well according to the data. But I also noticed a trend – the Minister said that it has actually been falling or has been steady since 2009. But actually it has been rising from 6.6% in 2011 to 7.4% today. It roughly translates to over 24,000 graduates under the age of 30 that are classified as unemployed.",1,119,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00119
2014-11-04-T-007,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Also, in the earlier Parliamentary Question (PQ), we looked at the graduates' under-employment. This is also a figure that is rising among graduates whereas for other education groups, it has actually been falling.",2,120,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00120
2014-11-04-T-007,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"So, I would like to know that moving forward, does the Ministry feel that it is important to do further studies to determine if there is any mismatch between the jobs and the training in our tertiary institutions. This is especially so because we are expanding the number of degree places in the publicly-funded Universities, and more and more people are also taking on private degree programmes.",3,121,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00121
2014-11-04-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I will be happy to follow up with Mr Yee on specifically the percentage points that he is referring to. I am not sure whether he is comparing like for like. The 7.4% in the PQ refers to the unemployment rate of resident degree holders below the age of 30, while the 6.7% refers to the annual resident youth, aged 15 to 24, unemployment rate. But be that as it may, we can follow up and check which specific data point he is referring to.",1,122,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00122
2014-11-04-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We do track this situation quite closely. As I have mentioned before, although we are not at that stage yet, my big concern is that if we do not arrest this trend, I think you will find a greater risk of unemployment and under-employment as more youths pursue other options, especially through private education institutions.",2,123,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00123
2014-11-04-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"It does not mean that by pursuing studies in the private education institutions, you will not be able to necessarily do well and fulfil your aspirations in life. There will be those who do well. As you would realise, there will be institutions out there that will be quite happy to provide you a qualification if you look hard enough, and are prepared to spend time and money, but the standards do vary. We do see it now in terms of employment outcomes. In terms of the employment opportunities and especially the remuneration packages, it is less than desired and that is a worrying trend. If we continue along that path, we will encounter some of the problems that other countries are facing.",3,124,2014-11-04-T-007-S-00124

2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Under the public-private partnership (PPP) arrangement, Sports Hub Pte Ltd (SHPL) designed, built, financed and operates the new Singapore Sports Hub for 25 years. The intent of the PPP is to leverage the private partner's expertise and network to create a vibrant mix of sports and lifestyle activities that would be accessible to all. SHPL is required to make available the various facilities in the Sports Hub for public and private use, according to the specifications and standards detailed in the Project Agreement between SHPL and Sport Singapore (SportSG).",2,131,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00131
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Developing a major sporting venue in land-scarce Singapore does present several unique challenges. Many stadiums around the world are designed for a specific purpose and they are not used intensively all year round. This is perhaps possible in countries which do not face space or land constraints. In Singapore, it is a luxury we cannot afford. As such, SHPL was asked to deliver a multi-purpose Sports Hub, which could accommodate a vibrant calendar of sports and entertainment activities. By and large, I would say that the expertise brought in by SHPL has helped to make the Sports Hub an integrated sports and lifestyle destination for Singaporeans to enjoy.",3,132,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00132
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"However, it has faced problems with the National Stadium pitch because of several reasons. For one, SHPL had taken three months longer than expected to complete the National Stadium and this meant that there was not enough time to allow the grass on the pitch to take root and stabilise. In addition, SHPL misjudged the impact that the intensive events schedule would have on the pitch. It had carried out testing before deciding on the hybrid Desso GrassMaster pitch. This is a hybrid pitch which is primarily natural turf anchored by artificial fibres. It procured a cover that was designed to allow activities and concerts to take place on the pitch with reduced impact on the grass. This had been tested but it did not work out as planned, and in part because the grass was not anchored deeply enough. It did not have time to grow and anchor itself deeply enough, and so, as a result, the repeated use and coverage of the pitch ended up damaging it.",4,133,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00133
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"SHPL recognises that the poor condition of the pitch and the changes in the event schedule have brought about negative publicity to the project. This is also not in the consortium's own interests and, hence, it has stepped forward to take ownership of the issue. It has acknowledged its own shortcomings and it has embarked on the necessary remedial actions to improve the condition of the pitch.",5,134,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00134
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Earlier, SHPL had procured growth lights at its own cost to enhance the growth of the grass. And after the recent Brazil-Japan match, the Asia Pacific Dragons – Maori All Blacks rugby match was cancelled and the Jay Chou concert postponed and this was done to give the pitch more time to stabilise before the coming AFF Suzuki Cup in November. SHPL is bearing the costs arising from the cancellation and postponement of these events.",6,135,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00135
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"With the freeing up of the events schedule and the measures put in place so far, we have already seen improvements in the pitch conditions. At the same time, SHPL has been engaging local and overseas experts to fundamentally re-examine its earlier assumptions and models for the use of the pitch. They will assess if the current pitch solution is viable beyond the Suzuki Cup, or whether more extensive changes are needed in the medium to longer term to ensure a consistently robust pitch. These are still being studied, and SHPL intends to put in place longer term measures after the Suzuki Cup.",7,136,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00136

I would like to ask the Minister how was the Government involved in deciding the type of pitch used for the National Stadium? Was the Government consulted before this hybrid was decided? In resolving this issue now, how is the Government working with SHPL to settle this issue and what is the time frame that the Minister expects this pitch to be restored to the expected standard?",1,139,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00139
2014-11-04-T-008,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"The Minister mentioned that as part of the PPP, the Sports Hub has to cater for public use. So, during this period where the pitch is not satisfactory, what are the public events that would be affected and how would this affect the PPP arrangement? How would SHPL be taken to task for not fulfilling its end of the agreement?",2,140,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00140
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, as I have mentioned earlier, the requirement is stated in the project agreement that spelt out between SportSG and SHPL. SHPL is required to deliver on certain outcomes, so it has to take upon itself the responsibility of ensuring the pitch allows for multi-purpose usage and is robust enough to withstand that usage.",1,141,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00141
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In the course of coming up with the present solution, SHPL had done a series of tests and these test results were shown to Sports Singapore to show that these tests were done and that the proposed solution that was eventually put in place was the best solution that they had, based on the conditions that they had tried out earlier. Of course, as I have mentioned, we know now that it has not worked out as planned, not necessarily because the proposed solution is not the desired one but perhaps there were other extenuating circumstances – as I had mentioned, the project was late and the grass itself had not had time to stabilise before it had to deal with a very heavy event schedule.",2,142,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00142
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The current arrangement or presently, even with the postponement of the events in the coming months and the time that has taken to allow the grass to grow, we have already seen significant improvements in the pitch. This is something that is being done in the interim, for the Suzuki Cup. Beyond that, there is now a process of going through some of the earlier test results all over again – just to ensure that the solution that is being proposed is truly robust. And this is again a process which we have asked SHPL to undertake. They will do a series of experiments and tests to assure all stakeholders that they have a robust solution for the medium and long term. They will be sharing the results with the Government, with SportSG. We are also asking our own experts, for example, from the National Parks to look at the results and to satisfy ourselves that whatever the solution as proposed by SHPL is a robust one.",3,143,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00143

Not that it is going to be happening next year in the Stadium, but if something like that were to happen, that would be an event that is for public usage.

Mdm Speaker, page 58 of the MOF's Public/Private Partnership Handbook states that the misallocation between the PPP provider, in this case, SHPL, and the Government procuring entity, namely, SportSG, is complex and SportSG must be careful that operational risks are not passed back to them.",1,145,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00145
2014-11-04-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Separately, there was also the media statement from SportSG suggesting non-payment if the condition of the pitch does not improve – I believe this was issued shortly after the Brazil-Japan Friendly match.",2,146,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00146
2014-11-04-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I have three supplementary questions for the Minister. First, what is the annual payment that SportSG pays to the Sports Hub under the PPP framework and how are the payments structured over the re-payment period? Secondly, under what circumstances can SportSG contractually withhold annual payment to the Sports Hub and how much can it withhold for non-performance? And finally, in view of the Suzuki Cup ticket prices that were released yesterday, what role does SportSG and the Sports Associations play to determine the pricing of events with potential mass appeal and what recourse does SportSG have to ensure that ticket prices are not out of reach for the mass public?",3,147,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00147
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, with respect to the questions, on the annual payment, I do not have a figure at hand but I would say that the annual payment is over a stream of a period of time which eventually would amount to the overall cost of the project. The overall cost of the project is something at a region of $1.3 billion.",1,148,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00148
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As a PPP, instead of forking out $1.3 billion upfront, the Government does not do that. It is done by the private sector but we, instead, pay an annual stream of payments over the 25-year period for the usage of the stadium; of the facilities within the Sports Hub. That is how it is designed and constructed.",2,149,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00149
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Within the project agreement, there is indeed a provision for deductions in the availability payment in the event of non-performance or non-availability of use. And this is quite standard in a PPP arrangement. Even in a mature PPP in other countries, you will often find deductions being made in the event of a non-performance by the private partner. This is something that SportSG will carry out in accordance with the provisions in the project agreement.",3,150,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00150
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On ticket prices, that is something that would be set by event organisers, not necessarily by Sports Hub itself because the events that are taking place in the Sports Hub may be put up by a National Sport Association, it may be put up by SportSG, it may be put together by a private events promoter. These are not regulated prices; these are left to the market. So, the property owners and the event organisers, which are usually commercial organisers, would then have to decide what is the appropriate price range to set these prices.",4,151,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00151
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I would say if you look at the experience so far and compare with what we have seen in Jalan Besar Stadium, what we have seen in the old national stadium for the events and for the sporting activities that we have had in the Sports Hub, I think they are within a comparable range. For example, the Brazil-Japan match ticket prices were comparable to what was in the old national stadium when Liverpool came to play in the old national stadium. We have had many sporting events within the new Sports Hub organised by our National Sports Associations where ticket prices are very affordable and accessible to all Singaporeans.",5,152,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00152
2014-11-04-T-008,Chia Yong Yong,Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member),"A clarification for the Minister. I am heartened to note that SHPL is taking ownership and taking steps to ensure that what happened before would not happen again. However, if the maintenance and the management continue to be unsatisfactory from the perspective of Singapore's reputation, then is there an exit clause that enables SportSG to treat the non-performance or the failure of obligation as a breach of contract and award the management to another entity?",1,153,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00153
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I thank the Member for the question on this worst case scenario that SHPL is unable to perform. I would, first of all, want to clarify that as a consortium, they have taken ownership and responsibility. They are already, as you can see, putting in their own investments – whether it is in the purchase of growth lights; whether it is in the rescheduling of events – they are already taking these decisions to ensure that the pitch is done properly. That is something we should acknowledge that the consortium may have fallen short in the first instance with this pitch at the early stages, but they have taken ownership and they are now putting in the necessary remedial measures.",1,154,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00154
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I would also say that it is not such a straightforward matter to get it right, right from the start, because in many of these stadiums around the world, in big venues, there is always an initial bedding process, a teething process where you have to go through some of these humps. That is something that I think they are facing now. The good news or the thing that I am assured by is that the consortium is taking full ownership and responsibility of the issue.",2,155,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00155
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But if it should come to pass that there is such a scenario where there is truly non-performance, the consortium for some reason or another is not doing anything to solve the problem or if it is a very bad breach of the terms of the project agreement, then indeed there are exit provisions that we can activate. I do not think they are anywhere near that in this particular case.",3,156,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00156

2014-11-04-T-008,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I think National Stadium is the first such PPP project for sports facilities of this scale. When we say PPP, it means Government is also involved. I would like to ask two supplementary questions. During the construction of the National Stadium, was the expertise of Government agencies being sought? In this particular case, was the expertise in NParks being involved during the construction stage, for example, selection of the grass and so on?",1,158,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00158
2014-11-04-T-008,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The next question is that, according to the media report, CEO of SportSG threatened or mentioned the possibility to withhold payment. I would like to ask is this non-payment allowed for in the contract and will this cause any strain in the relationship because this is a PPP project?",2,159,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00159
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, let me take the second question from the Member first. The non-payment and the deduction of availability payment, as I have said earlier, is part and parcel of all PPP projects, not just in Singapore. Anywhere in the world there is PPP project, these sorts of provisions are there and happen all the time.",1,160,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00160
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So it is in our case. There are provisions for deduction in the availability payment. This is spelt out in the contract. We have had many meetings since the statement made by SportSG and many meetings and discussions between SportSG and SHPL. There is no strain in the relationship. The consortium understands that they had fallen short in this particular case, they accept the consequences and, as I have said earlier, they are moving forward with solutions. So, that is where the team is at, working together to find solutions, both for the short term – for the Suzuki Cup – and for the medium to long term.",2,161,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00161
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the earlier question of the involvement of the Government in the construction, yes, there was consultation. It could perhaps have been done much better. If you look back and look at whether or not more attention could have been paid in terms of the solution that was arrived at for the pitch, perhaps, in hindsight, we could have put in a lot more attention in terms of looking at the results.",3,162,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00162
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"What I can say is that during the construction phase, the consortium had indeed done experiments and tests and derived the best solution for the pitch. At that time, the tests were done under a shade in the Orchid Country Club and so they were trying to replicate the conditions of the Stadium in order to find the best grass and best solution for the pitch. But the Stadium was not there, so they could only attempt to replicate something which they thought would be ideal for the conditions of the National Stadium. The results were done and the tests were shown. In fact, the people who were doing the tests were from an agency that was specifically recommended by FIFA. So, it was not just done by themselves. They had done it through an outsourced agency recommended by FIFA and they had done it extensively to show that this was the best solution available at that time. With the benefit of what we have now, we are re-examining the test results, the assumptions and we are asking them to do many more tests so that we can be very sure of a robust solution going forward.",4,163,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00163
2014-11-04-T-008,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Madam, Singapore prides itself for its efficiency for being well organised, for being forward looking. But some of the comments arising from the problems affecting the National Stadium pitch have led to international sports groups questioning the ability of our National Stadium to produce world-class conditions. Can I ask the Minister what is his assessment of this on Singapore's reputation as well as its ability to attract world-class sports tournaments to Singapore?",1,164,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00164
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I acknowledge that there had been negative publicity in the first few events or the first two, in particular – the Juventus game and the Brazil-Japan game – because of the conditions of the pitch. I would say that we will be able to overcome this negative publicity if we get the solution right.",1,165,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00165
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, if you look at the coming Suzuki Cup and the way the pitch conditions are significantly improved compared to before, and if you look at what we are planning going forward in the calendar, so long as we get a good solution, we will work out the best possible solution going forward. Then, we will be able to overcome the initial phase of negative publicity.",2,166,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00166
2014-11-04-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I would say also that we will still continue to receive a lot of interests from sporting event organisers to do events in the National Stadium, and, in fact, more than we probably can cope, given the event schedule that we have for the National Stadium. Notwithstanding the impact of the first two matches where the pitch conditions were not ideal, there is still very strong interest by sport promoters everywhere in all the different sports, whether it is football or rugby, to have events anchored in our new Sports Hub.",3,167,2014-11-04-T-008-S-00167
2014-11-04-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Minister for Transport whether sharing economy taxi applications such as Uber are a potential means to address peak hour taxi demand and the difficulty of getting a taxi during inclement weather and, if not, how does LTA plan to address the rise of such sharing economy enterprises.",1,168,2014-11-04-T-009-S-00168
2014-11-04-T-009,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mdm Speaker, third party taxi booking applications provide commuters and taxi drivers with an additional means of making and accepting taxi bookings. They facilitate more efficient matching of taxis with commuters as they can source for available taxis from more than one taxi company. However, they do not increase the supply of taxis per se and, hence, will not help the situation if availability of supply is the constraint during peak hours and inclement weather. The taxi availability framework we introduced last year will still be necessary.",1,169,2014-11-04-T-009-S-00169
2014-11-04-T-009,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Third party taxi booking applications are currently allowed to operate in Singapore without regulation. However, to protect the safety and interests of commuters, some basic regulations may be required. LTA is currently studying this.",2,170,2014-11-04-T-009-S-00170
2014-11-04-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Madam, two supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State. The first is that the Minister for Transport recently spoke in Parliament about the piloting of a taxi information trial system to monitor the real time demand of taxis. Can I enquire if the sharing economy companies or the taxi application companies are part of this trial, as they would have collected quite a lot of data that can be instructive for LTA to better calibrate the number of taxis on the road, or to explore, potentially allowing private cars with the requisite insurance and safety requirements for the public, for example, to make up the shortfall of demand during peak hours in particular? Secondly, are there any plans to review the taxi quality of service standards in the light of third party taxi applications?",1,171,2014-11-04-T-009-S-00171
2014-11-04-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, in response to the Member's first question, the answer is, yes. We make use of all available data, including those that are available through the taxi companies.",1,172,2014-11-04-T-009-S-00172
2014-11-04-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In response to his second question on whether there are plans to review the quality of service standards that taxi companies are currently required to meet, what Mr Pritam has highlighted is the fact that when we have these third party applications, it could affect the taxi companies' ability to fulfil those quality of service standards and it is, therefore, relevant for us to take a look at whether these third party applications impact the quality of service standards being met. So, we would take a look at the data first before coming to a decision.",2,173,2014-11-04-T-009-S-00173

2014-11-04-T-010,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Mdm Speaker, the Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fee aims to minimise the cost difference between owning and using a foreign-registered vehicle and a Singapore-registered vehicle here in Singapore. This framework, however, provides for VEP free hours and days such as during the weekends when the traffic on our roads is less heavy, so as not to unduly discourage foreigners from visiting Singapore.",1,175,2014-11-04-T-010-S-00175
2014-11-04-T-010,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Currently, about one in 10 foreign-registered cars entering Singapore needs to pay the VEP fee, or about 10% of them. The average daily number of foreign cars entering Singapore on weekdays and weekends is 10,900 and 12,100 respectively over the six months' period between April and September of this year. The corresponding figures for last year were 11,900 and 13,600 respectively. So, there has been a decline from last year to the same time period this year, and this is from April to September period.",2,176,2014-11-04-T-010-S-00176
2014-11-04-T-010,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),I note the Member's suggestion on revising the VEP-free periods. We will consider this and we will also factor in the possibility of Malaysia implementing its proposed charge on non-Malaysia-registered vehicles entering Malaysia.,3,177,2014-11-04-T-010-S-00177
2014-11-04-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked 	 the Minister for Education what is the progress on creating more apprenticeship opportunities for ITE students to work in small and medium enterprises.,1,178,2014-11-04-T-011-S-00178
2014-11-04-T-011,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Mdm Speaker, ITE has strong links with industry players, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs). These partnerships have helped ensure that course curricula stay relevant and students have access to good opportunities for industry attachments and exposure.",1,179,2014-11-04-T-011-S-00179
2014-11-04-T-011,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Currently, SMEs make up more than 60% of ITE's host companies for internships and traineeships and host almost 40% of ITE students for their industrial attachments.",2,180,2014-11-04-T-011-S-00180

This is being done in partnership with many economic and regulatory agencies, including SPRING Singapore.",3,181,2014-11-04-T-011-S-00181

2014-11-04-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Thank you, Minister, for the comprehensive reply. Many Singaporeans are very proud of the various ITE where campuses are with air-conditioning. The reality is that some SME jobs do not provide an air-conditioned environment, including those in the oil and gas industry, construction industry and even repair and maintenance of MRT trains and tracks. So, ITE graduates working in the oil and gas industry also need to get used to the smell of the gasoline.",1,183,2014-11-04-T-011-S-00183
2014-11-04-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"As a result, quite a number of ITE graduates in the technical field refuse to work in a non-air-conditioned environment and they choose to work in the IR, for example. I have these supplementary questions. How could MOE provide a realistic environment in the beautiful ITE campuses so that the graduates would not react in shock when they attend a workplace which is non-air-conditioned? And does MOE track the number of ITE graduates in the technical field who do not remain in this field?",2,184,2014-11-04-T-011-S-00184
2014-11-04-T-011,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I thank Mr Ang for his questions. First, on whether every part of ITE is air-conditioned, in fact, Senior Minister of State Indranee and I on our recent visit to ITE Central tried our hands in being aircraft technicians. We were in full suits; we were doing the work. I assure you that that was not in an air-conditioned environment.",1,185,2014-11-04-T-011-S-00185
2014-11-04-T-011,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"But I think the more important question is, what would encourage our students to continue to go into an area which they have been trained for? And this is exactly what the ASPIRE Committee sought to do. The recommendations of the ASPIRE Committee are wide-ranging, building structured internship, better educational and career guidance and working with companies to ensure that the jobs have the significant skills ladder and career ladder, that will encourage our students to invest their time and energy to enter those jobs and build skills. I think those are the issues that we need to tackle, not whether it is air-conditioned or non-air-conditioned.",2,186,2014-11-04-T-011-S-00186

2014-11-04-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"My last question is this. I know of some GPs who, in the past, waived certain fees or charged lower fees for those low-income families.

We also objectively monitor and analyse the claims submitted by the CHAS clinics, looking at the bill size claims, whether they are large bills consistently, say, top five for the common claims, as well as whether there are large bill size increases over time, and whether there are any unfavourable audit findings for CHAS audits, as well as for Medisave audits.",1,202,2014-11-04-T-012-S-00202

So, they have to abide by certain CHAS guidelines and, again, the audit team will go down to audit these clinics on a quarterly basis, and if there are exceptionally high bills, we will, again, engage and counsel them. We are also engaging the large medical groups to ask them to publish on their websites typical bill charges for common treatments, for instance, just consultation fees and, in future, perhaps the total bill, including medications.

2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In Southeast Asia, nearly US$1 trillion of infrastructure investment will be required until 2020 – the next six years. Likewise, India's infrastructure sector potential is estimated to require US$1 trillion in funding from 2012 to 2017. With these opportunities and growth in the region, the number and complexity of cross-border disputes will probably increase exponentially. The need for reliable dispute resolution services will increase. This is a need that we are well-placed to meet. There are three parts to our strategy to become one of the world's leading dispute resolution hubs.",13,230,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00230
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"First, international arbitration. For a few years now, we have focused on developing our international arbitration services. Our efforts have yielded excellent results. Singapore is now the third most preferred arbitration seat in the world. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) is the fourth most preferred arbitral institution worldwide. This did not happen by chance.",14,231,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00231
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Second, international commercial mediation. My Ministry has welcomed the recommendations of the International Commercial Mediation Working Group to develop Singapore into a centre for international commercial mediation. Two new mediation institutions, the Singapore International Mediation Centre and the Singapore International Mediation Institute will be set up.

It comprised international and local members to provide a wide range of expertise and views. The Committee submitted its report to my Ministry at the end of last year. We conducted a public consultation on the report, and the feedback received was generally supportive of the initiative. We also conducted a subsequent public consultation on the Bills to put in place the legislative framework for establishing the SICC. The feedback received was taken into consideration in finalising the Bills. So, there were two consultations, one before the draft Bills and one after.",16,233,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00233
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The SICC, under the current framework, will be an international court with specialist jurists hearing international commercial disputes. We want the SICC to hear disputes governed by foreign law as well. The SICC will complement existing arbitration services and broaden the suite of dispute resolution options that are available to regional as well as international parties. It will attract parties who would not otherwise have come to Singapore to have their disputes resolved here. The key objectives are to grow the legal sector by bringing offshore work into Singapore and that will, in turn, give our lawyers and law firms more opportunities to tap into Asia's growth. That process has taken place in the arbitration sector. So, even when the disputes have little or no connection to Singapore, Singapore lawyers will get involved the moment the arbitration is heard in Singapore.",17,234,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00234
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"How will the SICC seek to achieve these objectives? We have a strong reputation for good governance, low corruption, efficiency, rule of law and a trusted legal system. The brand name for Singapore is outstanding. Our neutrality is also an important factor which will help. Our Judiciary is highly regarded as being efficient, competent and honest. It is consistently ranked highly in international surveys.

This advantage is important as arbitration users have indicated that a personal connection to the city in which the arbitration is held is one of the main reasons for selecting the venue. Thirty-seven of the top 100 law firms in the world are present in Singapore. This further helps in what we have to offer in terms of legal services.",19,236,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00236

There is presently no equivalent default court in Asia. Our intention is to become that default court. No other country provides this option. We want to be the first and we want to succeed. The SICC will be positioned as that Court to leverage on our strengths to become the neutral forum of choice for court-based litigation in this part of the world.,20,237,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00237

2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),This Bill deals with the administration of justice and includes changes to the Judiciary and the Office of the Attorney-General.

2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I will deal with three new appointments created by this  namely, the Deputy Attorney-General, the Senior Judge and the International Judge. The appointment of the Deputy Attorney-General is set out in the new Article 35(8) to be inserted in the Constitution. The eligibility criterion is the same as that of the Attorney-General and he is empowered to carry out any duties of the Attorney-General assigned to him. The duties of the Attorney-General are broad and include advising the Government on legal matters and acting as the Chief Prosecutor.",3,274,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00274
2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The size and complexities of the Singapore Government have grown along with the growth of our economy over the years. Crimes are getting more complex, too, and the size of the Attorney-General's Chambers has grown correspondingly with the duties it has to cover. In this regard, I think it makes sense to have additional senior people who may assist the Attorney-General with his duties.",4,275,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00275
2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I know that there is scope for the appointment for multiple Deputy Attorney-Generals. I am interested to know how many Deputy Attorney-Generals it is envisioned that will be appointed, at least for starters, and whether each will have distinct duties. I am also interested to know whether this appointment will have any impact on the role of the Solicitor-General, who is, currently, the most senior person in the AGC after the Attorney-General.",5,276,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00276
2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The other interesting change is to the Judiciary  the position of Senior Judges being created to allow Judges, who have past the retirement age, to carry on sitting as Judge either for a fixed term or for a specific case. I welcome this development. Many Judges at their retirement age are still in very good health and have a wealth of experience. A good number carry on practices as highly regarded arbitrators. So, I think it would be a shame for the Judiciary to lose their expertise just because they hit the retirement age. The Senior Judges scheme allows us the ability to continue to tap on them.",6,277,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00277
2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The International Judge is also a new and rather unique creation. It is very unusual for a country to appoint a foreign qualified person as a Judge in its own national Courts. This provision is to support the Singapore International Commercial Court which will have the capability to hear cases governed by the laws of other countries. It makes sense to have these Judges, qualified in the relevant laws, to hear these cases.",7,278,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00278
2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"This concept is similar to International Arbitration where a tribunal in Singapore can hear cases governed by the laws of other countries and issue an arbitration award. The SICC, in this sense, is like a hybrid between arbitration and litigation and I would expect that for any international commercial contract, parties that would otherwise have chosen litigation before the Singapore Courts can now choose the SICC instead, especially since this gives them the flexibility of having a Judge versed in foreign law.",8,279,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00279
2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I believe international arbitration still continues to have some advantages over the SICC, particularly in that international arbitration awards are likely to be easier to enforce under the UN conventions, whereas an SICC judgment would still be treated as a foreign judgment. However, the SICC enjoys the usual advantages of a court procedure over arbitration, with the added advantage that a suitably qualified foreign judge may be available.",9,280,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00280
2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One feature of these constitutional amendments that I find interesting is the idea that Judicial Commissioners, Senior Judges and International Judges may be appointed to hear specific cases under clause 8(5)(a) or to be appointed for a specified period. The idea of a judge being appointed for a specific case is quite unique and, in my view, eminently sensible. As the practice of law gets more and more specialised, there will be practitioners who have in-depth knowledge of specific areas and it would make sense for them to be tapped to hear important cases that arise in those areas.",10,281,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00281
2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"This provision essentially allows flexibility to tap a wide range of experience since it permits the tapping of retired judges, international judges and potentially any other lawyer as a Judicial Commissioner. I can see the benefits of this procedure being used widely since it gives tremendous flexibility to find the person suited for a particular case. Once again, this is common in arbitration.",11,282,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00282
2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I am not entirely sure if the purpose of this provision is for it to be used widely on a regular basis or for it to be used exceptionally. If the intention is for it to be used widely, then it might make sense to also, perhaps at a later date, review the appointment procedure which still currently involves the President, the Prime Minister and the consultation of the Chief Justice. So, if we are going to get judges to hear specific cases, a more streamlined procedure might be helpful in the administration of justice.",12,283,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00283
2014-11-04-T-016,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Overall, I welcome these changes. Singapore's legal system is already one of the most highly regarded in the world and, because it is respected by both developed and developing countries, we are a popular jurisdiction for international contracts and for dispute resolution. I believe these changes will improve our system even further and provide additional impetus for parties to use Singapore as a commercial hub.",13,284,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00284
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Mdm Speaker, the Workers' Party opposes the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill. The Workers' Party is uncomfortable about the appointment of short-term Senior Judges who can be re-appointed after the age of 55. The renewal of these short-term positions is contingent on whether renewal is recommended by the Prime Minister and concurred by the President. The new Article 95(2) provides that a person who is 65 years of age or older may be appointed as the Chief Justice, a Judge of Appeal or a Judge of the High Court for a specified period. The Workers' Party is of the view that this weakens a concept critical to judicial independence, namely, the security of tenure.",1,285,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00285
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"According to the former Chief Justice, Mr Chan Sek Keong, ""The freedom to choose one's government is a hallmark of democracy"" and that the ""governors and the governed must respect the law and all are equal before the law. But respect for and subjection to the law can only be sustained if a neutral institution exists to ensure that the law is respected and enforced against all. That institution, in all democracies, is the judiciary"", and it is ""the linchpin of a democratic society and the rule of law."" Critically, the former Chief Justice notes, ""The ability of the judiciary to fulfil such a role is by no means automatic or assured; this is heavily contingent on it being an independent institution.""",2,286,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00286
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, these observations of the former Chief Justice appeared in a Singapore Academy of Law Journal article in 2010, titled ""Securing and Maintaining the Independence of the Court in Judicial Proceedings."" The former Chief Justice's thesis was that the independence of the judiciary hosted a theoretical and practical component.",3,287,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00287
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The theoretical component noted that judicial independence can be secured by surrounding judges with a protective wall against pressure from political appointees, parliamentarians and pressure groups with specific agendas. This protective wall can be categorised according to what secures independence ""to individual members of the judiciary and those that secure the independence of the Judiciary as an institution."" According to the former Chief Justice, protection afforded by this wall gives the Judiciary the impetus to carry out its Constitutional role and gives judges unfettered freedom to adjudicate disputes without fear or favour and according to law.",4,288,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00288

2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In accordance with our manifesto, the Workers' Party is of the view that the Constitution should be amended to extend the retirement age of Supreme Court Judges from 65 to 70 years, with no prospect of extension by the Government thereafter. While extensions and short-term appointments are administratively convenient, it is the Workers' Party view that they weaken the protective wall that upholds judicial independence.",8,292,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00292
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Under the existing regime, which this Bill re-enacts, it is conceivable that a Judge past the retirement age may be retained by the Government because his or her judgments are ""safe"" ones and are acceptable to the Government, even as the Judiciary remains a separate Organ of State. While I am not suggesting that this has occurred, such judgments may well be read as a signal by other judges who have not reached their retirement age as a factor that may determine the prospects for future judicial employment past the statutory retirement age or for a permanent appointment, in the case of Judicial Commissioners. Such a prospect could threaten to breach the protective wall upholding judicial independence and confidence in the Judiciary.",9,293,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00293
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"It is apposite to note, as the former Chief Justice did in his article, that there was also a practical component to judicial independence – namely, that each Judge must believe in and maintain the integrity that the judicial office requires of him or her and that no protective wall can maintain judicial independence should judges be unwilling or unable to exercise personal independence in discharging their duties and functions.",10,294,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00294
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, we have a first-class Judiciary. There is no reason to doubt the integrity of our Judges. However, judicial independence as an institution may well take centre-stage and remain in the spotlight in the years to come as our polity becomes more plural and as our citizens turn to the court to adjudicate or clarify disputes covering administrative action and social norms. Before that happens, the Government would be well placed to institutionally strengthen the protective wall of judicial independence so that confidence in the Judiciary remains high. Relooking at the concept of security of tenure for Judges is a good place to start.",11,295,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00295
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In fact, there are some signs that the Government is working to buttress the concept of judicial independence already. In the Prime Minister's speech to Legal Service Officers (LSOs) on 20 March 2014, it was announced that a separate track would be created for LSOs. While the structure of the Legal Service remains an integrated one – hence, retaining room for improvement – this change is nonetheless an improvement from the current situation where legal officers rotate between appointments in the State Courts as Magistrates and District Judges, and as Deputy Public Prosecutors in the Attorney-General's Chambers, heightening the prospects of a conflict of interest and a potential lack of judicial independence.",12,296,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00296
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The creation of a separate judicial service at the State Court level is a better measure to guard against members of the Executive from influencing the career and advancement of Judges at the State Courts, since the judicial officers' career track will now be assessed by the Judicial Branch Personnel Board and not the Legal Branch Personnel Board. In effect, what this change, as announced by the Prime Minister, does is to play some small, but not imperceptible, part in strengthening the protective wall of judicial independence. Even if this may not be the stated intention of the Government, it ought to operate as such.",13,297,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00297
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, this amendment to the Constitution would have been a good opportunity for the Government to address judicial independence with an acute focus on the future of the Judiciary in Singapore.

2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),I have a clarification for the Minister about the Government's thinking behind the possible appointment of multiple Deputy Attorneys-General. The AGC already accommodates for the appointment of a Solicitor-General and a Second Solicitor-General. What additional work is the new Deputy Attorney-General or Deputy Attorneys-General anticipated to take on? Could not taxpayer money have been better utilised to strengthen the middle ranks of the Attorney-General's Chambers if a heavier workload is the reason for the creation of the office of one or more Deputy Attorneys-General?,16,300,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00300

There was no replacement of parliamentary pensions with any gratuity and rightfully so. Indeed, the concept of a clean wage goes hand-in-hand with good governance and transparency.",18,302,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00302

It would, therefore, appear that there is a lack of consistency in the Government's approach towards the concept of a clean wage, if, indeed, a gratuity is seen to replace a pension.",19,303,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00303
2014-11-04-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In principle, because of the competitive salaries already received by civil servants, I seek the Minister's clarification about the current rationale behind paying certain civil servants a gratuity and why it would it not have been just simpler and more consistent to have a clean wage.

2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, I will focus my speech on the amendments relating to the Supreme Court.

2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Our Westminster system of governance separates state power into three functional and sovereign domains – the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. And as the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, the final interpreters of the Constitution are the courts. To ensure that they decide without fear or favour, judicial independence is ensured through security of tenure and remuneration. Article 98 of the Constitution provides that a judge shall hold office till he reaches 65 years of age and he cannot be removed from office except under very limited circumstances of misbehaviour or ill-health. Neither can a Judge's remuneration and other terms of office be altered to his disadvantage after his appointment. These safeguards are designed to ensure neither of the other two branches of Government can influence our Judges.",2,306,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00306
2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Even before this Bill came before the House, the Constitution already had two Judicial Offices that are exceptions in this sense  contract Judges and Judicial Commissioners. The current Article 94(3) provides for the appointment of Chief Justice and other Judges beyond their retirement age of 65, while Article 94(4) provides for the appointment of Judicial Commissioners. More worrying is Article 94(5) which empowers the President to appoint a person qualified for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court to be a Judicial Commissioner to hear and determine a specified case only. These provisions leave Judges and Judicial Commissioners open to possible interference by the other two branches of Government.",3,307,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00307
2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thankfully, this has not happened. But there is no guarantee that it will never happen. We should remove this risk.

2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, the Workers' Party is opposed to such temporary Judges. These Judges are appointed for short terms, and whether they get their contracts renewed would depend on whether the renewal is recommended by the Prime Minister and concurred with by the President. The uncertainty of the appointment also carries a risk that short-term Judges would be wary of making decisions that put the Government or ruling-party politicians in a bad light and might make safe decisions so as not to jeopardise their reappointment. I am not saying that this has in fact happened, nor am I impugning the integrity of the President or the Prime Minister. But if we are to improve the design of our constitutional institutions for the long term, these provisions do not help instil the highest public confidence in the independence of the Courts.",5,309,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00309
2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"One aspect of the Bill that we have no issue with is the creation of International Judges. Though these are also short-term appointments, the International Judges will sit only in the new Singapore International Commercial Court and their expertise may be necessary to boost SICC's standing and to encourage parties overseas to submit their disputes to the SICC for decision. As these International Judges will only hear disputes of an international commercial nature, the risk of such judges worrying about not being reappointed due to the judgments they deliver is, in my view, negligible. However, the continued policy of having Singaporean Judges on short terms, or even to hear particular cases, is not acceptable to us.",6,310,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00310
2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"However, one issue that Singapore has faced is that many of our Judges, upon reaching 65 years, still have much to contribute on the Bench. They are a wasted resource if forced to retire at age 65. To be fair, 65 years as a compulsory retirement age for a Judge is very early, considering that Singaporeans are living much longer and we are already encouraging people, in general, to work till 67. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, Judges retire at age 70. In the United States' Supreme Court, Judges are appointed for life and many of them are still issuing very lucid judgments well into their 80s. It is timely to relook at whether the Constitution should be amended to postpone the retirement age of our Supreme Court Judges from the current 65 years to, say, 70 years, so that the country can continue to benefit from their rich experience and wisdom.",7,311,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00311

I recognise the Bill states the intent for the Deputy Attorney-General to perform such duties of the Attorney-General as may be assigned to him or her by the Attorney-General. But is there really a need for such an office to be specifically provided for and protected under the Constitution? Surely, the Attorney-General can appoint a Deputy Attorney-General within the ambit of the office of the AGC without the need to amend the Constitution. Perhaps, the Minister can clarify on the role of the Solicitor-General as well.",4,316,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00316

We should not depart from the fundamental principle that Judges should have security of tenure so that they can exercise their judicial independence without fear that their tenure of office will be affected. I acknowledge that in the appointment of a Senior Judge, the Prime Minister must consult the Chief Justice who will give his input as to the appointment. I also recognise that a Senior Judge is expected to be a person who had ceased to be a Judge of the Supreme Court.

Whilst I applaud the intent of MinLaw to promote Singapore as a leading venue for dispute resolution, I certainly hope that we will allow sufficient opportunity for our local senior lawyers, Senior Counsels, retired Judges to be also considered for appointment as an International Judge of the Supreme Court. We should be mindful about appointing foreign senior lawyers as International Judges of the Supreme Court without giving proper consideration as to whether any of our own local lawyers or retired Judges would be suitable.",8,320,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00320

2014-11-04-T-016,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"The backdrop for these changes is the innovative introduction of the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC). This is going to be a new division of the Supreme Court designed to hear international cases, that is, disputes with little or no connection to Singapore other than the parties choosing to litigate here. If the SICC succeeds in its goal to attract international court based disputes, this will cement Singapore's position as a paramount centre for dispute resolution in nature; in the same way that London is the pre-eminent centre in Europe. It will build on the success of our Singapore International Arbitration Centre and enhance the choices available to parties who have disputes to resolve. They can choose litigation, arbitration or even mediation, all in a neutral, modern and cosmopolitan setting, which is designed to make international entities feel they can get justice in Singapore.",2,323,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00323
2014-11-04-T-016,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"The last point is vital. International users feel that they will get fair and equal treatment in Singapore even if they have no connections here. It is thus important that we do not overlook the ""I"" in SICC, which stands for international. Users must feel that this is an international court situated in Singapore, rather than a domestic forum with limited understanding of transnational issues. To that end, the Judges who hear these cases must not exclusively be Singaporeans, notwithstanding the deservedly high reputation of our Singapore Judges. It will assure the Singapore community and the international community if well-known jurists from other countries sit on occasion to hear such cases, as the SICC will benefit from the experience and knowledge of cases with international features. It will also send a strong signal that SICC is truly an international forum for the parties to litigate here and the foreign counsels who argue their cases here and the foreign Judges who hear these arguments, together with our Singapore Judges.",3,324,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00324
2014-11-04-T-016,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"It is thus a necessary and welcome step to permit the appointment of suitable persons who, in the words of the Bill, have the necessary qualifications, experience and professional standing to be International Judges. But can I ask the Minister to clarify these rather general criteria or, at least, specify the sort of qualifications and experience being looked for? Otherwise, it does seem a very wide brief to be given to the Chief Justice to recommend candidates for International Judges.",4,325,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00325
2014-11-04-T-016,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"The appointment of International Judges will be for specific cases for specified periods, so there is little danger of creating a surfeit of Judges. On the contrary, the increased workload of the Supreme Court, if it starts to hear more international cases, will put a strain on our judicial resources. This is where the appointment of retired Judges as Senior Judges again or specific cases for specified periods will help to plug the gap. Our Judges have judicial tenure up to age 65, but many of them still have the energy and commitment to contribute to the legal landscape. It would be a great pity to lose the benefit of their collective wisdom and experience. The appointment of Senior Judges on an ad hoc basis is thus an efficient manner in which we tap on the qualities of our retired Judges.",5,326,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00326
2014-11-04-T-016,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"It thus puzzles me to hear opposition from the Workers' Party to these changes, to argue that this weakens one of the pillars of the rule of law by undermining the security of tenure of Judges. We currently have security of tenure of Judges up to age 65. This Bill does not to seek to change that. In many countries which do have security of tenure, there are mandatory retirement ages. For instance, in the United Kingdom, there is a retirement age of 70. In United States, there is life-long tenure for Supreme Court Judges, but this has been criticised by many commentators as, in a sense, giving a Judge a licence to go on for longer than his shelf life. Currently, we do have the provision to extend Judges who reach the age of 65. One example is the ex-Chief Justice, whose sage words Mr Pritam Singh quoted. So, I fail to understand how appointing retired Judges for specific cases for specified periods in some way undermines the protective wall around the independence of our Judiciary.",6,327,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00327
2014-11-04-T-016,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Ms Sylvia Lim also thought that appointing Judges for short terms might have them worrying about being reappointed. But the Senior Judges we are talking about are retired High Court Judges. They are not short-term Judges. They have already been selected and appointed as High Court Judges and served a full career as a High Court Judge, with security of tenure up to age 65. To be able to tap on them, either for a specific period or specific cases, to me, is a cost-efficient way to be able to address shortages in judicial resources when the caseload of the High Court gets too heavy, and to be able to tap on their collective wisdom and qualities for specific cases. I do not see in that any danger that they will suddenly become short-term in their thinking and this somehow undermines their independence.",7,328,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00328

2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Vikram Nair raised a query as to how many Deputy Attorneys-General will be appointed, at least at the start, and how this appointment impacts on the role of the Solicitor-General.",2,332,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00332
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the question as to how many DAGs will be appointed and what their duties will be, our intention is to largely leave this to the Attorney-General to determine according to the organisational needs of the Attorney-General's Chambers. At the beginning, we think there will be one.",3,333,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00333
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,How does the DAG interact vis-a-vis the Solicitor-General? The Solicitor-General will be the Permanent Secretary-equivalent for the Attorney-General's Chambers.,4,334,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00334
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank Mr Nair for his suggestion that the appointment process for Judicial Commissioners, International Judges and Senior Judges could be made simpler. We will consider his suggestion. But this is what we think works now.",5,335,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00335
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Let me now turn to Mr Lim Biow Chuan's comments. Mr Lim noted that the internal organisational changes in the Attorney-General's Chambers were made public recently and queried the need to make amendments to the Constitution to appoint the Deputy Attorney-General. The internal organisational changes are meant to streamline the internal processes. The amendments to the Constitution are required because the Deputy Attorney-General will enjoy the same security of tenure as the Attorney-General.,6,336,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00336
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Lim also made some comments in respect of the independence of Judges. I will take those comments when I deal with Ms Lim's and Mr Pritam Singh's comments.,7,337,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00337
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I welcome Mr Alvin Yeo's points. As regards the discretion that is given to the Chief Justice on International Judges, the intention is that we want the Bench to be of an outstanding quality. It is difficult to prescribe, through legislation, who they are or where they will be from. But there are a number of checks and balances. It has ultimately got to be on the advice of the Prime Minister and agreed to by the President. And our intention is that this will be a Bench that will attract international work. If you do not appoint people of that quality, you simply would not get work. So, I think we have to look at how the process goes, but I take the point.",8,338,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00338
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Moving to the points made by Ms Lim and Mr Singh, in a sense, their speeches relate to amendments which are not being made. It is not so much that they oppose the amendments that are being made. They are saying that this is an opportunity, since we are amending the Constitution, why do we not change parts to make sure that there is no possibility of appointing Judges or Judicial Commissioners for the short term. I take it that, specifically, and I heard them say that for the SICC and the related amendments, there are no objections. The objections are in relation to the appointment of Judicial Commissioners and Senior Judges, which is, in fact, a continuation of the existing practice, except that we are introducing the category of Senior Judges.",9,339,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00339
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Now, let me take that at two levels. The first is the broader philosophical issue. Of course, security of tenure is important, and that relates to independence. We now guarantee Puisne Judges up to the age of 65. Should we make it absolute to age 70 or such other age and should we not make the practical adjustments that we have made in respect of having appointments like that of the Judicial Commissioners?",10,340,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00340
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In an ideal world, that, I think, is an approach that should be considered and, fundamentally, we do not disagree. But the point is, you have to take the profession as you find it and then you have to try and fit the rules as best you can. If you are too theoretical or too dogmatic about this, in the end, you will not have the Judiciary that we have had with the outstanding reputation that it has. It has that reputation. It is highly ranked by the World Bank and other such institutions precisely because of the approach we have taken.",11,341,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00341
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"What is the balance between giving them security and the practicality? The practicality is that we have a small Bar, a small pool and an even smaller pool of talent of the quality to become High Court Judges and Chief Justices. If you approach a lawyer from the private sector, many of them – as Mr Lee Kuan Yew explained to this House long ago when he was dealing with Judicial Commissioners – have indicated and continue to indicate that they do not want the appointment as Puisne Judges immediately. They would rather come in as Judicial Commissioners (JCs) – take a short-term appointment, take it for three years and then decide whether they want to continue or whether they want to go back into practice. Some have stayed, some have gone back.",12,342,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00342
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you do not give that flexibility and if you are like some other countries where perhaps you have 100 people who can become High Court Judges, yes, then you have a wealth of talent. But if you have very few, then you need to make that adjustment and we have, therefore, provided for the appointment of JCs which has worked very well. Outstanding Judges, some of them started out as JCs – Chan Sek Keong, for example, possibly the greatest jurist of his generation, decided he would stay on and then he became the Chief Justice.",13,343,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00343
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In the context of the point made by Mr Singh about independence, I do not think anyone questioned his independence, even though he was renewed for short terms after he turned 65.",14,344,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00344
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I do not disagree with the fundamental point. I am just saying that those fundamental points sometimes have to be leavened with a practicality of a small Bar, which is what we have. And it is a very small talent pool. So, really, what we should be looking at is appointment of persons of the right timbre. At the end, that is your best guarantee. And judgments are public – we have a highly educated public, they can look at the judgments and decide whether the Bench is or is not of the quality that we want.",15,345,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00345
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Now, the other points, and I do want to emphasise, this is not really about the amendments we are making, it is about the amendments that they wish we were making. But I will deal with it in this broad way anyway. Two other points that were made by Mr Singh is, first of all, the Deputy Attorney-General – why? I think there was a gratuitous point about taxpayer's money, the suggestion being that we are wasting taxpayer's money. Really, let us just be quite fair about this without being theatrical. Of course, the Attorney-General's Chambers is strengthening its middle sector. It has expanded substantially in the last few years. It has taken on a lot of officers.",16,346,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00346
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"At the same time, the Attorney-General spoke with us and said that he felt the need for someone at the Deputy Attorney-General's level. We are people who take the views of our Chief Justice and Attorney-General very seriously. How does he interact vis-a-vis the Solicitor-General? The Deputy Attorney-General will be the equivalent of a High Court Judge and that is why we are making the Constitutional amendments. He will be between the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General. And the Attorney-General needs a person of the calibre of a High Court Judge who is constitutionally protected and has his salary paid from the Consolidated Fund, to do the duties that the Attorney-General may give to him to do to help the Attorney-General manage AGC. There is a need for that, and also to deal with a substantial increase in other aspects of work, including criminal work.",17,347,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00347
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Now, as regards clean wage, there is no inconsistency at all in the position that is being taken. Deputy Prime Minister Teo said to this House that the Judges' salaries were at about the right level, as determined by the committee that was appointed. He said last year that the outcome of the PSD's review was the appointment holders are paid at about the right level in order to recruit and retain persons of high ability, integrity and commitment to hold such key appointments, which included pensions. So, pensions were computed and that was part of the package.",18,348,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00348
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Salaries of Judges were delinked from salaries of political officeholders. Political officeholders do not get pensions. But Judges continue to get pensions and we have been very careful. By way of a Constitutional amendment, for example, you could have removed pensions of current Judges, but we do not want to do that.",19,349,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00349
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This amendment relates to future Judges who will be appointed and we want to move them from the pension system to a gratuity system. The main difference is two-fold. One, they will not get monthly payments; and, second, there will be no post-retirement medical benefits. They will get a lump sum at the end of their tenure. And that is the way that most of the Public Service has moved.",20,350,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00350
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The amounts were at the right level. The way you quantify that amount, we are trying to make sure that it is consistent with the rest of the Public Service. And this is the opportunity to make the Constitutional amendments without impacting on the current Judges because we do not want any suggestion that we are making changes to their income in a way that is detrimental to them. We are being quite careful about the way we are making this amendment. I think I have dealt with the questions that have been raised. Thank you, Madam.",21,351,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00351
2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"I have one clarification to make and two clarifications for Minister. First, the Minister mentioned that Mr Pritam Singh and myself were speaking more on the changes which we wish the Government was making rather than the changes that it is making. But the point is that in this Bill the Government does reorganise those provisions that allowed for temporary Judges so we have to take a stand on the Bill because of this.",1,352,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00352
2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Second, I would like to ask Minister whether I heard him correctly that he says that as a matter of principle, he does not disagree that having Judges of short tenure actually undermines the principle of judicial independence. I would like him to clarify because that was the sense which I have got from him.",2,353,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00353
2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"And the second clarification for Minister is that he mentioned that we have a small Bar and the practical matter was that it may not be so easy to find people who are willing to take on the judicial appointment. But I do notice that in the current High Court Bench, for example, although many of them, if not most of them, started as JCs, quite a number of them continued on to be confirmed as Judges without taking a break at all to go back to practice. So, is it a question of just finding the people who see taking on judgeship as a vocation and are willing to go into it without thinking about practice?",3,354,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00354
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I will deal with the two questions. The first is an observation which I do not think requires a response. Do I agree or did I say that, as a matter of principle, the short-term appointments undermine the principle of judicial independence? I think maybe Ms Lim and, perhaps, Mr Singh, will be the only two people in the House who might have gotten that impression. It is the very opposite of what I said.",1,355,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00355
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"What I was saying is that, as a matter of principle, I agree that we should try and look at giving security of tenure and, we do, for Puisne Judges, up to the age of 65. But you also make adjustments and, in the context of a small Bar, the difficulty of getting people and the need for people to come in for a short term and go off. You make your adjustments. It will not undermine judicial independence. Indeed, our Judiciary already has all these structures, and the only change that is being made here is the appointment of Senior Judges. Other than that, everything is the same. With all that existing structure of Judges after 65 being appointed for short terms, even the Chief Justice was reappointed – Chief Justice Yong Pung How and Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong had more than one short-term tenure extended a number of times. The independence of our Judiciary is something I do not think you challenge, I do not think anybody else challenges it, and we are very highly regarded and ranked. So, I believe that the current structure does not undermine the principle of judicial independence or integrity. And, indeed, we rank very highly. But I do agree also that, where possible, we should move towards greater security of tenure. So, there is a slight difference in emphasis.",2,356,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00356
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,As regards the third point – I am not quite sure. Can I ask Ms Lim to repeat the third point so that I can respond?,3,357,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00357
2014-11-04-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"I was referring to Minister's earlier explanation that because we have a small Bar, there was a limited pool of people whom you could tap on. So, some people wanted to go back to practice after trying it out and so on. But what I was saying is that in the current Supreme Court Judiciary, I do note that, I think all of them started off as JCs, but some of them never took a break to go back to practice – as in, they probably went into the JC-ship, well, with the intention, hopefully, to make the Judiciary post a career in that sense.",1,358,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00358
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Yes. I understand. By definition, those who became Judges obviously did not go back. That is why they remained as Judges. There are those who have left. And we believe that they contributed. We believe that having such a system where they come in for a two- or three-year appointment, and then let them make the choice, and also the Chief Justice sometimes will recommend that they are very good lawyers but they may not have the right judicial temperament. So, that has allowed us to have the flexibility, without really, I think, anyone questioning their independence or integrity. Therefore, we have not sought to change that system.",1,359,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00359
2014-11-04-T-016,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And up to now, I can tell Ms Lim that when practitioners are approached, often, their preference is to come in as Judicial Commissioners, and then decide. They often say to us, ""We do not know whether this is something that we can do."" It is not a question of aptitude. It is not a question of wanting to contribute. It is not a question of taking a salary cut. Even when they are prepared to do all that, they do not know whether they would be cut out for it. It is a very harsh isolated life and it is very hard work. So, combine the two, some people have told us they would prefer to go back. So, I think it has worked well. With the touchstone that, as far as possible, as our Bar increases in size, in depth, in quality, we should try and move towards greater rather than lesser security. With that caveat, I think, at this point in time, these changes would greatly enhance the reputation of our Judiciary. Thank you.",2,360,2014-11-04-T-016-S-00360

2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The SICC will have jurisdiction to hear cases that can be heard by the High Court in its original civil jurisdiction, and are international and commercial in nature. The Rules of Court will set out the types of cases that are considered international and commercial in nature. For certainty, potential parties will have the option of applying for a pre-action certificate to certify that the intended action is international and commercial in nature. The pre-action certificate may also certify such other matters as the Rules of Court may prescribe.",5,398,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00398
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In addition, cases commenced in the SICC may be transferred to the High Court, and vice versa. This will enable cases which are more appropriately heard in the other Court to be transferred. The procedure and conditions for such transfer of cases will be set out in the Rules of Court. Proceedings in the SICC will be heard by either a single Judge or by three Judges. Where proceedings are heard by three Judges, the Chief Justice shall appoint one of the Judges to preside. The cases will be decided in accordance with the decision of the majority.",6,399,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00399

2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The rules and procedure before the SICC will differ from those before the High Court in three broad areas. First, cases before the SICC will not be bound by the rules of evidence that are applicable under the Singapore law in such cases and to the extent as provided for in the Rules of Court. Second, the Rules of Court may provide for different procedures and practices to be followed in the SICC. Third, even where Singapore's laws of evidence are applicable, the SICC may allow any questions of foreign law to be determined on the basis of submissions, without requiring formal proof by experts.",8,401,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00401
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The SICC's jurisdiction will generally be consensual. Parties who have voluntarily chosen to have their disputes adjudicated by the SICC are expected to comply with its orders without the need to resort to enforcement measures.,9,402,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00402
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Bill further provides that the parties to an agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of the SICC shall be considered to have agreed  (a) to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the SICC; (b) to carry out any SICC judgment without undue delay; and (c) to waive any recourse to any court or tribunal outside Singapore against any SICC judgment or the enforcement of such judgment. That is, unless the parties have expressly provided otherwise. Parties may also strengthen the enforceability of SICC judgments by including clauses in their jurisdiction agreements that will have the effect of waiving their rights to defend against an action based on an SICC judgment in any jurisdiction.",10,403,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00403
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mdm Speaker, I will now turn to the other amendments.

2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Bill also introduces a new procedure for applications made to the Court of Appeal, for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, I rise to support the Bill. I will deal with the provisions establishing the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC). Before that, I declare my interests as a lawyer practising in cross-border disputes.",1,408,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00408
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The Bill represents a bold move towards cementing Singapore's position as a leading destination for international dispute resolution. The growth of cross-border investment and trade, particularly in Asia, heralds a corresponding increase in demand for first-rate, efficient and dependable dispute resolution mechanisms. That is the value proposition, the brand, Singapore is able to offer in Asia. More than a few Asian clients have told me that they regard the Singapore system as one which will give a fair, just and reasonably expedient outcome. And so if two or more parties from different Asian countries enter into a deal, they will likely want their disputes to be settled in a neutral environment, and with the assurance that the outcome will be determined on the merits of the case and on the merits alone. And we have seen the results of that confidence in Singapore. Singapore is today regarded as the leader in Asia for arbitration, and the number of new cases handled by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) is increasing steadily. And this, as the Minister said in the last Bill, did not happen by luck or accident.",2,409,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00409
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But not all disputes can be arbitrated, and there remains an opportunity to provide a platform for international parties to resolve their differences in a court setting. The establishment of the SICC is a bold and creative move to fill that gap. With our well-developed legal infrastructure and reputable judiciary, and also our willingness to allow experienced judges and practitioners from elsewhere to participate, the SICC represents a new way of thinking about international dispute resolution.",3,410,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00410
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),I would like to deal with several aspects of the Bill.,4,411,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00411
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, a large number of details concerning the SICC will be prescribed by subsidiary legislation, that is, they will be issued without scrutiny and debate in this House. This is no doubt understandable and warranted for technical details and procedural matters. For example, rules governing how questions of foreign law will be determined and rules governing court procedures and practices in the SICC are suitably dealt with by rules. However, I question why important and fundamental aspects of the SICC should not come directly under Parliament's purview.",5,412,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00412
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"One such aspect is the SICC's jurisdiction. This is governed by the proposed section18D, which sets out three conditions that must be fulfilled for the SICC to have jurisdiction over a dispute. First, the action must be international and commercial in nature. Second, the action must be one that the High Court may hear and try in its original civil jurisdiction. And then we come to the third condition, which states that the action must satisfy ""such other conditions as the Rules of Court may prescribe"". Given that these three conditions must be fulfilled together in order for the SICC to have jurisdiction over the action, the conditions prescribed by the Rules of Court are pivotal.",6,413,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00413
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Further, the new section 80(2A)(b) allows rules to be made to prescribe what constitutes ""an action of an international and commercial nature"". This should be contrasted with section 5(2) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 134A) which specifically defines what an international arbitration is.",7,414,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00414
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"What this means is that Parliament has no direct control over a matter as fundamental as the SICC's jurisdiction. I would like to ask the Minister why this cannot be prescribed in the Act. And what are the definitions and conditions that will be prescribed by the Rules of Court that cannot be set out in the Bill? Section 18D can be contrasted with sections 15-22 of the SCJA, which sets out the jurisdiction of the Singapore High Court in a straightforward fashion. I understand the purpose is to allow flexibility. But there should be a balance between certainty and flexibility, particularly on fundamental issues like jurisdiction.",8,415,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00415
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My second point concerns the pre-action certificate. This is governed by section 18E of the Bill. According to this provision, parties intending to bring an action in the SICC may apply for a pre-action certificate to state that the intended action is international and commercial in nature for the purposes of the jurisdiction of the SICC and that such matters as the Rules of Court prescribe had been satisfied. I understand the rationale is to ensure that only the proper cases are brought before the SICC. My concern is that it adds an extra layer to the process of making a claim to the SICC, and will have implications on time and costs, therefore making the SICC less attractive. The method prescribed by the Act is for parties to file an original summons – I know it is supposed to be heard on expedited basis, but could there have been a simpler way to get the pre-action certificate issued. And could the Minister elaborate on how this application will be expedited?",9,416,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00416
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Third, I would like to comment on section 18J, which provides for the transfer of cases from the SICC to the High Court and vice versa. Again, the details governing such transfers will be set out in the Rules of Court. Nonetheless, cases properly brought before the High Court, may, without the consent of the parties, be transferred to the SICC. Such transfers may affect costs because the SICC fees may differ from High Court fees. Such transfers may also have an impact on certainty as the SICC Rules and practice directions will now govern the proceedings. Further, foreign rules of evidence may apply to the proceedings and foreign representation may be allowed. These factors may not have been contemplated by the parties when they first brought the dispute to the High Court. Therefore, I would like to clarify the circumstances in which a transfer may be made.",10,417,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00417
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My fourth point has to do with representation by foreign lawyers in the SICC. This is provided for by section 18M of the Bill. The provision states that a party to a case in the SICC may, in accordance with the Rules of Court, be represented by a foreign lawyer who has been registered under Part IVB of the Legal Profession Act. This implies that there are two pre-requisites for foreign representation  first, the Rules of Court must permit it; and secondly, the lawyer must be duly registered. Again, I would like to seek clarification from the Minister regarding the Rules. What are the conditions that must be satisfied before a party can be represented by a registered foreign lawyer? For example, will foreign representation be restricted to cases governed by foreign law?",11,418,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00418
2014-11-04-T-017,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My final point has to do with our goals for the SICC and this is a broader point. There is no doubt that there is great interest internationally in the SICC. I have lost count of the number of times foreign lawyers visiting Singapore have asked my colleagues and me about it. The simple question is this  how will we define its success? Does the Ministry have benchmarks it expects the SICC to meet, whether in terms of the number of cases, the value of disputes, the growth of the legal sector or even the direct or indirect revenues it generates for Singapore and Singapore businesses? In short, do we have a list of KPIs which we hope the SICC will meet?",12,419,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00419
2014-11-04-T-017,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,Minister Shanmugam.,1,420,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00420
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank Mr Hri Kumar for supporting the Bill. I will address the questions that he raised or at least try to address them. Mr Kumar's first concern is that a number of details and issues concerning the SICC will be set out under subsidiary legislation, for example, those relating to SICC's jurisdiction.",1,421,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00421
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Section 18D provides three requirements to be satisfied before the SICC will have jurisdiction to hear any action. As Mr Kumar noted, the three requirements are cumulative. So, for SICC to have jurisdiction, it must first be an action that can be heard by the High Court under its original civil jurisdiction. Second, there is the additional requirement to show that the action is international and commercial. So, that circumscribes the nature of the cases. The Rules of Court cannot enlarge the jurisdiction of the SICC. It can refine it, it can define it, but it cannot enlarge what is set out in legislation.",2,422,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00422
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Ultimately, Parliament, of course, has direct control over the ambit of SICC's jurisdiction. For example, if necessary, we can enact further laws. At this stage, we have not sought to define it with too much precision, because the objective is to attract international and commercial cases to Singapore and we took the approach that flexibility is key and that is best achieved through putting it under the Rules of Court. The Rules Committee is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes the Attorney-General, Judges and Members of the Bar.",3,423,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00423
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I will come back to the type of cases the SICC will hear, but let me first deal with the pre-action certificate question governed by section 18E of the Bill. This is an optional step for parties to take. It is not required, it is not essential, but sometimes parties do not want to start and then face an objection that the case is not appropriate. So, if you wanted to have a higher level of certainty, you will go and apply for the certificate. And because the SICC is new and untested, parties would be very uncertain as to whether it will or will not have jurisdiction, or how it will resolve threshold issues. They may not even be sure if their dispute is international or commercial in nature, which are jurisdictional requirements. So, we thought that it would be advantageous for parties to be able to apply for such a certificate in advance of the actual proceedings commencing. We considered other options, a number of options, and we spent a lot of time thinking about this. But in the end, we thought that allowing this pre-action certificate is the easiest and it will be certified by the Court.",4,424,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00424
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The third point that Mr Kumar made relates to the Court's power to order a transfer of cases from the High Court to the SICC and vice versa. The rationale is to allow the cases to be heard in the Court which is more appropriate, rather than again trying to set it in stone upfront, and the Rules of Court again are expected to set out the detailed procedure for such transfers. Section 18J(3) contemplates the Court making consequential orders to address the procedural and other issues that Mr Kumar raises.",5,425,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00425
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the adoption of foreign rules of evidence and foreign representation, these are optional. Unless the parties make the necessary application, the status quo will prevail, which means the Singapore rules of evidence apply and parties will continue to be represented by local counsel. So, when can parties be represented by foreign lawyers in the SICC? We envisage a system of registration. They will have to register under the Legal Profession Act to appear in the SICC. There will be two types of registration – either a full registration or a restricted registration. I will deal with the requirements for registration in the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill. Basically, in essence, foreign lawyers will only be allowed to appear in cases defined in the Rules of Court. These could be cases which are governed by foreign laws or have no connection to Singapore, or Singapore law cases but with an element involving foreign law, and you want a foreign lawyer to come and argue that specific foreign law part. So, subject to that, for Singapore cases, it is not envisaged that they will come and argue.",6,426,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00426
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you look at the report of the SICC Committee, there can be situations where a case involves Singapore law but has no substantial connection to Singapore. Foreign parties, with disputes arising overseas, but Singapore law has been chosen for some reason. In such situations, foreign counsel may be permitted to appear, but the objective is a very different one. It is to persuade parties to choose Singapore law as a choice of law, which will be beneficial for our legal industry.",7,427,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00427
2014-11-04-T-017,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Finally, on the question of how the success of the SICC will be defined, I think the data is important, like the number of cases filed and disposed, the values of the claims, which is very much the way we look at arbitration. Everyone knows it is a success now. I think it is not going to be possible to precisely track the direct and indirect economic benefits. But we have to define ""success"" at two levels  one, the number of cases and the type of claims that have come through; and, second, also, the intangible, which is how it positions us as a legal hub, as a place to go to in all of Asia. So, if you sit anywhere in the world and you think of a dispute resolution in the Courts, in a neutral forum, would you think of Singapore? That is what we want to try and achieve. To some extent, we are the only jurisdiction in Asia now that can even think of it. It is not going to be easy. It is not going to be achieved any time soon, but we have to try. And this is an attempt.",8,428,2014-11-04-T-017-S-00428

2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The various stages of the disciplinary framework, namely the Review Committee, the Inquiry Committee, the Disciplinary Tribunal and the Court of three Judges, are identical to the present framework that is applicable to Singapore-qualified lawyers. However, where a foreign-qualified lawyer is being disciplined, a foreign-qualified lawyer will sit on each of the committees, as well as on the Disciplinary Tribunal.",14,451,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00451
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Bill also establishes a new Professional Conduct Council (PCC) chaired by the Chief Justice. The PCC will oversee the enactment of the relevant rules relating to professional conduct matters for Singapore-qualified lawyers and foreign-qualified lawyers practising law in Singapore, and the management of law practices. This ensures that all lawyers will be subject to common ethical and professional responsibility standards.",15,452,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00452

2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Presently, there is no integrated regime governing the regulation of law practices as entities. The Attorney-General oversees the regulation and discipline of foreign law practices, as well as collaborations involving Singapore law practices and foreign law practices, and the Law Society oversees various approvals pertaining to Singapore law practices, such as name approvals, but does not otherwise regulate or license Singapore law practices.",17,454,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00454
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Bill seeks to consolidate the parallel regulatory regimes into one by establishing an integrated licensing system administered by a single central body, which we intend to name the Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA). The LSRA will oversee and regulate local and foreign law practice entities that operate in Singapore. The Bill establishes the post of the Director of Legal Services (DLS) to head the LSRA. The DLS will have the following powers and functions. He will take over the Attorney-General's and Law Society's respective powers to register law practices and regulate business criteria that are applicable to law practices in Singapore. However, all matters relating to professional conduct will remain under the Supreme Court's oversight. He will take over the Attorney-General's function of registering foreign lawyers in Singapore, and he will regulate and license law practices wishing to structure themselves as Alternative Business Structures (ABSes) in Singapore. I will explain more about ABSes shortly.",18,455,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00455
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Having an integrated licensing system would make it administratively more convenient for law practice entities to set up offices in Singapore by streamlining processes and allow for more consistent supervision and enforcement of the ""business criteria"" applicable to the various law practice entities, thereby facilitating a more coherent and consistent regulatory approach.",19,456,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00456
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Bill also provides for the flexibility to accommodate alternative business structures or ABSes which have begun to come up in other major jurisdictions such as Australia and the United Kingdom. Unlike traditional law practices which are completely owned by lawyers and only offer legal services, ABSes are innovative structures where non-lawyers are allowed to be partners, directors or shareholders, or to have a share in the profits of the law practice; and/or firms which offer multi-disciplinary services beyond the provision of legal services, for example, by including accountancy services.",20,457,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00457
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"ABSes present new ways for law practices to better organise their business.

This allows non-lawyer employees to become partners, directors or shareholders, or to share in the profits of the law practice. However, LDPs will only be permitted to provide legal services. Further, Non-Lawyer Owners will need to apply for approval to become an owner or manager of the law practice. The suitability of each applicant will have to be assessed. If approved, the Non-Lawyer Owner will be subject to the same management, professional responsibility and ethical rules in the professional conduct rules; and the same disciplinary framework as their lawyer counterparts.",23,460,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00460

2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mdm Speaker, the Bill also makes some miscellaneous amendments which I will now go through. It introduces anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations into the primary legislation. These obligations are mainly taken from existing obligations in the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules. The Law Society will also be given the power to make related rules, with the approval of the Minister for Law. The Law Society's existing powers to inspect Singapore lawyers for compliance with such obligations will be extended to foreign lawyers.",25,462,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00462

2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Secondly, the Bill enables the Law Society to introduce a new requirement for Singapore lawyers to disclose the number of hours spent in each preceding year on pro bono work. This will take effect from 2015 onwards. This requirement was recommended by the Committee to Study Community Legal Services Initiatives. This Committee was chaired by Attorney-General VK Rajah, who was then a Judge of Appeal, and it included representatives from the Singapore Bar.

2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Lastly, the Bill makes changes to better organise the categorisation of foreign-qualified lawyers seeking registration under the Act and sunset categories that will be streamlined. In this regard, a new category of registration will be created for foreign lawyers who do not practise in Singapore, but who wish to hold an interest in a Singapore law practice, to register and obtain approval to do the same.

2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. It seeks to introduce a raft of changes which are designed to introduce the new regulatory framework for the legal profession to bring the increasing number of foreign lawyers under the same umbrella and to enhance the measures relating to law firms to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. In so doing, we strengthen the profession and fortify Singapore's reputation as Asia's legal hub.",1,469,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00469
2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"The new regulatory framework gives effect through recommendations of the Committee to review the regulatory framework of the Singapore's legal services sector. This includes the creation of the new office of Director of Legal Services (DLS) under MinLaw to administer the new regime, applicable to all lawyer practising here, as well as the different legal vehicles which house them. Hence, the framework will cover not just Singapore lawyers practising Singapore law but also those Singapore lawyers practising foreign law. It will also cover foreign lawyers practising foreign law and foreign lawyers who practise Singapore law. It will even cover foreign lawyers who do not practise here but are partners or shareholders in Singapore law firms; and even regulated non-practitioners who cannot be partners or shareholders unless registered as regulated non-practitioners.",2,470,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00470
2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"This is not to say that it will adopt a one-size-fits-all framework, rather, they are tailored requirements for each of these different categories. But all will be overseen and administered by the Director of Legal Services which should better ensure evenness of treatment across the different categories of lawyers.",3,471,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00471
2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Similarly, they are specifically tailored regimes for the different vehicles through which lawyers practise, ranging from sole proprietorships and traditional partnerships to limited liability partnerships and law corporations. Again, all will be overseen by the DLS in a consistent manner.",4,472,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00472
2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),I do have certain questions arising from the proposed changes. There is a power to make all the partners in an LLP or all directors in an LLC or law corporation jointly liable for unbefitting conduct which cannot be attributed to one or more identified individuals. This is potentially wide liability for what appears to be a generally worded offence. And can I ask the Minister to clarify how this power will be exercised and what would constitute unbefitting conduct?,5,473,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00473
2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Further, as mentioned above, the Bill provides for the registration of this animal called ""regulated non-practitioners"". They can, if registered, be directors, partners or shareholders in a law practice. Could I ask which class of persons this provision is aimed at and what purpose it is trying to achieve? So, for instance, is it financial investors who can be registered as regulated non-practitioners or those who practise a different professional discipline, or perhaps a combination of the two?",6,474,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00474
2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"I do recognise that the new framework itself is in recognition of the greatest sophistication of legal practice in the modern day where lawyers avail themselves of different business structures to suit their particular practice objectives. At the same time, it helps to fill a lacuna in the current regime where foreign lawyers, who are estimated to number over 1,000, are likely or hardly regulated here at all.",7,475,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00475
2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),There will also be a specific regime for those foreign lawyers admitted to appear at the new Singapore International Commercial Court as this is the key element to make it an international court of choice. Local practitioners who are wary of this need only hark back to the fears where the arbitration regulations were amended to allow foreign counsels to appear freely in arbitrations here. This liberalisation helps spark a boom in arbitration cases coming to Singapore and local lawyers got their fair share or more of these cases.,8,476,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00476
2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"I turn now to the strengthening of measures to prevent money laundering and its associated evils. This is also a welcome step. Given Singapore's position as a financial centre, lawyers do need to recognise that monies remitted through their firms, ostensibly for commercial transactions, may have a more sinister provenance or more deadly objective.",9,477,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00477
2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Hence, our lawyers do need to support the effort to combat this modern-day evil with a range of provisions to prohibit receiving monies from anonymous sources to placing onus on lawyers to report suspicious transactions. While this does increase the compliance load on our law firms, they are necessary measures to make the world a safer place for all of us.",10,478,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00478
2014-11-04-T-018,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Singapore is known as the bastion for the rule of law which has been a pillar of our development as a leading international banking and services hub.

2014-11-04-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, I declare my interest as a Singapore lawyer holding a practising certificate. The Bill makes rather drastic changes in the way the legal profession is organised and regulated. While I am generally supportive of the Bill, I would like to seek clarifications on two areas.",1,480,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00480
2014-11-04-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, I understand that the Law Society had, in April, expressed some concerns to MinLaw about the Bill. They observed that the Law Society's self-regulatory role was being further eroded. For instance, the Director of Legal Services takes on a big role to register firms, and non-practitioners will also be involved in issuing practice directions and sitting on the Professional Conduct Council that oversees the relevant rules governing professional conduct matters. The Law Society had also indicated in its letter in April that it had insufficient time to provide feedback to the Ministry of the changes. How did the Ministry engage the Law Society before this Bill was presented to Parliament and how did the Ministry take the Law Society's feedback into account?",2,481,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00481
2014-11-04-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"My second concern is about the new section 36G under which non-lawyers can be approved to own shares in law firms. Reservations about this were expressed by the Committee chaired by Mr Sundaresh Menon to review the regulatory framework of the Singapore Legal Sector in his report in January 2014. The Committee noted that such alternative business structures risked consumer protection. Lawyers might have competing duties to the Court and to shareholders. Non-lawyer owners might have conflicts of interest. There were also concerns about client confidentiality, as different professions have different standards of duty, core values and ethics.",3,482,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00482
2014-11-04-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The Law Society too, expressed grave concerns that there may be abuse should non-lawyers be permitted to participate in law practices as they ""anticipate that such entities would inevitably be profit-driven which may result in higher legal costs for the public"".",4,483,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00483
2014-11-04-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),They expect that lawyers might be urged to maximise billing hours resulting in unnecessary and protracted proceedings. They were also worried that conflicts of interest might arise if non-lawyer owners had ties with large corporations such as banks and real estate corporations which are profit-driven.,5,484,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00484
2014-11-04-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Earlier, the Minister mentioned some safeguards to ensure that non-lawyer owners are subject to the same standards of the Legal Profession, for example, in ethics and confidentiality. I would like him to elaborate further on the safeguards, for example, are there any professions forbidden from being non-lawyer owners and in particular, whether there are any additional safeguards against excessive legal costs.",6,485,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00485
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill. I declare my interests as a legal practitioner. Our legal industry is undergoing a sea change. It is almost unrecognisable from the industry I joined 23 years ago.",1,486,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00486
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The number of foreign lawyers and foreign law firms has grown significantly in the past decade. With the growth of the arbitration market in Singapore and the new Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC) which will be set up early next year, there will continue to be interest in the Singapore market from foreign players. Additionally, we are about to liberalise the business structures of law firms to allow greater participation of non-lawyers. The Bill paves the way forward by updating our system of regulation and facilitating upcoming developments.",2,487,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00487
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In this regard, I would like to raise several points.",3,488,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00488
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The first concerns section 71, which among other things, empowers the Professional Conduct Council (PCC) to make rules governing every ""regulated legal practitioner"". This refers to Singapore lawyers and foreign lawyers who are registered to practise law in Singapore or have interests in Singapore law practices.",4,489,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00489
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Currently, the regulatory regime is bifurcated. Lawyers practising Singapore law are governed under section 71 while those practising foreign law come under the purview of the Attorney-General. There is also no formal institutional disciplinary process for lawyers practising foreign law. Given that approximately 20% of Singapore's total lawyer population now consists of foreign lawyers, this move towards consolidating our regulatory regime is a welcome one.",5,490,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00490
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"One issue that will arise in devising a unified regulatory approach has to do with the different standards of conduct and ethics that apply in different jurisdictions. These differences are manifested in all areas of practice, from case management to witness preparation to billing and fees. Conduct that is acceptable overseas may be regarded unacceptable here. Contingency fees are a case in point. For the non-lawyers in this House, these are fees charged for a lawyer's services that depend on the result – so you only get paid if there is a favourable outcome or settlement in your client's favour. While permitted in several countries, including the UK, contingency fees are prohibited in Singapore.",6,491,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00491
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Fees are only one example. There are other important differences such as the rules against conflicts of interest  in what circumstances can a lawyer take on a case which involves a previous client or where in a matter which he has advised previously. My question is this  what rules will we adopt in regulating foreign lawyers or lawyers practising foreign law? Will they be held to the same standards as Singapore lawyers? If different, are we potentially making it more difficult for Singapore firms to compete with foreign ones? Just taking an example, in the SICC, will we, for example, permit a foreign firm to offer contingency fee arrangement while a local firm cannot? And how will that level the playing field between a foreign and a local law firm?",7,492,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00492
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My second point concerns foreign representation in the SICC. Foreign lawyers who wish to act in SICC proceedings must first be registered under section 36P. They may be granted full registration or restricted registration in accordance with the qualifications and requirements prescribed by section 36P(3)-(4). The Bill, however, does not spell out the criteria that will inform this assessment. These matters will be left to subsidiary legislation.",8,493,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00493
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),I renew the comments I made on the Supreme Court of Judicature Bill on leaving too many matters to subsidiary legislation. But I hope the Minister will nonetheless shed some light on how this assessment will be carried out.,9,494,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00494
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"On a related note, foreign lawyers who represent parties in the SICC do not fall within the definition of a ""regulated legal practitioner"" in section 71. So, these lawyers will not be regulated by the PCC. Instead, they will be registered under section 36P and complaints against them may be made under section 36S. So, it is a different regime. Section 36Y(2)(j) states that the Rules Committee may make rules ""regulating the professional practice, etiquette and conduct of foreign lawyers registered under section 36P"". Could the Minister clarify how these rules will compare to those governing Singapore and foreign lawyers? Furthermore, the Bill is silent as to whether a foreign lawyer who has had due cause shown against him may be debarred from applying to register in the future. Will this be covered in the Rules?",10,495,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00495
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Third, I would like to raise some questions about section 2F, which gives the Director of Legal Services wide-ranging powers to require law practice entities to provide information. According to section 2F, the Director may require information from law practice entities or their directors or partners for (a) carrying out his functions under the Act; or (b) compiling statistics on law practice entities. A failure to comply with the Director's requirement is an offence punishable by a fine, imprisonment or both under section 2G. With regard to the first purpose, section 2A states that the Director is to administer Part IVA and IXA and to perform such other functions as the Minister may assign to him. So, essentially, the Director's functions are left open-ended.",11,496,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00496
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"It is worth noting that the Director's power to require documents or information to investigate a possible breach of law or rule is already provided for in sections 2B and 2C. So, the rationale for the Director's powers under section 2F cannot be to facilitate an investigation of possible misconduct. With regard to the second purpose, it suffices to say that the Director may ask for virtually any information under the guise of ""compiling statistics"". Section 2E then allows any information in the Director's possession to be furnished to the Attorney-General, the Registrar of the Supreme Court, the Singapore Institute of Legal Education, the Council of the Law Society, the Law Society, a Ministry or department of the Government, an Organ of State or a Statutory Board and so on – so long as the information is required by and for the performance of any of their functions. The group of persons and agencies the information can be shared with is therefore very large.",12,497,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00497
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Taken as a whole, these provisions raise serious privacy concerns. I would like to clarify what is the purpose of section 2F and why does it need to be drafted so widely? What are its limits? And I hope the Minister will give some clarity.",13,498,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00498
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My fourth point has to do with allowing non-practitioners to own equity in, or share in the profits of, a law practice. I support this amendment in principle. Individuals in other areas of expertise – in financial management or accounting for example – can add considerable value to law firms, and should be allowed to take equity. This will allow law practices to retain and reward talent.",14,499,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00499
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"That said, under section 36G, a non-legal practitioner shall not be a director, partner or shareholder in, or share in the profits of, law practices unless he or she is first registered. To register, an individual must first satisfy ""such requirements as may be prescribed"". Again, we appear to have relegated important issues through subsidiary legislation. What will these requirements be and why can we not have some basic requirements spelt out in the Act? This is not a matter of procedure or implementation, but a fundamental shift in the way law practices will be organised and run.",15,500,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00500
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"This is happening in other jurisdictions. Australia and the UK have liberalised their systems to allow legal services to be conducted through what they call Alternative Business Structures (ABS) like the Multi-Disciplinary Practice (MDP) and the Incorporated Legal Practice (ILP). In fact, Australia made the news in 2007 when two of its law firms became the first in the world to list on the stock exchange.",16,501,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00501
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Today, Singapore is taking a tentative step towards permitting ABS models. But to what extent? Will we eventually see lawyers and accountants in Singapore teaming up to give financial management advice? Or engineers, architects and lawyers banding together to provide real estate development services? Are we going to take the next step of allowing lay individuals to invest in law practices, and to what extent will that compromise professional and ethical standards because lay individuals would want a return for their investment? I would hope that Minister, with his breath of experience and knowledge, can perhaps give this House perspective of how he sees the legal landscape develop in the future.",17,502,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00502
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Let me end on a positive note. I support the new reporting requirement for Singapore-qualified lawyers to disclose the number of hours they spend each year on pro bono work. My initial reaction was that pro bono is voluntary and should not be the subject of oversight or regulation. People like to run lawyers down, but many lawyers regularly give up time and income to help others, and without calling attention to what they do.",18,503,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00503
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Nonetheless, we can and should do more, and this reporting requirement will facilitate that effort. It allows us to assess the gap between the supply of pro bono work and its demand, and what we can do to narrow that gap. It will also help lawyers take stock of what they have done and assess if they can do more. Yes, lawyers need to earn a living, but we should never forget that we also have a critical role to play to ensure access to justice for all. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.",19,504,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00504

2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. If I can take the points raised, Mr Yeo asked about the purpose of introducing ""regulated non-practitioners"", and the classes of persons who may apply to become one. The reference to a regulated non-practitioner is to implement the recommendation to allow law firms to structure as Legal Disciplinary Practices. I had set out the purpose earlier.",1,506,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00506
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Yeo also asked about the power to make all partners in an LLP, or directors in an LLC, jointly liable for ""unbefitting conduct"" which cannot be attributed to one or more identified individuals. That provision is actually not new. It is found in sections 81F(2) and 81U(2) of the Legal Profession Act.",2,507,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00507
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The purpose of this provision is to ensure that consumers of legal services are protected notwithstanding that the firm is structured as an LLP or LLC and to ensure parity with other forms of corporate structures, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships, but I take Mr Yeo's points and since really we are talking about something that is quasi criminal, I think appropriate discretion ought to be exercised depending on the extent of liability and the extent of mens rea and culpability involved.",3,508,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00508
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As to what constitutes ""conduct unbefitting an honourable profession"", I think even the Courts have struggled with that, but it would include any breach of ethical or professional responsibility standards set out in the Act or Professional Conduct Rules. I think it will also go beyond that.",4,509,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00509
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Kumar enquired about the approach taken to unify the professional conduct rules for Singapore and foreign lawyers practising in Singapore, given the varying professional conduct rules across different jurisdictions. The intent behind a unified disciplinary framework is to have a basic set of requirements applicable equally to both Singapore and foreign lawyers offering legal services in Singapore.",5,510,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00510
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In proposing this reform, the Regulatory Committee which comprised both Singapore lawyers and foreign lawyer representatives, was mindful that lawyers in Singapore are now largely operating in the context of an international environment. As Mr Kumar has pointed out, there are some differences across jurisdictions with regard to specific rules.",6,511,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00511
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As such, the Regulatory Committee proposed the following approach to devising the new Professional Conduct Rules (PCR). First, general and universally accepted principles of conduct will apply to all lawyers in Singapore; and second, specific rules that are more relevant to the practice of Singapore law will only apply to Singapore lawyers, and foreign lawyers practising Singapore law. For example, rules relating to court proceedings and rules peculiar to the practice of Singapore law. Third, new management rules will apply to local and foreign lawyers involved in the management of a law practice.",7,512,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00512
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The Regulatory Committee has tasked a Sub-Committee comprising practitioners from both the local and foreign Bar to work through the details and the rules will be put out for consultation as soon as a draft is ready.,8,513,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00513
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Kumar had some questions on foreign representation in the SICC. He has pointed out that the Bill does not spell out the qualifications and requirements for registration with the SICC. The approach taken for registration and administrative issues under the LPA is that, for example, under the current LPA, the qualifications and requirements for registration of foreign lawyers in local or foreign firms are left to subsidiary legislation. So, we have taken the same approach now, and really because most of it relates to administrative details that may change from time to time.",9,514,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00514
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For registration to appear before the SICC, the intention is to set out a basic standard of qualifications and requirements in subsidiary legislation as well. I had previously explained the substantive aspect as to when you can register for actual appearance.",10,515,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00515
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Kumar also asked about the PCR which will apply to foreign lawyers registered with the SICC. Section 36Y(2)(j) provides that Rules may be made for regulating the professional practice, etiquette and conduct of foreign lawyers registered under section 36P. The Code of Ethics applicable to these foreign lawyers, therefore, will be set out in subsidiary legislation.",11,516,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00516
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As for the query on whether a foreign lawyer who has had due cause shown against him may be debarred from applying to register in future, section 36U(5) states that a foreign lawyer shall be permanently prohibited from re-applying for registration where his registration has been cancelled, unless the Court otherwise orders. So, we give the discretion to the Courts.",12,517,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00517
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The questions on Director of Legal Services  first, I think it is important to emphasise what is the role of the DLS. The DLS will head a new division within MinLaw, likely to be named the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, and he or she will oversee, first, the licensing and regulation of business criteria applicable to law practices, so it is administrative; and, second, the registration of foreign lawyers.",13,518,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00518
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The DLS' regulatory focus is to ensure that there is adherence to some sort of logical business and licensing criteria, for example, the licensing of QFLPs or the naming of law practices and profit sharing and equity limit rules on Joint Law Ventures and Formal Law Alliance arrangements between a Singapore and foreign law practice. As part of this role, section 2E allows for mutual co-operation between the DLS and other stakeholder agencies which are involved in various aspects of the regulatory regime of the legal profession. For information to be shared, it must be required for the discharge of the relevant agency's functions.",14,519,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00519
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The DLS' powers, as Members can see, are scoped for the formulation of regulation and policy, and the administration of his functions under the Act. The DLS is legally required to exercise his powers reasonably and for a proper purpose. Section 2F allows the compilation and aggregation of more accurate and timely information relevant to the legal services industry as a whole. Currently, that information must be obtained through surveys under the Statistics Act. However, data which are current and of good quality are not always available and this can, in turn, affect the quality of policymaking and regulation.",15,520,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00520
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As regards the points Mr Kumar made about allowing non-practitioners to own equity in or share in the profits of a law practice, the Bill seeks to set out some safeguards. If approved, the non-lawyer owners or managers will be subject to the same management and ethical rules as in the new PCR as lawyers. If found to be in breach of these rules, they will be subject to the same disciplinary framework as their lawyer counterparts.",16,521,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00521
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As to the detailed requirements that a non-practitioner has to fulfil in order to become a director, partner or shareholder, or to share in the profits of a law practice, again, the intention is that this will be addressed by way of subsidiary legislation which will be drawn up in consultation with the Law Society as well as other industry stakeholders. The Regulatory Committee had recommended that a 25% cap on the total non-practitioner ownership be permitted, and there be a ""suitability"" or ""fitness"" test.",17,522,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00522
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The concept of ABSes, of course, is new to Singapore as Mr Kumar has pointed out. We intend to adopt an incremental approach starting with LDPs. In relation to the possibility of allowing other types of ABSes, we will study this issue carefully in consultation with the industry.",18,523,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00523
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As regards the points made by Ms Lim on Law Society's regulatory role, I think it is important to understand what the amendments are. We have been working closely with the Law Society on the implementation details. Let us be clear – there is individual regulation and there is entity regulation. For individual regulation, the lawyer himself, for professional conduct matters, the Law Society will continue in its current role as secretariat supporting the Inquiry Committee and the Review Committee for the disciplinary process. The key change will be that the disciplinary process will now also extend to foreign-qualified lawyers, ultimately, subject to the control of the Courts.",19,524,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00524
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For entity regulation, the functions currently handled by the Law Society relate to fairly administrative issues like the naming of business, approvals to share premises, and so on and the licensing criteria of Singapore law practices, and these will be transferred to the LSRA. The broader regulations and the transfer to MinLaw is necessary, really, for us to adapt, anticipate and keep ahead of changes and have a certain logical framework for allowing structures to come through which would help our legal profession and the industry.",20,525,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00525
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For example, the LDPs and in future, perhaps, the ABSes, how they should be dealt with, what sort of rules should we put in and what sort of equity caps should be allowed. Of course, we will consult the legal profession but these have wider economic implications as well and therefore they have to be dealt with by MinLaw as recommended by the Committee headed by the current Chief Justice. To emphasise, disciplinary matters will continue to be handled by the Law Society coming under the ultimate oversight of the Supreme Court.",21,526,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00526
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As regards the regulation of LDPs, non-lawyers partners, directors, owners, they will be, as I have explained in answer to Mr Kumar's question, subject to the same obligations and duties as their lawyer counterparts. Issues of conflict of laws, issues of costs, and so on, will have to be dealt with as law practices are dealt with now. Clients, first of all, have a choice of finding out what the likely costs are going to be. Second, they can always file a complaint and, third, ultimate supervision by the Courts if it amounts to misconduct.",22,527,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00527
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Who will be prevented? I think we have defined the broad criteria. In terms of the specific criteria, we will go into a little bit more details in subsidiary legislation because of the requirement for flexibility, but it is more looking at the individual rather than saying who will not be.",23,528,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00528
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As regards to the question of whether the Law Society was consulted, I am a little curious because the Report was out in January; we consulted members of the Bar; we consulted the Law Society; it was engaged before and after the public consultation; and we continued to work with it on implementation and aspects of their feedback was incorporated. The PCC, we want to make sure there is a broad representation and representation from the profession.",24,529,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00529

2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"Thank you, Madam. Just three clarification points. I hear what the Minister says in relation to the framework of rules which will apply to both local lawyers and foreign lawyers. But could I get some clarity on that? I have raised a specific example. In the case of a matter before the SICC or where firms are bidding to represent the client in the SICC, will a foreign firm and a local firm be subject to the same professional rules, because they both can appear before the tribunal in the SICC? That is my first clarification.",1,532,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00532
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"The second is a comment in relation to a non-lawyer, non-legal practitioner. I hear what the Minister says that the non-legal practitioners who hold an equity stake or some other position in law practices will be subject to the same professional rules, but the penalties are quite different. Where a lawyer is found to have breached professional standards, the ultimate price he pays is really to lose his licence and be debarred from practice. That will be quite irrelevant to a non-legal practitioner, and so the consequences are not as grave for him. Is it envisaged that different types of penalties will apply to non-lawyers who breach professional rules?",2,533,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00533
2014-11-04-T-018,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,And the final clarification is really my request for the Minister to give again a short overview of how he sees the legal landscape developing in the future.,3,534,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00534
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the first question  will foreign and local firms be subject to the same rules if they are bidding for work in the SICC? Of course, this is subject to the point that just because it is in SICC does not mean that a foreign firm can appear. There are those requirements of no substantial connection and/or representation on a specific aspect of foreign law. Those are not cast in stone. The rules will have to be structured but those are broadly the principles for foreign counsel.",1,535,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00535
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The intention is to unify the rules for foreign and local lawyers, to make them subject to certain minimum standards and then impose on Singapore lawyers additional rules insofar as they pertain to Singapore law practices. For example, appearance before the High Court, not before the SICC. There will be specific rules which may not apply to, say, a foreign lawyer who does not appear in Courts. If he is practising German law as a solicitor, there will be some rules which do not apply to him which will apply to Mr Hri Kumar who appears before the Courts.",2,536,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00536
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Logically, if there are lawyers who are practising and who appear before the Supreme Court, the intention as described in the report, foreign lawyers, even if it is on a matter of foreign law, the intention is that certain basic standards should apply. And to some extent we may have to look to their own jurisdictions on what would be required when they appear in court. But when they appear in the Singapore Court, we should impose on them fairly similar standards and rules.",3,537,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00537
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I am putting a slight caveat because if they are appearing purely on a matter of, say, German law and such terms are governed by German law and it has got nothing to do with Singapore, and there are certain things that are permitted under German law which are not permitted under Singapore law, I think that has to be taken into account. That is why I hesitate to say it will be exactly the same, but I understand the point Mr Kumar makes and I think the intention is to not disadvantage anyone. That is the answer to the first point.",4,538,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00538
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the second point, non-legal practitioners are subject to the same rules, but, of course, to disbar a person who does not have a right to practise in the first place may not appear to be much of a sanction. Those are the very reasons why because it is a little too premature to try and put it in the Act. Every possible person who may potentially become a member and then what are all the different types of sanctions? We need to find our way in this a little bit. That is why the Act is worded a little bit broadly and then we hope to put into the rules some further criteria.",5,539,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00539
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"My thinking is that we will have to refine it as we go along and we need to be cautious upfront. We need to take into account that the sanctions that are imposed on the non-lawyers must be effective. So, I accept that point and that is something that will be given as guidance, and the relevant rules committee would be very much aware of that point. There is no point saying that we have a sanction which has got no bite.",6,540,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00540
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The third point is a much more difficult one  an overview of how the profession is developing. This is something that we are giving a lot of thought to. In fact, all these changes are meant to try and anticipate what is going to happen. Fundamentally, what is our intention? It is to create the circumstances which will make sure that there is a lot of work for the legal profession. It may not be created out of our own economy, in which case we create a new sector. That is what we did with arbitration and that is what we are hoping to do with the SICC.",7,541,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00541
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"By positioning Singapore as a legal hub, if we succeed in that, a lot of work will be attracted here. We intend to keep to the current framework where Singapore lawyers have rights of audience for Singapore cases and the foreign lawyers can come and practise foreign law. QFLPs have fairly limited rights in specific areas. That is the broad scope that we can see.",8,542,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00542
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"At the same time, because of our financial services industry, and the economy is so integrated with the rest of the world, what happens with the legal practices elsewhere, and where they are moving towards multi-disciplinary practices with ABSes and so on. We have looked at it a number of times, we have been cautious, we did not want to move in that direction after consulting the industry. But you cannot say that you will forever preclude it. I cannot say I rule it in, but neither can I say I rule it out.",9,543,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00543
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, LDPs is a small step. I think bigger law firms will not have a problem, but small law firms – two-man law firms, three-man law firms, one-man law firms – they often need capital. If their capital is going to come from someone who is not a lawyer, then we should allow it as a way of encouraging them to upgrade, to do better.",10,544,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00544
2014-11-04-T-018,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,This seeks to help the smaller and medium-size law firms. The Drew & Napiers of this world do not need LDPs. ABSs offer a very different challenge from the ethical and business perspectives. It is working in other countries; we are studying it carefully. We are also looking at the major economic challenges that are on the horizon and how we can position our legal sector. I think that is the best I can do at this point in time. We see a bright future for the legal profession if we get these rules through and if ASEAN integration comes through.,11,545,2014-11-04-T-018-S-00545

2014-11-04-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The Minister mentioned that the Law Society basically retains much of its role.

It specifies the terms under which such a gratuity plan may be paid to judicial appointment holders. It also confers on the President the power to make regulations to prescribe a gratuity plan for judicial appointment holders.

2014-11-04-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, I just have one key clarification on the Bill. Under the newly enacted clause 4(5), it states that no Judge has an absolute right to any gratuity upon retirement. This ostensibly would mean that the Government can determine which judge should or should not receive a gratuity. I understand section 8 of the Pensions Act also extends similar powers to the Government.",1,562,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00562
2014-11-04-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, section 8 of the Pensions Act also states in the event an officer is guilty of negligence, irregularity or misconduct, it shall be lawful for the Pension Authority to withhold the pension, gratuity or other allowance for which the officer would have become eligible. The drafting of section 8 suggests that it is under these latter conditions that a pension could be discontinued. The newly enacted clause 4 of the Bill does not provide such clarity.",2,563,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00563
2014-11-04-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Under the new regime, it would be foreseeable that a one-time gratuity would be paid upon retirement. This is unlike the Pension Act where payments can be expected to continue and the scenario of an infraction post-retirement may well result in the stoppage of a pension. Such a prospect cannot be reasonably expected to be invoked after the full gratuity is paid up under the proposed Bill.",3,564,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00564
2014-11-04-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Can the Minister explain under what circumstances would a judge not expect to receive a gratuity at the end of retirement under this Bill, especially if he or she qualifies for one and has not been found guilty by a tribunal of his or her peers of misbehaviour, or being unable to discharge the duties of judicial office? Thank you.",4,565,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00565
2014-11-04-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill seeks to amend the Judges' Remuneration Act to provide for the payment of a gratuity to any individual who holds judicial office and who either retires from office at 65 years old or dies while holding judicial office.",1,566,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00566
2014-11-04-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),The gratuity is a new scheme meant for those appointed to any judicial office on or after the date of commencement of the Judges' Remuneration (Amendment) Bill as they would no longer be eligible for pension.,2,567,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00567
2014-11-04-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"As a basic principle, I am of the view that individuals who hold judicial office as Chief Justice, Judge of Appeal or Judge of the High Court ought to be paid salaries befitting their responsibilities, powers and the dignity of the office. It is always important that the judiciary is able to attract suitable talent to ensure that the quality of justice dispensed by our judicial officers is of the very best and that our judiciary remains uncorrupt.",3,568,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00568
2014-11-04-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In 2006, the then-US Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr raised concerns that federal judges are leaving the Bench due to inadequate compensation. Other judges had also raised concerns that the Bench would not be able to attract the best lawyers in practice if their compensation falls too far below what other careers, like a law professor, would be able to offer. One highly respected judge of the US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal, Mr J Michael Luttig, reportedly resigned to join Boeing Company as its General Counsel and he cited the need for his obligation to his family, one of whom was approaching college age.",4,569,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00569
2014-11-04-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Hence, if our judiciary wishes to attract some of our top legal brains to join the Bench, we cannot expect them to make too great a sacrifice of their legal careers. Whilst the overall compensation package may never and should not be commensurate with what a top lawyer in private practice may earn, there should not be too large a gap either.",5,570,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00570
2014-11-04-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The current Bill does not specify what the gratuity amount would be. It merely refers to a ""gratuity determined in accordance with a rate prescribed in regulations subject to such limit as may be prescribed in those regulations"". I surmised from a reply to a Parliamentary Question by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean in April 2013 that the Gratuity and a Long-term Retention package would be similar in value to the amount of pension forgone by newly-appointed judicial officers.",6,571,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00571
2014-11-04-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I had said earlier in my speech that as a basic principle, we ought to pay judicial officers salaries which are befitting their responsibilities, powers and dignity of the office. However, I do wish to caution the Government that paying a high compensation package is not the only way to attract or retain legal talent. If a judicial officer is too highly compensated, it leads to cynicism and sometimes an erosion of respect for that office. Public opinion may be adverse if they perceive judicial officers as being out of touch if they are paid too high, compared to wages of the average man in the street. This may, in turn, cause talented legal brains to shun the call to join the judiciary as they may not wish to face the adverse public opinion.",7,572,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00572
2014-11-04-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Hence, I urge the Government to consider a mix of incentives to attract good talent into the judiciary. Besides a fair monetary compensation, we should consider appealing to the person's sense of national service and sacrifice; appealing to the prestige and respect that come with such an appointment to judicial office.",8,573,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00573
2014-11-04-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, I believe that talented Singaporeans would willingly answer the call of duty if they feel that there is a need for their skills and talents to serve the people of Singapore. A huge gratuity package, in itself, may not, and, in my humble view, should not be the only solution to keeping or attracting talent.

2014-11-04-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on Mr Singh's question on pension versus gratuity, pensions are payable continuously for a period of time until the person passes away, and the person would be entitled to medical benefits. With a gratuity scheme, he gets a lump-sum at the end of service and that is that. Yes, if there is misconduct after he receives the money, then, of course, you cannot claw back, because I thought that was the question that was being asked. His misconduct after he receives it – say, at age 75, 80 or whatever – is not going to be relevant for what he received at 65, for example, and he will not get any medical benefits.",1,577,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00577
2014-11-04-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In terms of whether he is entitled to the gratuity when he retires, if he retires honourably, then there is no issue.

But to be more precise, regulations would have to be made by the President on these issues, at least in broad terms.",2,578,2014-11-04-T-019-S-00578
2014-11-04-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As regards Mr Lim's question, yes, I agree. The compensation cannot be the only issue. The Deputy Prime Minister explained the points; the committee considered it. The people who come in, by and large, take a pay cut. They have been delinked from political office holders, and the current judicial officers, such as Judges, High Court Judges, their compensation broadly, according to the committee's view, taking into account the entire remuneration, including pension – was acceptable.

2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),Animal welfare is undeniably an emerging interest in our society today and it is also often a sensitive and emotive topic.,2,599,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00599
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"In setting up the Animal Welfare Legislation Review Committee (AWLRC), we recognised the importance to take into consideration the views of the Singapore society on cruelty and the expectations for animal welfare. The 11-member AWLRC includes representation from different stakeholder groups – our members come from the animal welfare groups, the vet profession, the pet industry, as well as the community and grassroots leaders. During the AWLRC's consultation process, we also held consultation sessions with all these different stakeholder groups, as well as public e-consultation to seek views.",3,600,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00600
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, the multi-stakeholder representation of the AWLRC reflects our belief that animal welfare should be seen as a shared responsibility amongst all stakeholders, and that we need to go beyond relying on imposing stricter laws and regulations to improve animal welfare standards. Thus, the scope of the AWLRC was not only to recommend ways to strengthen the legislation, but also to enhance stakeholders' collaboration on animal welfare. The 24 recommendations put forth by the Committee in March 2013 included legislative recommendations, and other recommendations that seek to strengthen and improve animal welfare through collaborative efforts by all stakeholders.",4,601,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00601
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"We sought to strike a balance between recommending stricter laws and regulations where warranted and also taking a more graded approach to encourage stakeholder-led initiatives to improve animal welfare standards where appropriate. In this way, the AWLRC tried to avoid over-regulation, but rather to promote co-ownership of solutions and hence a sense of shared responsibility in upholding the animal welfare.",5,602,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00602

2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, there were suggestions from the AWLRC consultations for a separate Animal Welfare Bill, but we considered that the scope of the current Animals and Birds Act (ABA) is broad enough to actually allow more sections and provisions on safeguarding animal welfare and prevention of animal cruelty provisions to be parked there. As such, we did not think there was a need to enact a standalone Act for animal welfare. The current provisions for prevention of cruelty to animals are found in Part IV of the Act and were last revised 12 years ago.",7,604,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00604
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Today, we see the need for strengthening the legislation once again, as our society becomes increasingly aware and concerned about animal welfare issues. The number of animal welfare cases is rising, with a total of over 1,000 cases of animal welfare and cruelty feedback received by Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) and Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) annually. I would caution that, however, we should not extrapolate this to mean that our society as a whole is becoming less compassionate towards animals, as there could be many reasons for this increase, including increasing interest in animal welfare and a greater willingness to report incidents. However, it does cause us to think about how our society treats animals and the changes that we should aim towards in order to become a more gracious and compassionate society. Cases are also growing in complexity, and shifting away from the black and white of clear-cut acts of cruelty to increasingly grey areas of neglect or infringements of animal welfare. Challenges in enforcement also have emerged, as it is currently difficult to actually take action – be it punishment or prevention – without strong evidence of cruelty and witnesses who are willing to come forward to testify in Court. To strengthen the legislation in line with a socially gracious and harmonious society, we need to move the regulatory controls upstream.",8,605,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00605
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, the existing Animals and Birds Act focuses on preventing cruelty to animals. However, punishment is usually meted out only after cruelty has been done and there is little the authorities can do beyond advising better care or warning potential offenders – before such acts are committed. Much emphasis is also placed on the Government to be the sole protector of animal welfare, when it really should be a shared social responsibility. The key guiding principles in our legislative review were therefore to make the legislation more responsive and preventive, in addressing the welfare of the animals in the way that they are cared for, as well as to instil responsible and appropriate behaviour in all stakeholders who play a part in an animal's life cycle.",9,606,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00606

However, we should be cautious not to veer to the extreme that even actions generally deemed to be socially normal or acceptable, such as a child chasing after an animal in the intent of play, or the meeting of greater public objectives, such as mosquito and rodent control using proper pest control methods for public health reasons, can be also perceived out of context as an animal welfare concern.",11,608,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00608
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"While the AWLRC concurs that acts causing unnecessary pain and suffering to any animal should be appropriately addressed under the legislation, it notes that the majority of animal cruelty and welfare complaints currently pertain to pet animals, as reflected in the current statistics of animal welfare feedback and the findings from the consultation exercise. The AWLRC also notes that there are existing regulations and guidelines for specific animal groups, for example, animals used for scientific purposes.

2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),A new section 41C is proposed to place legal responsibility on owners and persons in charge of animals to provide proper care for them so that the welfare of animals is attended to in a way that they are cared for and not just limited to punishing acts of cruelty after such acts had taken place. Existing clauses in the current section 42 associated with providing care are shifted to the new section 41C.,19,616,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00616
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, the Codes of Animal Welfare have been formulated by the Multi-stakeholder Collaboration Committee (MSCC), which includes most of the AWLRC members, and chaired by Member Alex Yam. The Codes stipulate what constitutes proper care. There are specific codes for pet owners and pet businesses. The Codes have undergone stakeholder and public consultations before being finalised, and had been presented by the MSCC to AVA in July 2014. Upon acceptance and issuance of the Codes by AVA, should the Bill be passed by Parliament and gazetted into law, these Codes can be used for enforcement by AVA against failure to provide duty of care. While the Codes are not legislated, failure to meet the Codes can be used as evidence to support prosecution. However, AVA will not prosecute a person purely because of a breach of the Codes. The new sections 41A and 41B set out the legal provisions for the issuance, adoption and amendment of the Codes, as well as the use of the Codes in proceedings.",20,617,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00617
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, the proposed definition of ""person in charge"" will include a person who has the animal in the person's possession, custody or control, or under that person's care or supervision, whether permanently or on a temporary basis and the definition of owner would include persons in charge. This includes pet owners as well as those working with animals and handling animals in the course of their work, for instance, pet industry workers. The duty of care would also extend to include those who do not own the animals but care for them in a shelter or in their homes, including fosterers, hoarders and those looking after the pets of the family members or friends.",21,618,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00618
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Under the existing Act, it is an offence for an owner to abandon any animal in circumstances that is likely to cause suffering or distress to it. The clause on abandonment being an offence has been shifted to the new section 41C under duty of care for better alignment, as it should be a duty of care of an owner to look after the animal properly and not abandon it. This is also in line with our intent of addressing the issues upstream, by encouraging responsible pet ownership. The clause has also been amended to make the act of abandonment an offence without having to consider whether the animal is suffering or in distress.",22,619,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00619
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"The AWLRC found from the consultation sessions that a common comment made was that potential and existing operators of all pet-related businesses should be required to undergo some form of training and not just only the pet shops. Requiring animal related businesses to train their staff will foster greater responsibility within the pet industry to ensure better animal welfare. Furthermore, it is equitable to expect handlers of animals in the industry to have a certain level of training on animal care and handling.",23,620,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00620
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Currently, operators and staff of pet shops and pet farms that have been employed for six months or more are already required through licensing conditions to attend training on animal care and handling. However, we have also heard of acts of negligence or unfortunate accidents happening in other sectors of the pet industry. There was also a news report last year of a dog that died as a result of a groomer's handling fault. It is therefore timely and necessary for such a requirement to be extended to other areas of the industry.",24,621,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00621
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Under the new section 43, the Bill proposes that those engaging in animal-related businesses – as prescribed under the relevant subsidiary legislation – must employ individuals who are qualified and trained to be in charge of its animals, in such manner as the Director-General may specify. The Bill proposes penalties of $5,000 and up to six months' jail term for failure to comply with this requirement. Section 80(2)(q) is proposed to be inserted to provide power for the Minister to make rules on such training requirements for animal-related businesses. However, to ease the new areas of the industry into the training requirement, downstream implementation will follow later. We have received a lot of feedback from the SMEs and definitely will ensure that the implementation will be phased, to give the businesses more time to adapt and fulfil the training requirement.",25,622,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00622
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"On penalty structure, Madam, there was strong consensus from the AWLRC's stakeholder consultation sessions to increase the maximum penalty. Over 80% of e-consultation respondents also supported increasing the maximum penalty, with the majority calling for the maximum fine to be increased to $20,000-$50,000 and maximum jail term to be increased to two-three years. The Committee also noted that penalties in animal welfare legislation of other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US, Europe and Hong Kong, are higher than those in Singapore, with fines ranging from $1,000 to as high as $500,000, depending on the nature of the offence and the type of offender, and imprisonment ranging from days up to five years.",26,623,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00623
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"However, in determining the revisions to the maximum penalty, my fellow Members of Parliament and I held the view that the magnitude of penalty should provide sufficient deterrent as well as punish those who are convicted of committing acts of animal cruelty, but should not be overboard that it would cause unnecessary or unintended consequences, such as causing people to abandon their pet out of fear of non-compliance. We also felt that it is important to maintain proportionality of the proposed penalties for animal welfare and cruelty offences to other existing legislation for human abuse offences in Singapore.",27,624,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00624
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Taking all these into consideration, the maximum penalties of $20,000 for non-cruelty offences and $30,000 for cruelty offences, with a possible jail term of up to two or three years is proposed in this Bill. The maximum fine of $50,000 proposed by the AWLRC for individual offenders has been reduced to maintain proportionality to other existing legislation for human offences.",28,625,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00625
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"We also saw the need to propose higher penalties for repeat and recalcitrant offenders. The proposed penalty structure has two-tiers, with one tier for the first convictions, and another tier for the second and subsequent offences. First-time offenders who may be ignorant of how to care for animals may also be ordered by the Court to perform community work order with animal welfare groups to increase their awareness and ability to care for animals. This is provided for under the Criminal Procedure Code, as an additional sentencing option in lieu of fine and imprisonment.",29,626,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00626
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"The Bill also proposes to establish separate and higher penalties for animal-related businesses. This is in recognition that businesses are much more financially capable of paying the fine and a higher fine quantum would be a greater deterrent. My fellow Members of Parliament and I also rationalised that the penalties for offences committed by animal-related business should be higher, not only to target the profit motives of animal-related businesses, but also to underscore the greater responsibility that they should bear, seeing as they should have a greater obligation to care or provide for the welfare of animals and cannot claim ignorance of what constitutes proper care for animals. Moreover, under the law they will be required to undergo proper training to handle and care for animals. We also felt that the jail terms should apply to convicted individuals engaged in animal-related businesses, similar to other individual offenders. In this regard, the Bill proposes the maximum fine for businesses to be $100,000 for all offences and, in addition, a possible jail term of up to two or three years, depending on first or subsequent conviction.",30,627,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00627
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"My fellow Members of Parliament and I felt that it is necessary to scope the animal-related businesses by especially including a definition under the expanded section 41, to include  first, places or establishments which operate for reward such as pet shops, pet cafes, commercial breeders, boarding premises, vet centres, horse riding clubs and zoos; second, providers of services for reward such as pet groomers, pet boarders, animal trainers, dog walkers, pet transporters, vets, businesses providing special treatments to animals and animal control companies; and, third, animal welfare groups, for example, animal rescue, or welfare organisations, or facilities.",31,628,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00628
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Animal welfare groups were not included in the AWLRC's original recommendation for higher penalties, which was targeted at pet-related businesses. However, in the course of our discussion, it became clear that animal welfare groups should not be exempted as the law should be fair and consistent to all. Neither is it our intent to cause animal welfare groups to be over-penalised, but rather to ensure that these groups have the proper processes and systems in place similar to any other businesses which handle animals.",32,629,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00629
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"The Bill also proposes to empower the Court to disallow offenders, where warranted, from owning or being in charge of any animal while working or being employed in any animal-related business, or from engaging in or carrying on an animal-related business, for a set period of up to one year. While it may not be easy to enforce such disqualification orders, such a penalty need only be meted out in specific cases in line with the intent and severity of the abuse, and would be able to serve as a social deterrent to offenders. We also decided against having lifetime disqualification orders, as we believe that people should be given a second chance.",33,630,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00630
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),The revised penalties are proposed to apply to sections 41C and 42 on duty of care and acts of cruelty to animals. Disqualification orders and related penalties for non-compliance with other orders are set out in section 43B.,34,631,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00631
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, beyond the AWLRC's recommendations, my fellow Members of Parliament and I also noted that AVA has experienced gaps in its enforcement powers in the investigation of cruelty cases. Welfare compromises and failure to provide duty of care may be even less straightforward to investigate. Therefore, we felt that it would be useful for the Bill to also enhance the enforcement powers.",35,632,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00632
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"The new section 43A is to provide powers for the Government to issue directives to require the person to improve the care of an animal. The Committee recommends that failure to comply with a directive be a punishable offence, liable to a maximum penalty of $20,000 and up to one year jail term for animal-related businesses, and $10,000 and up to one year jail term for other offenders.",36,633,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00633
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, some of the challenges that enforcement officers face in investigating animal welfare complaints include lack of evidence, tampering of evidence by the public, no witnesses, witnesses not willing to testify, and lack of cooperation from witnesses and suspect. There have been cases where a lack of cooperation by suspected offenders have resulted in cases being dragged on for months or cases closed due to insufficient evidence. For example, there was a case in 2011 where officers investigated an animal welfare complaint concerning a dog being left on the balcony and exposed to the elements for long hours. The investigation was protracted and prolonged as the owner did not cooperate to come and give his statement in person.",37,634,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00634
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Enhanced powers have been proposed to give enforcement officers greater powers in conducting investigation and gathering evidence as well as remove longstanding obstacles to enforcement. For example, the existing provision only allows an arrest to be made if the animal cruelty offence is committed in the presence of the enforcement officer, which is unlikely to happen in reality. As it would be useful for these enhanced powers to also apply to the entire Act for more effective enforcement by AVA, the scope of the enhanced enforcement powers have been expanded to be applied to the whole Act and not just animal welfare/cruelty offences and consolidated in Part VI.",38,635,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00635
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, as we enhance the powers of enforcement officers, we also propose necessary safeguards to be put in place. These safeguards, such as on how offenders may be apprehended and how long they can be detained in custody, are similar to those in other existing legislation in Singapore.",39,636,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00636
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to highlight that, even with greater enforcement powers provided and proposed by this Bill, AVA may not be able to bring an offender to justice unless they have strong leads to investigate and sufficient evidence to take action. Public involvement to report cases and step forward as witnesses is needed. For example, Members may recall a case at end 2012 where a dismembered kitten was found at a HDB block in Yishun town. Police and AVA investigated the case but could not solve it because there were neither eyewitnesses nor any other credible leads. I thus urge again the public to come forward to report cases of animal welfare and abuse to AVA, and to testify as witnesses in court, if necessary.",40,637,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00637
2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Sir, in line with the Committee's aim to make the legislation more responsive and preventive, and underline the emphasis of ensuring animal welfare beyond preventing cruelty to animals, we propose to include ""Animal Welfare"" in the title of Part IV, to become ""Animal Welfare and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals"".",41,638,2014-11-04-T-021-S-00638

2014-11-04-T-021,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"As I stressed at the start of my speech, safeguarding the welfare of animals must be seen as a shared responsibility by all stakeholders, including the pet industry, owners, vet profession and the community.

2014-11-04-T-024,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Singapore's corporate landscape is a diversified one, where MNCs and government-linked companies co-exist with local enterprises. Among local enterprises, 99% are SMEs. This diversified corporate structure needs to be a symbiotic one to successfully spur Singapore's economic development. In 1980, Singapore's GDP per capita was US$5,004, and in 2013 our GDP per capita has soared to US$55,183. The growth is ten-fold. It can be said that MNCs, industry leaders and government-linked companies are the locomotive for the Singapore economy, while local enterprises follow closely behind to form the train for economic development. Under the leadership of the Government, all have surged forward to create an admirable economic miracle.",2,654,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00654
2014-11-04-T-024,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"However, in recent years, as Singapore has moved into the restructuring of its economy, the business community has become split and the gaps between large enterprises and SMEs are widening. In May this year, Swiss business school IMD released its World Competitiveness Yearbook Ranking for 2014, and Singapore's overall competitiveness ranking improved from Fifth to Third. This good news was very well covered by the media. However, when I spoke to the business community about this ranking, they seemed confused. Why is there such a disparity between the sentiments of the SMEs and the Yearbook rankings?",3,655,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00655
2014-11-04-T-024,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Hence, I studied the findings of the Yearbook, and discovered that in terms of productivity and efficiency, the world ranking of Singapore's large enterprises was number 17 in 2011, whilst they moved up to number 14 in 2014, up three notches. The SMEs' performance was, on the contrary, the reverse, having fallen in ranking from number 24 in 2011 to number 29 in 2014. In other words, after we embarked on economic restructuring, the productivity and efficiency of Singapore's large enterprises have improved, while those of SMEs have suffered a decline. What causes greatest concern is that Singapore's SMEs' ranking falls far behind that of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia, and SMEs from China are ahead of us by four notches. Our ranking is 29; another country is also ranked 29 and that is Lithuania. At the same time, the adaptability of Singapore companies has plummeted from number 15 in 2011 to number 23 in 2014. These figures are rather sobering and deserve to be carefully examined.",4,656,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00656
2014-11-04-T-024,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Large enterprises are surging forward, while SMEs are faltering. The decline in companies' adaptability is not good for the healthy development of our country. This phenomenon can be attributed to the internal factors of the enterprise, as well as factors relating to the sudden changes in the external business environment. In 2010, the Government started to tighten its foreign manpower policy, encouraging local enterprises to raise their productivity and reduce their reliance on foreign workers. This is the right direction to take. However, in the process of implementation, we have seen the untimely departure of some well-trained and skilled workers. Enterprises find it difficult to immediately recruit qualified workers, resulting in a decline in productivity as well as disruption to companies' existing business plans.",5,657,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00657
2014-11-04-T-024,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"At this juncture of economic restructuring, large enterprises and industry leaders have the ability to make necessary adjustments, and some promising SMEs are also gradually adapting to this new reality. However, majority of smaller enterprises are vulnerable to the challenges of the manpower policy and are particularly prone to changes in business costs. They are having a rather tough time.",6,658,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00658
2014-11-04-T-024,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Last month, the International Monetary Fund's report also indicated that the tightening of Singapore's foreign manpower policy has weakened Singapore's competitiveness and growth potential, but also noted that the measures to improve productivity could eventually help Singapore to achieve sustainable economic growth. Combining the analysis and findings of both IMD and IMF, it is evident that Singapore enterprises are already feeling the pain of economic restructuring. At this crucial time, everyone needs to grit their teeth and work even harder to overcome this most difficult period, before we can usher in a new phase of stable growth.",7,659,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00659
2014-11-04-T-024,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Hence, I would like to recommend that, in next year's Budget – pity the Finance Minister is not here – the Government should retain the productivity assistance schemes, giving a strong boost to enterprises and enabling them to overcome this period of economic restructuring. Effective measures that had been put in place in the last few years must continue, and the qualifying criteria should not be raised because of the abuse from one or two exceptional cases. Currently, many enterprises have already decided to adopt measures to raise their productivity; we have to give them time and space to do so.",8,660,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00660
2014-11-04-T-024,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Naturally, there are still some enterprises which are unable to adapt quickly to the restructuring of the economy, and we have to think of ways to help them. Even if they need to restructure, they need to do it within their capabilities. If they can only turn 180 degrees, let them do so; do not force them to turn 360 degrees. At the opening ceremony of the ""National Productivity Month"", Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong likened the productivity drive to ""a marathon without a finish line"". I totally agree with this viewpoint. The most important part about running a marathon is in the mentality, and the enterprise has to have sufficient endurance, determination and be well prepared, broaden its visions, find an appropriate strategy, be adaptable, and press on steadily! Any ideas done too hastily or with a sprint mentality would not succeed.",9,661,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00661

2014-11-04-T-024,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"There is always a physical threshold in running a marathon; moreover, every person's physical threshold is different. As long as this physical threshold is surpassed, it means entering a whole new realm. In Budget 2015, we hope the Government would draw up its policies taking into consideration the physical thresholds of various types and sizes of enterprises and continue to give impetus to businesses. To achieve this, there should be a dedicated agency with a very thorough understanding of local enterprises, particularly the SMEs, to take charge of coordinating resources and solving problems. I realise this request had already been raised twice by former Nominated Member of Parliament Mr Teo Siong Seng, but nothing has materialised thus far. Since the Municipal Services Office (MSO) has just been set up directly under the supervision of Minister Grace Fu, to coordinate the work of many Government agencies, this has given me confidence to revisit and surface this request once again.",11,663,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00663

We have to realise that even if the Government provides assistance, ultimately, it is the enterprise that has to run the marathon. The enterprise can only achieve a breakthrough and enjoy robust growth if it fully recognises its unique characteristics and leverages on its strengths. When we talk about building world-class Singapore enterprises, it is not only according to size or business performance. Rather, there has to be a unique business model which enables Singapore enterprises to gain more recognition, gain acceptance in more markets and become internationally renowned.",12,664,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00664

She is a Secondary 1 student in Raffles Girls' Secondary School. Based on Team Singapore's special selection system, Jodie was chosen to represent our country to participate in an international sports competition.

If this wish could be realised, then we would advance one huge step further in our ambition to become world-class Singapore SMEs. Next year, Singapore celebrates the 50th year of Independence, and I sincerely hope that even as we celebrate our golden jubilee and be encouraged by all our past achievements, we have to work hard at planning an even more beautiful development blueprint and action plan, so that future generations of Singapore would look back with pride on all we are working hard to put in place today.",14,666,2014-11-04-T-024-S-00666

Seven of these Centres are located at CDCs or CCs, to make it convenient for SMEs to seek help. The Government has also set up the SME Workgroup led by Minister of State Teo Ser Luck, bringing together grassroots advisors, Government agencies and businesses on a single platform, to improve outreach to SMEs.

2014-11-04-T-025,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Next year, HDB intends to launch four Build-To-Order (BTO) exercises, for a total of 16,900 new flats. That will include about 4,000 2-room flats to cater to demand from singles and low-income families. In addition, HDB will conduct Sale of Balance Flat (SBF) exercises to augment the BTO supply.

2014-11-04-T-025,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As the number of new Singaporean family formations is estimated at about 15,000 each year, we are confident that the proposed supply should be adequate.

2014-11-04-T-026,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Supplementary Retirement Scheme, or SRS in short, is a voluntary retirement savings scheme that complements the CPF.

2014-11-04-T-026,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As a retirement savings scheme, withdrawals prior to retirement are not encouraged. However, to provide flexibility to SRS participants, premature withdrawals are allowed but fully subject to tax. Even so, a person would still benefit from tax savings if his marginal tax rate is lower at the time he withdraws the savings, compared to when he earned the money and put it in his SRS account. Hence, a 5% penalty is imposed as a deterrent against using the SRS as a tool to lower one’s income tax, as distinct from building up retirement savings.",2,702,2014-11-04-T-026-S-00702
2014-11-04-T-026,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"However, we recognise there could be circumstances where participants may need to exit the scheme prematurely.

2014-11-04-T-027,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in light of IMF's remarks that cutting reliance on foreign workers can reduce Singapore's competitiveness and growth potential while keeping core inflation elevated (a) how is the Government addressing our business competitiveness to maintain our economic momentum; and (b) which sectors of the economy have shown signs of a slowdown during the last two quarters.,1,704,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00704
2014-11-04-T-027,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"The Government's policy of tightening access to foreign manpower is an integral part of our strategy to restructure the economy towards productivity-driven growth. Given Singapore's land constraints, it is not sustainable for us to grow our economy through a continuous increase in foreign manpower. Easy access to low-skilled foreign manpower also blunts the incentive for firms to invest in automation and improve their processes. By tightening firms' access to foreign manpower, our objective is to achieve a more efficient use of labour and raise productivity. Higher productivity will in turn enhance the competitiveness of our economy and translate into higher real wages for Singaporeans over the longer term.",1,705,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00705
2014-11-04-T-027,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"However, the Government also recognises that firms need time to adjust to tighter labour market conditions. As such, the Government has taken care to tighten foreign manpower policies progressively and gradually. For instance, reductions in the Dependency Ratio Ceilings (DRCs) were announced two years before they take effect fully. This calibrated approach has led to a gradual moderation in foreign workforce growth. In particular, foreign workforce growth slowed from 7.6% in 2011 to 5.9% in 2012 and further to 4.2% in 2013.",2,706,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00706
2014-11-04-T-027,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"At the same time, to help firms raise productivity and enhance their competitiveness, the Government has put in place many assistance schemes.

Significant investments have also been made in Continuing Education and Training programmes to upgrade the skills of our workers.",3,707,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00707
2014-11-04-T-027,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Apart from sharing the cost of productivity improvements, the Government has also introduced schemes to help businesses, especially SMEs, compete internationally. For instance, the Partnerships for Capability Transformation (PACT) initiative facilitates collaborations between SMEs and large organisations to enable knowledge transfers and capability development among the SMEs. In addition, the Global Company Partnership (GCP) programme, administered by IE Singapore, helps local companies tap overseas opportunities by helping to defray part of the cost of financial and market access studies as well as manpower development.",4,708,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00708
2014-11-04-T-027,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"The take-up rates for these various schemes have increased over the last few years. This is an encouraging sign that more of our SMEs are making a concerted effort to raise productivity to remain competitive. We urge more companies to step forward to tap on these schemes. The Government has also put in place support measures such as the Wage Credit Scheme and corporate tax rebate to help companies cope with higher manpower costs during the transitional period. This will in turn help to mitigate the pass-through of manpower costs to inflation. Notably, core inflation was 1.7% in 2013, lower than the median monthly nominal income growth of 6.5% over the same period.",5,709,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00709
2014-11-04-T-027,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Er Dr Lee also asked which sectors of the economy have shown signs of growth slowdown in the last two quarters. Based on advance estimates, GDP grew by 2.4% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2014. This was the same pace of growth as that achieved in the second quarter, although slower than the 4.8% growth in the first quarter. The moderation in growth in the last two quarters was due mainly to the slowdown in the manufacturing and construction sectors, as well as selected services sectors.",6,710,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00710
2014-11-04-T-027,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"In particular, the manufacturing sector grew at a slower pace of 1.5% and 1.4% year-on-year in the second and third quarters respectively, compared to 9.9% in the first quarter. The weak performance in manufacturing is partly due to lacklustre global economic conditions. Although economic activity in the US has started to improve, this was offset by anaemic growth in Europe. In addition, China's economic growth has continued to moderate amidst ongoing efforts to rebalance the economy.",7,711,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00711

This was due mainly to lower output growth from private sector construction projects, following the cooling measures put in place by the Government to stabilise Singapore’s property market and tighter manpower conditions. Apart from construction, growth in other domestically-oriented, labour-intensive services sectors, such as retail and food and beverage services, has also been weighed down by labour constraints.",8,712,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00712
2014-11-04-T-027,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"In sum, the slowdown in our economy in the last two quarters was due in part to external headwinds, and in part to tighter labour constraints amidst on-going efforts to restructure the economy. However, there are also positive signs that firms in some sectors, especially the export-oriented ones like precision engineering, have adjusted to tighter labour market conditions by moving up the value chain and raising their productivity. MTI and the various agencies are working closely with firms in the domestically-oriented labour-intensive sectors, such as construction and retail, to raise their productivity.",9,713,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00713
2014-11-04-T-027,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,Economic restructuring is a long-term endeavour. It is important that we do not let up on our efforts to steer the economy towards a more sustainable growth path. The Government stands ready to provide further assistance to support our companies as we continue on this journey. We remain confident that we will succeed in our restructuring efforts and that our economy will emerge stronger and more competitive than before.,10,714,2014-11-04-T-027-S-00714

2014-11-04-T-028,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"In 2010, we set a target of 2%-3% annualised productivity growth over the decade starting from 2009. This ambitious target was set because productivity growth had been weak in the decade before 2009, at 1% per year, and we had assessed that there was significant room for improvement. Tracked against this target, we have achieved an annualised productivity growth of 2.9% so far",1,716,2014-11-04-T-028-S-00716
2014-11-04-T-028,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"However, a large part of this was due to the strong recovery in 2010. Annualised productivity growth since then has been weaker, at 0.2%. Nevertheless, we were still able to record good overall economic growth during the 2010 to 2013 period. Annualised GDP growth was 4.1%, which is within the 3%-5% projected for the decade.",2,717,2014-11-04-T-028-S-00717
2014-11-04-T-028,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Some sectors have also done better than others. From 2010 to 2013, productivity grew 2.1% annually in the export-oriented sectors like Wholesale Trade and Financial Services. Such sectors make up just over half of the economy. Being globally competitive, they are able to transform and adjust processes quickly to changing market conditions.",3,718,2014-11-04-T-028-S-00718
2014-11-04-T-028,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"In comparison, domestic sectors like Construction and Retail performed more poorly, with an annualised growth rate of -0.3%. The National Productivity and Continuing Education Council (NPCEC) is focusing its efforts on measures that will significantly uplift productivity in these sectors. For example, we are taking more aggressive upstream measures in the construction sector. These promote greater use of pre-fabrication and other high-impact technologies to enhance productivity. It will take some time for these efforts to be reflected in the productivity numbers.",4,719,2014-11-04-T-028-S-00719

2014-11-04-T-029,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is the anticipated cost of the move of Central Manpower Base (CMPB) to its new premises near the upcoming Cashew MRT station; (b) what factors compel the Ministry to move CMPB to a new location; and (c) whether the Ministry has considered any other cost-effective alternatives before deciding on the construction of a new CMPB.,1,721,2014-11-04-T-029-S-00721
2014-11-04-T-029,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"CMPB began operations in its current location at Depot Road Camp since 1989. Over the years, it was found necessary to include other departments, such as the SAF Career Centre and Defence Psychology Department, to be at CMPB to centralise facilities to better serve pre-enlistees. However, due to space constraints, important departments, such as the SAF Military Medicine Institute, where medical specialists assess pre-enlistees for medical conditions, had to be located elsewhere. The segregation of needed services due to inadequate space at the current CMPB is not ideal for pre-enlistees and NSmen. MINDEF therefore reviewed possible sites for a one-stop centre that meet the needs of pre-enlistees and NSmen.",1,722,2014-11-04-T-029-S-00722

The new CMPB site was also chosen as it will provide greater convenience and accessibility due to its proximity to the upcoming Cashew MRT station. Overall, the new CMPB at Gombak will provide more integrated and efficient services relating to National Service, human resource, finance and medical screening for our pre-enlistees and NSmen.",2,723,2014-11-04-T-029-S-00723

2014-11-04-T-030,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the circumstances under which the Singapore Police Force will revoke existing security officer licences or reject new security officer licence applications; (b) what are the requirements that applicants have to fulfil to be eligible for a reinstatement or reconsideration of a revoked/rejected security officer licence; and (c) whether there is any debarment period in place.,1,725,2014-11-04-T-030-S-00725
2014-11-04-T-030,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,The job of a security officer is to protect lives and properties. All security officers must be licensed and trained before they can be deployed.,1,726,2014-11-04-T-030-S-00726
2014-11-04-T-030,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"In assessing an applicant’s suitability to be licensed, Police take a number of factors into account, including whether the applicant has any criminal record. Successful applicants are required to undergo an approved training programme.",2,727,2014-11-04-T-030-S-00727
2014-11-04-T-030,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"When a security officer breaks the law or breaches licensing conditions, Police will reconsider his suitability to remain in the security industry and may revoke his licence.",3,728,2014-11-04-T-030-S-00728
2014-11-04-T-030,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,Police will consider granting security officer licences to ex-offenders if they have remained crime-free for a period of time. The period of debarment will depend on the nature and severity of the offence committed.,4,729,2014-11-04-T-030-S-00729
2014-11-04-T-031,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many foreign spouses have been granted a Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus (LTVP+) since December 2013; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider granting as a rule LTVP+ to foreign spouses who have been married and lived in Singapore for more than five years.,1,730,2014-11-04-T-031-S-00730
2014-11-04-T-031,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus (LTVP+) was introduced on 1 April 2012. As at 30 September 2014, there were a total of 7,300 foreign spouses on LTVP+. Two thousand foreign spouses were granted LTVP+ between January and September this year.",1,731,2014-11-04-T-031-S-00731
2014-11-04-T-031,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"A foreign spouse who has been married to a Singapore citizen (SC) for at least three years or has at least an SC child from the marriage would be eligible for consideration for LTVP+. In addition, ICA considers other factors such as the ability of the SC spouse to support the family. Every application for LTVP+ is assessed on a range of factors rather than a single factor such as the length of marriage or length of stay in Singapore. Where the foreign spouse does not qualify for LTVP+, ICA will consider the foreign spouse for the grant of LTVP.",2,732,2014-11-04-T-031-S-00732
2014-11-04-T-032,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the rationale for commencing Home Protection Scheme (HPS) coverage after the collection of keys to a HDB flat instead of when the lease agreement is signed; and (b) what is the rationale for not making HPS transferable to the next flat that is purchased.,1,733,2014-11-04-T-032-S-00733
2014-11-04-T-032,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,The Home Protection Scheme (HPS) is a mortgage reducing insurance administered by the CPF Board to help insured members and their families settle their outstanding housing loans for HDB flats in the event of death or permanent incapacity of the member.,1,734,2014-11-04-T-032-S-00734
2014-11-04-T-032,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The HPS cover commences once the housing loan has been disbursed. This is about the same time when the HDB flat buyer collects the keys to his HDB flat and is due to make the balance payment for his flat purchase. At this point, the housing loan quantum, loan repayment period and share of repayment among the co-owners would have been finalised. The flat buyer would be better able to determine the appropriate level of protection in terms of the amount insured and coverage period under HPS and avoid paying excessive HPS premiums.",2,735,2014-11-04-T-032-S-00735
2014-11-04-T-032,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Flat buyers looking for earlier financial protection can consider alternative private mortgage or term insurance policies.,3,736,2014-11-04-T-032-S-00736
2014-11-04-T-032,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,An insured member who changed his property will have to obtain a new housing loan with a different loan quantum and repayment period for his next flat. He will need a new HPS cover that is determined based on the new loan and the level of financial protection he now needs.,4,737,2014-11-04-T-032-S-00737
2014-11-04-T-033,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether he can provide an update on the impact of the special employment credit and the wage credit schemes; (b) whether the frequency with which employment or wage credits are being used to incentivise employers to hire certain groups of workers is sustainable; and (c) whether there are any concerns that the application of such credits in non-recessionary periods can limit their subsequent availability for use against hiring weakness in an economic downturn.,1,738,2014-11-04-T-033-S-00738
2014-11-04-T-033,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Special Employment Credit (SEC) provides support to employers to hire older workers. It was enhanced in 2012 to help employers cope with business costs arising from the increase in CPF contribution rates for older workers. The SEC will apply until 2016 to enable employers to plan ahead in hiring older workers. Today, employers receive an SEC of up to 8% of each eligible employee's monthly wage. It is targeted at Singaporean workers aged above 50, earning up to $4,000 per month. In 2013, SEC was paid to over 100,000 employers for employing 445,000 eligible employees.",1,739,2014-11-04-T-033-S-00739
2014-11-04-T-033,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) was introduced as part of a 3-Year Transition Support Package in Budget 2013. The scheme helps businesses cope with rising wage costs as they restructure in a tight labour market. It is not meant to incentivise hiring of any particular group of workers. Under the WCS, the Government co-funds 40% of wage increases given to Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to $4,000. Over 74,000 employers benefited from WCS in 2013.",2,740,2014-11-04-T-033-S-00740
2014-11-04-T-033,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The employment rates for older workers have been rising significantly. Seventy-one percent of residents aged 55 to 59 were employed in 2013, up from 64% in 2008; 39% of residents aged 65 to 69 were employed in 2013, up from 26% in 2008. These higher employment rates are due in part to the tight labour market conditions today as well as various Government schemes including the SEC. Aside from the SEC, employers can also receive various grants under the WorkPro scheme to support them in redesigning jobs and the work environment to adapt to the ageing workforce. Re-employment legislation was also introduced in 2012 which requires employers to offer re-employment to eligible resident employees who turn 62, up to 65 years old.",3,741,2014-11-04-T-033-S-00741
2014-11-04-T-033,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Assoc Prof Tan has asked if the frequency of use of wage credits as incentive for hiring is sustainable. Both the SEC and WCS are not intended to be permanent forms of support. The SEC and WCS were introduced in the context of rising cost pressures on businesses including the progressive tightening of our foreign worker policies since 2010 and changes in CPF contribution rates for older workers. Wage credit schemes, such as SEC and WCS, as well as various productivity grant schemes, are avenues through which the Government channels back the additional foreign worker levies collected as a result of the tightening, to help businesses upgrade and share gains with their workers.",4,742,2014-11-04-T-033-S-00742
2014-11-04-T-033,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"However, the long-term solution for ensuring the employability of our workers, including our older workers, is through skills upgrading. We have various schemes and subsidies in place for older workers to upskill themselves and raise their productivity such as through the Skills Training for Excellence Programme (STEP) and Enterprise Training Support (ETS) schemes.",5,743,2014-11-04-T-033-S-00743
2014-11-04-T-033,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Whether wage credit schemes will be made available during an economic downturn and how effective they will be, will largely depend on the nature of the downturn and economic outlook at that point in time.",6,744,2014-11-04-T-033-S-00744
2014-11-04-T-034,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Manpower what are the Government's plans to facilitate credential checks on foreigners coming to work in Singapore in light of cases of foreigners on employment passes who are revealed to have used false credentials.,1,745,2014-11-04-T-034-S-00745
2014-11-04-T-034,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Our Employment Pass (EP) eligibility framework is based on a range of factors, such as the applicant's salary level, qualifications and experience, to identify individuals that are likely to possess expertise and capabilities to contribute to our economy. Hence, possessing acceptable qualifications alone does not guarantee that the EP application will be approved. Conversely, not possessing acceptable qualifications does not automatically rule one out of being eligible for an EP.",1,746,2014-11-04-T-034-S-00746
2014-11-04-T-034,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In 2012, we tightened our legislation and increased penalties for making false statements or submitting false documents in support of work pass application, including those relating to academic qualifications. Offenders may be fined up to $20,000 and/or imprisoned up to two years. Since 2012 to the first half of 2014, we have successfully prosecuted about 150 foreigners for false credentials. All were sentenced to imprisonment terms and subsequently had their work passes revoked and were barred from working in Singapore.",2,747,2014-11-04-T-034-S-00747
2014-11-04-T-034,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We have also taken a risk-based approach to improve and strengthen our credential checks, including supplementing these checks with third-party overseas screening agencies, verifying the authenticity of certificates directly with the issuing educational institution and requiring the applicant to upload proof of diplomas and higher qualifications authentication.",3,748,2014-11-04-T-034-S-00748

2014-11-04-T-035,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the employment rate for Singaporeans and permanent residents respectively for the respective age groups of (i) 21 to 30 years (ii) 31 to 40 years (iii) 41 to 50 years (iv) 51 to 60 years (v) 61 to 70 years (vi) 71 to 80 years and (vii) 80 years and above; (b) what is the breakdown of those not in the workforce in terms of men and women for each age group; and (c) what are the reasons for them being unemployed.,1,750,2014-11-04-T-035-S-00750
2014-11-04-T-035,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Referring to Chart 1, data from MOM's Comprehensive Labour Force Survey indicates that the employment rates for citizens and permanent residents are broadly similar across age groups. Citizens and permanent residents aged 30 to 49 enjoy high employment rates of over 80%, while the employment rates for those aged 50 and above are also relatively high (75% and 50% for those in their 50s and 60s respectively).",1,751,2014-11-04-T-035-S-00751
2014-11-04-T-035,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh also asked for the breakdown of those not in the workforce by age and sex, as well as their reasons for inactivity.

2014-11-04-T-035,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Chart 2 shows the breakdown of economically inactive residents by age and sex. Seventy percent of all economically inactive residents are between 15 to 24 years, or 60 years and above.

2014-11-04-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For the 44 SMC disciplinary proceedings that concluded between 2011 and 2013, taxation has been completed for seven cases, of which six had a proportion of the bill reduced after taxation. In these cases, between 37% and 78% of the costs were recovered after taxation and the cumulative amount that was taxed down amounted to about $926,000. The remaining bill was eventually undisputed. These taxation cases do not include cases which are pending cost negotiations and outcomes of appeals. In each of the cases taxed, SMC paid the legal fees that were incurred.",1,759,2014-11-04-T-036-S-00759
2014-11-04-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Taxation is a procedure that determines the proportion of the costs of the winning party that the losing party is made to bear when the costs are disputed. It must not be confused with whether the legal fees incurred were reasonable, and as the Law Society explained, the taxation framework is such that there is usually a considerable difference between what a losing party eventually pays and the costs incurred by the winning party in the disciplinary proceedings. For that reason, most cases that undergo taxation would result in the winning party not being able to recover a proportion of the costs incurred.",2,760,2014-11-04-T-036-S-00760
2014-11-04-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Invariably, the legal expertise required and the costs of the disciplinary process increase with the complexity of the cases. SMC must carry out its public duty to ensure that patients' interests are protected. If it fails to pursue such cases due to financial considerations, there will be a loss of confidence in its ability to safeguard the interests of patients and in the integrity of the medical profession. SMC will continue to ensure that the legal fees of the law firms engaged are reasonable and commensurate with the work done.",3,761,2014-11-04-T-036-S-00761

It is part of an ecosystem that benefits Singaporean job seekers. This ecosystem includes the number and types of jobs being created, and whether our people have the skills and passion for the job.
