2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Madam, I believe that everyone, regardless of their age, income, connections or ability, deserves equal access to an excellent education. Singapore's education system is said by many to be one of the best in the world. Many countries look at us in envy. However, we are not perfect and we face our own giants.",2,3,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00003
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I would like to use the language of Finance Minister Mr Heng's ""Budget Speak"" and share on three areas  (a) addressing near-term concerns in education; (b) future-proofing the education industry; and (c) educating for a caring and resilient society.",3,4,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00004
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"First, addressing near-term concerns. At a recent Meet-the-People session, a couple with three children asked me to appeal for more childcare subsidies for her younger ones. When I asked for more details, they shared that they are paying more than $500 for their eldest for tuition – a Secondary 1 student. The tuition fee is more than 10% of their household income. Tuition is indeed too prevalent to ignore. It is still thriving as a shadow education industry.",4,5,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00005
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"And as though the $1-billion academics tuition industry needs another boost, another form of tuition for Direct School Admissions (DSA) has arisen. It was reported that there are tutors who can help pupils build DSA portfolios at the rate of up to $300 per hour.",5,6,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00006
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"PSLE cut-off points for entry into Secondary schools of one's choice, is a KPI for not only many students but also their parents and school educators.",6,7,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00007
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),Some educators feel that the education rat race has begun even before one enters Primary 1. Others fear that meritocracy is at risk of losing its place as a social leveller as those in the higher income groups self-perpetuate themselves. Woe be the day when a child's postal code determines his destiny.,7,8,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00008
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Then, for those who learn differently, whether in special or mainstream schools including the Institutes of Higher Learning, quality of support is still inconsistent.

2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"But all is not lost. As a member of the Education Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for many years, I know that the Ministry has been diligently confronting these mountains. They and many other Singaporeans know we must level the playing field so that every child has the opportunity to excel.",9,10,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00010
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"In January this year, I had spoken at length about the unhealthy trends of our Pre-occupation with academic success; ""Parentocracy"" and the Physical segregation of students based on their learning abilities.",10,11,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00011
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I had also given several suggestions including removing the high-stakes PSLE at the age of 12, but retaining the rigour of academic learning; and a review of the current model of sorting students into geographically different physical schools which may not reflect the microcosm of society.",11,12,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00012

2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Next, I want to touch upon future-proofing the education industry.

2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Our education sector is not immune to the fast-changing world that Budget 2016 has warned us about.

2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"SkillsFuture was the first salvo to future-proof our nation.

2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Minister Heng has announced a SkillsFuture or a future-ready toolkit that will be available from Primary 5. What about for our Educators and Parents? How about learners who continue to learn long after their traditional school exit years of ages 18 or 21? How can the current schools including special schools and IHLs, be relevant to all of them?",21,22,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00022
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Besides doing things to our students, we should work with partners to develop an Education Sectoral Manpower Plan.

2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Next, to future-proof our education sector, I feel there is the need to speed up the application of technology to bring excellence to many more. Besides its plan to launch an online learning space for its students, can MOE build an open-source platform to allow participants to develop, evaluate and contribute education ware?",23,24,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00024

2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),Some of us have heard of The Independent Project where US high-school students are allowed to start a mini-school for themselves. But that is at the extreme.,25,26,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00026

2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Lastly, on education for a caring and resilient society. I commend MOE's recent plans to have all students clean up their school on a daily basis. I also support its plan to build resilience in our youths through its National Outdoor Adventure Education Masterplan.",28,29,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00029
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),The goal of an excellent education must be the character of a person and must be based on a few key principles,29,30,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00030

2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"In conclusion, Madam, the Ministry of Education is one of our largest Government agencies. As the captain of the education industry, it has to not only address its near-term challenges but also envision and transform itself to be a key game-changer so that Singapore will be future-proof and will be here for many 50 years to come.",38,39,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00039
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of classic ""The Little Prince"" was believed to have said, ""If you want to build a ship, don't herd people together to collect wood, and assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them first to yearn for the endless immensity of the sea."" I look forward to both yearning for the sea and building a ship with the Ministry and my fellow Singaporeans. [Applause]",39,40,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00040

2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, over the years, our education system has evolved from survival to efficiency to ability-driven in terms of strategies, approaches and expected outcomes. We are now promulgating multiple pathways to diverse peaks of excellence in our education system. In our bid to make our education system more diverse and holistic, we have to include more co-curricular activities, outdoor learning, the creative arts, and community involvement in our school curriculum.",1,42,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00042
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I laud the move to recognise students' involvement in clubs, societies, sports, music and drama as part of the formal school curriculum, hence placing such involvement as co-curricular activities rather than what was previously known as extra-curricular activities. This is good because values such as resilience, sportsmanship, having the spirit of teamwork, and developing one's leadership skills can be honed.",2,43,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00043
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"However, currently, students' involvement in CCAs depends a lot on their ability in a particular interest group. For instance, before a student is able to join the school's netball or football team, the student has to undergo trials to see if they are good enough to be part of the school team.",3,44,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00044
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"The purpose of CCA is to allow more of our students to have a more balanced and holistic education in schools. But having trials to see how good they are before they are allowed to be part of a particular sport or ensemble, unnecessarily restricts participation and does not allow late bloomers the space to blossom. I would propose that our schools expand their CCA intakes to take in different tiers of student abilities. For example, a school can have a Tier 1 netball team to compete in national schools' competitions, and a Tier 2 netball team to train students in the sport, or even have friendly matches with other schools' Tier 2 teams.",4,45,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00045
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"In addition, the integration of outdoor learning and creative arts in our main school curriculum will strengthen learning and personal development of our students in schools. Schools in countries such as Finland have incorporated outdoor learning in their curriculum where students learn map reading and trekking, and put the knowledge learnt in Mathematics, Geography and Physics to practice; while schools in Australia have incorporated creative arts in their curriculum where students learn to appreciate music, visual arts, drama and dance, and apply the knowledge learnt in English, Literature and Physical Education. I would even propose that appreciation of music, dance and culture of the different ethnicities in Singapore be included in our creative arts curriculum.",5,46,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00046
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Being involved in the community through projects and outreach programs helps foster values such as empathy, caring for others, and magnanimity. I hope the Ministry will continue to build on our Values in Action programme and grant sufficient space for our students to design and implement their own community outreach projects, so that they are able to learn and internalise these values in a more authentic manner.",6,47,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00047
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"My second cut on inclusivity  the new PSLE scoring system that was first announced by the Prime Minister at the National Day Rally in 2013, is a strong signal to parents, teachers and students of our move away from chasing the last point for the PSLE aggregate score. This chase, in turn, affects admission to Secondary schools, particularly those that are more popular than others and where the school cut-off points can be rather high.",7,48,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00048
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"As a result of such keen competition to gain admission to these popular schools, many students depend on the Direct School Admission (DSA) to leverage on their other talents such as in sports, music, dance, or specific academic subjects. There are students who may not have met these popular schools' cut off points for the PSLE but have talents in other areas. There have been some concerns that popular schools which admit students through DSA in non-academic areas may end up having these students under-performing or doing poorly in national examinations, hence affecting the schools' overall performance.",8,49,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00049
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I can understand that some popular schools are proud of their traditions and would like to retain a certain standard of excellence among their students. However, excellence cannot just mean achievement in the academics. Excellence must be holistic and include those in sports, the arts, music, and community work and volunteerism. I would like to urge the Ministry to continue to allow popular schools to admit students who have talents that are non-academic in nature. The diversity in student population created would then be more representative of the larger community where different abilities exist and where the environment is not so exclusive.",9,50,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00050
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Similarly, I would also like to urge the Ministry to help the less popular schools attract a more diverse student population – those who have talents in both the non-academic and academic arenas – by allowing these schools greater flexibility and autonomy to admit more students through the DSA.",10,51,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00051
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"As schools strive to create greater diversity among students and provide multiple pathways of excellence for them to pursue their interests and abilities in, there must also be efforts to ensure that our schools are a lot more inclusive. I have two suggestions.",11,52,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00052
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"One, as the PSLE grading system will be tweaked, I call on the Ministry, once again, to consider abolishing the academic streams. Sorting our students according to academic streams has served its purpose during our efficiency-driven education era. But now, as we try to move away from putting too much emphasis on scores and instead allow students to learn different subjects at different levels of difficulty, according to their abilities, let us go one step further and remove these self-limiting but no longer necessary labelling which we call Gifted, Special, Express, Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) streams.",12,53,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00053
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Let us recognise that students develop differently and at different rates. We have already allowed subject based banding and allowed students in the current Normal (Academic) stream to take some Express stream subjects because they are able, for instance. Let us now be bold enough to remove the labels entirely and yet continue allowing our students to learn different subjects at different levels of difficulty according to their abilities and progress.",13,54,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00054
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, in our bid to make our schools more inclusive, I would urge the Ministry to include more students with special needs in our mainstream schools, as long as they are able to cope with the rigor and expectations of the curriculum. There are Allied Educators for Learning and Behavioural Support or AED(LBS) who can help students with special needs in the classroom. Although we have the AED(LBS) in all our Primary schools, it is not quite so for our Secondary schools. I would like to see all of our mainstream schools having AED(LBS) so that students with special needs can enrol in any of our mainstream schools.",14,55,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00055
2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"To mitigate the challenge of not being able to employ enough AED(LBS), I hope the Ministry would consider my earlier suggestion to train suitable parent volunteers to take on this role. I envision our schools to be a lot more inclusive, being a microcosm of our society – where various abilities and disabilities exist together, and where our students learn to work together and help one another with compassion and magnanimity.",15,56,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00056
2016-04-08-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The Ministry has taken steps to reduce competition in PSLE scores. We stopped announcing the top PSLE scorers since 2012, and stopped revealing the highest and lowest scores in a cohort.",1,57,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00057
2016-04-08-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Despite these changes, the PSLE remains a high-stakes examination for 12 year-olds. Without T-scores, children and parents will still be in a race to achieve the ""best"" grade bands to secure a place in the ""good"" schools. Even the DSA Exercise has just been an entry route for students who have had the resources or opportunity to be developed in certain areas of sports or arts. At the end of day, children are still pushed to compete against others; if not in academics, then in sports or arts.",2,58,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00058
2016-04-08-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),Competition is a fact of life and we do our children a disservice if we do not prepare them for it. But we also need them to appreciate that human beings cannot be measured like weight of fish or height of trees. And our children need to develop in a less stressful and competitive way.,3,59,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00059
2016-04-08-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"MOE is developing diverse programmes in schools to meet the needs of different children. This is an encouraging development, but how will this be aligned with the review of the PSLE system? Will school admissions still be based on how well the children perform academically or in that area of specialisation, or more based on whether the child's interest and aptitude matches the school's programme? How can we improve our PSLE system of grading and make it less stressful, more broad and free up more time and space for them to pursue other interests outside of academics?",4,60,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00060
2016-04-08-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Finally, we recently introduced SkillsFuture initiatives such as the Earn and Learn programme for Polytechnic and ITE graduates, recognising that students can take a longer or different pathway to their respective careers. This is a positive step. Can the Minister tell us how we can carry this through to Primary school – so that it is not necessary to just ""cram"" at the PSLE level and make it a must to get into that one good school?",5,61,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00061
2016-04-08-T-002,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Mdm Chair, the seven neighbourhood schools that received no Secondary one posting from this year were attributed to the following cohort size. Indeed, the 2015 cohort of 38,600 Secondary 1 students is about 10% lower than the previous year. However, if MOE were to divide the 2015 cohort size by the number of Secondary schools, it can easily fill all schools including these seven schools with at least five to six classes of 40 students each. Thus, the reality is – all schools are created not equal, as popular schools will continue to attract more students at the expense of neighbourhood schools. These call into question about the mantra that every school is a good school.",1,62,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00062
2016-04-08-T-002,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The mad rush to become a parent volunteer, join the RC or even relocate just to secure a better chance in the balloting exercise for admission into popular schools for their children has become a stressful ritual for parents year after year. So, in the minds of parents, every school is definitely not the same. But what do teachers and principals think? I am sure when teachers and principals come together, the issue of funding for their schools will surface somewhere down their conversation. It is my belief that MOE must walk the talk that every school is indeed a good school by addressing the funding issues first.",2,63,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00063
2016-04-08-T-002,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"In a reply to my Parliamentary Question (PQ) on funding for school, the Minister said it is not meaningful to compare funding per school but rather we should look at the per capita funding per student. Madam, I believe comparing funding for school is meaningful because we are talking about every school is a good school at the school level. So, while we know that every student can be a good student because they are given the same per capita funding, I am not sure if every school can be a good school in the context of funding at the school level.",3,64,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00064
2016-04-08-T-002,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Popular schools with higher enrolment numbers by default will have more budget to work with.

2016-04-08-T-002,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Let us compare Rosyth Primary School with an enrolment of 2,000 students with Bendemeer Primary School with an enrolment of 1,200 students. Based on per capita funding per Primary school, Rosyth Primary School is effectively receiving $7.8 million than Bendemeer Primary School every year. This disparity is significant and needs to be addressed because smaller schools will always face a budget constraint by default. This disparity will perpetuate year after year as popular schools with bigger budgets will be able to do more for their students, and at a lower cost due to economies of scale.",5,66,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00066
2016-04-08-T-002,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"And when schools churn out even more top students, it will be a hard sell to tell parents that every school is a good school because neighbourhood schools will be shrinking in size and disappearing overtime.",6,67,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00067
2016-04-08-T-002,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Madam, we are living in a social media world. We do not need the mainstream media to publicise anything anymore.

2016-04-08-T-002,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"For a less popular school with a smaller cohort, the extra funding will come in handy to compensate for the lower economies of scale in the procurement of products and services for their students. These schools will also be able to do more in sports and enrichment programmes with I strongly believe are important activities for small neighbourhood schools to build character and instil a sense of belonging and pride in their students.

I propose that graduating students finishing in the top tier of their Primary school based on PSLE results, to be given a direct admission to secondary school of their choice. Currently, Primary schools are already recognising their top PSLE students, so the chances of top students from neighbourhood Primary schools going to popular schools like Dunman High, Hwa Chong or Raffles Institution are no lesser than their peers from popular Primary schools now and still based on merit at the school level.",9,70,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00070

MOE has eight stated outcomes of what a kid should have achieved by Primary 6, including great things like  (i) they know their strengths; (ii) they have a lively curiosity about things; and (iii) they cooperate, share and care for others. But because every Primary school still dedicates the biggest real-estate on report cards to subject grades, every stakeholder gets the message that these outcomes do not really matter.",3,87,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00087
2016-04-08-T-002,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"If these behaviours are not tracked or rewarded on a report card, it is not going to happen systematically; just accidentally. You can hear few parents freaking out about their child not ""Knowing their Strengths"" or stressing about Ah-Boy's lack of ""Curiosity"", even though that is more actually an indicative of future success. So, I suggest we give significant space on report cards to non-academic indicators closely linked to our strategic outcomes of innovation and collaboration.",4,88,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00088

For example, in Singapore, parent-teacher meetings (PTMs) often take the form of the teacher explaining the gaps on the child's performance without the child being present, with the view to the parent helping to remedy those gaps at home. Many of us are familiar with this. I do not blame our teachers at all for this. They are doing their jobs as defined by the system, and usually they are motivated by genuine care for their children.",2,93,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00093

In fact, it appears that the further students progress in their education, the more difficult they find it to participate in CCAs and sports or in the performing arts. This is even more so if the CCA is known to be a niche CCA that the school is supposedly good at, where presumably, you have more teachers and fellow students with much to share.",2,99,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00099

I understand that the pupil-teacher ratios for Primary and Secondary schools are equivalent to OECD averages.

2016-04-08-T-002,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"I would like to suggest that Reading Sessions become part of Primary and Secondary schools' core curriculum, and not merely an exercise within the English class. Led by facilitators with strategies, reading sessions can help students access the lives of characters, and understand their deeper emotions. In this way, the students can better deal with similar issues that they may be facing.",9,122,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00122
2016-04-08-T-002,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Secondly, Character and Citizenship Education. Firstly, I would like to commend MOE in their recent revamp of the pedagogical approach to CCE. Here I would like to suggest the topic of loss be included in the syllabus at all levels. The content can be scaffolded. For Primary schools students, we can use relatable stories like taking care of pets to examine issues of loss. For higher levels, we can tackle more complex situations. However, the approach must be nuanced. Students have to be guided in the process. And I would think that experiential learning would be a good strategy. Experiential learning builds within the body a memory that does not forget easily and help the students to cope. It is like riding a bicycle. You cannot intellectually learn how to ride a bicycle, you have to go onto it, fall. But after a while, you realise that even if you do not ride a bicycle, you will still remember how to do it because your body recalls it for you.",10,123,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00123

As it is, the teachers are already swamped with work. I hope that more teachers can be employed, specifically trained to manage these areas of teaching, where a lighter touch in needed, and where a safe environment is crucial. Schools may already have existing counsellors. But these operations often appear to be detached from the daily grind of school life – as if being in touch with a counsellor is a sign of weakness, or worse, a taboo. Imagine then, if such teacher-counsellors are part and parcel of school life. Imagine if a child can ask questions about algebra and fractions in one class, and then talk about the pain of losing her favourite cat minutes later.

Some may think that my proposals would mean that parents are excused from their responsibilities. I would, however, like to suggest a paradigm shift  let us begin work on the young, so that as they grow in their ability to handle change and loss, they in turn can be the living examples that their children can learn from.

They may pass the tests and exams with just above 50 marks and get promoted to next level. When they reached the next level, the difficulty level of the subject is going to be raised another notch.

2016-04-08-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,"Mdm Chair, I am aware that MOE is supporting schools with special needs children through the deployment of Special Needs Officers (SNOs), but the support is insufficient. Hence, parents with special needs children would prefer for their children to be in specialised schools where there is better support, but either, there are no vacancies in those schools or the cost of putting their child in these specialised schools is too expensive as they may not be eligible for subsidies.",1,183,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00183
2016-04-08-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,"I would like MOE to consider improving the ratio of SNOs to the number of special needs children in schools. MOE should also consider having more special needs schools and providing more support for special needs children.

However, the focus of our education system should go beyond test scores.

Let them not just study the flowers, but also stop to smell the flowers and wonder at their beauty.

2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Today, there is a deeply ingrained mindset that the PSLE is a very high-stakes exam. Many perceive that a child's PSLE T-score at the age of 12 determines his or her success and pathway in life. But we know that this is not true, from the many stories of many who have done well in life despite not having done so well in PSLE. What we observe is that a student's PSLE indicates the progress that a child has made in his or her learning in Primary school; but it does not cast in stone what he or she can achieve in the future, in life.",39,225,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00225
2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Yet, such a mindset has persisted. And as a parent, I can empathise with that. It is easy to get fixated on what is measurable. We put a score on something and that makes it easy for us to compare with one another. But what is measurable, sometimes, may not be what is most important in the long run. Chasing after that last point in an exam could come at a cost to other aspects of our children's overall development, especially at a young age. Too many anxious late nights, too much tuition, and too little quality time for family and friends, for play and for exploration.",40,226,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00226

I am not much of a gardener, but I did plant some green beans for a school project when I was a small boy. I remember waking up each morning, impatiently monitoring my glass jar day after day, waiting for the first shoot to sprout.

We have made several steps in this direction over the last few years. For example, in 2012, we stopped naming the top PSLE scorers. Today, we celebrate students' performance in all domains across both academic and non-academic areas. But I think we can do more to change mind-sets and culture.",44,230,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00230

2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"The main issue to address is that the way we currently score the PSLE is too precise, and differentiates our students more finely than necessary. A student may score one point more than his friend at the PSLE, but educationally, that one point does not mean that he is better prepared for Secondary school than his friend. It also does not mean that he is very much smarter or will grow up to be more capable or lead a more successful or fulfilling life. We should therefore, in time, move away from such fine distinctions, which are not meaningful, especially at that young age.",46,232,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00232
2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"The way that the T-score is calculated may have also created unhealthy competition among our young children. Because it is calculated based on how students do relative to one another, students may feel the pressure to do better than their peers rather than help each other out to learn. This runs counter to the values we want to inculcate in our children. We can find a better balance between encouraging our students to study hard and get good results, and making them overly-competitive and anxious about outdoing one another.",47,233,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00233

2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Also similar to the ""O"" and ""A"" Levels, we will move towards a scoring system that is more reflective of a student's learning and level of mastery. Once a student shows a level of understanding and ability that meets the professionally-set standard, he will receive the grade, regardless of how his peers may perform. This is more educationally meaningful than assessing a student's performance relative to his peers.",50,236,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00236

2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"With the move to broader PSLE scoring bands, students will be able to choose a school that is a good fit for them from a wider range of schools of a similar academic profile. In doing so, students can consider factors such as the school's distinctive programmes, CCAs, and partnerships with the community and industry, and better match these factors with their interests.",52,238,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00238
2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"These planned changes are significant, so MOE will not rush the implementation.

2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"So, we will take the next few years to work through these changes carefully. We have already begun our journey of evolving our school landscape. We want to give all schools time to develop their distinctive strengths and niche programmes, towards the vision of every school a good school. This remains important. Meanwhile, we will need to develop and test the new PSLE scoring and posting systems thoroughly.

These two modules, these two ideas of a CCE module and Service Learning Project, in the teacher training process informs us of how we map some of our expectations of behaviours and values that we have of our students to the process that the teachers undergo in their training.

Rather than be concerned about the average disbursements or a particular target, what is important is that these students have access to resources matched to their needs. The needs are greatly varied. Some students need a very small intervention a ramp, a mechanical key board – where as other students need a very wide series of both physical as well as process interventions. So, the average may not be very meaningful.

This is comparable to fees at Government schools. The remaining seven SPED schools charge higher fees. This is because they cater to students with multiple disabilities and challenges, who have a greater need for additional educational and therapy support.

There is little doubt that employers would want their workers to deepen their skills on the job. Yet, while both experimentation and trial-and-error are inevitable in a workplace setting, they are meant to be incidental.

But let me first start by addressing the current worry that Ms Foo Mee Har has raised. I chair the subcommittee of Jobs and Skills of the Committee on the Future Economy. So, I met up with an old friend recently. He is a journalist, and I asked him what do his readers expect out of the sub-committee. And he said, ""The economy is a bit sluggish, tell the students and the parents what to study, and after that what jobs to get. You used to say!"" And when he said ""you"", he meant the Government – the Government used to say, study chemical engineering, biomed. And so, what is next?",1,406,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00406
2016-04-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"When I see young students today, some of them do ask me the same question.

2016-04-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The first perspective, the first answer, is to understand the environment. It is very frustrating for a young person to graduate with a degree or diploma, step out to the workforce and find that there is no demand. Very frustrating. Something Mr Ang Wei Neng just mentioned, it happens in Korea, it happens in Taiwan. We must know how economic winds are blowing domestically, in the region, in the world, and what is developing, what are the technological advancements? What skills and knowledge are in demand? We should never ignore demand. From this perspective, governments all have a duty to decipher all that is happening around us, and signal to the people what are the areas to pursue.",3,408,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00408
2016-04-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The second answer is to know the individual. If we can help every one of us discover our interests and our aspirations, uncover innate talents and abilities, and fulfil the potential of as many individuals as possible, that will become an enduring strength for the collective, for Singapore. From this perspective, what to learn is also a very personal enterprise; we must help each individual follow their respective rainbows.",4,409,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00409

When you are able to choose and enter a course you are interested in or feel passionate about, you feel more ownership and enthusiasm, and will likely do better. There is a Confucius saying, """"知之者不如好之者, 好之者不如乐之者"". If I may provide an imperfect translation, it means somebody who knows cannot match somebody who wants to know; somebody who wants to know cannot match somebody who loves or is passionate to know.

We started with the Early Childhood Education courses out of necessity, because some of the students do not have staying power in the industry, something that Assoc Prof Randolph Tan mentioned.

Between a 12-pointer who is not so interested in a course but does not mind a course, and a 16-pointer who is very interested in the course, who do you choose?

Today, it is about 45%. Harvard, MIT and Oxford have a similar share of local faculty as our universities, but the bases – I have a big caveat here – because when we look at it, the bases of compiling the data and definitions are very different, and so we may not be comparing apples to apples. This is why MOE has been hesitant to disclose these comparisons. MOE is a very precise Ministry. But walk around the campuses of these top universities, you will find that you too will feel the diversity of the faculty. Even if the data is not accurate, I think the sense is they all have diverse faculty. Having said that, ours are national universities, and there also needs to be a balance between global diversity and having a Singapore character in our universities.

Previously, I was concerned that, with the efforts, the private training provider may be sidelined but I am glad the Minister has mentioned that there is always a place for private training providers. I hope to hear whether or not MOE plans to invest in strengthening some of our local-bred training providers like SEED Institute for Early Childhood Education and whether we will help them expand and deepen their capabilities.",1,535,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00535

I am quite glad to hear that all schools will have student care centres by 2020. First clarification is that how does MOE plan to roll out this plan? Which are the areas that you will have the student care centres first? I ask this because in very high demand area, like my area in Sembawang, we need more after-school care services. So, hopefully, when rolling out, do consider the local demand.",1,540,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00540
2016-04-08-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,I thank Dr Lim for his question. The roll-out will depend on a variety of factors. Local demand is certainly one of those. Space availability is also important. But the key issue for when a centre can develop and how long it will take us to reach a centre in every school is the availability of quality provision for student care centres. We do need to make sure that the providers of the service have the staff with the ability to provide appropriate services and sufficient supervision to make sure that the children are well looked after. We take into account the suggestion that we should prioritise some areas and I will study it.,1,541,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00541
2016-04-08-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,"Madam, I would like to thank the Acting Minister for bringing up the subject of aptitude admissions. Clearly, you did not open a can of worms but really open up a window of opportunity for many young people. So, Madam, I would like to ask the Minister of real cases. For example, a resident who met me last night, for five years he has tried to go into Polytechnic having completed his Higher Nitec.",1,542,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00542

He is articulate. He is positive. He has lots of energy. He participated in the Youth Wing. These are all the qualities you would want. So, my clarification, Madam, is whether for an individual like that who has attempted three times, that you would consider his case for this year's admission rather than wait till next year where he has to wait yet another year.",2,543,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00543
2016-04-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank Ms Foo Mee Har. I confirm that I have received your appeal and we will look into it. But I just want to sound caution here. Because you rattled off some things that he did. When we talk about aptitude-based admission, it is different from saying that you cannot meet the academic cut-off and therefore, I take your sports, your community work into account and I deem that you meet the cut-off. It is not like that. That is what we call discretionary admission, to make up for a failure to meet a cut-off point.",1,544,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00544
2016-04-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This is aptitude-based admission. That means if he has really worked very hard on the ground over all the years, helping the disabled, helping the needy and the low-income and now he says, ""I want to do a degree or I want to do a Diploma in Social Work"". That is a consideration for aptitude-based admission.",2,545,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00545
2016-04-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I just handled a case recently. She is a mature candidate. She never did a diploma before; worked in the F&B industry for 17 years; now being a mature worker, she wants to do a diploma, full time and so she puts her name through the system based on aggregate score, in her case it is ""O"" levels 17 years ago. On that she was sent to the nursing course. She appealed to me to say, ""Why nursing? I have been working in F&B for 17 years."" And so, we raised her appeal to the Polytechnic. The Polytechnic interviewed her and put her now into a Food Science and Nutrition programme which is exactly what she wanted.

2016-04-08-T-002,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin,"The second question is how can MOE also work with schools to clarify the mixed messaging that some parents are getting because I have heard of parents who are quite happy with the progressive report cards they are getting but, at the same time, they are also getting these assessment schedules, detailing extensively what is the weightage of grades and all that kind of stuff. Their complaint is that they are both confused about what does the system want from them, the holistic assessment and there is also an issue of distrust. They are not sure whether there has been a real shift at all.",2,548,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00548
2016-04-08-T-002,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin,"The third question is, I am aware that it is a work-in-progress, but is MOE working towards consistently connecting the non-academic competencies that they are tracking on these report cards to the desired Key Stage Outcomes that MOE has listed because, for example, at the Primary school level, one of the eight desired Key Stage Outcomes is awareness of the arts and, clearly, there are not many Primary schools prioritising this as a competency on a large scale.",3,549,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00549

Firstly, a point of clarification to the Minister on the issue of class sizes which he discussed in relation to what Assoc Prof Daniel Goh had mentioned. The Minister mentioned there is no proven causal link between smaller class sizes and better educational outcomes. I would like to ask if that is the case then why is it that the OECD average is smaller, why is it that our GEP classes are smaller, why is it that our international schools in Singapore have smaller class sizes and why is it that the tuition centre classes that we have in Singapore all have smaller class sizes than the norm, compared to the Primary and Secondary schools.",1,551,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00551
2016-04-08-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,The Minister alluded to the fact we can generate good educational outcomes in Singapore based on tests like PISA and so on in spite of having larger class sizes than the OECD average. But we have to bear in mind that that is also with the help of the $1 billion tuition industry.,2,552,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00552
2016-04-08-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"My question and my suggestion is − and relating to the point about sustainability − right now we have a situation where enrolments are gradually declining and if we assume that the attrition rate remains stable and that teachers are not made redundant, would not this create an opportunity to redeploy teachers in such a way as to reduce the class size, to avail ourselves of those kind of benefits. So, that is my first point.",3,553,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00553
2016-04-08-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"My second point is just in relation to the increased emphasis on outdoor learning with the OBS and so on, what are the provisions being made for students with physical disabilities in order to be inclusive towards them?",4,554,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00554
2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"I thank the Member for the question. What I said in the speech is that on class size, according to research, on a systemic basis, there is no conclusive evidence. But we do go on a needs basis to tailor our education programmes for specific needs, whether it is GEP or for Normal (Technical) classes. Where the class size of Normal (Technical) is concerned, in Spectra and Crest, we go down to 20 per class to meet those needs. So, it is not just an issue of having a smaller class size for the GEPs but according to the needs. Both ends of the spectrum.",1,555,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00555

2016-04-08-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,"My second clarification, Madam, is to Minister Ng Chee Meng. I note that Minister has not touched on reviewing academic streams in his response but I would like to urge the Ministry to review academic streams in tandem with PSLE review. I recognise that it is not easy because having the academic streams have made Secondary 1 posting and teaching a lot more expedient and targeted but I think the timing is right. With five years or six years before the PSLE review kicks in, I think we should attempt to move away from this self-limiting sorting.",2,558,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00558

2016-04-08-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Interestingly, I have a case of a student which I had no time earlier to mention during my COS speech. It is this student from Kent Ridge Secondary School, Leonard Chia. He did not get a place in a school which offered the AEP but because of the three centres that we have, they enabled students like him to be able to have opportunities to take on the courses. We will monitor the situation. Nevertheless, we can see the value of art education to our people.",2,560,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00560

I appreciate the concern raised but an equally important point in our education system is that, at the PSLE juncture, we would like to determine, after six years of education, how to tailor the Secondary school curriculum to the needs of the individual child. As you know, each individual child has different abilities, different learning paces and different learning needs. PSLE together with streaming has allowed us to place students into the appropriate courses to best cater to their learning needs.",1,568,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00568
2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"I have joined the Ministry for about six months and I looked at the history of our education. In the long past, we lost about 40% of our Primary 1 cohorts who started but did not finish secondary education. With the combination of different things that we have done, we have reduced dropout rates to less than 1%. So, this tailoring, while I do understand some of the potential downsides, does have its important educational outcomes.",2,569,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00569

Even where you have, let us say, a Normal (Academic) student who has done well, we will permit transfer to the Express course. For specific subjects, under subject-based banding, if we see a student who is very good at Mathematics and he may be in Normal (Academic), we do permit and encourage him to take Mathematics at the Express level. These things that we are doing allow porosity. We try our very best to afford the opportunities for the student to excel in whichever course he may be in. This will always be evolving and we will be continuing to study your proposals to see how we can further improve.",3,570,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00570
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Madam, I would like to pose two questions to the two Ministers. One is, a lot of the plans that were outlined by Minister is for what you do for the students and to the students. But I said in my sharing that I think the education sector is not immune to the changes of this world. I wanted to hear Minister's views on what SkillsFuture plan MOE has for itself to address the new economy. How do you plan to help your staff meet these challenges and also adjust to these challenges?",1,571,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00571
2016-04-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"The second one on the PSLE review is for Minister Ng. It is definitely an improvement so that it is not such a fine score to work on. However, I think at the end of it, it is still boils down to grades. I am just wondering what Minister thinks will be the game-changer, or the key that will unlock Singaporeans from our habit of chasing the grades and chasing the scores through tuition and definitely wanting to go for a degree for that matter. So, I am just wondering how Minister feels about that.",2,572,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00572
2016-04-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank Ms Denise Phua, for her questions. The SkillsFuture plan for MOE, I think will comprise the following. One is for teachers, and that is at NIE. NIE has always been updating its curriculum and moving forward, it has a big role to play in SkillsFuture to upgrade and deepen the skills of our teachers.",1,573,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00573
2016-04-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"At the Polytechnics and ITE, many of them come from industry and I think they have to continue this strong effort to make sure that there is a rotation of their lecturers moving between academia and industry. That way, they keep abreast of what is happening in the industry and bring the lessons back into the Polytechnics and ITE.",2,574,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00574

There is really no easy straightforward solution, no silver bullet answer that I can give for cause-effect outcomes.

2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"MOE, however, cannot do any of these alone. We need all the different stakeholders to come on board with us, to value other areas beyond academics. The three areas that I have spoken about, we should look at them in totality and embrace them to reduce the emphasis on academics, more emphasis on non-academic areas including character and values, and also provide over time a realisation of the possibility of every school being a good school to open up choices and opportunities for students to pick and choose schools that will best meet their needs. I think this paradigm shift is needed and again, I do apologise that I do not have a silver bullet answer, a simple one that will be able to move us into the realm that Ms Denise Phua has mentioned.",4,582,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00582

As the Member knows, in NTUC, they set up e2i which is a tripartite organisation with about 100 employability coaches. Likewise, when we set up WDA in 2003, we also took in all the employability coaches from the CDCs and on the ground – that is another 100-plus. So we have over 200 people in the system that has done this for the last 10 years  meeting industry, meeting job seekers and giving coaching. Let us be very careful. Let us not hire a whole new army every time we start a new scheme. There is an existing group of people with the experience that we can use and leverage on to deliver this service that Mr Desmond Choo spoke about.

While it is true that there is inconclusive research on the causal link between reduced class size and teaching and education outcomes on a systemic level, and that is because academics are so good at destroying at each other's research, there are provisional conclusive results that reduced class size would positively affect education outcomes for disadvantaged students especially in the US and UK.",1,585,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00585

What avenues are there for teachers who are passionate to teach disadvantaged students to take a sabbatical to upgrade themselves with skills outside the regular academic fields so that they can go and teach the disadvantaged students and then to request for a transfer, where they can go and teach the disadvantaged students?",1,589,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00589
2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"I thank the Member for the questions. Perhaps, I will just give an update to Assoc Prof Daniel Goh. When we do a needs-based approach, we provide the necessary resources to disadvantaged students. In Primary 1 and 2, as I had mentioned, if students joining our schools are not able to catch up, we take them out of the form class into a smaller size of maybe eight to 10 students and we provide dedicated teaching resource, one or two teachers, to level them up in English or literacy skills or numeracy skills, for up to two years. In the time that I have been in MOE, if I recall the numbers correctly, about 6% of our students benefit from these programmes. They do graduate out of these support programmes. So, it is very tailored, as per our philosophy, where there is need, we will put in the necessary resources to level our children up.",1,590,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00590
2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"For the posting suggestion that Assoc Prof Goh mentioned, when I visited Spectra Secondary School in Woodlands. I was very impressed by one teacher. She was a teacher at Raffles Institution. But because of her deep ingrained desire to make a bigger difference to children with low progress, she decided to ask for a transfer to Spectra. As I had mentioned in my speech, in the context of Singapore, through NIE, we have a central institute, if you will, to train teachers to a very high quality. In this central system, we do allow these transfers for teachers with the passion that Assoc Prof Goh had mentioned.",2,591,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00591

To Minister Ong Ye Kung, I want to clarify that he agrees with me that for certain faculties where local context is important such as Political Science and Public Policy, having an adequate core of Singaporean academics in such faculties is useful.

2016-04-08-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Member for the questions.

I have met many foreign faculty and foreigners living in Singapore for a long time. Some of them serve in the SAF Volunteer Corp I talked about yesterday. And their hearts are with Singapore. So, I would not say that this is something only Singaporean faculty can do. So I suspend judgement here. Ultimately, I do think in a faculty, putting whatever they teach in our context is important.

In our school system as you would know, ultimately, there is a personal choice involved, what the students may want to do, what the parents may want him or her to do.

There is a falling cohort size. Would the Ministry consider taking the opportunity to reduce class size then for secondary schools, rather than not post any student to those secondary schools and eventually those schools got to merge or close?",1,602,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00602
2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"I thank the Member for the question. With reference to school mergers, falling cohort size is a reality. Enrolment is coming down across the different schools. It would not be right to roll back enrolment in a healthy Secondary school to bolster up the lowered enrolment in the other secondary schools because this would lead to a distortion of outcomes.",1,603,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00603
2016-04-08-T-002,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"In our philosophy, when we look at merging schools, we want the students to have the best opportunities to explore different programmes. If you do not have the critical mass in low enrolment schools, we will not be able to afford the programmes, the CCAs that Members have also mentioned. If it is 400 students versus 1,200 students, you can see the potential differences in opportunities to be given to the 400 and the 1,200. So, we do need a certain critical mass and there is a certain design in our school system that affords us these resources for them to run all these different co-curricular activities and so on and so forth.",2,604,2016-04-08-T-002-S-00604

Please allow me to use the famous Chinese classic novel ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" as an analogy. Liu Bei was also an ""SME"" and only managed to recruit Zhuge Liang after three attempts.

We need to do more to change mindsets, and there is a huge difference between the word SAVE and SAFE, although both sound almost the same.

The growth in our local labour force will drop by more than half from an average of 55,000 a year in the past five years to just about 20,000 a year for next five years. So, a drop of more than half.",6,747,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00747
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Likewise, the growth in our foreign workforce will drop too. Also by more than half from an average of 55,000 per year in past five years to just 20,000 to 25,000 a year in next five years. So, put together, growth of the Singapore Workforce will continue to drop from 4% a year in 2011 to 2014, to 2% last year and likely to be around 1% by the year 2020.",7,748,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00748
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"This has great impact on the future employment landscape in Singapore. The days of more than 100,000 job growth a year are over. It is simply not sustainable. With no gain in productivity, we have moved from a 4+0=4 or 4% growth in the Singapore workforce plus 0% growth in productivity to give us a 4% GDP growth during the year 2011 to 2014 on an average.",8,749,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00749

2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"The question is  what will happen next? From 4+0=4 to 2+0=2, what is going to happen next? Will employment outcomes in next five years be better or worse? I can see, I can think of three possible scenarios – the Good, the Bad, and of course, the Ugly.",10,751,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00751
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"The first scenario, we are unable to transform fast enough; continue with zero productivity growth; continue with manpower led growth of more than 100,000 jobs a year. MOM will have no choice, we do a U-turn, relax on our foreign manpower and that is what many employers are asking for.",11,752,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00752
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"From 4+0 to 2+0, we now go back to 3+0. We have to let in more foreign workers to make up for the slower growth in local manpower. With 3+0=3, yes, we have 3% GDP growth but what happens to our locals-foreign workers ratio? It will continue to drop from the 2 1 today, maybe to 1 1 one day and beyond that Singaporean workers will become a minority in our local workforce. The Singaporean core will be weakened further and in fact, the local-foreign divide will deepened further. That is why I call the ""Ugly"" scenario.",12,753,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00753
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"The second scenario, to avoid this ugly outcome, MOM can stand firm, no U-turn in our foreign manpower policy, continue to moderate the intake of foreign manpower. But without breakthrough in productivity growth, we will move to from 4+0 to 2+0 to eventually 1+0=1. So, in other words, low growth will become the new norm, in fact, hovering around stagnation. If that happens, it is a matter of time that the unemployment in Singapore will go up and wage growth will stop and I call this a ""Bad"" scenario for all.",13,754,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00754
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"The third scenario is for us to recognise that technology is changing the nature of jobs and global competition is changing the nature of investment. Instead of manpower-led growth, 100,000 new jobs a year, we go for manpower lean growth. We speed up transformation, instead of going for larger quantity of jobs growth, we go for better quality of job growth.",14,755,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00755
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Step by step, sector by sector, we move from high value-added to value creation. From value creation to value multiplication; and then we can return to positive productivity growth again. Instead of going from 4+0, 2+0 to either 3+0 which is an ugly outcome, or 1+0 which is a bad outcome, we should strive for 1+2, 1% growth in our workforce plus 2% growth in our productivity to give us 3% growth. So, 1+2=3 is the good outcome that we must strive for.",15,756,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00756
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"The challenge for us is how to make it happen. Along the way, if we are more pro-business and less pro-worker, we could end up with a strong economy but a weak Singaporean core. If we are more pro-worker and less pro-business, we can have a strong Singaporean core but a weak economy. Neither is good because growth cannot be sustained, eventually we will go downhill.",16,757,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00757

2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"First, to be a more manpower-lean economy and more productive economy. This is of great concern to the MOM, because if we fail to become a more manpower-lean economy, manpower will become the bottleneck in our future growth.

Later, my colleague, Minister of State Teo Ser Luck will share more on LEDS.",22,763,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00763
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),Our second thrust is to build a strong Singaporean core. Every Industry Transformation Map will be accompanied by a Sectoral Manpower Plan formulated by the Sectoral Tripartite Committee. This will address the concern of Mr Lee Yi Shyan on whether the MOM be involved in co-driving the development of Industrial Transformation Plan.,23,764,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00764

Ms Jessica Tan expressed her concern about whether can we minimise this mismatch between skill and job. With the Sectoral Manpower Plan, we will be able to look ahead and identify what type of jobs will be created, what kind of skills need to be developed for the future, so that we can support the growth of this transformed industry of the future. In this way, it also helps our people to upgrade, to reskill, and along the way, we aim to build a strong Singaporean core in all major sectors of economy, as we continue to transform these industries.",24,765,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00765

It is not a sexy sector, but it is an important sector, alongside with many other sectors. We are going to see a 20% increase in hotel rooms in Singapore by the year 2020.

The industries are working very hard to reduce the staff-to-room manning ratio, so that as the room number goes up, you do not have increase the number of workers at the same proportion. Secondly, how to strengthen the Singaporean core? How to attract, develop, retain and improve quality of locals working in this sector?

2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"At the same time, we are helping them to become more lean and more productive. For example, rank and file workers in the hotel sector are now undergoing this process of multi-skilling, so that each person can perform more than one task, and thereby optimise the deployment of manpower, and along the way help them to enhance their wages. Another example would be through the use of RFID to strengthen the process of automation.",29,770,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00770

A mid-career PMET, who has been out of job for six months, can come under the CSP. We will help them to find employers. For the first year of his employment, under the CSP, we will subsidise wages of up to S$12,600 for that year for those older than 40.

At that time, he was feeling unsure whether will he be able to get a job that he was looking for. But today, he is a different person, confident and positive. Under the CSP, within one month, we helped him to find a good job with a local distributor of industrial lighting products to develop markets in ASEAN and East Asia.

Because Mr Chong looked at biologics as an emerging sector with tremendous potential. There is a rising demand for medicines in Asian markets. There is a good career progression path, where there is a HQ operation, manfacturing, or R&D in this sector. He read in public media that EDB has built up a healthy pipeline.

As a result, Mr Chong took a pay cut willingly. As I said, he was not retrenched, but he decided to take a pay cut to move from electronics to biologics. He has to take a pay cut, because he did not have any prior experience relevant to the sector. He was supported under PCP. He received a WSQ Higher Certification in Process technology, and he is now working as a Senior QA specialist.

We will include that under this Place-and-Train Programme. In addition to Place-and-Train, e2i and the career centres of WDA, also conduct career guidance, the one that Minister Ong Ye Kung mentioned earlier. We provide career guidance and every year, we conduct more than 200 job fairs to introduce more than 20,000 jobs to our jobseekers. Last year, we helped to place 11,000 rank-and-file workers.",59,800,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00800

He approached WDA Career Centre for career advice and career guidance, so we guided him to move into the areas of Workplace Safety and Health (WSH). He went on to receive a WSQ Certificate in WSH, followed by a WSQ Advanced Certificate in WSH. Today, he is working as a Safety Coordinator earning $2,200 – a big increase from $1,500.",60,801,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00801

The jobseekers are unsure about the job, and the employer is unsure about the worker. What do we do? We say, ""Never mind. Go on a work trial"". For 80 hours, WDA will pay a token allowance to the person. In other words, the employer does not have to pay anything. They work together for 80 hours just to try it out. It is for the workers to try out the job, and for the employer to try out the worker.",61,802,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00802

She wanted to try out the early childhood sector, but she was not sure if this sector was suitable for her. We put her under the Work Trial. After 80 hours, she decided that, yes, this is a career that she is interested in. And yes, the companies in this sector also found her suitable.

So besides workshops, seminars, recruitment events, job fairs, we are going to introduce e-services. For example, e2i is now trying out this concept of virtual job fairs. This is a job fair but it does not happen in the real world; it is in the virtual world. They help the jobseekers to submit not resumes, but ""Visume"".",65,806,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00806
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"I asked them what is the difference between resumes and ""Visumes"". They say ""Visumes"" stands for video resumes. What it means is that the e2i will help the jobseeker to do a video recording of how the person will describe himself, present his resume in the video form and they will send this video to the prospective employer. The prospective employer will look at it over the virtual world, on the Internet. Apparently, the response has been quite positive, so e2i intends to do more.",66,807,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00807
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"WDA, likewise, is going to introduce more e-career services, such as online matching, as well as online forum communities. We will also improve our information support for both employers and the jobseekers. The National Jobs Bank does contain a lot of useful information.

This was a point brought up by Patrick Tay. We are going to work with them closer to understand the current placement practices, and to see how can we work with them, encourage or to regulate the industry in such a way that they will step up and pay more attention to the placement of local PMETs. We are going to partner with the ""best-in-class"" placement companies, for example, those with industry specialisation or those who are jobseeker-centric.",69,810,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00810

The Singapore Workforce today is made up of two-third locals and one-third foreign manpower.

Call after call. Why? Because quality investments are very hard to come by. Competition is global. The better the investment, the stronger the competition, the stronger the competitors, the higher the demand of the investors. The toughest demand of all, for Singapore, to meet, is not land or water, but manpower.",76,817,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00817

We knew that one day, the disk drives sector will go through major restructuring. We needed to find a new growth sector.",77,818,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00818
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Twenty years ago, we identified wafer fabrication industry as the next growth industry. Each plant costs about US$1 billion to build. Each plant is water intensive and uses 1 million gallon (1 mgd) of water every day. But fortunately, we have NEWater. So, today, they are all supplied with NEWater. But most importantly, each plant will need 1,000 workers – 500 PMETs and 500 Production Specialists. Our local manpower is good, but we do not have enough, in terms of the range of expertise, experience and most of all, in number. We just do not have the number.",78,819,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00819
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"As a result, we worked with these investors to borrow PMETs, to borrow workers from around the world, bring them into Singapore so that we can bridge three manpower gaps that we face − the number gap, the capability gap and the timing gap.

2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"So, having foreign manpower in our Singapore workforce is a plus for us, not because Singaporeans are not good but because we simply do not have enough in number, in readiness and in diversity of capabilities to meet the needs of the global investors and to beat the offers of the other global competitors.",82,823,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00823

The demands from investors will only get higher, especially on manpower. We stand a better chance of beating the competition, winning good investments and jobs if our local and foreign manpower here work together as one Singapore workforce − two-thirds plus one-third, as one Singapore workforce rather than as two competing workforces − two-thirds versus one-third. Because remember two-thirds versus one-third will always be less than one. At the end of the day, we must recognise that the real competition is out there globally, not in here locally.",83,824,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00824

So, these two sectors have the highest 37%, 38%. All other sectors, all other industries, the ratio of foreign to local counterparts is less than one to two. Less than one-third. All the other sectors, less than one-third. You must also bear in mind that the growth of EP has also slowed down, from 32,000 in 2011 to 9,000 last year.

Yet, there is a perception among some Singaporeans that ""Why am I a minority in my workplace, working here in Singapore? Why?"" I think the answer is because of what I call the pockets of ""EP concentration"" in some companies, in some segments of the industry and at some locations. This is highly undesirable.",86,827,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00827
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"These pockets of ""EP concentration"" have led to the perception of liberal intake of EPs, which is not the case, or accusation of unfair consideration for locals or discrimination against our local PMETs. I am also concerned that some of these employers may have violated the ""Employment of Foreign Manpower Regulations"", which require companies to take, and let me quote  ""…reasonable efforts to provide fair employment opportunities to citizens of Singapore, including efforts to attract and consider such citizens for employment or to train them and develop their careers and potential in the workplace"".

At TAFEP's recommendation, they will be placed on our ""watchlist"", not because we are anti-foreigner but because their behaviour has added to the deepening of ""local-foreign"" divide in our Singapore workforce.

TAFEP is engaging them to improve their HR practices and will do a company-by-company review in six months. So far, these firms have been broadly cooperative. Some of them have acknowledged that there is room to strengthen the Singaporean core, some have approached e2i/WDA to source for local PMETs through programmes, such as CSP and PCP, that I talked about.

Renewal of existing EPs, processing of new EP applications will be affected. Curtailment of work pass privilege will have serious consequences on their continued operations and growth in Singapore.

2016-04-08-T-003,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"However, there are two key problems with existing schemes. First, a lack of enforcement measures. While the Government has in the implementation of FCF recognised the existence of ""double weak"" firms, firms that are found to have flouted the rules will only have their work pass privileges curtailed. A second problem the low take-up rates of voluntary schemes. To-date, 4,439 organisations have signed the employer's pledge by TAFEP but with 9,106 manufacturing establishments and another 58,784 services establishment in 2014, TAFEP's coverage does not seem substantive.",2,864,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00864

2016-04-08-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"The Lean Enterprise Development (LED) Scheme is a welcome initiative, to help businesses adapt to a manpower-lean landscape and incentivise the development of a skilled Singaporean core. However, not many businesses seem ready or willing to take on this challenge. Would the Ministry share what has been done so far under the LED Scheme to encourage and support business transformation, and what more can be done, given the current business environment? How could the Ministry work closer with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to speed up the take-up rate?",2,870,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00870
2016-04-08-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"I am glad that the Government is introducing a new SME Working Capital Loan scheme to co-share with participating financial institutions 50% of the default risk of loans up to $300,000 per SME. Total business loans fell 3.5% year-on-year in January to $357 billion and SME loan growth is expected to be a low- to mid-single digit this year. This is understandable as the rising level of non-performing loans last year was a problem for Singapore banks. SMEs struggle to secure loans, some due to their short credit history and others due to a lack of collateral. This lack of capital is stifling businesses and hampering innovation in our economy. Will co-sharing of default risk change the bank's risk appetite in this business climate? Since it is an equal sharing of risk, will there be an appeal process through MOM if the SMEs could not obtain the loans from the banks?",3,871,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00871
2016-04-08-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"SMEs may also need smaller loans over shorter periods of time which banks may not be able to finance. It is heartening to note that recently, crowd-funding sites have sprung up to meet this need of matching individual investors with small companies that require funds. The loans are more likely to be approved and are processed more quickly than at banks.",4,872,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00872

2016-04-08-T-003,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Could the Ministry consider legislating the right to request for flexible work arrangements? Employees have the legal right to make a request in a reasonable manner for a flexible work arrangement which can range from changes to hours, work patterns or locations of work. In the United Kingdom, an employer can be taken to a tribunal if they do not handle the request in a reasonable manner and there is a good business reason to do so.",4,877,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00877

How can we enhance the Grant to improve the take-up rate of FWA? What other measures have the Ministry implemented or is planning to implement to extend the adoption of FWA? Can the Government and the GLCs take the lead? Currently, we have the Tripartite Advisory on the FWA.

2016-04-08-T-003,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Incentives are low and insufficient to encourage the utilisation of FWA. The current FWA set up is entirely dependent on employers' voluntary initiative. Giving employees the right to apply for the Work-Life Grant to fashion and take up FWAs in their companies with their employers incentivised by the Government grant to accept, can overcome employees' inertia to FWA adoption. After employees initiate such applications, employers can refuse a request on reasonable business grounds but must discuss options available with the employees with the Ministry acting as facilitator.",2,880,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00880
2016-04-08-T-003,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Another thing that the Ministry could consider under the Work-Life Grant is to promote all-roles flex for larger Singapore companies. Last year, PriceWaterhouse Coopers Australia extended flexible working to all 6,000 employees. In all-roles flex, employees' performance rather than actual face time and hours spent working become the most important criterion for work evaluation. Vesting employees, such flexibility allows them to be at their best, fosters happy families so that employees can focus on their work and therefore, positively impacts productivity.",3,881,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00881

2016-04-08-T-003,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Majority of our companies are SMEs and they may not have adequate resources for comprehensive workplace safety measures. Some of the challenges they face include lack of expertise in workplace safety and the significant financial costs involved. Can MOM do more to encourage and support our SMEs in assessing and managing workplace safety more effectively?,5,908,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00908
2016-04-08-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Chairman, as mentioned in my Budget speech, I believe the Government should put in more effort to track under-employment. Let me highlight three areas.",1,909,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00909
2016-04-08-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, the Government could put into its headline numbers not just the employment and unemployment rates but two other indicators it is already gathering. For some years, the Government has been publishing some statistics on ""time-related under-employment"", showing the hours worked versus the hours that the employees are available and willing to work. The Government also gathers data on ""discouraged workers"", namely, those who have given up the job search. Headlining time-related under-employment and the numbers of discouraged workers will focus public attention to these two important statistics that are not captured in the employment and unemployment headlines.",2,910,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00910
2016-04-08-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, while I accept that measuring under-employment by time is probably the only internationally-accepted measure, we know that working less hours is just one aspect of under-employment. How can we measure under-employment where a person is being under-utilised in terms of his earning capacity? Could we consider collecting data on income earned versus median income for that qualification and age, or perhaps compared with previous income?",3,911,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00911
2016-04-08-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thirdly, it has been noted in the United States that in the last decade, the growth of temporary and contract jobs has surged with the proportion of Americans working as independent contractors soaring. In Singapore, according to the Ministry's report on the Labour Force 2015, there were 202,000 contract workers. Does this figure capture all those who are on contract, freelance or ad-hoc work arrangements? Can we expect such alternative work arrangements to increase, given the uncertain economy, the need for employers to manage costs and the automation of jobs? If so, there will be more Singaporeans facing issues such as poor job security, intermittent CPF contributions and little or no medical benefits. Are we adequately measuring the number of Singaporeans who are under-employed in this way?",4,912,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00912
2016-04-08-T-003,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Mr Chairman, thank you. Today, I must say I have learned a lot from Minister Lim. There are so many terms – PCP, CSP, LED.

2016-04-08-T-003,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Those in the middle-aged category, who are skilled and possess tertiary educational qualifications, generally struggle to be re-employed after being retrenched. A Straits Times report on 20 July last year reported that 57% of retrenched Singaporeans and permanent residents managed to be re-employed within the next six months – 57%. For the PME group within this retrenched lot, only 49% are able to find a job within the same period. This is lower than the lot average. For those aged 40 and above, within the same group, the re-entry rate was only 53%. This meant that roughly half of the older PMEs could not find a job within six months of being laid off, let alone finding one of comparable grade and salary.",3,915,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00915
2016-04-08-T-003,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),The NTUC PME Centre saw a jump of 265 cases of PMEs looking for assistance in employment and employability – from 253 cases in 2014 to 518 from March 2015 to February 2016. It is worrisome that 77% of the PMEs looking for re-employment were aged 40 and above.,4,916,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00916
2016-04-08-T-003,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Losing one's job through retrenchment can be a devastating experience, if not traumatic. The affected worker may lose his or her self-esteem and self- confidence. It could lead to health issues when one's mental state is not at rest. For the family breadwinner, this is unthinkable.",5,917,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00917
2016-04-08-T-003,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"Here, I would like to qualify that I appreciate all these safety nets that MOM has put in place. What I am going to propose here is not to undermine what has been done, but I thought it would complement the whole safety net framework.",6,918,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00918
2016-04-08-T-003,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"To cushion the impending tough and challenging experience, I would like to propose a Temporary Income Shield (TIS), an insurance scheme that is modelled after the MediShield. TIS is for those who have lost their job due to retrenchment, resulting in an immediate loss of income. It is meant to cushion the impact, providing continuity to their daily life and mitigate potential disruption to their children's educational progress and the well-being of their elderly parents.",7,919,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00919
2016-04-08-T-003,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"The proposed scheme is progressively decreasing in nature, that is, the pay-out is calibrated downwards towards zero at the end of a four-month period after being laid off. How does it work? For the first month, he/she receives 75% of his/her last drawn salary. In the second and third month, it is 50% of his/her last drawn salary and, the fourth month, which is the final month, it is 25% of his/her last drawn salary. Knowing it is going to go down, it will give him the urgency to find a new job. So, this is the proposal I have. The last drawn salary is capped at $6,000. That is the proposal I have. Of course, we can discuss further the details.",8,920,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00920
2016-04-08-T-003,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"During the four-month period, the worker is encouraged to take up new skills to help him/her gain re-employment. All other existing schemes are made available. Upon re- employment, the TIS scheme will be terminated automatically. On the other hand, the scheme will lapse after four months, even if the worker has not gained any employment. It is just a temporary cushion given to the worker.",9,921,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00921
2016-04-08-T-003,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"I would like to suggest that the scheme is offered to all working and salaried employees with a monthly income of not more than $10,000, and the payable insurance premium is to be made from the worker's monthly CPF contribution. The usage of CPF contributions towards this TIS scheme is just an expansion to its purpose to supplement the workers in times of dire need, such as medical, housing, education, retirement and, in this case, unforeseeable loss of income.",10,922,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00922
2016-04-08-T-003,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),"I acknowledge that this idea is not a new one. It is similar to others which have been raised before. Like I mentioned in my speech in the Budget Debate, as the old economy gets replaced by a new one, job redundancy and obsolescence are inevitable. I salute the Government for taking proactive and constructive measures for our workers through re-training and reskilling. I believe we should continue to explore all possibilities, especially so when I reckon this issue will be with us for many more years to come. I also believe it is going to get tougher with each passing year.",11,923,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00923

This will be especially helpful to many women who ""work"" at home as the primary care-giver of their families, with no paid wages and little retirement savings. So, this is going to be very helpful to them.",1,926,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00926

2016-04-08-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"However, how much does the average Singaporean understand of the CPF scheme in order to fully leverage its benefits? Other than a small group of financially-savvy individuals, it is not easy for most of us to remember the different tiers of interest rates offered in the different accounts, as well as the different rules that apply, so that we can optimise our own savings and those of our family members.",3,928,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00928
2016-04-08-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, I think the instinctive solution to this problem is to recommend that the Government launch a comprehensive education campaign, but I would admit that this will not be an easy task, given the complexity of the system. Furthermore, we should consider some learnings from the field of behavioural finance. Drawing on the research of psychology of decision-making, behavioural finance argues that many financial phenomena are the result of less than fully rational thinking on the part of the participants. Behavioural finance helps explain sub-optimal trading and investment behaviours. The science of behavioural finance is already applied to understand asset pricing, investor behaviour and corporate finance.",4,929,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00929
2016-04-08-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, I urge the CPF Advisory Panel to consider applying behavioural finance in Part II of their work to help guide optimisation of CPF savings. MOM should study carefully the patterns of transaction of CPF members and take a very proactive role to help members to fully optimise the benefits of the CPF scheme.",5,930,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00930
2016-04-08-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"For example, since January 2016, CPF members can transfer CPF savings above the Basic Retirement Sum to their spouse's Special Retirement Account instead of the previous Full Retirement Sum. This change means couples stand to benefit significantly if they have varying levels of CPF savings between them. The savings enhancement for a couple can be substantial if the husband transfers, for example, some of his eligible CPF funds to top up the low balance retirement account of his wife, which now attracts 6% for the first $30,000, and 5% for the next $30,000. Overall, in Singapore, we are still seeing a gap of 14% in CPF balances between male and female members. But I believe that even though it is still early days − just implemented − thus far, very few CPF members that I have spoken to have thought about this, let alone take action to enhance their savings in this way.",6,931,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00931
2016-04-08-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"I would like to repeat a request that I had raised during last year's COS, that the Minister consider providing ""auto sweep"" functions for CPF members to transfer their savings to their spouse's account to top up to Basic Retirement Sum. CPF members who do not wish to participant can opt out, but they should be helped by a statement explaining how much less they will get as a couple if they do so. This approach may help result in more couples benefiting from the extra interest rates, which will be particularly welcome for lower balances.",7,932,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00932
2016-04-08-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, CPF is a great savings scheme. We must do our very best to ensure all Singaporeans can take full advantage of it.",8,933,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00933

The payouts are meant to provide a modest but meaningful supplement to their retirement incomes in support of the bottom 20% to 30% of Singaporean seniors. I welcome this support.",1,934,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00934
2016-04-08-T-003,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"I would like to reiterate our earlier calls for Silver Support payments to be made monthly instead of quarterly. With monthly payouts and a more consistent liquidity that they provide, the elderly will be better able to manage their day-to-day expenses. Would behavioural economics suggest that making the payouts monthly could even nurture the seniors to use more of the payouts to pay for those significant living expenses that are incurred monthly, such as utility bills and others? If they were to do so, it will help them better manage their limited cash flow.",2,935,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00935
2016-04-08-T-003,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"I hope the Minister will also consider adjusting the amounts of future payouts for inflation, perhaps at the start of every term of Government, to ensure that the support our needy seniors receive keeps up with the rising cost of living.",3,936,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00936
2016-04-08-T-003,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"As Members have said in many different ways, I hope that a degree of flexibility can be built into the eligibility considerations of the payout scheme involving the three criteria of lifetime wages, housing types and household support. I appreciate that clear-cut rules and a high degree of administrative efficiency may be required to deliver Silver Support to needy seniors in large enough numbers. However, balanced against that consideration is, of course, our hope that specific needy seniors who deserve support do not fall through the cracks of rigid eligibility criteria.

The question we ask ourselves is  why is the productivity index not going up as well? Productivity schemes and grants cover a wide area. They have breadth, but not the depth.

2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),We have studied all the applications and proposals and we found that there are three commonalties in this whole development and in their proposals.,19,963,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00963
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"First, they centralise a lot of their operations. What this means is that they share facilities among groups of companies. More than 10 companies coming forward and saying, ""let us come together, take our basic processes and centralise them"", thereby achieving some economies of scale and reducing wastage, and then through a hub-and-spoke kind of the network, they could do their own differentiation.",20,964,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00964
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"Second, they have an automation plan. This automation plan helps them to combine man and machine, as well as to put in machinery within a business process or operational process to make it more efficient. They also support job redesign and reduce lots of manpower wastage.",21,965,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00965
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"Thirdly and most importantly, they develop new skill sets, or enhance the skill development, especially for our local workforce. This imparting of new skills will align to our SkillsFuture vision and mission to enable locals to take on new types of jobs in future. So, if the company changes, the worker's job changes.",22,966,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00966
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"Let me give you an example. A good example comes from the Indian Restaurants Association (Singapore). Fourteen members of the Association collaborated to form a consortium. You are probably wondering how they can come together because they could be competitors as well. But they could, because they felt that there were some basic processes that were the same, and they could consolidate them. So, first, they achieved the objective of centralising shared services. The consortium will form a central processing unit, or a shared kitchen, where the basic processes will be centralised. Basic processes involve preparing the certain basic ingredients – onions, cabbage, vegetables and so on. Subsequently, these will be delivered to the restaurants' individual kitchens for their own recipe, so that they will prepare the dishes differently. That will differentiate their dishes.",23,967,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00967
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"Secondly, they will automate, putting in new types of machinery and equipment in the central kitchen. For some, automation will be done in their individual restaurants, in their individual kitchens. That helps to up-skill the workers too. The skill transfer is extremely important, because they are building a sustainable pipeline of local Indian cuisine chefs. They want to have that pipeline, but this involves skills transfer and capability development, and they need foreign chefs to come to Singapore to transfer skills and knowledge to locals during this transition.",24,968,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00968
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"So, MOM provides two years' flexibility to retain S Pass chefs beyond the company's foreign manpower quota. These chefs are needed to impart skills and knowledge to local trainees that can take on such better jobs in future. With a pipeline of skilled Singaporeans ready to take on critical roles, these foreign chefs will then be released once the transition has been achieved.",25,969,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00969
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"It is not easy to achieve such a manpower-lean state, and we are still going through the process. In fact, we only appointed the multipliers in January this year, and the scheme was only launched late last year. But we saw a lot of progress, and we want to work by sectors, clusters, and individual companies.",26,970,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00970
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"I fully agree with Mr Chong Kee Hiong, Mr Lee Yi Shyan and Mr Thomas Chua that more should be done to help more businesses to break these barriers and shift mindsets in order to achieve this. You have to think out of the box, change your mindsets to do so. But it takes the whole-of-Government as well to support such a transformation programme. This year's Budget has got a lot to do with Industry Transformation Programmes, and LED plays its part to do so.",27,971,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00971
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"LED also depends on good HR practices, and good HR practices require good HR and qualified HR professionals. In managing manpower and the workforce in a company, it has to go beyond HR. It has to go into human capital (HC). It is not just human resource, but human capital. There is a difference here, especially in the way we plan, and in managing the human resource within the company. HR is not just about plugging holes  when there is a job vacancy, you find a suitable person, you plug a hole here. A lot of times they are faced with situations which extend beyond recruitment, with retention for example. We need a strategic and longer term plan. Look at every single individual, not just as a factor of production, but as capital for investment. Invest in them early, even for our mature workers.",28,972,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00972
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"As Mr Thomas Chua has pointed out, companies will need to focus more on building and nurturing human capital, investing in identifying each employee's strengths and making the best use of differentiated talents. We have many good examples that did that, and many are SMEs. Sometimes, it is not about investing only in the young, but investing across the board – young and old.",29,973,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00973
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"Let me give you an example. ROHEI Corporation, a local corporate training SME consultancy, is one such SME. They advocate ""people above process"", often going out of their way to nurture and guide their employees towards achieving their life goals. When their senior consultants in their 50s expressed interest to master different skill sets and practices offered by the business, the company readily supported and guided them to acquire those skills, even though they were close to retirement age. They wanted to ensure that their wisdom and skills could combine together to help the company. This ensured that they could continue to value add, even in their golden years.",30,974,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00974

To upgrade the HR practices in the different sectors, we need to upgrade their learning process. We need to upgrade their certification process as well.",31,975,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00975

Over the last six months, the HR Sectoral Tripartite Committee has engaged over 150 stakeholders through six different engagement sessions.",32,976,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00976
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"One recurring feedback is that they felt the need for HR to evolve, to better support business strategy and to be more strategic, to think in the longer term, to be able to look at the macro view of the company – basically, to think like a CEO. They have to move from focusing on operational and transactional approaches, to a more strategic approach, to look at how the company moves forward, forecast its manpower needs in the future. Employers expect that HR professionals can better apply these skills and align them to the organisation goals, and so they cannot work in isolation. The HR strategy has to be integrated within the company. The committee is also recommending that we develop a pathway because of that requirement.",33,977,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00977

Also, they have to possess an understanding of local employment laws, regulations and practices.",34,978,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00978
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"It is not just certification. It is a progressive learning ladder as well.

HR professionals, once they have gone through the process, can then better support businesses and also enhance their value to the organisation.",35,979,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00979
2016-04-08-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"The work of the HR professionals has become more demanding. As the expectations increases from bosses to workers to everybody, sometimes, they are sandwiched in the middle. Many times, the expectation from the workers or the employees is about the work-to-personal time ratio. As Ms Jessica Tan had mentioned  how do you integrate that work and that life together? It is not easy to find that integration.",36,980,2016-04-08-T-003-S-00980

How do we keep that balance? The success of it depends on integration of different factors – for example, the perception of such a practice within the society, and employers' and co-workers' attitudes towards Flexible Work Arrangements. In other countries, Flexible Work Arrangements are usually fairly prevalent before this legislation. That will not stop us from taking a review as well as making sure that we continue the awareness and education campaign.

In the early years, older workers were less wage-competitive because of rigid seniority-based wages.

Although the increase is quite marginal but we are concerned, nonetheless. Just this year alone, we lost 22 lives at work, as mentioned by Mr Melvin Yong just now. That is 22 too many. In fact, personally, to me, every one fatality is just one too many. Accidents can be prevented.

What is even more encouraging is that it is on the decline. So, for example, in 2013, it was more than 4%, then 2014, it went below 4% and last year, 2015, it went below 3%. This has to do with the tight labour market that we face today.",8,1038,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01038

As regards to the share of discouraged workers in the resident workforce in 2015, it was stable and low at 0.4%. This is similar to the OECD countries.",9,1039,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01039
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"On the issue of contract workers and freelancers, Ms Sylvia Lim asked whether they are on the increase, whether they reflect a rise in under-employment. The percentage of workers on contract, that means they are working as employees but on contract, has dropped from 12.7% in 2009 to 11.3% last year. So, 12.7% dropped to 11.3%. In the case of freelancers, they are what we call the ""own account"" holders so they are like self-employed. They do not have employee-employer relationship. That percentage of the workforce has dropped from 9.2% to 7.9% over the same period, from 2009 to 2015. In other words, both employees on contract as well as freelancer as a percentage of the workforce have been on the decline. Now, the question is whether they choose to be in this situation − contract or freelancer, or they are forced to be in this position. On the part of MOM, what we are trying to do our best is that we offer them options. In other words, if they feel that they do not want to continue with their contract work or be freelancers, I hope they will step forward, take advantage of our CSP, our PCP, our PMax and all the other programmes that I talked about earlier.",10,1040,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01040

Our unemployment rates are low and our long-term unemployment rates are also low. At the same time, and this is something that is worth taking note, the practice of paying retrenchment benefits in Singapore is widespread. According to our latest survey, nine in 10 of the retrenching companies paid retrenchment benefits, and for the retrenched workers, likewise, nine in 10 received retrenchment benefits, including those from the non-unionised companies. It is a fairly standard practice in the industries and in Singapore today.",12,1042,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01042

The top priority for many workers is to go back to work. That is the reason why, earlier, I spent a lot of time going into a lot of details to explain the kind of options that we are offering to our workers.

The last time was at the recent review of the Employment Act, and they came to the conclusion that it is important to allow the employer and employees and unions to continue to have the flexibility to negotiate this, rather than prescribing it in the law. This is because the different retrenching companies are in different circumstances and therefore, it cannot be a one-size-fits-all rule.

Mr Chairman, firms which hire older workers currently benefit from the Special Employment Credit. A wage credit to firms we believe is a better way to incentivise the employers to hire more older workers and to keep them, rather than to give them a discount in foreign worker levy. This way, even firms without foreign workers can still benefit and be motivated to hire and retain our local older workers. Lowering the foreign worker levy may also lead to the unintentional outcome of these companies hiring more foreign workers, instead of keeping our older workers.",17,1047,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01047

What I would do is that I would, together with CPF, step up the effort to create greater awareness in the community so that, hopefully, we get more and more members of the community to be fully aware of this additional interest that they can benefit from.

The Minister for Finance has explained this in the Budget. Unlike Workfare, Workfare was given for work done earlier. Workfare was paid after the work was done. In the case of Silver Support, we have decided to pay in advance. So, we are paying quarterly payments in advance. For example, in January, he will get the Silver Support for the next three months. I appreciate Mr Chen's point that if it is paid out monthly, hopefully that will help to manage their finance better. I agree. But on balance, between giving them the money in advance to facilitate better liquidity versus giving it monthly to enforce them to spread the spending over three months, I think on balance, the decision on advance payment quarterly would probably be more beneficial, given the flexibility.",20,1050,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01050

We explained to them that the purpose of retirement age, the purpose of re-employment age, is to protect the workers, give the workers the right to work. In other words, employers cannot simply ""complete"" the employment before the worker reaches the retirement age, and now the re-employment age.

Companies would have to comply with the law.",1,1066,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01066

2016-04-08-T-003,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan,"Two questions for the Minister, Sir. One is on the active intervention, that he had explained that the Ministry is taking in the labour market to deal with certain large number of cases of retrenchment where the Ministry has stepped in to match the cases of retrenched workers based on different initiatives that the Ministry has thrown up. I think that this is very good and I urge the Ministry to continue doing it. But in specific cases where his Ministry has identified gaps in the market, the reasons why the matching cannot take place, his Ministry has been able to plug those gaps. Will his Ministry, therefore, be seeing to it that the market can ultimately take on this role, such as human resource agencies, can ultimately take on this role, so that the Ministry can continue to be active on other areas?",1,1070,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01070
2016-04-08-T-003,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan,The second question really is to reflect my concerns that we should not let the pendulum swing to the other extreme and then see a certain wave of criminalisation of employers. I know that is obviously not —,2,1071,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01071

2016-04-08-T-003,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan,"So, my question is  are we going too far in the opposite direction?",1,1073,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01073
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mr Chairman, I thank Assoc prof Randolph Tan for the two points. Firstly, on the issue of retrenchment, whether the MOM is overly active in helping the retrenched workers. First, the answer is a yes. We are very active. For example, right now, whenever we receive a notice of retrenchment, a task force will actually move in. We will engage the companies and ask the companies to provide us with information of who are the workers, how many will be affected and in terms of the job profile, how many are PMETs, how many are rank-and-file workers, and for each of these groups what the ages, background, and so on. And then, the other programmes will come in, like the CSP, PCP, and we will talk to the workers, introduce them to these schemes and bring them in. The objective is to help them to go back to work as quickly as possible, both the PMETs and the rank-and-file workers.",1,1074,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01074
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Increasingly, the job matching is going to go beyond WDA and e2i. Earlier, I mentioned that we intend to engage our Employment Agency industry more. Because we believe that they too can have a role to play. Progressively, we want to engage more of these private placement companies to be our partners, so that when there is a retrenchment exercise, especially for the PMETs, we can get them to help us too to place them. I will say that, on the whole, maybe we are doing too much compared to many other places. But I must say that it is something which is very close to the hearts of the tripartite partners – NTUC, e2i and WDA. We do feel very strongly that whatever we can do, we must help them. The weakness in our market today, is we feel that the Employment Agency market is not job seeker-centric and so, their objective is really to help the companies find workers. What we end up with is that the less employable workers are the ones who could end up taking a long time. That is why we want make sure that we do our best to support them.",2,1075,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01075
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"On the question of action taken again employers, whether we are swinging too much, I am very mindful of that. In fact, earlier in my address, I emphasised very clearly that as Singapore moves forward, we must both become even more pro-business as we become more pro-worker. The two have to be the two sides of the same coin. Because if we are pro-business and not pro-worker, we can have a strong economy but weak Singaporean core. Or if you are too pro-worker and not pro-business enough, we can have a strong Singaporean core but a weak economy. So, both ways will not enable us to succeed in our growth.",3,1076,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01076
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"That is the reason why MOM is very mindful that we will always strike a balance between pro-business and pro-worker. If there is a ""triple weak"", then there must be a ""triple strong"", and the two must go hand-in-hand. For the ""tripe weak"", so far we are starting with only the outliers. In other words, we look at sector by sector. We look at each sector and we look at all the companies in the sector that employ Employment Pass (EP) workers and plot them in terms of their strength of their Singaporean core. We can see a spread − industry norm somewhere in the centre, the ""triple strong"" in the extreme right, and the ""triple weak"" in the extreme left. What we are doing is that we are taking all these outliers, engage them and take action against them. Hopefully, by sending this clear messaging, the rest will start to gravitate more towards the centre over time.",4,1077,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01077
2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"We are very mindful that we have to strike a balance because, at the end of the day, if we swing too much to, as the Member said, against the employers, eventually we will be hurt.

2016-04-08-T-003,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"I always remember what our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew said. He said that in nation building, we must have three pillars, and this is what we call the Singapore software. The first pillar is that our economy must always be competitive. Because if our economy is not competitive, all of us will be poor together. However, always be mindful that competitiveness in an economy is only a means to the end. The end objective is social progress and social well-being, and employment is the best way for our people to benefit in its progress. And lastly, he also mentioned the third pillar, and the most difficult pillar, is sustainable development. You can be pro-business today to ensure the economy is competitive. You can be pro-people, pro-worker today, to ensure the society will be cohesive, we will have social progress, but how do you strike a balance in such a way that we can sustain our development for the long term.",7,1080,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01080

Three years or five years from now, there could be something else, not because we have done something wrong in the past but rather because we keep striking that dynamic balance between the two.",8,1081,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01081

For example, he may have his own contacts to explore or he may want to become an entrepreneur, and so on. I wonder if the Minister could give his views on whether there is still a place for some safety nets for these workers who may not fit so quickly into your schemes such as the PCP and the CSP. In fact, these may not be the best thing for them. That there is actually a place, perhaps, for some safety nets for such workers in the form of some sort of redundancy or unemployment insurance.",2,1085,2016-04-08-T-003-S-01085

2016-04-08-T-005,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mr Chairman, I agree fully with the first part but not the second part. The first part, the Member talked about, for example, some of the retrenched workers who may have their own options in terms of becoming entrepreneurs and so on, that I fully agree. In fact, just recently, a business entity approached MOM and came up with this idea. His idea was whether under our Professional Conversion Programme (PCP), besides converting a person from one profession to another profession, or within a sector, whether we can also allow someone to be converted from a profession to become an entrepreneur. His organisation – at this moment I am not ready to disclose any information – is prepared to step forward to play a role. Because when a person becomes an entrepreneur, there are many things he needs. He may need advice on how to run a business, he may need capital to start his business, and so on. So, I would say that this is an idea worth exploring. As I said, I fully agree with her first part.",1,1088,2016-04-08-T-005-S-01088

Our belief is that right now, given the context that we have, low long-term unemployment, high incidence rate of paying retrenchment benefits, and I think our priority right now is to help them to go back to work as quickly as possible. In the future, hopefully, we can also include this entrepreneurship as one of the alternatives, something that I am very keen to work on.",2,1089,2016-04-08-T-005-S-01089
