2015-05-11-T-001-S-00001,2015-05-11-T-001,1,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,asked  the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will provide an update on the assistance that Singapore has rendered to Nepal following the earthquake on 25 April 2015.
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00002,2015-05-11-T-001,2,Ang Wei Neng,asked  the Minister for Foreign Affairs what is the assistance which Singapore has rendered to Nepal to help Nepal recover from the recent earthquake that took place on 25 April 2015.
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00003,2015-05-11-T-001,3,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"<strong style=""background-color  transparent; color  rgb(0, 0, 0);"">(for the Minister for Foreign Affairs) </strong> Mdm Speaker, may I take Question Nos 1 and 2 together, please?"
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00004,2015-05-11-T-001,4,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00005,2015-05-11-T-001,5,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thank you. Mdm Speaker, within hours of receiving the shocking and sad news, the Singapore Government mobilised a disaster relief team for deployment to Nepal in aid of relief efforts. The Home Team mounted its largest-ever deployment for an overseas disaster relief operation. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) formed ""Operation Lionheart (Nepal, Earthquake)"" – the 14th such Lionheart mission – comprising a 60-member search-and-rescue team. In addition, a 66-member strong Singapore Police Force (SPF) contingent, including Gurkha Contingent (GC) officers, was also deployed to Nepal."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00006,2015-05-11-T-001,6,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the course of the deployment, the SCDF and SPF contingents operated in several areas in Nepal, such as Lalitpur district around Kathmandu, Pokhara and Gorkha. The SCDF and SPF contingents worked with the Nepalese authorities and other foreign teams to provide humanitarian assistance, including search-and-rescue, relief aid and medical assistance, to the affected people, with the GC officers helping to facilitate relief operations as they were familiar with the language, terrain and local communities. MFA also despatched a four-person Crisis Response Team to Kathmandu to provide consular assistance to Singaporeans stranded in Nepal. Our Embassy in New Delhi also sent an officer to support the team subsequently."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00007,2015-05-11-T-001,7,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"At the same time, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) immediately mobilised a joint medical team of 22 personnel and an advance team of six personnel from the Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) Coordination Centre or RHCC. C-130 aircraft were also deployed to airlift the personnel, equipment and relief supplies into Kathmandu."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00008,2015-05-11-T-001,8,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"A further six personnel from the Changi RHCC were deployed together with additional medical supplies. Eight members of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces and seven members from the Ministry of Health (MOH) were also deployed together with the SAF's medical team. The combined medical team, to date, treated more than 3,000 patients. The RHCC assisted the Nepalese national disaster management authorities and military with their efforts to coordinate the relief efforts. Eleven sorties have been flown in and out of Kathmandu by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), transporting more than 100 tonnes of equipment and relief supplies, various Singapore contingents, as well as evacuating Singaporeans from Nepal."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00009,2015-05-11-T-001,9,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, the officers involved in this disaster relief effort have worked tirelessly, often times under trying conditions. I would like to express my appreciation to all of them for their dedication and hard work, and to their family members for their support."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00010,2015-05-11-T-001,10,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition to mobilising our assets, the Singapore Government contributed a total of S$250,000 through the Singapore Red Cross (SRC). An initial S$100,000 was given as seed money to help kick-start the SRC donation drive. However, as news of the severity and scale of the disaster became clearer and there were increasing calls for international aid, we increased our contribution by another S$150,000, to support the SRC's efforts to purchase emergency supplies. To date, SRC has raised more than S$4.5 million, sent 14 personnel, including two medical teams with a total of 11 personnel, and S$200,000 worth of emergency supplies and relief items including food, household kits and shelter tool kits to Nepal."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00011,2015-05-11-T-001,11,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This financial contribution complements the on-going efforts by Singaporeans and Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) to raise funds for the relief efforts in Nepal. Many Singaporeans have been moved by the tragedy. They have dug deep into their pockets and contributed generously. Other NGOs including Mercy Relief and religious organisations have also raised more than S$800,000 to date, with many of them mounting medical and humanitarian missions to Nepal. The government of Nepal has expressed appreciation for Singapore's assistance and support to Nepal and the Nepalese people."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00012,2015-05-11-T-001,12,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to assure the House that in the midst of these relief efforts, the Government also spared no effort in looking after the welfare of Singaporeans affected by the disaster in Nepal."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00013,2015-05-11-T-001,13,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MFA's Crisis Response Team arrived in Kathmandu within a day to assist Singaporeans wishing to return home. MINDEF facilitated the return of 71 Singaporeans, along with 24 other nationals, on the returning C-130 aircraft. Throughout the crisis, MFA continued to reach out to Singaporeans in Nepal to render assistance and within five days of the earthquake, accounted for the safety of all Singaporeans who eRegistered with MFA."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00014,2015-05-11-T-001,14,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, one takeaway for me from this crisis is  help us to help yourselves. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to encourage Singaporeans travelling overseas to eRegister so that we can contact you or your Next-of-Kin promptly in the event of a crisis."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00015,2015-05-11-T-001,15,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As for Mr Ang's question of what assistance Singapore has rendered to help Nepal recover, at present, international efforts are still focused on disaster relief and humanitarian aid. We will continue to do what is within our means to assist and support Nepal during this difficult time."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00016,2015-05-11-T-001,16,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, I would also like to express our deepest condolences to the government and people of Nepal during this difficult period, and to extend comfort to the families of our Gurkha contingent in Singapore."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00017,2015-05-11-T-001,17,Speaker,Ms Irene Ng.
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00018,2015-05-11-T-001,18,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Thank you, Madam. It is heartening to see how readily Singapore responded to the disaster in Nepal. I would like to ask the Second Minister this  now that the disaster relief phase is coming to an end, how would Singapore contribute to the long-term reconstruction phase that follows? Nepal is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world and needs international support to carry on its work to reconstruct the whole country. Singapore has expertise in various areas, especially in master-planning and housing. Can I ask the Second Minister if Singapore would be contributing to the reconstruction efforts in Nepal?"
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00019,2015-05-11-T-001,19,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"It is clear that the disaster in Nepal has taken a very big toll on the Nepalese as well as on the country. At this point in time, as I mentioned, an assessment has not been made. The Nepalese are still asking for help in humanitarian aid, and the outpouring has not been coordinated. Until such time, we do not want to pre-empt the kind of aid that is needed."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00020,2015-05-11-T-001,20,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In the same way, too, when the relief and rescue work was done, not everything that went into the place were things that the Nepalese needed. So, when the international community comes together to help them with reconstruction, Singapore will do our part to contribute expertise in a way that we can, and not over-extend ourselves so that we do not over-reach what we can do as a nation."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00021,2015-05-11-T-001,21,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But we should also not discount the public in Singapore, and NGOs such as Mercy Relief as well as SRC, to extend their help also, in the development and rebuilding of Nepal."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00022,2015-05-11-T-001,22,Ang Wei Neng,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Second Minister for the comprehensive reply. Firstly, I want to offer my condolences to the Nepal citizens who have lost their loved ones in this earthquake and also congratulate and thank our Singapore team members – Singapore Police Force officers, SCDF officers, and SAF officers – for doing a great job in Nepal. I also feel for the Singaporeans who were affected by the earthquake in Nepal."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00023,2015-05-11-T-001,23,Ang Wei Neng,"I understand the Second Minister had answered that we would look at what kind of effort we could provide Nepal in due time. However, I would specifically like to ask the Second Minister would the Government consider assisting Nepal to rebuild parts of the destroyed areas, similar to what we have done for Aceh."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00024,2015-05-11-T-001,24,Ang Wei Neng,"Secondly, I would like to ask the Second Minister how MFA kept in touch with the Singapore Mount Everest Climbing team after the 25 April earthquake. What advice did MFA give to the team when the team initially decided to carry on with their climb despite extensive damages in Kathmandu and the risk of avalanche in the mountain areas? I understand the team only decided to end its mission on 29 April, four days after the earthquake."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00025,2015-05-11-T-001,25,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Member for the question. As I mentioned, it is too early to pre-empt the kind of aid that we should be giving to Nepal or whether to scale it to the kind of aid that we gave to Aceh. Clearly, even in Aceh, all our NGOs played a very big part, because they were our good neighbours, they had connections, and sometimes, NGOs can do a better job than governments."
2015-05-11-T-001-S-00026,2015-05-11-T-001,26,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In terms of the expedition by Singaporeans who went there, they were in very close touch with the authorities, as well as the base communications. At times, they also communicated personally with me. We always assured them that if they needed to get help, if they had the wherewithal to do it, they will be supported. You must remember that the Everest base camp was also part of the disaster area. Many people, climbers, also died there. It was a very difficult terrain. Despite that, arrangements were made, they came out, went back to Kathmandu, and they are now back in Singapore. So, we are really thankful for the efforts they have made to fly the Singapore flag, to get up to the peak of Everest, to celebrate SG50. Unfortunately, they did not achieve it but in the process, they knew what was more important – to keep safe, to make sure that they can come back safely and without harm to themselves, and hopefully, one day, they can pursue their dreams."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00027,2015-05-11-T-002,27,Christopher de Souza,"asked  the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether he can provide an update on the progress of preparations for the 28th Southeast Asian Games to be held in June 2015; (b) what is the number of sports that will be featured; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider having a special exhibition accessible to SEA Games participants and the public that showcases Singapore's relations with its ASEAN neighbours over the past 50 years."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00028,2015-05-11-T-002,28,Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, we started planning for the Games three years ago. Preparations for the event are currently in full swing and progressing well. Over the past few weeks, we have carried out several events at the various competition venues to test-run our systems and processes."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00029,2015-05-11-T-002,29,Lawrence Wong,
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00030,2015-05-11-T-002,30,Lawrence Wong,"Based on the experience of past SEA Games, the focus during the Games tends to be on the athletes and the competitions. For this reason, we do not think it will be so useful to have a dedicated exhibition on Singapore's relation with our ASEAN neighbours. Instead, we will find different ways to highlight this throughout the Games. For example, it can be done in the Opening Ceremony, or it can be done through social media platforms where we can promote ASEAN and our relations in ASEAN."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00031,2015-05-11-T-002,31,Lawrence Wong,
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00032,2015-05-11-T-002,32,Lawrence Wong,"The SEA Games in Singapore will feature 36 sports and around 400 events, as well as about 10,000 athletes and officials. We are also planning to field Team Singapore's largest-ever contingent, with 748 athletes representing Singapore in the Games. Our athletes are training intensively; I have spoken to many of them. They have told me that they are determined to do their best, and to do Singapore proud. In their preparatory and qualifying competitions in the run-up to the Games, many athletes have posted outstanding performances, achieved new personal bests, and broken long-standing national records. What remains is for Singaporeans to come forward to attend the Games with family and friends, to cheer for our Team Singapore athletes. While being gracious hosts to our Southeast Asian friends, let us also make the home ground advantage for Team Singapore count by being the to cheer our athletes on."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00033,2015-05-11-T-002,33,Lawrence Wong,
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00034,2015-05-11-T-002,34,Lawrence Wong,"At the end of the day, it is the support and encouragement of all Singaporeans that will determine whether we have an extraordinary Games, one that is worthy of our Golden Jubilee."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00035,2015-05-11-T-002,35,Lee Bee Wah,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister what is the status of ticket sales."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00036,2015-05-11-T-002,36,Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, the ticket sales are progressing well. It is somewhat uneven. There are some events which are very popular; I think if you are planning to buy a ticket for the Opening Ceremony, I am sorry to say that tickets have probably been sold out. And if you are going for very popular games like the water polo finals, that event is also sold out; swimming events, very popular. Certain events have been very popular. Some are still progressing slowly, steadily, partly because the fixtures have just been announced. For example, football fixtures were just announced; and some other sports, the fixtures had just been announced. It may take a bit more time."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00037,2015-05-11-T-002,37,Lawrence Wong,"But I would say that, based on past experience, compared to other games and other sporting events, the ticket sales so far have been better than expected, compared to previous events. We will continue to encourage all Singaporeans to, like I said earlier, take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to support Team Singapore on home ground in a new competition venue like the Sports Hub."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00038,2015-05-11-T-002,38,Lawrence Wong,"It is true that we will host the SEA Games again 20-something years later because all the Southeast Asian countries will take turns every two years. But we will never have another SEA Games hosted in our Golden Jubilee Year like this. So, this is a historic opportunity and I would encourage all Singaporeans to come and support Team Singapore."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00039,2015-05-11-T-002,39,David Ong,"Thank you, Madam. Some quick supplementary questions for the Minister."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00040,2015-05-11-T-002,40,David Ong,"The Sports Hub is touted to be the centrepiece of the SEA Games, so, I would like to ask about the status of the hybrid Desso pitch that was much talked about and whether it could stand the robust tests during the SEA Games. What are some of the marquee fringe activities and events that Singaporeans and participants can look out for? Of course, some of the events are already way over-sold. So, are there any plans to expand the capacity or even look at alternative sites so that it can accommodate more Singaporeans and participants to cheer Team Singapore on?"
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00041,2015-05-11-T-002,41,Lawrence Wong,"Madam, on the pitch of the Sports Hub at the National Stadium, as I have explained before, the SHPR, the Sports Hub consortium, has already put in place a lay-and-play solution, meaning to say, they are growing the grass somewhere else and they will be laying it on later when the pitch is needed. So, if you were to go to the National Stadium now, the entire pitch has been covered for the rehearsals and the Opening Ceremony. Naturally, when you open the covering, all the grass there would have died. It is only natural, because it is covered for days or weeks. But because we have a lay-and-play solution, the grass is being grown elsewhere. And I have seen the grass grown elsewhere. It is fine, it is luscious. The grass is good. So, the next step is when the grass is needed, it will be transferred over as part of this lay-and-play solution. The company that has been contracted will be in charge of doing that."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00042,2015-05-11-T-002,42,Lawrence Wong,"The hon Member also asked about marquee fringe events. Indeed, that is what we are planning to do, because many people come for these events not just for the games and the sports but also as part of a lifestyle experience. So, we will be having carnivals at the Sports Hub and also at the Marina Bay. At Marina Bay, we are hosting all our sailing and dragon boating events. There will be a big carnival there. And in the Sports Hub where many events are going to be held, we are also going to have a sports carnival around the Sports Hub. So, hopefully, that will draw more people to come for these carnivals and then to support and watch our Team Singapore athletes in action."
2015-05-11-T-002-S-00043,2015-05-11-T-002,43,Lawrence Wong,"On the over-subscribed events, whether or not we can find ways to broaden their viewing, I would say that we are doing it through various means. One, the events will be telecast live on TV. So, we can put up community screening sites for people to watch. We are also making it available on social media platforms, so you can download an app which will be announced very shortly and you can even watch the events live on your mobile platforms, whether it is a handphone or a mobile device. These will allow also for viewing of all the different sports."
2015-05-11-T-003-S-00044,2015-05-11-T-003,44,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,asked  the Minister for Manpower how can companies that are outside of the 17 priority sectors in the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme participate in the programme.
2015-05-11-T-003-S-00045,2015-05-11-T-003,45,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,asked  the Minister for Manpower whether trade associations from the non-priority sectors can be supported with more resources and funding to develop their industry manpower plan under the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme.
2015-05-11-T-003-S-00046,2015-05-11-T-003,46,Lim Swee Say,"Madam, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 4 and 5 together, please?"
2015-05-11-T-003-S-00047,2015-05-11-T-003,47,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2015-05-11-T-003-S-00048,2015-05-11-T-003,48,Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme (ELP), launched in March this year, is a work-study programme designed to give fresh graduates from the polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) a head-start in careers related to their study. It provides them with more opportunities after graduation to build on the skills and knowledge acquired in school, and to better support their transition to the workforce."
2015-05-11-T-003-S-00049,2015-05-11-T-003,49,Lim Swee Say,"The Food Manufacturing industry was the first sector to roll out the ELP in April this year. Other industries that will come onboard in 2015 include Food Services, Games Development, Logistics, Infocomm Technology, Marine and Offshore Engineering, Retail and Precision Engineering. We will progressively implement the ELP in more industries and, eventually, cover up to one in three polytechnic and ITE graduates."
2015-05-11-T-003-S-00050,2015-05-11-T-003,50,Lim Swee Say,"We have prioritised these industries to start first because they are more ready. At the same time, we also encourage the participation of Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to help reach out to companies in their sectors, whether priority or non-priority sectors. Mr Thomas Chua may be pleased to know that the Government will support them with additional resources and work with them to design quality ELPs that are not only relevant to the individual companies but also to the industry as a whole. Together, we can move faster in developing skills progression frameworks and career progression pathways for our fresh graduates."
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00051,2015-05-11-T-004,51,Lee Bee Wah,asked  the Prime Minister (a) whether the Ministry is aware of how many Singaporeans are invested as individual owners of properties in Iskandar Malaysia; and (b) how are our banks safeguarded against any major default in property loans to these buyers.
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00052,2015-05-11-T-004,52,Lawrence Wong,"<strong style=""color  rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color  transparent;"">(for the Prime Minister) </strong>"
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00053,2015-05-11-T-004,53,Lawrence Wong,
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00054,2015-05-11-T-004,54,Lawrence Wong,"Madam, there are many risks involved in overseas property purchases, especially in markets where there is uncertainty of supply or no effective regulation of supply. And if there is an over-supply of properties, investments can lose their value, and it will also be difficult to find tenants for an investment property."
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00055,2015-05-11-T-004,55,Lawrence Wong,
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00056,2015-05-11-T-004,56,Lawrence Wong,"In Iskandar and Johor, some reports have highlighted aggressive land-banking by developers. There is, indeed, a real concern about future over-supply in the property market there and, hence, the potential decline in value of homes. Based on data from Malaysia's National Property Information Centre, there are around 336,000 new private residential units in the pipeline. This is more than the total number of private homes in Singapore. So, everything that is coming through in the pipeline, incoming and being planned, is already more than the total number of private homes in Singapore. The data do not include another 1,400 hectares of reclaimed land near the Tuas Second Link that will come on stream from 2020 onwards."
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00057,2015-05-11-T-004,57,Lawrence Wong,
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00058,2015-05-11-T-004,58,Lawrence Wong,"Given these indications, there are many reports that indicate that buyers are becoming more cautious. Official Malaysian data suggest that the Johor housing market is already slowing down, with the value of residential property transactions falling by 42% on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the fourth quarter of 2014. Singaporean buyers, too, are becoming wary. According to surveys of real estate agencies in Singapore, the number of Malaysian properties bought through these agencies dropped from 2,609 in 2013 to 838 in 2014."
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00059,2015-05-11-T-004,59,Lawrence Wong,
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00060,2015-05-11-T-004,60,Lawrence Wong,"Nevertheless, not all Singaporeans have recognised the risks involved in overseas property purchases. Hence, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Council of Estate Agents (CEA) will continue to step up efforts in raising awareness and highlighting these risks. For example, the CEA has issued guidelines on what investors in overseas properties should look out for. These include finding out about rules or restrictions on foreign property purchases and ownership, the taxes payable, and the dispute resolution avenues available in the foreign market. This is besides the risk of oversupply that I mentioned earlier, resulting in potential investment losses."
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00061,2015-05-11-T-004,61,Lawrence Wong,
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00062,2015-05-11-T-004,62,Lawrence Wong,"At the systemic level, financial institutions in Singapore do not have large exposures to loans for the purchase of overseas properties. In fact, the banks themselves are cautious about financing the purchase of overseas properties. Hence, such loans make up only 2% of the housing loan portfolios of the key mortgage lenders in Singapore. In addition, the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework introduced by MAS in June 2013 requires lenders to assess the debt servicing ability of their customers for all new property loans, regardless of whether the property is in Singapore or overseas. All existing debt obligations, including those for overseas property purchases, must be included for such assessments."
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00063,2015-05-11-T-004,63,Lawrence Wong,

2015-05-11-T-004-S-00065,2015-05-11-T-004,65,Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Minister for the answer. According to the feedback from my friends and residents, a lot of Singaporeans have gone overseas to buy properties because of the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty imposed in Singapore, coupled with aggressive advertisements by foreign developers, including those from Iskandar Malaysia. I would like to ask the Minister  is there any possibility or any review on lifting the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty for Singaporeans?"
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00066,2015-05-11-T-004,66,Lawrence Wong,"Madam, we should look at this separately because we have a set of cooling measures which is put in place taking into account global conditions and our domestic property market, and we know why there is a need for that. It is really because, globally, interest rates are low, returns are low, there is a lot of liquidity in the market, and investors everywhere, including in Singapore, are looking for things to invest in. If we are not careful, then you can easily have a bubble being built up, which is why we had to put in place cooling measures in our property market. In that context, whatever we do on the cooling measures has to take into consideration the broader global developments as well as our domestic property market trends, and ensure that we continue to have a stable and sustainable property market within Singapore."
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00067,2015-05-11-T-004,67,Lawrence Wong,"On the advertising standards which the hon Member talked about, that is something which we can and should look into. In fact, I understand that the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore is already looking into reviewing their guidelines for advertising on investment in properties, and the guidelines would apply to investments in property both locally as well as overseas. They are reviewing the guidelines and I think they will put in place a set of more stringent guidelines in future. What is important at the end of the day is that individuals must have responsibility when they make these decisions, and we have to continue to raise the awareness of potential investors and educate them to make sure that they do sufficient due diligence before they make any property purchases, overseas in particular."
2015-05-11-T-004-S-00068,2015-05-11-T-004,68,Lawrence Wong,"There are many risks. I have mentioned over-supply risks as one of the considerations. There are also foreign exchange risks which can move easily against the investors' favour. There are risks of changes to tax and regulatory frameworks governing property ownership. For example, there may be rules that restrict the non-residents' ability to sell a property in that country easily. And these are risks that can happen in any investment in overseas property. These are risks that we must continually emphasise. The CEA and MAS, as I mentioned earlier, will step up their efforts to help investors understand these risks better and do their due diligence."

2015-05-11-T-005-S-00071,2015-05-11-T-005,71,Teo Ser Luck,"EV Phase 2 will explore fleet-based, shared car operations with the potential to reap economies of scale through higher daily mileage and potentially lower running costs. Operators under Phase 2 will have to incur significant upfront cost of investments in EVs and a network of charging infrastructure. The 10-year period will allow adequate time for the companies to recover their investment."
2015-05-11-T-005-S-00072,2015-05-11-T-005,72,Teo Ser Luck,
2015-05-11-T-005-S-00073,2015-05-11-T-005,73,Teo Ser Luck,"Our broader transport goal is to encourage the use of public transport and reduce reliance on private vehicle ownership, whether they are EVs or not. Those who wish to purchase EVs can benefit from the recently enhanced Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS), under which low carbon emission vehicles stand to enjoy significant rebates of up to $30,000 off the Additional Registration Fee (ARF)."
2015-05-11-T-005-S-00074,2015-05-11-T-005,74,Yee Jenn Jong,"I thank the Minister of State for the answers. I have three supplementary questions. The first is on the duration of 10 years for Phase 2. Ten years seem to be quite a long time. I understand that yes, there is a need for the investment to be recuperated. But given that many cities have already moved on to large scale commercial implementation, it means that these countries will gain the advantage of wide-scale EV implementations over us. Will we lose out in terms of building capabilities among our companies and also in our country's leadership in sustainable and liveable cities, if we wait 10 years before even implementing this on a larger commercial scale basis? And is EV something that is important for us to invest in our economic development?"
2015-05-11-T-005-S-00075,2015-05-11-T-005,75,Yee Jenn Jong,"The second question is on EV ownership. I would like to ask whether EV ownership can be factored into this Phase 2's 10-year period when there has been sufficient infrastructure that has been built. Given the high cost of adoption, will there be incentives such as COE and tax rebates to encourage adoption so that we can have even larger scale of implementation?"
2015-05-11-T-005-S-00076,2015-05-11-T-005,76,Yee Jenn Jong,"Lastly, I would like to ask regarding other types of electric vehicles. Will buses and taxis also be factored in Phase 2, since they are also heavily used and have a shared fleet that can be maintained by operator with rapid charging facilities? So, this will also give us the larger scale implementation that we need."
2015-05-11-T-005-S-00077,2015-05-11-T-005,77,Teo Ser Luck,"I thank Member for the questions. As an overall basis, it is still under the study phase. We have just completed the Phase 1, going to Phase 2. From Phase 1, testing the vehicle out on the roads and then to Phase 2 of rolling out fleet base, we are still undergoing the research and the study. Technology changes all the time. So, the duration of the 10 years is a safer duration for operators when they make for investment. Also, over the 10 years, technological advancements will change. You can see that there are many different types of technology that is advanced – today with batteries that are rechargeable and actually last longer and takes a shorter time to charge."
2015-05-11-T-005-S-00078,2015-05-11-T-005,78,Teo Ser Luck,"EV ownership right now is still in the study phase but the policy intent has always been not to have individual car ownership and as best possible to use public transport. Nevertheless, we want to give more options to consumers. We have to wait till the Phase 2 study is over because individual ownership is beyond the Phase 2 study right now. So, let us let this Phase 2 to progress and let the operator make the necessary infrastructure investments with the fleet base operation, and see what is the result of that."
2015-05-11-T-005-S-00079,2015-05-11-T-005,79,Teo Ser Luck,"As far as rebates is concerned, I will refer that to the Ministry of Transport to study what is available and whether it is necessary to come out with the other types of rebates and COE rebates. Currently, they have a review, but I am not too sure if the outcome is in the near term or not. So, we will let Phase 2 be implemented, before considering any other measures."
2015-05-11-T-006-S-00080,2015-05-11-T-006,80,Tan Tai Yong,"asked  the Prime Minister (a) to date, how many honorary scholarships (scholarships with no funding) has the Public Service Commission given out; (b) when was the last occurrence and what was this scholarship given out for; and (c) what are the reasons for this class of scholarships and whether these reasons can apply to a wider range of students."

2015-05-11-T-006-S-00083,2015-05-11-T-006,83,Teo Chee Hean,"Currently, PSC scholarships are awarded to outstanding men and women with the passion, capability and clear commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans through a career in the Public Service. Hence, today, all individuals awarded PSC scholarships are provided full funding for their university studies and are expected to commit to work in the Public Service. Under this framework, PSC thus no longer awards nominal scholarships."
2015-05-11-T-006-S-00084,2015-05-11-T-006,84,Tan Tai Yong,"I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his answer. I am just wondering, as more students come from families who may not need financial support of the sort that scholarships give, but yet would want the recognition that scholarships acknowledge, do you see the possibility of a more honorary scholarships being awarded as a way of acknowledging academic excellence but not taxing on the resources that the scholarships would entail by giving financial support?"
2015-05-11-T-006-S-00085,2015-05-11-T-006,85,Teo Chee Hean,"Mdm Speaker, I described the purpose of PSC scholarships. The purpose of PSC scholarships is not merely to recognise the academic attainments of a particular individual. They are designed to have outstanding men and women with a passion, capability and clear commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans in the Public Service. Hence, if there are such Singaporeans of ability who want to apply for Public Service Commission Scholarships, we would be happy to award it to the student. But if they are equivalently bright, young and able people who have decided that, ""No, this is not what I want to do"", then, this does not come under the ambit of the PSC scholarship, and it would not be appropriate to do so."
2015-05-11-T-007-S-00086,2015-05-11-T-007,86,Baey Yam Keng,"asked  the Minister for Communications and Information in light of SMRT's announcement that it will work with OMGTel to bid for Singapore's fourth wireless telecommunications carrier licence, how does the Ministry ensure that high telecommunication service standards are maintained if the partners of the licences do not have proven track records."
2015-05-11-T-007-S-00087,2015-05-11-T-007,87,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Mdm Speaker, IDA issued a public consultation in April last year, seeking views from the industry on potential interest to enter Singapore's mobile market. A new entrant would further spur competition in the mobile market, benefiting consumers through more attractive pricing and innovative services."

2015-05-11-T-007-S-00089,2015-05-11-T-007,89,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Should a new mobile operator be interested to enter the Singapore market, they will need to take part in a spectrum auction. IDA has yet to determine the rules for the next spectrum auction. Nonetheless, in previous auctions, IDA has stipulated qualifying criteria, which includes the requirement for applicants to have strong technical capabilities and financial positions. This is to ensure that only serious and capable players participate in the spectrum auction. Any new mobile operator will also have to comply with IDA's regulatory obligations, including its Quality of Service frameworks."
2015-05-11-T-007-S-00090,2015-05-11-T-007,90,Baey Yam Keng,"I thank the Minister for the answer. I would like to ask  going back to the time when the Singapore telco industry was liberalised, the partners in M1 and StarHub did not necessarily have technical backgrounds in the telecoms sector. So, does the same rule apply then and now, in this new licence? I would appreciate it if the Minister could shed more light."
2015-05-11-T-007-S-00091,2015-05-11-T-007,91,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, we have to see how the market has evolved and the experience that we have gained. For example, when we invited new entrants for the 2013 4G spectrum auction, we had a pre-qualification phase where we ask the participants to declare their capital structure, financial proposal, technical capabilities and the proposed 4G systems and services, amongst others. Through these criteria, we pre-qualified them and then invited those pre-qualified to tender for the spectrum. We are likely to put in similar criteria for the next spectrum auction."
2015-05-11-T-007-S-00092,2015-05-11-T-007,92,Zaqy Mohamad,"I just want to ask a couple of questions. One, in terms of evaluation -- what is proportion in terms of the tender price as well as the innovations that we can expect from such bidders? The bidding should not just be based on price considerations, I suppose, because that would also increase price. With the increased competition, what is the Ministry's long-term strategy to enhance the telco users experience here in Singapore?"
2015-05-11-T-007-S-00093,2015-05-11-T-007,93,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"That is exactly the intention, Mdm Speaker. We do have a variety of criteria. I am not at liberty to declare the proportion at which our regulators will decide, but certainly we take into account not only pricing but the ability to innovate."

We want a telco that can bring innovation to the market, and therefore, cause the existing incumbents to also innovate. We want to spur competition. Certainly, we will bear all these factors in mind to ensure that it will spur growth to benefit the consumers."

2015-05-11-T-008-S-00099,2015-05-11-T-008,99,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, I expect SMRT to remain fully focused on providing reliable and efficient public transport services. In this regard, SMRT has given their assurances on multiple occasions. What we understand from SMRT Corporation is that it intends to take a stake with an investment of up to $34.5 million, which is small, compared to the overall cost of a new mobile network, and that the collaboration will be for the provision of services and goods that leverage on SMRT's media presence and commuter reach."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00100,2015-05-11-T-008,100,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00101,2015-05-11-T-008,101,Lui Tuck Yew,"In any case, the LTA imposes strict Operating Performance Standards and Codes of Practice on our public transport operators to ensure that they perform to expectations. These standards and codes are reviewed regularly, with the most recent round of tightening announced earlier this year. If operators fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, they can be penalised up to $1 million per incident, or 10% of the annual fare revenue of the licensed system, whichever is higher."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00102,2015-05-11-T-008,102,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00103,2015-05-11-T-008,103,Lui Tuck Yew,"LTA will continue to keep a close eye on our public transport operators to ensure that they are not distracted by their non-public transport businesses, and that their primary mission of providing public transport services is not compromised."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00104,2015-05-11-T-008,104,Baey Yam Keng,"Madam, I have three questions to follow up. First, looking at the past few years of financial figures for SMRT, we note that the revenues and earnings of SMRT, fare-based versus non fare-based, there has been a greater discrepancy. There are more profits generated from non-fare businesses. So, how does the Government ensure that the management's attention is not distracted, given that other businesses are bringing the company more profitability?"
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00105,2015-05-11-T-008,105,Baey Yam Keng,"The second question is regarding the fines. If you look at the fines imposed on SMRT over the last three years, they constitute about, at most 2% of the overall profits that the company made. How is the Government able to ensure that this fine amount or the system of penalty is adequate enough to make sure that the fines serve as an adequate deterrence and penalty for the PTOs?"
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00106,2015-05-11-T-008,106,Baey Yam Keng,"My third question is  in today's Zaobao interview given by the CEO, he claimed that the profits from non-fare businesses helped to keep public transport fares low. Is this just a goodwill gesture of the company, or is it featured in PTC's assessment of any fare increase proposals by the PTOs? And whether this goodwill could be mandated as a condition for such PTOs to be allowed to diversify into other businesses so that the public interest of Singaporeans and commuters, is protected."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00107,2015-05-11-T-008,107,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. The first is on financial figures. It is indeed true that for the last few years, the vast majority of the profits have come from non-fare revenue. In the recent financial year, the profit for the entire SMRT Group is about $91 million. If I recall correctly, more than 90% of this was from non-fare businesses and the pattern was familiar in the preceding years."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00108,2015-05-11-T-008,108,Lui Tuck Yew,"Regardless of that, for LTA and for MOT, for us, we regulate them based on the Operating Performance Standards as well as the Codes of Practice. It is our job to make sure that they are not distracted as a result of ventures together with the Sports Hub or this possible venture with the fourth telco operator, and to concentrate on delivering public transport to the degree of reliability and service standards that is expected of them."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00109,2015-05-11-T-008,109,Lui Tuck Yew,"On the fines, as part of the review, I think it was last year or the year before, we had raised the fines from the maximum of $1 million to either $1 million or 10% of the annual fare revenue of the licensed system, whichever is higher. That is not to say that for every incident, we will fine them to this amount. It really depends on the matrix of factors including, for example, the severity of the disruption, the number of commuters that are affected, and so on and so forth."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00110,2015-05-11-T-008,110,Lui Tuck Yew,"The reason why this limit was raised was that when we did a review following the December 2011 incident, we felt that the $1 million limit was insufficient for an incident of that severity. Hence, we decided to make a move to increase the limit that we could impose on them should a similar incident of such nature happen again."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00111,2015-05-11-T-008,111,Lui Tuck Yew,"On the third point, I have not read the CEO's interview with Zaobao. I will certainly go and look it up. As far as we are concerned, public transport fares are governed by the fare formula that the PTC works on. It is the formula that is used to determine the extent of the fare increase or reduction should the factors call for a reduction, as we expect for this year's exercise. Having said that, PTC will, of course, look into the financial performance of the operator and one of the features is that it requires the operators, if they are doing well, to make a contribution to the Public Transport Fund. Both SBST and SMRT made a contribution last year. This year, when we had the fare increase in April, they made a larger contribution to the Public Transport Fund."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00112,2015-05-11-T-008,112,Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Minister for the clarification. Just a couple of supplementary questions. I am glad that the Minister mentioned about keeping SMRT focused on operating guidelines and requirements. To keep SMRT focused and to ensure that the profits that it gains every year are not misconstrued as profiteering from passengers, what is stopping the regulator – LTA or the Ministry, for example – from ensuring that every new non-fare business that SMRT undertakes, they have to set up a separate subsidiary? Or even for existing non-fare business, should SMRT then move these entities or businesses to a separate subsidiary?"
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00113,2015-05-11-T-008,113,Zaqy Mohamad,"On Minister's reply earlier, as with the fines review, when he said the fines are a proportion of operating revenue, is that just operating revenue from the fare business or does it include total operating revenue that includes all the non-fare business as well."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00114,2015-05-11-T-008,114,Lui Tuck Yew,"I thank the Member for his suggestion. Indeed, it is possible for them to set up a subsidiary but I suspect they will still be looking at the overall performance of the entire corporation. Although they manage the non-fare businesses separately, we look at it in its entirety."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00115,2015-05-11-T-008,115,Lui Tuck Yew,"Your second question was whether it is on the revenue of the operating system itself or in totality. Actually, it is on the fare revenue of the operations itself which is the vast majority of total revenue. So if you are looking at revenue by far, the vast majority of it comes from operating trains, but in terms of profits, the bulk of the profit, probably up to 90%, actually comes from the non-fare businesses that they run."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00116,2015-05-11-T-008,116,Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. By asking them to just contribute to the Public Transport Fund is not sufficient. It is providing public transport and if they would want to do any other businesses, it must bring benefit to the commuters. Therefore, any profits from other businesses, they should use it to cross-subsidise the public transport. Otherwise, why should we allow them to venture into other businesses? I would like to ask the Minister, will PTC change the fare revision formula to take into consideration the overall profit, so as to cross-subsidise the commuters' fare."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00117,2015-05-11-T-008,117,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, the PTC formula was deliberated in this House a couple of years ago. It runs till 2017, by which time, we would then take a relook at the formula, and I am sure Members can give their suggestions in due course for that to be taken into account."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00118,2015-05-11-T-008,118,Baey Yam Keng,"Thank you, Madam. I would like to ask the Minister to clarify, because I was looking at section 19 of the Rapid Transit Systems (RTS) Act. The penalty is up to $1 million or 10% of its annual fare revenue of a rail line. Does that refer to a particular line that has suffered some breakdown or disruption or the rail revenue for all rail operations under the PTO?"
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00119,2015-05-11-T-008,119,Lui Tuck Yew,For a particular licensed system. The North -South and East-West Lines are considered as one licensed system.
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00120,2015-05-11-T-008,120,Chia Yong Yong,"<strong style=""""> </strong>   I would like to ask the Minister thus far the penalties do not seem to be working very well in terms of ensuring that there are smooth operations for the benefit of commuters. Right now, we also have an issue of SMRT wanting to go into another area of business which is not its core business. I know the Minister has stated that the Ministry will ensure that they continue to give good services and adhere to the transport standards that are required, but in more specific terms, how would the Ministry ensure that they do not get distracted by making more profits, seeing of course that the computation of the penalties could possibly be quite minuscule, particularly if it is limited only to the revenue of a particular line."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00121,2015-05-11-T-008,121,Lui Tuck Yew,"I would say that in reply to the point that the penalty could be minuscule because it is only on the revenue of a particular licensed system, it probably is not so. If you look at the revenue for the North-South and East-West Lines, that constitutes the bulk of the revenue. It could be a very, very hefty fine well beyond $1 million should there be a breakdown that is so severe that the LTA has to impose the 10% limit."
2015-05-11-T-008-S-00122,2015-05-11-T-008,122,Lui Tuck Yew,"What are the ways in which we look at it? First, we look, in particular, at the use of manpower with regard to SMRT Trains, which is the entity that we regulate. If, for example, we see senior manpower being taken out from SMRT Trains to be used to support their venture with the fourth telco, we will be very concerned."
2015-05-11-T-009-S-00123,2015-05-11-T-009,123,Christopher de Souza,asked  the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can provide a further update on the progress of the high-speed rail project that will connect Singapore and Kuala Lumpur; and (b) what will the Ministry be doing in the next few years to ensure timely completion of the project.
2015-05-11-T-009-S-00124,2015-05-11-T-009,124,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, Prime Minister Lee announced the location of the Singapore terminus of the KL-Singapore High Speed Rail last week. We are deep in discussions with the Malaysians on the technical, security, commercial and regulatory aspects, having completed our own preliminary studies into these areas. As both Prime Minister Lee and Prime Minister Najib noted, this is a challenging and complicated project and we should take the time required to plan well and implement well. Both countries are fully committed to the success of this project."
2015-05-11-T-009-S-00125,2015-05-11-T-009,125,Christopher de Souza,May I ask the Minister if there is an estimate cost per ticket from Jurong East to Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur back on the express version of the train?
2015-05-11-T-009-S-00126,2015-05-11-T-009,126,Lui Tuck Yew,"I thank the Member for his supplementary question. It is too early for us to talk about fares but we have already shared with the Malaysians that we think it is better for the express service between KL and Singapore, and for the transit service that runs from KL through a number of stops before it reaches Singapore, for both these sets of services to be managed separately."
2015-05-11-T-010-S-00127,2015-05-11-T-010,127,Kuik Shiao-Yin,asked  the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what inter-cultural and inter-religious programmes are in place to actively rehabilitate youth offenders who make seditious remarks against other races and religions; and (b) whether engagement and mentorship from representatives of religious or racial groups are integrated into the rehabilitative care of such youth offenders.

These could include conditional warnings, probation, and placement in a juvenile rehabilitation centre, reformative training centre or prison. These measures encourage the youth offenders to take responsibility for their actions and equip them with the life skills to embark on constructive lifestyles. Of course, the involvement of families is also very critical in the rehabilitation of the youth offenders."

The youth would also have the opportunity to interact with people of different races and religions through activities, role-modelling, and also community service, or be mentored by staff or volunteers."

2015-05-11-T-010-S-00135,2015-05-11-T-010,135,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"Thank you. Just a supplemenary question. Given how significant online communication is to the average youth today, are there any collaborative efforts between MSF and MOE that specifically look at educating young people about the social, political or legal boundaries that have to do with communication about race and religion?"
2015-05-11-T-010-S-00136,2015-05-11-T-010,136,Low Yen Ling,"I thank the Member for the supplementary question. Yes, indeed, MSF and MOE work very closely. You would be aware that MOE has a cyber-wellness curriculum that aims to equip our students with lifelong social emotional competency, so that they can grow up to be safe, responsible and respectful users in the online space. And, of course, like I have mentioned earlier, parental guidance is very, very critical. To this end on the parental front, if there are some parents who face difficulties in addressing their children's challenging behaviour, whether online or offline, there are platforms where they can approach community agencies, for example, the Family Service Centre (FSC). We work with MOE and there are also counsellors in the school to guide the parents and the students accordingly. All these are made available with a view to prevent the children's behaviour from getting worse, whether online or offline. That is on the parental front."
2015-05-11-T-010-S-00137,2015-05-11-T-010,137,Low Yen Ling,"Now, the Member's question on whether there are inter-racial programmes and so on, earlier on, I mentioned about youth offenders, for example, they can be referred to the OnePeople.sg - Explorations in Ethnicity Programme. This is put together by the organisation that spearheads racial harmony initiatives in Singapore. To that end, MSF and MOE give it very strong support. For example, the OnePeople.sg – Explorations in Ethnicity course is a two-day course comprising between 20 to 30 participants and very experiential learning activities, so that participants can register better through role-playing, and so on. It serves to guide our youths to better navigate some of these very sensitive topics in the online space."

And, if so, are these from existing operators or are they new ones, and what arguments have been put forward by the casinos, if any?"
2015-05-11-T-011-S-00141,2015-05-11-T-011,141,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Second, what will the Government's considerations be in granting or not granting casino licences after 2017? And finally, how is the Government tracking the social harm that has brought about by casinos since they were introduced?"
2015-05-11-T-011-S-00142,2015-05-11-T-011,142,Lee Yi Shyan,"Mdm Speaker, currently we have no plans beyond the moratorium. As I said, the priority now is to work with the existing Integrated Resorts (IRs) to ensure that they continue to improve their offerings, so that as part of the tourism appeal and content of Singapore remain attractive."
2015-05-11-T-011-S-00143,2015-05-11-T-011,143,Lee Yi Shyan,"For the last few years, it is useful to note that other countries in the region have also started to build or seen completion of casinos. For instance, in the Philippines, they will have five IRs by 2018, and in Korea, they will also have five by 2019. Other countries that have expressed interest to build IRs would be like Japan and Taiwan. This is the international competitive landscape in terms of major cities improving their tourism attractions. This will be one set of considerations that we have to take into consideration as and when we consider the next steps. Domestically, the two IRs contribute between 1.5% and 2% to our GDP and they have created more than 20,000 jobs. These are also the economic considerations that we have to bear in mind."
2015-05-11-T-011-S-00144,2015-05-11-T-011,144,Lee Yi Shyan,"For the monitoring of crime related to the casino operations, the Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) is keeping a very close watch. From their reports, we have not seen substantial increase in crime associated with casinos."

We introduced mandatory minimum fines of $3,000 for the first-time offender and $6,000 for repeat offenders. We also introduced higher maximum fines for both first-timer, from $5,000 to $15,000, and for repeat offenders, from $10,000 to $30,000. At the same time, we enhanced MOM's enforcement and investigatory powers, granting employment inspectors the power to arrest any person believed to be guilty of failing to pay salary, as well as the power to enter workplaces to conduct inspections."

2015-05-11-T-012-S-00152,2015-05-11-T-012,152,Lim Swee Say,"MOM has stepped up our enforcement efforts since 2014. MOM now investigates every salary-related claim for employees covered under the Employment Act. We take a particularly serious view of employers who wilfully refuse to pay. Last year, MOM took action against 645 employers for salary-related offences. Forty-nine employers were prosecuted for severe breaches. This is four times more than the number in 2013."

2015-05-11-T-012-S-00154,2015-05-11-T-012,154,Lim Swee Say,We therefore urge workers who have not been paid their salaries or feel that their wages have been wrongfully withheld to come forward early to MOM or their unions for assistance.
2015-05-11-T-012-S-00155,2015-05-11-T-012,155,Hri Kumar Nair,"I thank the Minister for the answer. I have two supplementary questions. Could the Minister let us know what is the number of pending cases with the MOM on unpaid salaries? Second, are there any mechanisms to help the employee in salary dispute case where there is a dispute as to whether payments are made, for example, requiring the employer to pay the monies into MOM for safeguarding funds, so that at the end of the dispute, the employee can be assured that there will be monies there for him to receive payment?"
2015-05-11-T-012-S-00156,2015-05-11-T-012,156,Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, of the 645 cases prosecuted last year, most of them were issued advisory or warning orders, and 49 employers, as I mentioned earlier, were prosecuted in the court. This is the action taken against employers. At the same time, employers were also taken to the Labour Court to settle the payment to the workers. For that, last year, we cleared about 1,630 cases. And of these cases, two-thirds of the workers were able to receive full payment at the order of the Labour Court. However, one-third of them, due to financial difficulties faced by the companies, received either partial payment or, in some cases, no payment."
2015-05-11-T-012-S-00157,2015-05-11-T-012,157,Lim Swee Say,"We investigated further into those employers who were not able to make full payment and we discovered that 80% of the employers were able to make full payment but 20% of them, were unable to pay due to financial difficulties and, in some cases, even closing down of business. As a result, there was no recourse for the workers and for the Labour Court to recover the payment."
2015-05-11-T-012-S-00158,2015-05-11-T-012,158,Lim Swee Say,"We take this seriously. Our sympathies are with the workers because they work hard for the money. MOM is doing two things  firstly, those workers who are not covered under the Employment Act, today when they face a problem of salary non-payment, they have to take civil action which can be protracted and costly. By the end of this year, we will be setting up the Employment Claim Tribunal so that workers, including the managers, executives, even CEOs, who are earning more than $4,500 and not covered under the Employment Act, will be able to have access to the Employment Claim Tribunal. At the same time, in order to reduce and minimise the number of cases whereby the employers are not able to make any payment due to financial difficulties, MOM, together with the tripartite partners, is looking into how we can enhance the protection for the workers in a more holistic manner."

Vandalism is a serious offence, especially where it defaces public facilities or property, is designed to draw wide public attention to the act of lawlessness, or involves indelible substances making removal difficult or costly. The maximum penalty for vandalism is three years' imprisonment or a fine up to S$2,000. There is a mandatory minimum of three strokes of the cane but not more than eight, unless the act was committed with a delible substance. For the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, the maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment and a fine or caning. This increases to life imprisonment or up to 15 years' imprisonment and a fine or caning if grievous hurt is caused by dangerous weapons and means."

This includes the offender's age, antecedents, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors. The courts would also need to consider what is in the public interest. For example, it would not be in the public interest to have youth crime take root in society or go out of control. While rehabilitative options are available for young offenders who are suitable, the courts have also meted out more severe punishments if the offence was a serious one, including deterrent sentences to send a strong signal that such criminal behaviour will not be condoned nor taken lightly. In appropriate cases, the Public Prosecutor may appeal against the sentence if it is inadequate or does not reflect the seriousness of the offence committed."

In 2013, three young men aged between 19 and 21 were sentenced to imprisonment terms of between two years six months and three years six months, and received between four and six strokes of the cane, for rioting and slashing a full-time national serviceman in an attack at a shopping complex in Orchard Road.

He has rightly pointed out the need for a significant deterrent effect. For youth offenders, the effectiveness of this may be reduced because of the lack of understanding and awareness. Are there further measures that the Ministry can take to work with at-risk individuals to try to prevent them from offending in the first place?"

For example, there is the Youth Engagement Program (YEP) developed by Police psychologists with inputs from Ministry of Education, Ministry of Social and Family Development and the Police, to have activities planned throughout the year to engage these youths, occupy them especially during holidays, particularly to steer them away from crime. One good example is the Delta League Sports Challenge, which is carried out in June and December, where many youths who have been identified to be at-risk have been engaged by the Police, given mentoring programmes, as well as professional coaching by our S-League teams to give them a sense of purpose and divert them away from crime."

It is a pilot in the Northeast and Northwest districts to look out for youths who hang out late, beyond 11 pm. These youth workers go out beyond 11 pm to identify youths who are regularly out there, not under supervision, so that they can have a person they are familiar with who can work with them should they have issues and prevent them falling into crime."

Some of them may just have some form of severe discipline problems in school. This does not necessarily mean they will fall into crime. But if we can engage them early, get them onboard programmes that will put them on productive purposes so that they do not come into bad company. We do not generally want to just address youths at-risk. We want to make it as broad as possible so that even those at the fringes should be involved. That is the hardest part because those youths who have already been arrested, and even given stern warnings, we know who they are, and we are engaging them. But the biggest problem is those who are at the fringes or suffering some form of problems at home or in school that we need to be aware of."

What is important is to find out the exact reasons from the GPs on their reluctance to participate in CDMP and CHAS. Some of these reasons received from the GPs include GPs being satisfied with their own current patient load; some GPs also perceive that the additional administrative burden that comes along with the schemes are quite onerous; some GPs are also quite concerned about the audit process, especially the amount of effort that is needed in the process, such as time needed to retrieve and photocopy relevant documents for the audit; and some GPs are not keen to take on a larger chronic caseload."

Just as hon Member Assoc Prof Fatimah had said, it is very important that we promote this because we are having an ageing population, and a lot of elderly residents have given us feedback that they really hope that there will be more GP clinics that are accessible to them, and where they can at the same time, enjoy the subsidies that the Government has been offering readily?"
2015-05-11-T-014-S-00193,2015-05-11-T-014,193,Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Ms Tin for the supplementary question. We do not have any timelines currently, but having said that, we are quite encouraged by the take-up rate from the GPs as well as the dental practitioners over the past one to two years. MOH will continue to put in effort to engage these practitioners so that we can increase the take-up rate as much as possible."

For private candidates who are much older than the Secondary School age, interaction with Secondary School age students and participation in our schools' CCAs would not be age-appropriate.

Consequently, countries like the United States of America, Australia and New Zealand have done so."

Currently, MAS' power to carry out inspections is found in sector-specific legislation like the Banking Act, the Insurance Act and the Securities and Futures Act. For greater efficiency and consistency, these powers will now be centralised in the MAS Act. Specifically, the new provisions will vest MAS with the power to inspect Financial Institutions for compliance with directions or regulations relating to Singapore's international obligations, like United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolutions on sanctions and the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. It will also enable MAS to appoint a third party, like an auditor, to inspect a Financial Institution on MAS' behalf."

However, in certain jurisdictions, like in Australia, the responsibility for AML/CFT supervision resides in an authority that does not have prudential supervision responsibilities, meaning to say that they have two separate regulators – one in charge of AML/CFT and another, over-seeing financial prudential standards."

MAS will also be able to make AML/CFT supervisory enquiries on the counterpart's behalf."

Nevertheless, MAS may give its consent, upon the request of an AML/CFT supervisor, to allow information that has been shared for AML/CFT supervisory purposes to be shared with a third party, in appropriate circumstances. And such onward-sharing of information will be subject to strict confidentiality safeguards set by MAS."

In its recent assessment of Singapore's compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, the IMF recognised that MAS has in place a strict AML/CFT regime. Even so, in the light of the constantly evolving threat, it is important that we continually review and enhance our regime to align it with international standards and best practices. The introduction of the MAS (Amendment) Bill represents Singapore's resolve to maintain the high standards of integrity and trust in our financial system. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move."

Singapore has a legal system in place to apply targeted financial sanctions regarding terrorist financing.

2015-05-11-T-023-S-00272,2015-05-11-T-023,272,Lina Chiam,"Financial institutions are the first front line positions to inform MAS of any suspicion but, at the same time, they are put in a difficult position of keeping their clients' secrecy and meeting their KPIs in the face of intense competition."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00273,2015-05-11-T-023,273,Lina Chiam,"While the Bill addresses anti-terrorism, I am afraid this Bill may not be effective in keeping financial institutions in check as they are put in a position in keeping dual conflicting roles."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00274,2015-05-11-T-023,274,Lina Chiam,"This Bill also does not address extradition. Cross border and international white collar crime makes it difficult to catch money laundering criminals. Countries should constructively and effectively execute extradition requests in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing, without undue delay."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00275,2015-05-11-T-023,275,Lina Chiam,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to propose that the Bill address the following"
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00276,2015-05-11-T-023,276,Lina Chiam,- Money laundering and terrorist financing are extraditable offences.
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00277,2015-05-11-T-023,277,Lina Chiam,- Have a clear and efficient processes for the timely execution of extradition requests including prioritisation cases where appropriate.
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00278,2015-05-11-T-023,278,Lina Chiam,- A case management system with rigorous supervision be maintained to monitor progress
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00279,2015-05-11-T-023,279,Lina Chiam,- Ensuring an adequate legal framework.
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00280,2015-05-11-T-023,280,Lina Chiam,"In addition, the draft Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act (Cap. 2A) (the ""ACRA Act""), has been amended and a new Part VIA1 introduced to enhance the regulatory framework for corporate service providers, comprising registered filing agents and registered qualified individuals such as solicitors, accountants and advocates."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00281,2015-05-11-T-023,281,Lina Chiam,"Under this Act, a new set of Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Filing Agents and Qualified Individuals) Regulations 2015 sets out further requirements on this enhanced framework."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00282,2015-05-11-T-023,282,Lina Chiam,"Under Recommendation 8 of the FATF (Financial Action Task Force), ACRA Act will also have more scrutiny on non-profit organisations – corporate limited by guarantees (CLG)."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00283,2015-05-11-T-023,283,Lina Chiam,"I feel that this MAS Bill should be read with the ACRA (Amendment) Bill concurrently or perhaps make it into an Omni MAS-ACRA Bill providing more enforcement powers over professional firms and corporate service providers. There should also be some provisions to ensure MAS scrutinise law firms, accounting firms and charities/companies limited by guarantee."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00284,2015-05-11-T-023,284,Lina Chiam,"Many accounting firms, law firms and corporate service professional firms are tasked to incorporate foreign companies and foreigners with paid up capital funds from other countries."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00285,2015-05-11-T-023,285,Lina Chiam,"Most criminals and scammers do their money laundering by setting up shell companies with PO Boxes as registered/mailing addresses in Singapore. MAS needs to provide and train bankers, bank officers, lawyers, accountants to detect such suspicion, especially those that are classified in the high-risk range which include politically exposed foreigners and organisations from countries/territories and their unrealistic turnover in client business accounts with no apparent business and low paid up capital."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00286,2015-05-11-T-023,286,Lina Chiam,"Section 30ZC (5) under assistance that may be rendered to domestic authority, the Bill should also address the confidentiality clauses that binds lawyers under the Legal Profession Act. This Bill should ensure that lawyers be able to break all confidentiality without the worry of the Legal Profession Act in place."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00287,2015-05-11-T-023,287,Lina Chiam,"In 2012, there was a case in France in which a lawyer was put to task for reporting the origin of his client's money. While client/attorney privilege is important, the French Court concluded that the obligation to report suspicions did not represent a disproportionate interference with lawyers' professional privilege and that there had been no violation."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00288,2015-05-11-T-023,288,Lina Chiam,"Last but not least, ACRA Act addresses non-profit organisations (NPO) and religious bodies. Increasingly, activities linked to terrorism and its financing, including the use of NPOs for terrorist financing. Therefore, I would again ask the Minister whether the MAS Bill should be read concurrently with the ACRA Act as they both share the same purpose, as these two Bills and Act will raise NPOs' awareness of possible misuse of their organisations for money laundering and terrorist purposes. Enforcement authorities should also periodically monitor NPOs which are reasonably suspected of such activities."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00289,2015-05-11-T-023,289,Benedict Tan,"Mdm Speaker, I stand in support of the MAS (Amendment) Bill. Singapore has grown significantly over the past decade or so to become one of the world's leading wealth management centres. This growth reflects the trust that high net worth individuals have in Singapore. And this trust is precious and hard earned. Singapore must defend her reputation for being a well-regulated financial centre that abides by international standards for anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00290,2015-05-11-T-023,290,Benedict Tan,"With the crackdown on corruption intensifying in China and Indonesia and with the expanding grip of ISIS, the Bill could not be more timely. I would however, like to make two observations"
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00291,2015-05-11-T-023,291,Benedict Tan,"One, the codification of customer due diligence requirements is certainly a large step in the right direction. We have heard stories of how businesses have migrated from one financial institution to another, in search of lower account opening due diligence requirements. Some have experienced how one bank might ask fewer questions about the provenance of funds compared to another bank. How will MAS ensure that the playing field is level for all banks, and that there are no loopholes or leakages?"
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00292,2015-05-11-T-023,292,Benedict Tan,"Two, stepping up international cooperation and information exchange is important given the increased cross border mobility of capital. However, banking confidentiality, which has been an important foundation of success, continues to be critical. We must safeguard against spurious international requests, and also safeguard bona fide client confidentiality. In addition to paragraph 30Z on the Conditions for Provision of Assistance to AML/CFT authority, can the House be provided with more concrete details about how these safeguards will work in practice?"
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00293,2015-05-11-T-023,293,Arthur Fong,"Mdm Speaker, I declare my interest as a professional working in the banking industry. I spoke in the House during the Second Reading of the amendment of the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act (TSOFA) in 2013. The amendments were to increase the maximum fine for terrorism financing offences, to make tipping off an offence, to protect the identity of informers, to refine the exemption provisions and to consolidate the terrorism financing provisions under TSOFA. Singapore has, over the last few years, aligned the Banking Act and the Insurance Act as well. These reviews and updating of our laws show our commitment to fight money laundering and to counter terrorism financing."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00294,2015-05-11-T-023,294,Arthur Fong,"We are a fast developing pre-eminent financial centre. Over the years, the financial sector has seen an exponential increase in the transactions and an increase in players in the form of financial institutions globally operating in and through our front yard. The Government and the regulators have put in place a tough regime that includes much of the prudence I spoke of during the Second reading of TSOFA amendments. I liken the regulators to be the constructors of a shark net protecting the swimmers in a lagoon. They are also the lifeguards, the inspectors of the nets and the ones keeping up-to-date with technology and innovation to improve the reliability of the shark nets and, therefore, the safety of the swimmers."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00295,2015-05-11-T-023,295,Arthur Fong,"Our financial sector is the lagoon that financial professionals and financial institutions operate in. Sharks are known to penetrate shark nets and cause serious injuries to swimmers and fatal attacks are not rare. Translate that into our financial sector, an important engine of Singapore's survival, it would damage our reputation as a financial centre. To not have AML and CFT elements penetrate our strict standards and regime is unrealistic."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00296,2015-05-11-T-023,296,Arthur Fong,The proposed amendments to the MAS Act will once again show our commitment to be part of the international effort to fight money laundering and counter financing of terrorism. The amendments will further place Singapore in the forefront in banking supervision and demonstrate our commitment to be a pre-eminent financial centre.
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00297,2015-05-11-T-023,297,Arthur Fong,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to touch on three aspects that I feel is important to highlight, which the Bill serves to achieve."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00298,2015-05-11-T-023,298,Arthur Fong,"First, the Act gives MAS the power to conduct AML/CFT inspections to an expanded scope of FIs, particularly holders of stored value facilities and non-bank credit card or charge card issuers. This is an important move in the fight on AML. Ask any banker and they will tell you their antennae are raised if their clients or if they hear from prospective clients that they deal with non-bank financial institutions. In practice, this would trigger enhanced due diligence processes. Bringing into the fold under the Act to regulate such vehicles is to be applauded. Such vehicles count amongst the tools in the arsenal of money launderers."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00299,2015-05-11-T-023,299,Arthur Fong,"The second aspect I would like to touch on is the introduction of ""Assistance to Foreign Authorities and Domestic Authorities for their Supervisory and Actions in respect of Money Laundering, Financing of Terrorism and other Offences"". While I am glad to see that there are legislative safeguards to prevent ""fishing expeditions"" and the abuse by a foreign AML/CFT supervisory body, I would like to hear even more from the Minister, the oversight and administration to ensure that the safeguards are indeed adhered to in practice. Some of the concerns were alluded to by Dr Benedict Tan a moment ago."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00300,2015-05-11-T-023,300,Arthur Fong,"As important as Singapore's financial sector to be part of the global effort in anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing, we must also ensure that this role, this commitment and stance cannot impinge upon the understanding and the branding of Singapore being a banking centre where the clients or would-be clients of FIs place their trust in that their banking and personal information is well guarded."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00301,2015-05-11-T-023,301,Arthur Fong,"Lastly, to have CDD enacted as a primary legislation to be consistent with other jurisdictions also demonstrates our commitment to FATF and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. This would even send a stronger signal to professionals in the industry that CDD and the maintenance of transaction records and the review of the same will ensure that our surveillance ""radar"" is always up. Proper retention and maintenance of records will be a focus when the situation arises where MAS or the foreign supervisors need to carry out investigations related to AML and CFT."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00302,2015-05-11-T-023,302,Arthur Fong,"The current situation where radicalisation and ease of terrorist recruitment, helped by social media, is a concern for many security agencies across the world. Amongst clients that an FI may have, may already have, may exist one or some who may be sympathisers for a particular group or have grown to be sympathisers for a particular group. They may have had a long and cosy banking relationship stretching back many years. CDD and transaction records will certainly throw light into the changes into the account conduct and client behaviour. Madam, I support the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00303,2015-05-11-T-023,303,Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Members who have spoken and for their support of the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00304,2015-05-11-T-023,304,Lawrence Wong,I think all the Members who spoke – all three – highlighted the importance and relevance of ensuring that our anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) laws remain relevant and effective in the face of recent developments. The Members have also raised several issues and I will address them in turn.
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00305,2015-05-11-T-023,305,Lawrence Wong,"First, Dr Benedict Tan asked how MAS can ensure a level playing field for banks with regard to the implementation of customer due diligence requirements. Madam, as I mentioned earlier, detailed customer due diligence requirements are set out in the AML/CFT Notices issued by MAS to financial institutions. The Notices specify what customer due diligence entails and the specific requirements."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00306,2015-05-11-T-023,306,Lawrence Wong,"Mrs Lina Chiam alluded to the fact that these requirements may put banks in a conflicting position between developing and growing their business, and being subject to these regulatory requirements. But, Madam, I would say that all the banks and financial institutions around the world understand that there is a need in today's environment to perform such functions to be able to identify and verify the customer's identity, to screen customers against sanctions list and other published databases. This is not an imposition or additional requirement. This is basic to what a bank should do and it is essential, in fact, in preserving trust and integrity in order to develop the banking sector. In fact, these requirements are benchmarked against international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), as well as industry best practices."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00307,2015-05-11-T-023,307,Lawrence Wong,"MAS supervises the financial institutions for compliance with these Notices. Where deficiencies are identified in a financial institution, MAS will require it to take prompt remedial actions and update MAS on the completion of these remedial actions. MAS may also require the financial institution to appoint an independent third party to certify that the measures have addressed the deficiencies."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00308,2015-05-11-T-023,308,Lawrence Wong,"I would like to assure Members that MAS takes a serious view of any breach of the Notice and will take appropriate regulatory actions. Depending on the severity of the breaches, these range from formal warnings, reprimands, restrictions on operations, financial penalties to the revocation of licences."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00309,2015-05-11-T-023,309,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Arthur Fong likened financial regulators, like the MAS, to builders of a shark net to protect swimmers in a lagoon from the sharks. I would say it is a very vivid analogy. While MAS may be responsible for setting the AML/CFT rules, the integrity of our financial sector is a collective responsibility. Industry stakeholders play a critical role in making sure that these rules translate into an effective regime. We must all work together to make an effective net."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00310,2015-05-11-T-023,310,Lawrence Wong,"Both Mr Fong and Dr Tan asked for more details about how the safeguards for international cooperation will work in practice. Madam, the sharing of information with foreign supervisors is intended to support the effective AML/CFT supervision of international financial groups. While customer information may be relevant in certain cases, information requests will generally relate more to the financial institution itself, such as its policies and procedures, management or control structure information, control lapses that may be identified through inspection and supervisory actions taken against the institution."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00311,2015-05-11-T-023,311,Lawrence Wong,"I had earlier highlighted the key safeguards for ensuring that only bona fide requests are acceded to and that the information shared is kept confidential. To facilitate MAS' assessment, the Act requires that the foreign supervisor be specific on the purpose of the request, the nature of the assistance, and the relevance of the information requested to the foreign supervisor's oversight of the institution it is in charge of. This will address some of the broad requests with tenuous grounds that are typical of the ""fishing expeditions"" that Mr Arthur Fong mentioned."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00312,2015-05-11-T-023,312,Lawrence Wong,"To mitigate the risk of misuse or leakage of the information, the foreign supervisor is required to undertake to safeguard the confidentiality of the information and to use the information only for the specified purpose. MAS will be able to reject any future requests for information by the foreign supervisor if MAS finds that it has breached any of the undertakings."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00313,2015-05-11-T-023,313,Lawrence Wong,"The Act further requires that the information requested be proportionate to and of sufficient importance to the supervisory issues that are raised, and that the matter to which the request relates to should be of sufficient gravity. Based on these criteria, detailed assessments will then be made, taking into account the specific facts of each case. This proportionate approach taken by MAS is provided for in international standards, including those set by FATF."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00314,2015-05-11-T-023,314,Lawrence Wong,"Mrs Lina Chiam mentioned that this MAS Bill has to be taken holistically, together with the ACRA Bill and other enforcement and legal aspects, and I agree that combating money laundering and terrorism financing is really a multi-agency effort and I would like to assure her that we do have an overall multi-agency effort in place to look at this holistically."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00315,2015-05-11-T-023,315,Lawrence Wong,"There is a Steering Committee on AML/CFT. All the various agencies – MHA, MAS and MOF – are involved. On the enforcement side for money laundering and terrorism financing, we have agencies like Police, CAD and CNB, working on this. On the legal side, Ministry of Law and AGC are involved and on the financial side, MAS is the integrated financial supervisor overseeing AML/CFT issues for the entire sector, including the banking, securities and insurance industries. MAS works very closely with other non-financial sector supervisors including the Casino Regulatory Authority and ACRA."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00316,2015-05-11-T-023,316,Lawrence Wong,"This is our whole-of-Government, multi-agency effort. We are not doing this in a piecemeal fashion. We are doing it holistically but, for now, we are presenting the MAS Bill, focusing on the amendments relevant to MAS' role."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00317,2015-05-11-T-023,317,Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I believe I have addressed the questions raised by Members. Once again, I thank the Members who have spoken for their support of the Bill and for their clarifications and I would encourage Members of the House to give their support to the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00318,2015-05-11-T-023,318,Lawrence Wong,"Madam, the amendments will reiterate Singapore's commitment to the global fight against money laundering and terrorism financing. Singapore's financial sector is built on integrity, trust and professionalism. Our continued growth is only possible if we have a clean regime that safeguards legitimate funds and weeds out tainted money."
2015-05-11-T-023-S-00319,2015-05-11-T-023,319,Lawrence Wong,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"

2015-05-11-T-024-S-00325,2015-05-11-T-024,325,Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00326,2015-05-11-T-024,326,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00327,2015-05-11-T-024,327,Josephine Teo,"The Government announced in March 2015 the introduction of Singapore Savings Bonds, a new type of Government security. The Bill before the House amends the Government Securities Act to allow the Government to issue the Savings Bonds as non-tradeable securities, which is a key design of the Savings Bonds to protect individuals from capital loss."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00328,2015-05-11-T-024,328,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00329,2015-05-11-T-024,329,Josephine Teo,"The Government is introducing the Savings Bonds programme to provide individual investors with a long-term savings option that offers safe returns. Unlike in other countries, we do not issue bonds to fund Government expenditure. Where bonds are issued, they are for the purpose of helping to develop the local bond market. The proceeds of these issuances cannot be spent but must be invested instead."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00330,2015-05-11-T-024,330,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00331,2015-05-11-T-024,331,Josephine Teo,"Madam, I will now go through the key features of the Savings Bonds."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00332,2015-05-11-T-024,332,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00333,2015-05-11-T-024,333,Josephine Teo,"Savings Bonds are safe investments, as both the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the Government."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00334,2015-05-11-T-024,334,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00335,2015-05-11-T-024,335,Josephine Teo,"In addition, individuals have the flexibility to redeem their bonds at par from the Government in any given month, which means that they will get back in full the initial purchase price with no risk of capital loss. And, unlike fixed deposits for which early withdrawals means forgone interest payments, holders of the Singapore Savings Bonds get to keep the interest paid out at six-monthly intervals even if they redeem the bond before the full bond tenor."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00336,2015-05-11-T-024,336,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00337,2015-05-11-T-024,337,Josephine Teo,"The interest payments are also designed to ""step-up"" every year, with each year's interest payment being larger than the one before. In the first year, the total interest payments results in an annual interest equivalent to that of a conventional one-year Singapore Government Security, commonly known as SGS. After five years, the average earned interest per year will match the return of a five-year SGS issued at the point of purchase. By the end of the 10th year, the total interest payments results in an average annual interest equivalent to that of a conventional 10-year SGS issued at the point of purchase."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00338,2015-05-11-T-024,338,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00339,2015-05-11-T-024,339,Josephine Teo,"These features mean, in effect, that individuals do not need to commit to the investment period upfront but will still get to enjoy the higher returns of a longer term investment."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00340,2015-05-11-T-024,340,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00341,2015-05-11-T-024,341,Josephine Teo,"The Government will make Savings Bonds easily accessible to individual retail investors  new bonds will be issued every month for at least the next five years. For 2015, the Government could potentially issue between $2 billion to $4 billion of Savings Bonds, depending on demand. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will announce each month's issuance size on the first business day of that month. Individuals can apply for the bonds via ATMs of participating banks, at a transaction fee that is charged by the banks. In any month, individuals will be able to apply for the bonds with as little as $500. For a start, each individual can apply for up to $50,000 per issue and can hold up to $100,000 of Savings Bonds at any point in time. The Government will review these caps if there is a need to after the programme has been in place for some time."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00342,2015-05-11-T-024,342,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00343,2015-05-11-T-024,343,Josephine Teo,"Madam, it is the Government's intention to enable all individuals to have access to the Savings Bonds. There is therefore no need to rush and buy these bonds. If total applications exceed the total issuance size in a particular month, the MAS will allocate bonds to all applicants in increasing multiples of $500. The allocation to each individual will stop when the individual gets the full amount applied for, or when all the available bonds have been allocated, whichever comes first. This means that smaller applications will have a higher chance of receiving the full allotment, and individuals with larger applications may not get the full amount that they have applied for."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00344,2015-05-11-T-024,344,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00345,2015-05-11-T-024,345,Josephine Teo,"Madam, let me now go on to explain the amendment in the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00346,2015-05-11-T-024,346,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00347,2015-05-11-T-024,347,Josephine Teo,The Government Securities Act currently allows Government securities to be transferred and pledged. This means that securities-holders can freely transfer ownership to other parties or trade the securities in the open market. The Bill proposes an amendment to allow the Government to impose restrictions on such transfers and pledges in future new issues. This change will allow Savings Bonds to be issued as non-tradeable securities.
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00348,2015-05-11-T-024,348,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00349,2015-05-11-T-024,349,Josephine Teo,"The change is necessary to protect individuals from capital losses. When interest rates rise, instead of selling the bonds in the open market at a price that is possibly lower than the purchase price, individuals are assured of getting their full capital back should they decide to redeem the bonds with the Government. On the other hand, when market interest rates fall, while bond-holders will not enjoy possible price appreciation or capital gain, they would benefit from the higher-than-market interest rates of their existing Savings Bonds which had been locked in at the point of purchase."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00350,2015-05-11-T-024,350,Josephine Teo,
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00351,2015-05-11-T-024,351,Josephine Teo,"The restrictions on transfers and pledges of Government securities will be set out in the terms of issue for the Savings Bonds. Conventional SGS are not affected, and will remain tradeable."

This amendment to the Government Securities Act facilitates the issuance of a new class of non-tradeable securities to the public."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00357,2015-05-11-T-024,357,Liang Eng Hwa,"I support the amendments and the ensuing introduction of the Saving Bonds. There are three reasons why. Firstly, it is an investment with almost zero risk of default; being issued by an ""AAA"" rated sovereign. It will appeal to investors with very low risk appetite. Secondly, it offers holders of the bond a long-term Government bond yield pick-up and at an affordable denomination of just $500. Thirdly, it does not impose penalty or price risk should investors need to encash the bond before the 10 years maturity; yet enjoy interest coupons even when redeem earlier. In other words, it allows investors to enjoy the higher interest rate premium from the longer end of the yield curve without having to give up on liquidity."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00358,2015-05-11-T-024,358,Liang Eng Hwa,"In this day and age where markets are volatile and full of surprises; and where investment products are increasingly complex, the Saving Bonds is just what some financially less literate individuals would need; the peace of mind of a safe credit and a steady stream of returns with flexible redemption options."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00359,2015-05-11-T-024,359,Liang Eng Hwa,"Given the simplicity of Government issued Saving Bonds, we can expect investors to be spared the many pages of terms and conditions of a typical investment product as well as both the fine and the bold prints."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00360,2015-05-11-T-024,360,Liang Eng Hwa,"Of course, the other plus is that the transaction cost for such investment is likely to be lower than those offered by financial institutions. Hence, it is most suited to ordinary investors who just want a simple and low-cost investment alternative with reasonable returns and flexible tenures for their financial planning as well as to meet their long-term retirement needs."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00361,2015-05-11-T-024,361,Liang Eng Hwa,"Currently, the closest comparable is the Singapore Government Securities (SGS), which comes in higher denominations and investors would have to take the price risk when it is sold, as the bond is traded in the secondary market."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00362,2015-05-11-T-024,362,Liang Eng Hwa,"From a risk-return analysis stand point, the Saving Bond is certainly of more value than SGS as it comes with a free put option for investors to put the bond back to the Government if they need the cash. In market terms, this is known as the ""free lunch"" part of the Saving Bond. When the bond is being put, investors still get the returns for the shorter tenure they hold."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00363,2015-05-11-T-024,363,Liang Eng Hwa,"Given this free put option feature, I agree that the bond should be targeted and limited to individual investors and not to institutional investors."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00364,2015-05-11-T-024,364,Liang Eng Hwa,"Also, there is a need for the cap as otherwise we may potentially see a huge surge in bank deposit withdrawals due to the attractiveness of the Saving Bonds. The implication is that it may push up bank interest rates and result in a tighter monetary condition in the financial system."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00365,2015-05-11-T-024,365,Liang Eng Hwa,"While it is mostly pluses of the Saving Bonds, I would like to point out a few areas where investors of Savings Bond ought to take note of. Firstly, the interest rate for the bond is fixed at the time of the purchase and does not change for the life of the bond. So, in a rising interest rate or rising inflation environment, the return of the bond might not keep up with inflation or with rising interest rates. Of course, if the investors of the Saving Bonds take the view that interest rate or the inflation is rising, the investors can early redeem the bond and re-invest later when the rates increase. But that would require investors to understand the interest rate markets; which is not something that is easy for a layman to understand. Hence, I hope that Government would consider to also issue inflation-linked bonds in future so that there is a safe avenue for retirement savers to hedge the inflation risk other than by way of investing in stocks or property which comes with downside risks."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00366,2015-05-11-T-024,366,Liang Eng Hwa,"Secondly, based on current SGS yields, the CPF rates still offer better returns. It still makes sense to save most of the retirement money in CPF LIFE. However, in times of changing interest rates environment, retiring investors may need guidance as to whether they should maximise their savings in CPF or withdraw some of the funds to invest in the Saving Bonds."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00367,2015-05-11-T-024,367,Liang Eng Hwa,"During the Ministry of Manpower Committee of Supply debate, I am glad to learn that the Government will be providing guided one-to-one retirement planning service for CPF members approaching retirement. Saving Bonds should feature as another instrument in the portfolio of retirement planning and the guidance will be helpful to CPF members who are approaching retirement."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00368,2015-05-11-T-024,368,Liang Eng Hwa,"I have a few questions for the Senior Minister of State. Firstly, can the Saving Bonds be transferred or inherited by their beneficiaries should the investors pass away? Secondly, how would the Government intend to use the funds raised from the Saving Bonds if they are given the money condition may not have the opportunities where the Government could invest at a return higher than what the bond is paying and whether there will be also an overall cap as a proportion to the Government total debt? Thirdly, would the statutory boards also consider issuing Saving Bonds in future?"
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00369,2015-05-11-T-024,369,Liang Eng Hwa,"Mdm Speaker, with our society ageing rapidly and individuals needing to save even more due to increasing longevity as well as in anticipation of rising cost of healthcare, the Saving Bonds is a thoughtful initiative by the Government to help Singaporeans better plan for retirement and is another compelling investment alternative worth considering for the public at large. Madam, I support the Amendment Bill."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00370,2015-05-11-T-024,370,Yee Jenn Jong,"Mdm Speaker, as the Senior Minister of State has explained, the amendment to this Bill is to prepare for the recently announced Government Singapore Saving Bonds. The Senior Minister of State has also explained the mechanisms of the Saving Bonds. These bonds have a 10-year term with step-up interest and which rates are linked to the long-term Singapore Government Securities (SGS) rates. Unlike existing SGS, the new Saving Bonds will not be transferable, hence, necessitating this amendment to the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00371,2015-05-11-T-024,371,Yee Jenn Jong,"Madam, I support the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00372,2015-05-11-T-024,372,Yee Jenn Jong,"Interest rates in Singapore have been low. The average member of the public has few alternatives to invest in very safe asset classes to meet their long-term financial goals and to save extra for retirement needs. Yields on bank savings have been extremely low. Fixed-term deposits, or FDs, with banks have slightly better rates but are of relatively short duration of up to around two years. Even with their better yields, fixed-term deposit rates from banks have lagged behind inflation rate for many years already."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00373,2015-05-11-T-024,373,Yee Jenn Jong,"Corporate bonds have better yields, but most required investments of $250,000 and above per transaction. More retail corporate bonds have recently been launched since changes to our policy on corporate bonds which have made it easier for companies to issue retail bonds. But interest by companies to issue such bonds is still low. There are also risks in corporate bonds as they are primarily based on the financial stability of the issuing company. Ten-year SGS, whose recent yield has been between 2% and 3% per annum, can already be purchased on tranches of $1,000 and above. However, there appears to be low interest in SGS by retail investors. Not many understand the mechanism and how to trade this on the secondary market, if they wish to cash out before the maturity, plus there may be capital loss when sold on the secondary market."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00374,2015-05-11-T-024,374,Yee Jenn Jong,"In the search for better returns on savings in this period of low interest rates and high liquidity, many small investors have dabbled in risky investments or penny stocks without fully understanding the risks, with some losing a good part of their hard-earned savings while trying to beat returns from bank savings. The to-be-launched Singapore Savings Bond is, therefore, a useful new instrument that can help the average small investor save for the long term and get yields close to inflation rate. Investors should keep the Savings Bonds to maturity to maximise the returns but can sell back to the Government at any time at a lower interest rate, depending on the durations that the bonds had been kept for. They act like FDs offered by the banks but have more flexibility in withdrawals. The Singapore Savings Bonds could push banks to work harder on making their FDs more competitive."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00375,2015-05-11-T-024,375,Yee Jenn Jong,I have three questions for the Senior Minister of State regarding these Savings Bonds.
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00376,2015-05-11-T-024,376,Yee Jenn Jong,"First, I would like to know what will happen should a person who owns such Savings Bonds passes on. The Bonds will form part of his estate. However, this Bill makes such Bonds non-transferable. These Bonds would then have to be sold back to the Government and the monies returned to the estate. However, the family members would then lose the advantage of the step-up interest rates. Can the Bonds be transferable in the event of death if one wishes to hold on to the Bonds received through inheritance? Are there special circumstances where the Bonds can be made transferable?"
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00377,2015-05-11-T-024,377,Yee Jenn Jong,"Second, I would like to know how investors' education would be conducted with the launch of the Savings Bonds and how purchases can be made easily. I think the Bonds can encourage people with spare cash to save more for retirement in a safe instrument while maintaining the flexibility to cash out on the investments if needed. It would be a pity if the take-up rate is low due to a lack of understanding of the product and also due to maybe difficulties in purchase. The Bonds can be sold through existing financial institutions, as the Senior Minister of State has said. Are incentives attractive enough for banks to promote these Bonds, given that they may sell other instruments that may pay better commissions but may be riskier for investors? Furthermore, the Savings Bonds compete directly with FDs offered by the banks. So, banks may not be interested to market these."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00378,2015-05-11-T-024,378,Yee Jenn Jong,"Third, I understand from reports that there is a cap on the amount that can be invested on the Savings Bonds by any persons. I would like to know how the cap will be set because, if it is set too low, it may not be attractive enough to encourage retail investors to bother with yet another investment to keep track of. If yields on the Savings Bonds are equivalent to the SGS 10-year bonds, may I know why there is a need to restrict the amount that can be invested by any one person? Thank you."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00379,2015-05-11-T-024,379,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Government Securities (Amendment) Bill. We know the main reason for this deck of amendments is to facilitate the issuance of the Singapore Savings Bond. I applaud this move by the Government to introduce this ""first-of-its-kind"" and ""one-of-its-kind"" financial instrument for the benefit of the people of Singapore."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00380,2015-05-11-T-024,380,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I recall after the sub-prime crisis in 2008 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers that many Singaporeans, including numerous organisations, suffered deep and painful monetary losses. Those affected delved into products, such as the High Notes and Pinnacle Notes, which were actually instruments whose risks were not apparent to many investors. Many Singaporeans burnt a big hole in their pocket thinking that 4% to 5% returns placed them in better stead for the same period than in fixed deposits and other structured instruments."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00381,2015-05-11-T-024,381,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Since that saga, I believe many local investors have become more apprehensive and careful with the rich diversity of financial products available in the local market. There have also been many who have urged the Government to offer alternative savings plans, other than the CPF, which can afford security and guaranteed returns but allow for flexibility and liquidity. It is with this as a backdrop that this Bill is introduced and comes, with it, the new Singapore Savings Bond which will be introduced later this year to offer a new instrument which is safe, secure, guaranteed, flexible and yet affordable for the general populace to benefit and save their excess cash for a rainy day."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00382,2015-05-11-T-024,382,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,There are three reasons why I strongly support the introduction of these amendments and the Singapore Savings Bond.
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00383,2015-05-11-T-024,383,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Firstly, the building of retirement savings. The step-up interest provided under the Singapore Savings Bond encourages savings for the longer term yet does not penalise early termination nor withdrawals which sometimes are done for exigencies or a sudden need for cash. This will also fill the lacuna of fixed deposits which are traditionally for one to two and, sometimes, three-year periods. It also provides a much better yield than putting your cash into savings account whose interests rates are a far cry and pale in comparison with the payoffs from the Singapore Savings Bonds."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00384,2015-05-11-T-024,384,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Secondly, principal protection and it is flexible. Laudably, it is going to be a low-risk and safe long-term savings instrument for excess cash. The Singapore Savings Bonds will be backed by the Government and will not be traded and there is no risk that an investor gets back less than his investment. The flexibility also gives Singapore Savings Bonds an edge over a fixed deposit with a bank, which pays no interest if the principal is withdrawn before the account's maturity."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00385,2015-05-11-T-024,385,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"With the potentially low tranches and denominations of $500, many Singaporeans will be able to benefit from it. In particular, many middle-income Singaporeans, especially Professionals, Managers and Executives, and those who have cash in bank which they set aside for rainy days, can utilise this long term and secured savings instrument and benefit from the steady interest payouts. This is particularly so as there is a cap in the amount which a person can lock into his CPF account as well as the Supplementary Retirement Scheme. Having this new instrument will provide more options and encourage more Singaporeans to build up their nest egg in a safe and flexible manner. This will also circumvent the unnecessary risks associated with instruments like those affected during the 2008 and 2009 financial crises."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00386,2015-05-11-T-024,386,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Thirdly, there is no lock-in period and it is liquid. What is most attractive about this Savings Bond is that there will be no lock-in period as they are going to be issued at regular intervals and can be redeemed the same. There are also no penalties and one still earns the accrued interests for early redemption. This will offer strong liquidity and also peace of mind for Singaporeans who place their monies in them."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00387,2015-05-11-T-024,387,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Albeit a great boon for Singaporeans, I have some reservations and questions which I urge the Senior Minister of State to address and answer."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00388,2015-05-11-T-024,388,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"From a macro perspective, I wish to know the costs and estimated budget involved in running this scheme and issuance of this new instrument as it is not clearly forecasted. Is it going to be sustainable for the Government to run this scheme in the long term?"
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00389,2015-05-11-T-024,389,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Bankers and analysts have shared that there is, in fact, no need for the Government to raise capital this way. As such, I am concerned how the monies from these bonds will be utilised and how is the Government to hedge for market and economic fluctuations."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00390,2015-05-11-T-024,390,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"How will the Singapore Savings Bond adjust and reflect market sentiments, especially when interest rates rise much above the coupon rate and in instances where they fall rock bottom or when inflation propels? With guaranteed and fixed interest payouts, how is the Singapore Savings Bond going to stay true to its credo of being flexible, safe and protected? On this note, I agree with hon Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa's suggestion of having inflation rate-linked bonds as well."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00391,2015-05-11-T-024,391,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"From a micro and individual investor point of view, it has not been shared how much the cap on the Savings Bond for each individual will be. I hope that all Singaporeans will be able to tap on this savings scheme and the cap be at a level which will benefit all Singaporeans, including those who have excess cash which they want to save for the longer term."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00392,2015-05-11-T-024,392,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I am also urging if Government can allow SRS monies be used to purchase these bonds since, unlike CPF monies, SRS monies left with the bank earn a meagre interest rate."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00393,2015-05-11-T-024,393,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"In the same vein, I want to clarify that the interest earned from these bonds will not be taxable. If, indeed, they are going to be taxable, I urge the Government to consider rendering these special Savings Bond interests be made non-taxable to encourage savings."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00394,2015-05-11-T-024,394,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Finally, I hope the Government will make the purchase and redemption of these bonds easy and accessible by all Singaporeans and only Singaporeans. The passing of this Act and introduction of this bond is a milestone. But the follow-through, implementation and execution will be crucial as the beneficiaries are individual Singaporeans. I urge the Government to enhance the communication of this product so that even more Singaporeans can be made aware and benefit from this scheme, particularly the middle-income and PMEs and any Singaporean who have cash to save for a rainy day."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00395,2015-05-11-T-024,395,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Mdm Speaker, in Mandarin."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00396,2015-05-11-T-024,396,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] With the amendment of this Bill, what is called ""Singapore Savings Bonds"" will be launched in the second half of this year."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00397,2015-05-11-T-024,397,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The Savings Bonds have three benefits. First, it is a low-risk investment instrument. Second, it is also a low-cost instrument which you can invest in with as little as $500, and this will benefit many middle-income PMEs. Third, it is a flexible investment option which allows you to redeem at any time, and you will not suffer any losses from early redemption."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00398,2015-05-11-T-024,398,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The Savings Bonds is aimed at encouraging Singaporeans to make long-term investment and prepare for the rainy days by having another source of fund after retirement. The longer you hold, the higher the return. I would like to urge the Government to let Singaporeans know as soon as possible how to purchase the Bonds and what the caps will be, and encourage Singaporeans to use this instrument as a long-term saving option."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00399,2015-05-11-T-024,399,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"(In English) 	I look forward to more details about the Singapore Savings Bond which should be issued in the coming months. I believe the Singapore Savings Bond will combine the flexibility of a short-term investment, the affordability of a low-cost product, and the stability of a long-term Government Bond, and help Singaporeans build their nest egg."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00400,2015-05-11-T-024,400,Speaker,Senior Minister of State Josephine Teo.
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00401,2015-05-11-T-024,401,Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Yee Jenn Jong and Mr Patrick Tay for their comments on the Bill. Let me address the points raised by the Members, together with some of the feedback that we have received from the public, on the Savings Bonds programme."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00402,2015-05-11-T-024,402,Josephine Teo,"First, I would like to assure Members of the House and the public that the programme will not adversely impact the Government's finances. All proceeds from bond issuances cannot be spent but are instead invested. As a result, Government's assets will increase by the same amount as its liabilities, leaving the reserves unchanged. Overall, as a Government, we continue to maintain our strong net asset position, and expect the returns from investments to cover the interest cost of the bonds."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00403,2015-05-11-T-024,403,Josephine Teo,"Additionally, the liquidity risk from the programme will be manageable as the total issuance is not expected to add significantly to the size of total Government borrowings. In any case, total Government borrowings will be kept within the limit authorised by Parliament under the Government Securities Act."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00404,2015-05-11-T-024,404,Josephine Teo,"Mr Liang has asked if Statutory Boards will consider issuing Savings Bonds. The proceeds from bonds issued by Statutory Boards are used primarily to meet payments of development projects on a continuing basis. It may, therefore, be difficult for them to manage the liquidity required by the flexible early redemption feature of the Savings Bonds."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00405,2015-05-11-T-024,405,Josephine Teo,"Mr Liang has pointed out that the cap on individuals' holdings of Savings Bonds will mitigate the programme's impact on the banking system. In addition, we expect the programme size to be small relative to total bank deposits, and the impact on the banking system is, therefore, likely to be limited."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00406,2015-05-11-T-024,406,Josephine Teo,I will now move on to address the questions raised on the features of the Savings Bonds.
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00407,2015-05-11-T-024,407,Josephine Teo,"Mr Tay has asked how the Savings Bonds will reflect market sentiments and remain flexible, safe and protected when there are market interest rate movements and changes in inflation."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00408,2015-05-11-T-024,408,Josephine Teo,"Like conventional SGS, the interest rates on Savings Bonds are set to compensate for expected future inflation. But interest rates on such bonds may not offer full protection against unexpected inflation. However, the key difference from conventional bonds is that holders of Savings Bonds enjoy full protection from price depreciation or capital losses. In the case of conventional bonds, which are tradable, prices fluctuate with interest rate changes. During a period of rising inflation expectations, interest rates may adjust upwards and cause the prices of conventional bonds to fall. Savings Bonds, however, can always be redeemed at the initial purchase price. This full-redemption feature of Savings Bonds prevents such rising inflation expectations from eroding the value of the savings."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00409,2015-05-11-T-024,409,Josephine Teo,"I should add that the redemption and interest on Savings Bonds are guaranteed by the Government, which has received ""AAA"" credit ratings from international credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Moody's consistently since 2003. It is therefore a very safe investment option."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00410,2015-05-11-T-024,410,Josephine Teo,"Mr Tay has noted that Savings Bonds have a fixed interest rate schedule, which provides greater certainty to individuals as the interest income will not fluctuate with market movements. It is fixed, it is logged in at the point of issue, the schedule is known to the person buying the Savings Bonds. And even if there are market changes in interest rates, that schedule will be honoured. When market interest rates fall, existing bond-holders will therefore benefit from receiving higher-than-market interest rates. On the other hand, when interest rates rise, bond-holders can make use of the flexibility of the early redemption feature to redeem their bonds if they wish to do so. They can then re-invest the proceeds in the new issues of the Savings Bonds."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00411,2015-05-11-T-024,411,Josephine Teo,"We have also received some feedback from the public on whether the Savings Bonds can be floating-rate bonds, where the interest rates move with the market. Some have also asked if new Savings Bonds can be issued to existing bond-holders automatically when interest rates rise."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00412,2015-05-11-T-024,412,Josephine Teo,The Government has carefully considered and decided against including these two features in the design of the Savings Bonds. Let me explain why.
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00413,2015-05-11-T-024,413,Josephine Teo,"First, issuing floating-rate bonds creates more uncertainty for the individuals, as there would be both upward and downward movements over time. And, as I explained earlier, in a rising interest rate environment, the bond-holder can redeem his existing Savings Bonds at the initial purchase price and re-invest the proceeds by applying for new issues of the Savings Bonds. In this way, he can potentially enjoy higher interest rates without having to face the downside risks of floating interest rates."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00414,2015-05-11-T-024,414,Josephine Teo,"Second, an automatic rollover into new Savings Bonds may not be beneficial for all bond-holders. To illustrate, take a 10-year Savings Bond issued in January 2016 that will earn 2.5% interest per annum if held to the full 10 years. Let us say that in the first year, this bond earns 0.9% and the interest rate will step up to 1.9% by the fifth year. Suppose in the fifth year, the bond-holder could also purchase a new 10-year Savings Bond issued at 3% interest which pays a first year interest of 1%. This is clearly not an attractive option, compared to the 1.9% he is already getting on his existing bond by then. Even if the first-year interest rate of a new issue was attractive in comparison, the bond-holder may prefer to hold on to the existing bond because the interest payment is due shortly – and he would like to be able to use the money, or wait for even higher interest rates before switching. Therefore, the choice of whether to redeem existing Savings Bonds and apply for new issues with higher interest rates will be better left to the individual bond-holders than to have the Government automatically roll it over."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00415,2015-05-11-T-024,415,Josephine Teo,"To reiterate, the design of the Savings Bonds is expected to offer a safe savings option for individuals while also allowing them the flexibility to redeem their bonds in any given month. It may not be an inflation-linked bond as Mr Liang and Mr Tay have asked the Government to consider, but in effect, the full-redemption features allow bond-holders to mitigate against risks of soaring inflation and higher interest rates."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00416,2015-05-11-T-024,416,Josephine Teo,"On a related note, some people have also asked if Savings Bonds offer good returns, compared to existing savings and investment options."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00417,2015-05-11-T-024,417,Josephine Teo,Mr Tay will be pleased to know that the interest received on Savings Bonds will be tax-exempt.
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00418,2015-05-11-T-024,418,Josephine Teo,"The returns on Savings Bonds are pegged to the market yields of conventional Singapore Government Securities, commonly known as SGS. The full interest rate schedule for each bond will be announced by MAS when the application period opens each month. Over the past 10 years, the 10-year SGS yield has generally been between 2% to 3%. Compared to SGS, the Savings Bonds offer attractive returns, considering the additional benefits of capital-guarantee and flexible redemption. Mr Liang has characterised this as a ""free lunch"". There are very few ""free lunches""."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00419,2015-05-11-T-024,419,Josephine Teo,"We expect that the interest rates paid by the Savings Bonds would be higher than that of shorter-term fixed deposits but lower than the longer-term CPF monies. Savings Bonds are thus meant to complement, and not replace, existing instruments like fixed deposits, bonds and equities. Mr Yee also talked about corporate bonds. But I should add that the other investment options carry varying levels of risk which investors ought to familiarise themselves with before plunging in."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00420,2015-05-11-T-024,420,Josephine Teo,Mr Tay has also asked that investors be allowed to use their Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) monies to buy Savings Bonds. Others have pointed out that CPF monies cannot be used. The Government will consider the suggestion of allowing SRS or CPF monies to be used to buy Savings Bonds. It makes sense to start the Savings Bonds with cash purchases as it complements the CPF scheme. There are also ongoing reviews to provide CPF members more investment options. We will consider all these in totality.
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00421,2015-05-11-T-024,421,Josephine Teo,"To address Mr Liang and Mr Yee's query, the Government will allow Savings Bonds to be transferable to beneficiaries in the event of death of a bond-holder. Such transfers can be effected in full, without being constrained by the cap on individual holdings. However, a beneficiary will not be able to apply for new Savings Bonds if his total holdings exceed the cap, until maturity or redemption of the existing bonds brings him below the cap."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00422,2015-05-11-T-024,422,Josephine Teo,"Mr Tay and Mr Yee have also noted the importance of communicating the details of the Savings Bonds programme to the public. To ensure that Singaporeans are aware of the features and application process of Savings Bonds, MAS will be conducting a public education campaign through the media and its industry partners. A dedicated website will also be set up for the public to obtain information on Savings Bonds, and a public hotline to answer enquiries."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00423,2015-05-11-T-024,423,Josephine Teo,"The Government intends to make Savings Bonds accessible to all Singaporeans, and have linked up with the three local banks to widen the outreach. But I assure Mr Yee we are not only depending on the banks for the outreach. As you heard earlier, we will have our own website and our own public education campaign."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00424,2015-05-11-T-024,424,Josephine Teo,"As to why there is a cap on individual holdings, it is precisely to allow as many individuals as possible to gain access to the Savings Bonds. Otherwise, they could be concentrated in the hands of a small number of savvy investors. Nonetheless, the Government can review the caps after a period of time when patterns of demand have had the opportunity to stabilise."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00425,2015-05-11-T-024,425,Josephine Teo,"In conclusion, the Savings Bonds are a new type of Singapore Government Securities designed to offer individuals a long-term, flexible savings option with safe returns. They will provide individuals with more options to save and invest to meet their long-term financial needs. The proposed Government Securities (Amendment) Bill will allow Savings Bonds to be issued as non-tradable securities to protect individuals from capital losses."
2015-05-11-T-024-S-00426,2015-05-11-T-024,426,Josephine Teo,"I thank Members once again for their support of the Bill. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move."

2015-05-11-T-025-S-00438,2015-05-11-T-025,438,Lui Tuck Yew,"Unmanned aircraft, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have become affordable and accessible to the general public. Recreational flying of unmanned aircraft is fast gaining popularity."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00439,2015-05-11-T-025,439,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00440,2015-05-11-T-025,440,Lui Tuck Yew,"Organisations, including Government agencies, are also increasingly tapping on the capabilities of unmanned aircraft for commercial purposes, such as for aerial advertising and event photography and filming, and for specialised services, such as search and rescue, as well as surveillance and inspection."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00441,2015-05-11-T-025,441,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00442,2015-05-11-T-025,442,Lui Tuck Yew,"To develop a balanced and sustainable regulatory framework that encourages the safe and responsible use of unmanned aircraft by both public sector agencies and private companies, the Ministry of Transport had set up a few months ago a multi-agency Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Committee. This UAS Committee has been engaging stakeholders to facilitate proof-of-concept trials and innovative use of unmanned aircraft by public sector agencies."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00443,2015-05-11-T-025,443,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00444,2015-05-11-T-025,444,Lui Tuck Yew,"The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, for example, will soon have an extra pair of ""eyes"" to assess oil spills at sea, in the form of an unmanned aircraft which can be deployed from its patrol boats. The Home Team agencies are looking at unmanned aircraft usage to enhance their response during emergencies and incidents. Other uses of unmanned aircraft being explored include safety inspection of cranes at work sites and monitoring of vast areas of state land, waterbodies, pipelines and off-shore structures."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00445,2015-05-11-T-025,445,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00446,2015-05-11-T-025,446,Lui Tuck Yew,"Unmanned aircraft can, however, pose public safety and security risks. Members may remember the case in which an unmanned aircraft crashed and injured a triathlete in Australia last year. Just last month, an unmanned aircraft with radioactive substance landed on the roof of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office. In the United States, flights of drones over a concert had sparked safety concerns. In Singapore too, there have been several episodes of unsafe use of unmanned aircraft, but thankfully, there were no deaths or injuries or damage to property. But we might not always be so lucky."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00447,2015-05-11-T-025,447,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00448,2015-05-11-T-025,448,Lui Tuck Yew,"Clear rules on the use of unmanned aircraft will enhance safe and responsible operation of the aircraft. It will allow us to facilitate innovative uses like the ones I mentioned earlier, while mitigating the risks to public safety and security. It is for this reason that the Air Navigation Act (Cap. 6) (ANA) and the Public Order Act (Cap. 257A) (POA) are being amended by way of the Unmanned Aircraft (Public Safety and Security) Bill 2015."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00449,2015-05-11-T-025,449,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00450,2015-05-11-T-025,450,Lui Tuck Yew,"Let me highlight the key amendments in the Bill. First, the amendments to the Air Navigation Act (ANA). The new section 2A will make a person who flies or operates an unmanned aircraft from outside Singapore liable for the new offences under sections 7, 7A, 7B and 7C of the ANA, as if the person had been in Singapore when committing the offence. This is to cater to the scenario where an unmanned aircraft may be flown into Singapore from outside Singapore."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00451,2015-05-11-T-025,451,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00452,2015-05-11-T-025,452,Lui Tuck Yew,"The Minister for Transport will publish in the Government Gazette a list of security-sensitive areas as protected areas under section 7. Examples of such locations are the Istana, Parliament House, Supreme Court, Jurong Island, and military camps and bases. A new section 7A will prohibit unmanned aircraft flights over these protected areas. Section 7 will also prohibit the taking of photographs, from an unmanned aircraft, of these protected areas, unless a permit is obtained."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00453,2015-05-11-T-025,453,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00454,2015-05-11-T-025,454,Lui Tuck Yew,"A new section 7B will absolutely prohibit an unmanned aircraft from carrying any arms, explosives, munitions of war, bio-chemical, nuclear substances, or hazardous substances. A new section 7C will prohibit the discharge of any substance from an unmanned aircraft without a permit."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00455,2015-05-11-T-025,455,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00456,2015-05-11-T-025,456,Lui Tuck Yew,"A new section 29G will allow a safety inspector authorised by CAAS, senior police officers, or an auxiliary police officer authorised by the Commissioner of Police, to order the operator of an unmanned aircraft to (i) end the flight; (ii) land the unmanned aircraft; or (iii) fly the unmanned aircraft in a specified manner, if the unmanned aircraft is being operated in a manner that poses a serious and imminent risk to the safety of the public. The enforcers are also given powers to assume control of an unmanned aircraft in order to end the flight of the aircraft, or land it safely and detain it or any component of the unmanned aircraft system."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00457,2015-05-11-T-025,457,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00458,2015-05-11-T-025,458,Lui Tuck Yew,"Sections 3 and 3A are expanded to allow CAAS to make laws on the operation of unmanned aircraft, including indoor operation of such aircraft, to ensure public safety. Section 4M of the ANA is amended to provide greater clarity on the powers of CAAS' safety inspectors to require the attendance of witnesses and the process for taking of statements."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00459,2015-05-11-T-025,459,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00460,2015-05-11-T-025,460,Lui Tuck Yew,"Let me now highlight the key amendments to the Public Order Act (POA). Section 26 of the POA is amended to prohibit unmanned aircraft from entering special events venues, except where a permit has been obtained from the Singapore Police Force. A new section 32(2) will also make it an offence for an unmanned aircraft to be operated in a manner that disrupts or interferes with the conduct of an activity associated with the special event, whether in or outside the special event area. Examples of special event areas could include venues of major events where big crowds are expected, such as the Sports Hub or the Padang and their vicinity during the National Day Parade, and the venues of the Southeast Asian Games. Police officers and auxiliary police officers can be authorised by the Commissioner of Police to exercise enforcement powers under the new section 32A similar to those I have described earlier."

The penalty for each of the other offences under the Bill is a fine not exceeding $20,000 or a jail term not exceeding 12 months or both."

2015-05-11-T-025-S-00464,2015-05-11-T-025,464,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, unmanned aircraft can transform the way we do our jobs in many industries. It has the potential to increase productivity and efficiency, and enhance the effectiveness of our services and operations. However, given Singapore's busy airspace and densely populated urban environment, unmanned aircraft operators need to ensure that they operate the unmanned aircraft safely and responsibly, exercising due care and concern for others."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00465,2015-05-11-T-025,465,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00466,2015-05-11-T-025,466,Lui Tuck Yew,"In this regard, the proposed Bill provides a clear regulatory framework for unmanned aircraft operations, to safeguard public safety and security. The UAS Committee will continue its work to improve and refine this framework in order to strike an even better balance across safety, security and other concerns while facilitating unmanned aircraft operations. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00467,2015-05-11-T-025,467,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00468,2015-05-11-T-025,468,Lui Tuck Yew,Question proposed.
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00469,2015-05-11-T-025,469,Ang Wei Neng,(
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00470,2015-05-11-T-025,470,Ang Wei Neng,"With technology improvements, drones are getting cheaper too. A popular China-made DJI drone, for example, costs as low as $1,200 and has very good functions. Many even consider it worthy for commercial use."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00471,2015-05-11-T-025,471,Ang Wei Neng,"Drones can help to solve many problems and create new opportunities. However, drones could also cause problems if the drone operators harbour bad intentions. On 29 April 2015, Katsu, a popular graffiti artist, used a drone to discharge red paint to vandalize one of the largest outdoor billboards in New York City. Section 7C of the Bill will prohibit the discharge of any substance from an unmanned aircraft."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00472,2015-05-11-T-025,472,Ang Wei Neng,"On 9 May 2015, a UK newspaper reported that an American tourist was trying to fly a drone close to Windsor Castle to take photographs. Fortunately, he was caught in time. Section7A of the Bill provides the MOT the authority to declare a list of security-sensitive areas as protected areas, and prohibit drones from flying over them or take aerial photographs of the protected areas without a permit."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00473,2015-05-11-T-025,473,Ang Wei Neng,These two separate incidents show the importance and timeliness of the Bill.
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00474,2015-05-11-T-025,474,Ang Wei Neng,"(In English)  Mdm Speaker, in my Chinese speech earlier, I have used two examples to illustrate how drones could be used to vandalise public property and also intrude security sensitive areas. Earlier this year, there was also a drone that landed quite unexpectedly in the White House in the United States. The incident had caused a huge public alarm. The experiences that I have mentioned above show that it is timely to have an Unmanned Aircraft (Public Safety and Security) Bill in place. Even though I support the Bill, I have three areas of clarifications and one suggestion for the Minister. For the purpose of this discussion, I will use the term ""unmanned aircraft"" and ""drone"" interchangeably."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00475,2015-05-11-T-025,475,Ang Wei Neng,"I understand that under this Bill, a permit may be required for a drone to be used for specialised services such as"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00476,2015-05-11-T-025,476,Ang Wei Neng,(a) flying the drone over any crowd; or
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00477,2015-05-11-T-025,477,Ang Wei Neng,"(b) suspending, carrying or attaching any item to the drone unless it is manufactured to hold the item."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00478,2015-05-11-T-025,478,Ang Wei Neng,"We are celebrating SG50 this year and there are many SG50 events besides the National Day Parade, which is classified earlier on by the Minister as a special event similar to the Sea Games. Many drone fanatics would like to use their drones to join in the celebrations. Will the authorities require an amateur drone operator to apply for a permit from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to fly the drone over SG50 events or other private events for the purpose of taking aerial photographs and videos? Can a drone fly with a Singapore flag during such events? What is the definition of ""crowd"" as stated in the advisory of the Safe and Responsible Operations of Unmanned Aircraft? This is my first set of clarifications."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00479,2015-05-11-T-025,479,Ang Wei Neng,"Under clause 13 of the Bill, an authorised person, including a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant, has the power to use necessary force to end the flight of an unmanned aircraft in the fastest and safest practicable way. Does it mean that the police officer is entitled to use firearms to open fire at an illegal drone or is the authority thinking of using another bigger drone to destroy the illegal drone? What are the examples of necessary force that the authorities have in mind to ""end the flight of the unmanned aircraft in the fastest and safest practicable way""? This is my second set of clarification."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00480,2015-05-11-T-025,480,Ang Wei Neng,"Before I proceed with my third set of clarifications, Mdm Speaker, allow me to declare my interest as I am the Senior Vice President of SBS Transit (Ltd). I understand that MOT is drawing out a list of security sensitive locations which include airports, power stations, army camps, Police establishments, headquarters of various Government Ministries, as well as the Parliament House as mentioned by the Minister earlier. Does MOT consider MRT tracks and MRT depots as part of the sensitive locations? Were there any previous instances where drones flew over and crashed on the MRT tracks? We certainly do not want drone operators to take aerial photographs of MRT depots to aid potential intruders in vandalising the trains. We have just heard the Second Minister for Home Affairs said earlier in the House that the Government is taking a very serious stand against vandalism."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00481,2015-05-11-T-025,481,Ang Wei Neng,"As mentioned in the beginning of my speech, the availability of affordable high-tech drones opens up many possibilities for commercial usage. In Singapore, the Timbre Group is considering using Infinium Robotics' drones to deliver up to 2 kg of food and drink in its group of restaurants. It is not only novel but a practical way to solve their manpower shortage issue. I understand that all drones operating for commercial purposes need to apply for a permit even under the new Bill. At the same time, I understand that about 30% of the 70 applications for a permit to fly a drone in January 2015 were all rejected."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00482,2015-05-11-T-025,482,Ang Wei Neng,"While we want to regulate the usage of commercial drones, we should not over regulate, so much so that the industry will find that it really kills the commercial initiative. For example, Amazon is battling with US Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, for its reluctance to approve beyond visual line of sight operations so that Amazon can continue its trial to deliver lightweight goods to its customers using drones. Currently, in the US, there is a big debate whether the FAA is over regulating the use of drones for commercial purpose. Meanwhile, Alibaba is pushing ahead with its own trial to deliver ginger tea packets to its customers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. If this trial is successful, Alibaba could overtake Amazon in this respect."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00483,2015-05-11-T-025,483,Ang Wei Neng,"If a popular online store in Singapore, such as Qoo10, would like to apply for a permit to conduct a trial to deliver items of, say, less than 1 kg in weight to its customers using drones, will the authorities approve such a trial?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00484,2015-05-11-T-025,484,Ang Wei Neng,"The commercial usage of drones is like a money plant. Money plants need very little sunlight and water to thrive. However, it still needs some light support for the plant to blossom. In the same way, innovative use of drones will thrive as long the regulators do not unnecessarily block the initiative, akin to blocking the sunlight. At the same time, the innovative use of drones needs some support from the Government for the industry to bloom, giving Singapore an edge over other countries. With this, I support the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00485,2015-05-11-T-025,485,Gan Thiam Poh,"Mdm Speaker, the increasing popularity of unmanned aircrafts (UAs) necessitates an update of our regulatory and permit framework to facilitate their usage while ensuring safety and security."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00486,2015-05-11-T-025,486,Gan Thiam Poh,"This Act amends the Air Navigation Act and Public Order Act. New sections 29G of the Air Navigation Act and 32A of the Public Order Act provide for authorised personnel to take action to counteract security and safety breaches. They can direct the fastest and most practicable way of controlling or ending a UA's flight path, even by force, if necessary."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00487,2015-05-11-T-025,487,Gan Thiam Poh,"However, it is not very clear to me how far our enforcers are allowed to go to end the flight paths of rogue UAs. Would the authorities be empowered to shoot them down if the operators refuse to land them, or if they are beyond control and likely to cause harm and injuries on the ground? I would appreciate it if the Minister could share more details in this area."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00488,2015-05-11-T-025,488,Gan Thiam Poh,"What worries me about this Bill is the lack of measures to enable the authorities to carry out preventive checks to minimise chances of UAs carrying prohibited items, especially explosives, from taking off; and in the event rogue UAs are recovered, there may be very little evidence on them to assist with the identification of owners and operators."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00489,2015-05-11-T-025,489,Gan Thiam Poh,"I suggest that we put in place checks and restrictions on all UAs, locally-made or imported, and impose licensing and certification requirements so that the authorities will have a complete database of UAs and their owners, somewhat similar to the database we have for SIM cards for mobile phones. Even the UAs owned by hobbyists who fly the UAs for recreation or private use should be included. This way, operators would be more conscious of responsible usage and it would be more feasible for the authorities to track down operators should something go wrong."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00490,2015-05-11-T-025,490,Gan Thiam Poh,"Next, the penalty for carrying dangerous materials, such as weapons or bio-chemicals, is a fine of up to $100,000, jail for up to five years, or both. I think that this punishment is too light for anyone who carries such dangerous materials which can cause injuries and fatalities on a potentially massive scale. I urge the Ministry to re-examine this."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00491,2015-05-11-T-025,491,Gan Thiam Poh,"With more and more UAs fitted with cameras, it would be inevitable that the privacy of all in the flight paths of UAs will be compromised. How would the authority resolve the problem of such intrusions and help protect residents' privacy? Taking UA operators to court for privacy invasion can be tedious and expensive for most Singaporeans and residents. How can the Government help victims take action against errant operators in an expeditious and affordable way?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00492,2015-05-11-T-025,492,Gan Thiam Poh,"Finally, may I request the Ministry consider prohibiting the flying of UAs in all HDB estates, especially between the HDB flats, as they would certainly intrude upon the privacy of the flat owners unless with permits and copy of the video recorder be subjected to censorship. With that, I support the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00493,2015-05-11-T-025,493,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Mdm Speaker, unmanned aircraft, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) or ""drones"", are aircraft which can be operated without a human pilot on board. This Bill introduces a new regulatory framework to address security and safety concerns posed by unmanned aircraft flying in Singapore's airspace."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00494,2015-05-11-T-025,494,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Until recently, drones were better known for their ability to spy on enemy movements in the battlefield or deliver precision strikes on terrorists in troubled regions. However, in the past few years, drones have been more commonly mentioned for their commercial and civilian, rather than military, uses."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00495,2015-05-11-T-025,495,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"There is the ""Octocopter"", which online retailer Amazon is planning to use to deliver packages in as little as half an hour after the purchase. Drones are also being used for aerial photography, patrolling of secure areas, inspecting ships and oil spills, and search and rescue operations, to name just a few."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00496,2015-05-11-T-025,496,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In introducing this new regulatory framework, the Government should take care to avoid hindering commercial developments by placing too heavy a regulatory burden on the drone market. This is so that our companies and our local entrepreneurs can benefit from, and contribute to, some of the promising innovations in this exciting new space."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00497,2015-05-11-T-025,497,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The Bill empowers the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), with the approval of the Minister for Transport, to make orders and regulations with regard to unmanned aircraft. The detailed regulations have not been spelled out in this Bill, although some have been mentioned in media reports and in the Minister's speech."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00498,2015-05-11-T-025,498,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I would like to clarify if the following regulations are on the cards. First, will the regulations specify that drones must keep a safety distance from persons, vehicles, buildings or structures as well as from congested areas or large groups of people, such as sporting events or concerts?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00499,2015-05-11-T-025,499,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Second, on requiring ""geo-fencing"". Flying drones within 5 km of an aerodrome is already prohibited under the Air Navigation Order. However, there is a risk that drone operators may unintentionally fly too close to an aerodrome or military installation. This will pose not just a security risk, but also a safety threat to aircraft taking off and landing. As such, has the CAAS considered requiring drones above a certain weight or size to be equipped with geo-fencing capabilities? Using geo-fencing, the drone can be programmed with the coordinates of aerodromes and security-sensitive areas in Singapore. If it tries to enter these areas, it will be forced to turn around or land. I understand that many commercial drones already come equipped with geo-fencing capabilities, so it should not pose too much of a regulatory burden for these drone operators."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00500,2015-05-11-T-025,500,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Third, CAAS regulations currently prohibit a drone from being flown beyond the normal unaided ""line of sight"" of the person operating it. However, there are currently beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) technologies being developed, which will enable a drone operator to make course changes to avoid obstacles, including other aircraft, using on-board cameras. It was recently reported that the US Federal Aviation Administration is working with private companies to test commercial drones that can fly beyond an operator's line of sight. This will open up the possibility for more sophisticated drone operations, such as package delivery. While it is still early days for this technology, I hope that CAAS remains open to issuing permits, on a case-by-case basis, to companies to test-bed such technologies in Singapore so that we maintain an edge over our overseas competitors."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00501,2015-05-11-T-025,501,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Fourth, it was reported that all commercial drone operators will need to apply for a permit. Can the Minister explain why this requirement is being imposed on all commercial operators? Is the risk posed by commercial operators higher than that of, say, hobbyists? Would it not be fairer to require permits only for drones above a certain weight or size, rather than placing a permit requirement on all commercial operators?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00502,2015-05-11-T-025,502,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Fifth, if commercial operators are required to apply for a permit, then it is important that the assessment criteria for permit approvals be made transparent, in terms of the specifications of the drones, the types of commercial uses that will be allowed and whether there would be any requirements for operators, in terms of training and qualifications. If this law is to be effected on 1June 2015, which is just over two weeks from now, then sufficient time must be given to operators to obtain the permits without interrupting operations."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00503,2015-05-11-T-025,503,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"And, sixth, CAAS says that it will serve as a one-stop centre for all drone permit applications. This is a welcome move. I hope this will help reduce red tape and the time taken for permit approvals. Can the Minister share what will be the expected typical waiting time for a permit approval, so that commercial operators can better plan their schedules and operations?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00504,2015-05-11-T-025,504,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I have some security concerns about the risk of drones being used for terrorist activities. While this Bill will probably be effective in preventing law-abiding drone operators from unintentionally causing harm to persons and property, it is unlikely to stop a determined terrorist from using a drone to fly explosives, chemical or biological agents into key installations or large crowds, causing mayhem, fatalities and serious injuries."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00505,2015-05-11-T-025,505,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"It is important that our security agencies develop plans for detecting, intercepting and taking down rogue drones. These include acquiring systems to ""detect and defeat"" drones. I note that clauses 13 and 17 give the authorities the power to direct a drone operator to change course or assume control of the drone, by force if necessary, to end the flight of the drone in the fastest and safest practicable way."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00506,2015-05-11-T-025,506,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"However, detecting and defeating rogue drones is not a straightforward task. Most drones are small, move slowly and fly low, which makes it difficult for radar to detect them. To ""defeat"" a detected drone by shooting it down or jamming its control signals could risk injuring innocent bystanders when it plunges to the ground, particularly if it contains a hazardous payload."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00507,2015-05-11-T-025,507,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"According to The Economist, there are currently systems that can hijack a drone's navigation and control systems, and fly it to a desired location, or to use another drone to catch the drone in a net. In addition, there are technologies available to track the control signals of a rogue drone back to its human operator, and intercept the operator. Has the Government already acquired such systems to deal with rogue drones?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00508,2015-05-11-T-025,508,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Also, will there be any enhanced penalties for anyone convicted of using a drone to carry out a serious crime, as is being proposed in the state of Washington in the US?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00509,2015-05-11-T-025,509,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Finally, this Bill does not appear to address data protection or privacy issues with regard to the use of drones. My concern is mainly with the possibility of drones being used to take photographs of people or private property in a manner that infringes individuals' privacy. Do current laws already provide for data protection and privacy from drones? I hope the Minister can explain how these laws are adequate and what penalties there are for violators. Madam, I support the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00510,2015-05-11-T-025,510,Benedict Tan,"Mdm Speaker, with the increasing applications of unmanned aircraft, this Bill is indeed necessary. The broad applications also mean that various needs would need to be balanced. It is evident that this Bill has given thorough consideration to two concerns, that of public safety and security."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00511,2015-05-11-T-025,511,Benedict Tan,"I would like to pose a query on a third concern, and that is the privacy of individuals. With Singapore's dense housing, how do we ensure that unmanned aircraft with cameras do not peep into bedroom and bathroom windows? There is hardly any mention of privacy in this Bill, so I hope the Minister will provide more details on how this would be addressed."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00512,2015-05-11-T-025,512,Benedict Tan,"While we protect public safety, security and, perhaps, privacy, we need to ensure that we do not hinder useful applications of unmanned aircraft, both current and potential ones. These include using unmanned aircraft for search and rescue, sports science, media coverage of sports events, and simply as a hobby. In particular, I would like to highlight that aerial filming of sports events is fast becoming a norm, and it is a trend that we should encourage, to keep sports exciting, thereby attracting an active following."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00513,2015-05-11-T-025,513,Benedict Tan,"The organising of sports events is becoming increasingly complex and onerous, as we set higher standards for sports safety and compliance. For example, to organise a race at the National Sailing Centre at East Coast Park, organisers require a permit from the Maritime Port Authority. On top of that, to do aerial photography of the event as part of the media coverage, it seems a permit is also required from the Commissioner of Police to bring the unmanned aircraft into a special event area, and yet another from the CAAS to operate the unmanned aircraft for commercial photography within 5 km of an aerodrome. I would like to ask if it is possible for the Minister to streamline the application of multiple permits and provide a timeline for the application process, to reduce the hurdles for event organisers."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00514,2015-05-11-T-025,514,Benedict Tan,"Paragraph 14(b) of the Bill clarifies the definition of an unmanned aircraft. The definition clarifies specifically that an unmanned aircraft excludes a balloon or kite. In a similar vein, given the rapid growth of the sport of kite boarding / kite surfing, I hope the Bill will also clarify specifically that kite boarding equipment – including those with GoPro cameras mounted – are also not considered unmanned aircraft."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00515,2015-05-11-T-025,515,Benedict Tan,"Mdm Speaker, I support of the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00516,2015-05-11-T-025,516,Mohd Ismail Hussein,"Mdm Speaker, most Singaporeans, myself included, are not very familiar with ""Unmanned Aerial Vehicles"", ""Remotely Pilot Aircrafts"", or what one would normally call ""drones"". If you ask an average person on the street what a drone is, the answer you would typically get is that it is something used in the military or as recreational use by a small group of hobbyists."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00517,2015-05-11-T-025,517,Mohd Ismail Hussein,"However, as I have lately discovered, there is more to these devices than its use in the military or as a hobby. Most recently in Nepal, drones were used in rescue missions to photograph and map areas affected by the earthquake in Nepal. It proved useful in aiding crews and rescue workers to plan and pin-point areas to focus on. Due to its versatility, drones with cameras attached have also found its uses in law enforcement, scientific research and journalism, just to name a few."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00518,2015-05-11-T-025,518,Mohd Ismail Hussein,"That being said, the use or misuse of drones can also pose a danger to the public and to our security. According to an in-depth report by Washington Post, there were more than 400 major drone crashes since 2001."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00519,2015-05-11-T-025,519,Mohd Ismail Hussein,"The reality is that drone technology is still evolving. The price of drones is falling, which makes it affordable to more people, and people are finding better and more creative ways of using them. The risk posed by drones to our security and public safety is also very real and other countries have either implemented regulations or are embarking on one. It is therefore timely that we introduce this Bill to provide clarity on the regulations pertaining to the use of drones and I fully support this Bill."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00520,2015-05-11-T-025,520,Mohd Ismail Hussein,"There are a few areas, however, I wish for more clarification from the Minister."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00521,2015-05-11-T-025,521,Mohd Ismail Hussein,"Firstly, there seems to be very little data on how prevalent are usages of drones in Singapore. Can the Ministry provide information on how many users are there in Singapore, in terms of commercial and personal uses, how many local sellers of drones and whether there are any incidents, accidents or near misses incidents involving drones?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00522,2015-05-11-T-025,522,Mohd Ismail Hussein,"Secondly, given that offences related to the use of drones are strict liability offence, there should be a greater effort by the Ministry to educate the public on the do's and don'ts in using drones as well as better information on where are the protected or restricted areas in Singapore where flying drones are off-limits. Does the Ministry have any plans to educate the public and can the Ministry share what these plans are? Can the Ministry provide more clarity and specifics on the use of drones in residential areas, schools, high-rise buildings, stadiums, parks, etc. especially where there is higher possibility of causing injury to people or damage to properties?."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00523,2015-05-11-T-025,523,Mohd Ismail Hussein,"Thirdly, there are already businesses out there exploring the commercialisation or the commercial use of drones for example in film-making, photography, journalism, etc. Does the Government have any plans to regulate the sale of drones and to what extent will it be regulated so as to strike a balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring responsible use of drones?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00524,2015-05-11-T-025,524,Mohd Ismail Hussein,My last question is on insurance coverage. What is the current state of insurance coverage in Singapore with respect to drones? Are these adequate to provide protection to the public against damages caused by drones on person or property?
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00525,2015-05-11-T-025,525,Seng Han Thong,"Mdm Speaker, I support the spirit of this Bill, that is, the flying of unmanned aircraft must be carried out in a safe and responsible manner."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00526,2015-05-11-T-025,526,Seng Han Thong,"As a resident, I received an advisory note on the Safe and Responsible Operation of Unmanned Aircraft for recreational and public uses, from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). The flyer lists out six ""dos"" and eight ""don'ts""."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00527,2015-05-11-T-025,527,Seng Han Thong,"As the advisor to the Ang Mo Kio Grassroots Organisation, I would like to seek clarification on the number 7 and number 8 ""don'ts"" from the Minister."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00528,2015-05-11-T-025,528,Seng Han Thong,"Number 7  ""Don't fly the aircraft over or within restricted, prohibited or danger areas, including security-sensitive locations."""
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00529,2015-05-11-T-025,529,Seng Han Thong,"Number 8  ""Don't fly within 5 Km of any airport/military airbase, or higher than 200 feet."""
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00530,2015-05-11-T-025,530,Seng Han Thong,"As we know, there is the Amoy Quee Camp in the Ang Mo Kio Town. There is also the Seletar Airbase not far from the Ang Mo Kio Town."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00531,2015-05-11-T-025,531,Seng Han Thong,"With the introduction of this Bill, it is not clear if we are allowed to fly the drone at all future community functions as we are at the immediate vicinity of the restricted and prohibited areas like the Amoy Quee Camp, Seletar Camp and the Seletar Airport."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00532,2015-05-11-T-025,532,Seng Han Thong,"Under the category on ""Location of Operations"", it states that a permit is required if the drone is flying within 5 km of an aerodrome regardless of operating height, or about 200 feet beyond 5 km of an aerodrome."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00533,2015-05-11-T-025,533,Seng Han Thong,"So, is there a need to apply for a permit, if the drone is flying outside the 5 km of an aerodrome and within the 200 feet height limits?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00534,2015-05-11-T-025,534,Seng Han Thong,"For the information of drone operator for recreational and private uses, will the CAAS be publishing a map to indicate the areas that are outside the 5 km of an aerodrome? Many of my areas, for example, the Yio Chu Kang Stadium, there are many activities that are within this area."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00535,2015-05-11-T-025,535,Seng Han Thong,"In the Bill, it also mentioned about applying a blanket permit for usage at same location. So, is it possible for our GRO new media team to do it for our community events coverage all year round? For application of permits to use drone for recreational and private uses, will it be a friendly and simple process and, in terms of waiting time, will it be short?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00536,2015-05-11-T-025,536,Seng Han Thong,"It is good to have a Bill to create awareness and responsible use of drone by the public on the one hand and to achieve the objectives of national security and public safety on the other hand. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00537,2015-05-11-T-025,537,Speaker,Minister Lui Tuck Yew.
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00538,2015-05-11-T-025,538,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, first, let me thank all six speakers who have spoken out and all of you have supported the Bill. You have raised a number of interesting questions, comments and queries. Let me try to group them together into issues and address them in turn."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00539,2015-05-11-T-025,539,Lui Tuck Yew,"By way of introduction, I think basically many have spoken out in support of the potential for the use of drones, whether it is in terms of dealing with natural disasters or commercial potential. Dr Benedict Tan spoke very eloquently on the use of it to support sporting activities, for filming purposes and so on. And yet, I think everyone has also spoken on their concerns over privacy, on security and safety. Indeed, that really is the challenge and the dilemma we face - how to find a judicious balance that would safeguard us as much as possible with regard to issues of safety and security, and so on, and yet allows sufficient potential for operators and individuals to experiment, to innovate and to use it for the right purposes."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00540,2015-05-11-T-025,540,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ismail Hussein asked if we could provide information on the prevalence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Singapore and how many known users and suppliers there are, both for hobby and commercial purposes. But the answer is that actually we do not know because right now we do not track the number of unmanned aircraft users and suppliers. For us, I think this is somewhat difficult and, to a large extent, impractical because the public can easily purchase unmanned aircraft in many stores in Singapore - for hobbyists, order them online from overseas; or for the enthusiasts, they will actually build or modify some of these unmanned aircraft themselves. What we do know is that, on average, on a monthly basis, over the course of the first few months of this year, we are receiving about 50 applications for permits. Fifty applications per month this year, compared to about, on average, 12 applications per month last year. And so you have seen that huge increase over the course of the first few months for this year, and you expect that this will increase especially with the new regulations. But also without the regulations, I think there is a greater interest. Hence, we think that there is a need to introduce this Bill both to educate and alert the public but also to put in place the right processes."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00541,2015-05-11-T-025,541,Lui Tuck Yew,"Dr Tan asked if kite boarding equipment is considered unmanned aircraft. Let me give him the definition. A device that is not manoeuvred by electronic means but is physically tethered such as through strings and manoeuvred by these physical means or are uncontrolled such as free balloons does not fall under the definition of unmanned aircraft for the purposes of this Bill. Under the Air Navigation Order, kiteboarding activities are already regulated. So the answer is that it does not fall under this Bill but if you are speaking specifically on kiteboarding, that is already being regulated."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00542,2015-05-11-T-025,542,Lui Tuck Yew,"Some have asked on the number of incidents or near misses involving UAVs in Singapore. There have been over 20 unmanned aircraft incidents reported in Singapore since about a year ago. So far, we have not received any reports of injury or damage to property associated with these cases, but I think it is really more of good fortune than anything else."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00543,2015-05-11-T-025,543,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang Wei Neng had a very interesting query on whether there were incidents of unmanned aircraft dropping onto MRT tracks. Actually, there have been two such reported incidents. In both incidents, a member of the public was flying the unmanned aircraft in a nearby open field and lost control of the unmanned aircraft, and this is within visual line of sight, this is not even EVLOS. But even within visual line of sight, he lost control of the aircraft in a nearby open field and one of them came to rest on the side of the track and, fortunately, no train service was disrupted, no damage was caused to the MRT tracks, no one was injured. One of these incidents is under Police investigation while in the other incident, the member of the public was issued a stern warning for an offence of ""Negligent Act which Endangers Life or Personal Safety of Others"" under the Penal Code."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00544,2015-05-11-T-025,544,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang has proposed that train depots be added to the list of security sensitive locations. In designating security sensitive locations, I think the Government needs to take a calibrated approach based on an overall threat assessment. Let me assure him that although MRT depots may not be designated as security sensitive locations, any reported incident of aerial surveillance by unmanned aircraft will still be investigated by the Police, who have the necessary powers to deal with persons with malicious intent to compromise the security of such places."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00545,2015-05-11-T-025,545,Lui Tuck Yew,"As for the threat to safety of train services, this is covered by existing regulations and guidelines. The operation of heavier unmanned aircraft which may cause serious damage and unmanned aircraft operations for commercial purposes will soon require a permit. For hobbyists and operation of light unmanned aircraft, we have enhanced guidelines for their use, and the Police have powers under the Penal Code to charge those who operate unmanned aircraft in a negligent and irresponsible manner which harms or threatens public safety."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00546,2015-05-11-T-025,546,Lui Tuck Yew,"Some of you have also asked questions on special event areas. Let me try to address this. Examples of special event areas could include venues of major events where a significant congregation of people can be expected, for example, at the Sports Hub, the Padang and their vicinity during the National Day Parade. To ensure the safety and security of people attending these events, all operation of unmanned aircraft over such areas will require a special permit from the Police, which will determine the conditions under which the unmanned aircraft can operate. The carriage of payload, if any, must also not compromise the safety of the intended flight."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00547,2015-05-11-T-025,547,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and others asked about the enforcement powers related to unmanned aircraft. Breaches of unmanned aircraft regulations will be investigated by Police officers or safety inspectors authorised by CAAS or auxiliary police officers that are authorised by SPF or CAAS. The enforcers are given powers to assume control of an unmanned aircraft in order to fly the aircraft or to end the flight of the aircraft, or to land it. How this will be done will depend on the circumstances, taking into consideration the need to ensure public safety."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00548,2015-05-11-T-025,548,Lui Tuck Yew,"There have been talks of what capabilities we have to deal with it, whether we intend to shoot it down and so on, I do not want to divulge too much the capabilities that we have to deal with this. I think it is something that needs to be built up and increase over time. But this is really not so easy an issue to deal with. Some Members have pointed out that times to shoot it down may actually cost more damage and I fully agree with you on that. So, any action that we take, we have to consider very carefully."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00549,2015-05-11-T-025,549,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh had a question on enforcement could be done before the unmanned aircraft carrying any prohibited items takes off, especially if explosives are being carried. A lot of it will depend, for example, on intelligence, on early warning, perhaps given by members of the public and the Police will have to assess any information received and, if necessary, take pre-emptive action to deal with it. In addition, when Police officers respond to unmanned aircraft-related incidents or come across suspicious persons with unmanned aircraft during their patrols, they will check to see if the unmanned aircraft is carrying any prohibited item. The shorter the range, meaning if it is within line of sight, it is easier for the Police to try and trace it back, try and deal with it; the longer the range, the greater the area of uncertainty and the more difficult the job will be for the Police."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00550,2015-05-11-T-025,550,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ismail Hussein had a very interesting question on strict liability offences. Let me clarify that even though the prosecution does not need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew or had reason to believe that the area flown over is a protected one – meaning that the prosecution does not need to prove beyond reasonable doubt – the accused also has the defence that the unmanned aircraft was not flown intentionally into the protected area but the overflight was caused perhaps by weather conditions or perhaps some other unavoidable cause. So, this would have to be taken into account even though we go with a strict liability regime. I would also like to assure Members that protected areas will be properly described and published in the Gazette that CAAS will be issuing so that there will be no mistake on the part of the accused or ignorance that we really do not know that these are the gazetted areas."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00551,2015-05-11-T-025,551,Lui Tuck Yew,"On extent of punishment, there were some who felt that the punishment may not commensurate with the threat that such UAVs pose. In particular, Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked if the penalty for committing an offence for carrying dangerous substances using an unmanned aircraft is too light."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00552,2015-05-11-T-025,552,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, if a person plans to use the unmanned aircraft as a weapon or as a means to carry out an attack, he may be prosecuted under a host of other Acts. For instance, under the Terrorism Act, the Chemical Weapons Act, the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act or the Penal Code. In reality, we have no shortage of Acts to try and catch you in a very comprehensive manner. The penalties for these offences can range from up to 10 years imprisonment, up to $1 million fine and caning. In more extreme cases, offenders found guilty could face the death penalty or life imprisonment."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00553,2015-05-11-T-025,553,Lui Tuck Yew,"Let me now touch on privacy issues because quite a number of Members – Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Dr Benedict Tan, Mr Gerald Giam – have highlighted privacy as an area of concern."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00554,2015-05-11-T-025,554,Lui Tuck Yew,"Privacy-related incidents where a person uses an unmanned aircraft to pry into another person's property and privacy will be investigated on a case-by-case basis. As a general principle, enforcement action will be taken against users whose activities constitute an offence under existing laws such as the Penal Code and the Protection from Harassment Act 2014. The inter-agency Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Committee, which I spoke about in my earlier speech and which was formed at the beginning of the year, is also looking into a comprehensive framework on the use of unmanned aircraft in Singapore and will look specifically and more deeply into the issue of privacy, to see if our current laws are adequate and if any regulatory enhancements are needed."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00555,2015-05-11-T-025,555,Lui Tuck Yew,"It was mentioned that maybe, the lighter unmanned aircraft ought to be regulated differently. I think it is a complex issue. The threshold that we use today is 7 kg. I will try to address the points raised by Mr Seng Han Thong because it can seem quite confusing. Anything that is less than 7 kg, flying below 200 feet, outside of 5 km of an aerodrome, not flying over gazetted areas and special event areas, not carrying out commercial and special activities, do not need a permit. Let me try to say that again because I know that there are a lot of ""nots"" somewhere. Not more than 7 kg, not higher than 200 feet, not within 5 km of an aerodrome, not carrying out commercial activities, not overflying specially gazetted areas or special event areas, you do not need a permit. Anything else – and that means over most of Singapore – you need a permit."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00556,2015-05-11-T-025,556,Lui Tuck Yew,"As for between 2 kg and 7 kg, can we have a different regime? I think that is something that we can look at more deeply. Right now, the regime in many countries is using 7 kg. This is all up weight – it is not just the weight of the drone itself. It is all up weight, 7 kg. It is something that most countries use and, in fact, CAAS is working with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to try and see if there a way to harmonise as well as to expound on some of the requirements for unmanned aircraft going forward, because I think this is a challenge that many countries are indeed dealing with."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00557,2015-05-11-T-025,557,Lui Tuck Yew,"On public outreach and awareness, Members have also mentioned this and it is really an important area. CAAS has started distributing an advisory to all households on the safe and responsible use of unmanned aircraft for recreation and private uses. As Mr Seng Han Thong has said, there are six ""dos"" and eight ""don'ts"". Thank you for reminding us. He is an expert in this House on this area. We will also be distributing posters to all educational institutions and hobbyist clubs next month. CAAS will also be conducting a series of briefings for key stakeholders, such as operators of unmanned aircraft for commercial and specialised services, as well as hobbyists, recreational users and retailers. Further information can be found on the CAAS website."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00558,2015-05-11-T-025,558,Lui Tuck Yew,"On permits, some Members have asked about permits and I have tried to explain under what circumstances those are required. There are others who have expressed some concern that you might need a multitude of permits from different agencies. I certainly understand that concern. CAAS will be the one-stop agency for the application of all permits needed for unmanned aircraft operations. Depending on the scope, the complexity, the type of operations, CAAS will then need to coordinate with other agencies in the evaluation of the application and the relevant permits will be collated into a single document for issuance to the applicant. Mr Gerald Giam had a query on how long it would take. The permits will take on average about two weeks but it depends really on the complexity of the application. On average, we take about two weeks."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00559,2015-05-11-T-025,559,Lui Tuck Yew,"There are also a number of other points that Mr Giam has raised, a number of useful suggestions and we will certainly take them back and look at them a little bit more. I just wanted to make a clarification on why we single out commercial operators which was the point that he talked about. On the one hand, we do not want to be overly prescriptive and hence, we decided not to say that you must have geo-fencing, so on and so forth. That could be overly prescriptive in mandating certain requirements."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00560,2015-05-11-T-025,560,Lui Tuck Yew,"What we do is try and adopt a risk-based approach and to assess the operator, the applications on their own merits. But we think that requiring a commercial operator to have a permit, both an operator permit as well as activity permit, is probably the right thing to do just to ensure that we look more carefully into its operations, into the way that they deal with safety, and even to some extent, if necessary, into the training of the people operating this. Why? Because we believe that for commercial operations, they could be using a range of UAVs. There could be a wide range of activities and so the risk exposure will vary accordingly. If you have a range of UAVs, different people operating them, covering a range of different activities in different areas, the risk of exposure could vary and increase accordingly. And because the activities are likely to be repetitive, possibly, the risk will also correspondingly increase. So, its activities, its flight paths may be complex, it may entail the delivery of a payload, it could entail more challenging manoeuvres being conducted. And so, we think that for commercial operators, we will require an operator permit and then the activity permit. If there are repeated activities over the same area doing the same thing, a little akin to what Mr Seng Han Thong had mentioned for his grassroots activities, we think you could have one single activity permit covering that same range of activities but it covers you for a period of time."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00561,2015-05-11-T-025,561,Lui Tuck Yew,"Finally, on insurance. Let me address Mr Ismail's queries on insurance coverage. Based on checks done by CAAS, there are insurers that are prepared to offer third party liability coverage for property damage and injury to persons arising out of unmanned aircraft operations. There is coverage for damage to the unmanned aircraft too. But I understand not many queries, not many interested parties that have been made queries about purchasing such insurance coverage. The UAS Committee has included insurance as part of its work in studying the regulation of unmanned aircraft activities in the longer term. It is not covered in this Bill but it is certainly something that we are looking at for the next round."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00562,2015-05-11-T-025,562,Lui Tuck Yew,"Again, we want to try to strike a reasonable balance between facilitating the exploitation of unmanned aircraft, and our regulations. In any case, when CAAS evaluates applications for unmanned aircraft operations, for example, from commercial operators, whether the operator has applied for relevant insurance coverage will also be a consideration, and could be quite a significant consideration, especially in cases where the unmanned aircraft operation may pose some level of safety concern. That is something that we will take into account but certainly, the next time round, when we have to address and revise some of these regulations, we certainly shall have a more definitive stance on this position. That covers it all, Mdm Speaker."
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00563,2015-05-11-T-025,563,Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00564,2015-05-11-T-025,564,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I thank the Minister for the clarifications. I just have one clarification regarding the effective date of this Act. I understand from reports that it is going to be on 1 June. Does it mean that the operators need to apply for a permit and obtain a permit before that time, or would they be given some time to apply and wait for the permit approvals?"
2015-05-11-T-025-S-00565,2015-05-11-T-025,565,Lui Tuck Yew,"I want to thank the Member for that clarification. We really want to try and get this in place before the SEA Games. That is really the intent of why we want to have this read a Second time in Parliament, and hopefully for Members to agree to pass this Bill because the SEA Games are coming, National Day activities are coming. For the rest, I think they can start to apply to CAAS. Where it takes a little bit longer, we can then discuss this with operators accordingly."

2015-05-11-T-026-S-00573,2015-05-11-T-026,573,Lui Tuck Yew,"This Bill seeks to grant the Land Transport Authority (LTA) powers to regulate third-party taxi booking services. These services have become increasingly popular in recent years, and Members who take taxis regularly would probably be familiar with smartphone applications such as MoobiTaxi, GrabTaxi, Easy Taxi, uberTAXI and Hailo."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00574,2015-05-11-T-026,574,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00575,2015-05-11-T-026,575,Lui Tuck Yew,"Today, about one-fifth of taxi trips are made via phone or app bookings. Based on the Taxi Customer Satisfaction Survey that we did last year, about 80% of these bookings are made through the taxi companies. In other words, 20% of all taxi trips are made through phone or app bookings, 80% are street-hailed. And of those that are made via phone or app bookings, about 80% are made through the taxi companies. The remaining 20% are made through third-party apps. In short, about 4% of taxi trips today are made through such third-party apps. But it is something that is growing."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00576,2015-05-11-T-026,576,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00577,2015-05-11-T-026,577,Lui Tuck Yew,"The introduction of third-party taxi booking apps is a positive development, as they can improve the matching of taxi supply and demand, particularly during peak hours. Commuters who use third-party apps are not restricted to sourcing for taxis from just one taxi company. Taxi drivers, on the other hand, can tap on multiple sources of bookings to get passengers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00578,2015-05-11-T-026,578,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00579,2015-05-11-T-026,579,Lui Tuck Yew,"The third-party taxi booking apps sector is relatively young and it is still evolving. New technologies and business models are continuing to emerge. While the Ministry has decided to regulate, we also recognise the need to allow enough space for the market to innovate and thrive."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00580,2015-05-11-T-026,580,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00581,2015-05-11-T-026,581,Lui Tuck Yew,"Thus, we have chosen a light-touch approach and will only impose basic requirements that are necessary to protect commuter interests and safety, and to preserve the fundamental tenets of our taxi regulatory policies."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00582,2015-05-11-T-026,582,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00583,2015-05-11-T-026,583,Lui Tuck Yew,"LTA announced plans to introduce such a basic regulatory framework in November last year and has consulted commuters, the National Taxi Association, third-party taxi booking services and taxi companies extensively. I believe that the regulatory framework has the support of all the parties and achieves the objectives that I have described."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00584,2015-05-11-T-026,584,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00585,2015-05-11-T-026,585,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, let me now summarise the key provisions in the proposed Third-Party Taxi Booking Service Providers Act. Clause 3 requires all third-party taxi booking services with more than 20 participating taxis to register with LTA, in order to operate in Singapore. We think ""20"" is a reasonable threshold. It allows very nascent services to be exempted from registration, which would provide them some room to experiment before their size reaches the registration threshold. Clause 7 specifies that anyone providing an unregistered service is liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both. These penalties are the same as those prescribed in the Road Traffic Act for a person operating an unlicensed taxi company."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00586,2015-05-11-T-026,586,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00587,2015-05-11-T-026,587,Lui Tuck Yew,"Clause 11 empowers LTA to impose conditions on registered providers to ensure that commuter interests are safeguarded and taxi regulations are not undermined. These include conditions in the following areas  first, the registered provider's operation, monitoring and supervision of the service; second, the fees that may be charged for the service; and third, the provision of information to LTA, such as live data on third-party taxi booking jobs."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00588,2015-05-11-T-026,588,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00589,2015-05-11-T-026,589,Lui Tuck Yew,"Let me cite two examples of the conditions that LTA plans to impose. First, third-party taxi booking service providers must dispatch only licensed taxis and drivers who hold valid Taxi Driver's Vocational Licences, if the commuter requests only taxis. This ensures that such commuters are served only by taxis and taxi drivers who are operating legally. Second, to ensure that taxi services remain a mode of public transport that is equally accessible to all members of the public, bidding and pre-trip tipping for taxi services will not be allowed."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00590,2015-05-11-T-026,590,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00591,2015-05-11-T-026,591,Lui Tuck Yew,"Clause 8 enables LTA to prescribe different classes of registration and to vary the conditions imposed for each class, based on the number of participating taxis or the type of communication system through which the service is provided. Amongst others, this will allow LTA to regulate existing radiophone-based service providers which mainly serve commuters in certain geographical areas."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00592,2015-05-11-T-026,592,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00593,2015-05-11-T-026,593,Lui Tuck Yew,"The proposed Act will also empower LTA to impose compliance measures on registered providers. Clauses 17 and 18 allow LTA to issue codes of practice and directions respectively. To enforce a condition of registration, a provision of a code of practice, or a direction, LTA can impose a compliance order under clause 19. Clause 20(1) empowers LTA to impose regulatory sanctions for the contravention of, or non-compliance with, a condition of registration, a provision of a code of practice, or a direction that has been issued."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00594,2015-05-11-T-026,594,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00595,2015-05-11-T-026,595,Lui Tuck Yew,"The regulatory sanctions that may be imposed under clause 20(2) include a financial penalty not exceeding $100,000 for each instance of contravention or non-compliance, which is the same as that for taxi companies under the Taxi Service Operator Licence framework; suspension for not more than three months; and revocation of registration. Clause 22 provides the registered provider with the right to appeal to the Minister against the imposition of a compliance measure."

Hence, clause 6 extends the scope of the proposed Act to any conduct outside Singapore as long as it is related to the provision of third-party taxi booking services for journeys within, or partly within, Singapore."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00598,2015-05-11-T-026,598,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00599,2015-05-11-T-026,599,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, I will also mention some related amendments to the Road Traffic Act. Section 111A currently defines a taxi service operator to be a person that owns more than one taxi and leases out these taxis to individual drivers. However, as we have seen with the growth of third-party taxi booking services, it is possible that taxi companies' operating models may also evolve."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00600,2015-05-11-T-026,600,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00601,2015-05-11-T-026,601,Lui Tuck Yew,"Clause 34(1) of the Bill therefore amends section 111A to broaden the definition of a taxi service operator, to be a person that owns more than one taxi, and allows individuals to drive these taxis to provide taxi services in Singapore. This will enable us to regulate taxi service operators with contractual arrangements with their drivers which are different from today's hirer model, if such should emerge in the future. It will also prevent taxi companies from by-passing regulations by adopting different contractual arrangements with their drivers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00602,2015-05-11-T-026,602,Lui Tuck Yew,
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00603,2015-05-11-T-026,603,Lui Tuck Yew,"Finally, clause 34(2) amends section 111H of the Road Traffic Act to stipulate the maximum suspension term for a licensed taxi service operator to be three months, for alignment with that for a registered third-party taxi booking service provider."

2015-05-11-T-026-S-00605,2015-05-11-T-026,605,Lui Tuck Yew,"In summary, this Bill accords LTA regulatory oversight over third-party taxi booking services. The proposed regulatory framework balances the need for consumer protection with the flexibility needed for innovation in the industry, so that these services can enhance the provision of taxi services in Singapore, and ultimately benefit both commuters and taxi drivers. We will refine the regulations as the industry evolves. With that, Mdm Speaker, I beg to move."

2015-05-11-T-026-S-00607,2015-05-11-T-026,607,Lui Tuck Yew,Question proposed.
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00608,2015-05-11-T-026,608,Seng Han Thong,"Mdm Speaker, first, I declare my interest as Chairman of the Singapore Taxi Academy. Since the third- party taxi booking apps entered Singapore market two years ago, there has been widespread use of third-party transport booking applications among a large number of commuters and individual self-employed drivers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00609,2015-05-11-T-026,609,Seng Han Thong,There have been an equally fast growing number of private car chauffeured service operators using GPS meter fare installed in a smartphone or tablet functioning exactly like the taxi-meter installed in a taxi.
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00610,2015-05-11-T-026,610,Seng Han Thong,"As we know, the third-party taxi booking service operators that this Bill is trying to regulate are platform service operators. These platforms are run by data scientists, software engineers, operations and marketing specialists. As new technologies mature, it enables these platforms operators to apply their platform services to various modes of land transport  van or goods vehicles, passenger cars or taxis or private cars for hire and private bus for hire. As such, it may disrupt the existing regulations for all the modes of land transport. It may also change the traditional business operating models of these land transport modes."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00611,2015-05-11-T-026,611,Seng Han Thong,"In the case of taxis, the impact to the taxi regulations is significant. We must not only look at the disruption on current taxi operations, but also look beyond taxis and into other closely related modes of transport such as private cars for hire."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00612,2015-05-11-T-026,612,Seng Han Thong,"In this aspect, may I ask Minister three questions"
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00613,2015-05-11-T-026,613,Seng Han Thong,1. How would commuter interest and consumer protection be safeguarded under the basic regulation approach of this Bill in view of what have transpired in other countries where the third-party taxi service booking service has developed into a social and political issue?
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00614,2015-05-11-T-026,614,Seng Han Thong,"2. Would the requirements set for commuter safety and consumer protection be of the same level to all service providers including taxi companies and car rental companies offering third-party taxi booking service, and also companies offering third-party taxi booking service only?"
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00615,2015-05-11-T-026,615,Seng Han Thong,"3. How would LTA create greater awareness among all stakeholders  the commuters, the taxi drivers, the hirers of the rental cars and the service providers, of the consumer rights and the duties and responsibilities of the service providers?"
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00616,2015-05-11-T-026,616,Seng Han Thong,"On the Bill, I also have three clarifications"
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00617,2015-05-11-T-026,617,Seng Han Thong,1. Will the Bill also cover private hired cars providing their services through third- party booking service providers? These private hired cars are functioning like taxis except that they are not allowed to do street pick-up.
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00618,2015-05-11-T-026,618,Seng Han Thong,"2. Will the Minister consider requiring drivers of the private hired cars to be screened, trained and tested for their competency before they could provide these services through the third-party booking service providers? This will ensure the interest of commuters using their services is safeguarded."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00619,2015-05-11-T-026,619,Seng Han Thong,"3. In view of the introduction of this Bill, will LTA look into other aspects of the taxi regulations from  (a) QoS of TOL, in particularly the taxi call booking regulations; (b) statutory defined use of each category of vehicles; for example, how to prevent the revival of pirate taxis, and (c) data collection, application and enforcement. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00620,2015-05-11-T-026,620,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Mdm Speaker, this Bill introduces a framework to regulate third-party taxi booking service providers, which include taxi booking mobile applications."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00621,2015-05-11-T-026,621,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In recent years, the near-ubiquity of smart phones in Singapore has facilitated the entry of several taxi booking mobile apps like Uber, GrabTaxi and Easy Taxi. Most of these apps allow passengers to book rides with any taxi driver, even independent limousine drivers, unlike the booking services run by taxi operators which are limited to a smaller pool of drivers. This can provide better matching of passenger demand with taxi supply."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00622,2015-05-11-T-026,622,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Some of these apps allow passengers to track the cab driver's location, contact the driver directly, rate their drivers and even share a cab with others who are travelling on the same route. This can help reduce transaction costs while encouraging taxi drivers to maintain high levels of service."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00623,2015-05-11-T-026,623,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"They are a win-win for both passengers and taxi drivers. Passengers enjoy greater convenience booking cabs, and drivers have easier access to a wider pool of passengers. I understand some enterprising Singaporeans have started their own limousine companies and receive their bookings through these apps. A larger supply of drivers could help address the perennial problem of not enough taxis being available during peak hours or when there is a heavy downpour."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00624,2015-05-11-T-026,624,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"With these ""disruptive"" technologies, the dominant taxi operators have to up their game or risk losing drivers to rivals. Their drivers could decide to switch to other operators who charge cheaper taxi rentals, while still receiving enough bookings via mobile apps. This could put downward pressure on rentals charged by taxi operators, which will benefit cab drivers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00625,2015-05-11-T-026,625,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Third-party taxi booking services could encourage greater competition, innovation and service quality, and improve customer satisfaction. In regulating third-party taxi booking service providers, the Government should focus more on maximising benefits to consumers and taxi drivers, and less on protecting a particular business model or existing taxi operators."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00626,2015-05-11-T-026,626,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I would like to seek clarification from the Minister on clause 10(b), in which the regulator, in deciding whether to register an applicant, ""must have regard"" to the demand for third-party taxi booking services in Singapore. Does this mean that if supply of these booking services exceeds demand, as assessed by LTA, the regulator may decide not to issue a taxi booking service licence?"
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00627,2015-05-11-T-026,627,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Can the Minister explain why the LTA needs to base its licensing decision on demand for third-party taxi booking services? Is it not the responsibility of potential entrants to assess the viability of their own business models? If the service being provided by the new entrant is more attractive, this will give consumers more choice and consumers will naturally gravitate towards them, with weaker players fading out. I do not think the Government needs to make this decision for consumers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00628,2015-05-11-T-026,628,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Overall, I am glad to see that this Bill does not go the way of several other cities that have implemented outright bans on drivers accepting bookings via certain ride-sharing apps. It is not a free-for-all, where any private car driver can accept bookings via these apps. At the same time, the regulations require basic consumer protections to be in place, like requiring drivers to be properly insured, conducting background and health checks on drivers and prohibiting overcharging of passengers. Madam, I support the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00629,2015-05-11-T-026,629,Lina Chiam,"Mdm Speaker, this Bill seeks to control and provide regulatory framework to providers of technological companies that operate third-party taxi booking app services for journeys within or partly within Singapore, in anticipation of the impact on the growing transport system in Singapore and ensure the safety of passengers who use third-party taxi booking services."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00630,2015-05-11-T-026,630,Lina Chiam,Third-party taxi booking services have increasingly become a popular choice for commuters these days as they offer an alternative taxi booking service which allows commuters to book taxis from the different companies and facilitates a higher probability of booking a taxi.
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00631,2015-05-11-T-026,631,Lina Chiam,"The Bill is a good initiative by the Ministry of Transport to safeguard commuters' safety and interest using third-party taxi booking services for transportation needs. A case of allegation of rape in Mumbai, India, and several other overcharging cases in Singapore were some of the issues brought about through the use of third-party taxi booking services."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00632,2015-05-11-T-026,632,Lina Chiam,"This Bill also ensures third-party taxi booking services manage their pool of registered drivers well to provide a safe experience for passengers who choose to use their taxi booking services to provide basic customer support which includes feedbacks, lost and found services, and to deter overcharging of passengers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00633,2015-05-11-T-026,633,Lina Chiam,"After this Bill is passed in Parliament, third-party taxi booking apps will soon have to follow a set of regulations, as outlined by the LTA."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00634,2015-05-11-T-026,634,Lina Chiam,"Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill. However, the Bill has raised some issues which may be of concern. To me, this Bill deviates from the idea of the concept of a free market, where supply of services by companies is set by market demand."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00635,2015-05-11-T-026,635,Lina Chiam,"Under the proposed Bill, LTA is to issue licences to service providers and to impose penalties upon the licence based on the term, ""a taxi booking service that is safe, reliable and efficient."""
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00636,2015-05-11-T-026,636,Lina Chiam,"I bring up the point about Singapore being a free market because what LTA should be concerned about is the safety of passengers who use the taxi booking apps. It should not be concerned whether or not if the company is able to financially sustain itself through its operations or whether taxi booking services are ""reliable and efficient""."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00637,2015-05-11-T-026,637,Lina Chiam,"Whether or not the services provided by the third-party taxi services are reliable and efficient should be left to users, such as the taxi-drivers and passengers, to decide. If the taxi-booking apps fail to be reliable and efficient, the users would choose not to use them and the company eventually will back out from the market."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00638,2015-05-11-T-026,638,Lina Chiam,"Even so, with the condition for safe needs to be clearly stated out in the Bill of what LTA determines as being ""safe"", it seems to be giving LTA an arbitrary right to determine what is safe and not without clear terms of reference to the licence applicants."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00639,2015-05-11-T-026,639,Lina Chiam,"This Bill seems to pre-qualify licensees on conditions which it sets, and is unfair to the third-party booking providers to prove themselves in order to gain market support and service to app users, especially new start-ups, who wish to venture into the market."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00640,2015-05-11-T-026,640,Lina Chiam,"The Bill also seems to be protecting the interest of existing taxi companies by the conditions set within the Bill. Under one of its terms and conditions for application of the licence, the booking fees charged by third-party taxi booking services cannot exceed the booking fees charged by taxi companies, which runs contrary to a free market system and could impede operations. Commuters can use their discretion on which taxi services they want to book and pay more if they think they can get better and more efficient services with that particular taxi company provider to secure a booking."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00641,2015-05-11-T-026,641,Lina Chiam,"For this reason, I would recommend a capping of the booking fee of 10% more than the usual booking fee set for all companies."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00642,2015-05-11-T-026,642,Lina Chiam,"The intent to protect the interest of the taxi companies seems apparent because the taxi booking apps from the taxi companies are exempted from the Act, apart from the point that they are exempted from the conditions of providing a taxi-booking service that is ""safe, reliable and efficient."""
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00643,2015-05-11-T-026,643,Lina Chiam,"When LTA decides to give directions to third-party operators when availability of a taxi is an issue under the proposed Bill, taxi booking services by companies, such as ComfortDelGro and SMRT, are not affected and can still offer the booking service to passengers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00644,2015-05-11-T-026,644,Lina Chiam,"From the available information in the public domain, we note that ComfortDelGro reported 35.6 million booking jobs in 2014. SMRT said that 40% of its taxi booking is through mobile app."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00645,2015-05-11-T-026,645,Lina Chiam,A common feedback that the general public has on the Bill is the possibility that LTA will state that taxi booking service cannot require commuters to specify their destinations before they can make bookings. This could also impede operations and rule out the possibility completely.
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00646,2015-05-11-T-026,646,Lina Chiam,"The term ""picking and choosing passengers"" is unfair to taxi drivers, commuters and the public."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00647,2015-05-11-T-026,647,Lina Chiam,"Before the emergence of third-party booking services, passengers found it hard to book taxis in Singapore despite the availability of free taxis driving around the island. This is because the booking service provided by each company only extended to taxis under their own company and the methodology of assigning bookings to taxi drivers were inefficient as taxi drivers also are reluctant to pick up immediate bookings."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00648,2015-05-11-T-026,648,Lina Chiam,"Taxi drivers get penalised if they refuse to ferry commuters to their destinations upon confirmation of booking by their taxi companies. While some taxi drivers ""pick and choose passengers"" for maximum revenue, many of the taxi drivers ""pick and choose"" because of the clash of schedule due to the location that the passengers would want to go to."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00649,2015-05-11-T-026,649,Lina Chiam,The introduction of third-party booking services and its success in matching taxi drivers to passengers spurred taxi companies to allow passengers to specify where their destination is so as to improve the booking success rate of the taxi booking service that they provide.
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00650,2015-05-11-T-026,650,Lina Chiam,"To the passengers, it is not unfair to them if taxi drivers do not pick up their booking but unfair to them if the taxi drivers on the street refuses to ferry them to their destination and that is already addressed in LTA's regulations."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00651,2015-05-11-T-026,651,Lina Chiam,"Although it is not apparent in the Bill that third-party taxi booking services would be required not to allow commuters to specify their destinations in their bookings, but LTA is empowered to impose such a condition under clause 17 of the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00652,2015-05-11-T-026,652,Lina Chiam,"Mdm Speaker, the Bill has a huge gapping flaw in its writing to address the issues it sought out to do as it does not seem to address the issue of private taxi drivers, solely vetted by the company itself, working outside the main regulatory framework."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00653,2015-05-11-T-026,653,Lina Chiam,"Taxi drivers, especially those who provide limousine services, have been complaining about the presence of limousine driver facilities by third-party taxi booking service's private vehicle drivers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00654,2015-05-11-T-026,654,Lina Chiam,"The wordings in the Bill for ""taxi"" describe a public service vehicle as defined in the Road Traffic Act and, therefore, seem to exclude third-party taxi booking services which facilitates booking of private car drivers by passengers from the Bill, and the necessity of being licensed by LTA."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00655,2015-05-11-T-026,655,Lina Chiam,"Mdm Speaker, let us not forget that NTUC has close connections with ComfortDelGro and that SMRT is owned 50% by Temasek Holdings. Under section 12(1), there should be an independent body, other than LTA, to vet the required conditions and the issuing of the certificate of registration."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00656,2015-05-11-T-026,656,Lina Chiam,"The penalty of up to $100,000 imposed on any providers who fail to comply with the conditions set by the LTA is a good deterrent to errant operators but, on the flip side, would also deter small start-ups which might have issues dealing with administrative lapses that they might be penalised for."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00657,2015-05-11-T-026,657,Lina Chiam,"Section 20(1)(b), under regulatory sanctions, the authority without compensation under subsection 2 against a registered provider if the authority is satisfied that the registered provider has failed to provide a third-party booking service that is safe, reliable and efficient, I would like to ask the Minister  how does LTA define a booking service that is safe, reliable and efficient? This will be very intimidating for someone who intends to register as a provider as LTA does not give clear definitions."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00658,2015-05-11-T-026,658,Lina Chiam,"For the safety of drivers and passengers, I would suggest the recommendation to legislate technology companies operating taxi booking apps to compulsorily provide taxis with a strong, adjustable holder and handphone solely dedicated for use on the apps system only."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00659,2015-05-11-T-026,659,Lina Chiam,"Mdm Speaker, will the third-party booking apps be fazed by these new regulatory framework and stifle competition?"
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00660,2015-05-11-T-026,660,Lina Chiam,"In conclusion, there are pros and cons to a free market, and a regulation versus free market argument is one that has long been battled out and it is up to the active players in the market to react in the best interest of drivers and passengers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00661,2015-05-11-T-026,661,Lina Chiam,Could companies that have taken part in the innovation from ground up face the biggest backlash arising from the new regulations that might have affected their lucrative taxi booking services and heavy investment outlay?
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00662,2015-05-11-T-026,662,Ang Hin Kee,"Mdm Speaker, let me first declare my interest as a staff of the NTUC and, categorically, mentioned that the NTUC has no relationship with ComfortDelGro, as far as taxi services are concerned."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00663,2015-05-11-T-026,663,Ang Hin Kee,"Mdm Speaker, there are four parties who may be affected by this new regulatory framework; namely the commuters, taxi drivers, taxi operators and third-party booking operators. Let me first share on commuters."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00664,2015-05-11-T-026,664,Ang Hin Kee,"We have all heard that the third-party taxi booking apps are fast gaining popularity among commuters. Besides making it easier to match taxi drivers to commuters, it also helps commuters at remote locations find a taxi more conveniently. Whilst the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has reiterated before that taxi services are de-regulated, efforts now to regulate third-party taxi booking should not be seen as a reversal of policy. Rather, I think it will give the LTA power to safeguard the interests of commuters."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00665,2015-05-11-T-026,665,Ang Hin Kee,"Many of us learn of the concerns of third-party booking apps from news reports elsewhere in other cities, highlighting safety concerns and risks that commuters faced. Protests by taxi drivers in other cities against such apps and private hire cars also raise confusions on the legitimacy of such services. In fact, in many cities, if you read the news reports, the initial euphoria of cheaper commuting and greater flexibility has since evaporated and replaced by risks and concerns that commuters may face."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00666,2015-05-11-T-026,666,Ang Hin Kee,"For our commuters, there are four concerns which I wish to highlight for which the LTA may need to take steps to address."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00667,2015-05-11-T-026,667,Ang Hin Kee,"First, I am glad that the regulations address concerns such as whether the taxi driver dispatched by the third-party taxi booking apps has a proper vocational driving licence; and whether a properly inspected taxi is being used instead of a private car where issues such as insurance coverage remain hazy; or whether the commuters will end up having to pay for hidden surcharges for using such services."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00668,2015-05-11-T-026,668,Ang Hin Kee,"Secondly, most third-party taxi booking apps require commuters to set up an account and provide sensitive information such as credit card details. This raise concerns on how the service providers may use the data. I hope the Ministry can offer assurance whether the Personal Data Protection Act or other regulations will be able to address this particular concern."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00669,2015-05-11-T-026,669,Ang Hin Kee,"Thirdly, there are also commuters who asked if non-taxis could be used for bookings made through app service providers. This is especially so as the same third-party apps operator can have different products and services to meet the needs of commuters, either for normal taxi hire or for private limousine services. Invariably, this will lead us to consider the role played by operators such as Uber and Grab. You see, in the market, I think there is some confusion. For Uber, they have various sub-products ranging from UberTaxi, UberX and Uber Exec. For Grab, you have GrabTaxi and GrabCar options."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00670,2015-05-11-T-026,670,Ang Hin Kee,"Commuters need to know under what conditions such private limousine services are allowed. For instance, some operators have this convenience built into their booking systems where after three unsuccessful taxi-matching efforts, commuters will be prompted with an offer for a private limousine service. Some commuters have been reported to be confused, not knowing whether to reject the car that came to pick them up or how to deal with or lodge complaints against these drivers should disputes arise."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00671,2015-05-11-T-026,671,Ang Hin Kee,"Fourth, the next concern relates to how some of these drivers and apps service operators operate. Unlike conventional private limo services which only levy flat charges, some commuters are surprised when they find surge pricing levied by the new private car hire services they took on via these third party apps. For example, during rainy weather or peak demand period, such as concert, end of concert, end of major events, such services levy higher charges and many commuters are unfamiliar or unaware, feeling aggrieved that they may have been ripped off. Private limousine services should also not be offering metered charges but yet, their apps allow them to contain fare meter options similar to taxi meter, whereby drivers can use it to take on street hails or driving by taxi stands or popular tourist attractions to offer their services to commuters and tourists."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00672,2015-05-11-T-026,672,Ang Hin Kee,"The second group that may be affected are taxi drivers. And to that end, I would like to declare my role as the Executive Advisor of the National Taxi Association. There are, indeed, increasingly more taxi drivers who use these apps services so that they can take on additional bookings on top of their taxi operator's booking, street hails and commuters waiting at taxi stands."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00673,2015-05-11-T-026,673,Ang Hin Kee,I would like to urge that the LTA be ready to intervene when it is clear that the interests of taxi drivers may be compromised and there are four concerns that I wish to highlight.
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00674,2015-05-11-T-026,674,Ang Hin Kee,"First, how do we ensure that third-party taxi booking operators are held financially accountable? They do not have huge investments in vehicle fleet to at least be held financially liable should the need arise. Some drivers shared with me that they did not receive prompt payment of their fares from these operators, causing them cash flow problems such as rental fees, fuel costs and ERP charges that they incur daily. So if there is a delay in collecting payment, they would have to find other ways to pay for these costs. Some drivers have also gone as far as to worry whether these operators will exit the market suddenly, taking along with them monies and incentives owed to taxi drivers or even refunds owed to commuters."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00675,2015-05-11-T-026,675,Ang Hin Kee,"The second concern  how do we ensure that third-party taxi booking operators treat our taxi drivers fairly? These new operators have started to choose taxi drivers, using their own internal rating systems to deactivate taxi drivers' accounts with the third-party taxi booking services. This is of particular concern as these apps companies are seeing fast growing numbers of registered drivers and users. Whilst it is important to create new urban transport solutions, we have to be mindful that checks and balances need to be in place to ensure that no one operator becomes the most dominant, and end up with the power to dictate the way services are delivered, how fares are set and how drivers are selected."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00676,2015-05-11-T-026,676,Ang Hin Kee,"Taxi drivers also shared with me that there are increasingly more incidents of commuters who made bookings but did not appear at the pick-up points. A driver recently related his experience where the commuter he picked up using his taxi operator's call booking system also made a booking using the third-party apps, resulting in two taxis arriving at the same location to ""fight"" for the same commuter. There are currently no penalties imposed on these no-shows but conversely, if a taxi driver does not appear on time, he faces disciplinary action by the taxi operators, and now, he, too, faces disciplinary action by third-party taxi operators. And taxi drivers may also be blacklisted from future bookings or even be called up for interviews by the LTA should the commuters send in a complaint."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00677,2015-05-11-T-026,677,Ang Hin Kee,"Thirdly, taxi drivers also shared how drivers of private limousine services start to show up at taxi stands to pick up customers they have secured using third-party booking services. There have been instances of those who even tout their services at taxi stands, cruise terminals, tourist attractions, hotels and night spots and even compete for street hail jobs using their metered functions in the apps. We have surfaced the feedback to the LTA and it is important that educational efforts be enhanced and enforcements be undertaken so that the drivers and commuters know where the regulations lie relating to these two different types of transport services."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00678,2015-05-11-T-026,678,Ang Hin Kee,"Fourthly, should there also be regulations governing the licensing of private limousine services and the types of drivers they hire? Currently, these drivers do not need to possess a vocational driving licence and there are no requirements for retraining unlike those imposed on taxi drivers. Some have called for these drivers to undergo security screening, medical check-ups and compulsory Medisave top-ups and LTA's Vocational Licensing Points System to be levied on them. For a level playing field, it may be necessary for the LTA to also regulate third-party bookings and drivers for private limousine services."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00679,2015-05-11-T-026,679,Ang Hin Kee,"The third group of persons that is affected by this new regulation are taxi operators. Currently, taxi operators in Singapore have to meet strict service and availability standards set by the LTA. They have also sunk in huge investments to meet these licensing conditions. In fact, not long ago, a taxi operator had to surrender his taxi operator licence and sell off his fleet because he failed to meet the standards."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00680,2015-05-11-T-026,680,Ang Hin Kee,"Today, not many cities in the world have ventured into legislations on the use of third-party taxi apps. This is despite the fact that many taxi operators and their hirers have taken their displeasure to the streets with the uneven level playing field available to third-party booking services. As such, LTA's move to ensure some level of consistency and business operating conditions for third-party booking operators should be a welcomed move by the taxi operators in Singapore."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00681,2015-05-11-T-026,681,Ang Hin Kee,"The fourth group is the new group of players in this market and these are the third-party service operators. Disruptive technologies such as those brought on by third-party taxi booking apps, are bringing about new urban transport solutions and prompting existing operators to explore new possibilities to stay competitive. As these apps are able to link commuters and drivers from all taxi fleets, they have maximised the matching processes."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00682,2015-05-11-T-026,682,Ang Hin Kee,"While these have been popular and convenient, some of their practices, however, are questionable. For instance, some operators have been advertising through their apps that their fares using their own private limousine services can be cheaper than taxi services, leading commuters to feel that the two are the same. These operators have also urged drivers to set up their own transport company and legally become a one-man private limousine service. Thereafter, they will lease a car to these drivers and send them bookings through their third-party apps. In reality, limo rental companies and third-party booking operators should employ these drivers instead."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00683,2015-05-11-T-026,683,Ang Hin Kee,"Mdm Speaker, we need to right-size our rules. I agree that we need not start off with too many rules to reduce all the risks that commuters and drivers may be exposed to. We should instead take note that commuters' habits are changing, and that it may be better to regularly review the rules governing the relationships between commuters, taxi drivers and taxi operators. For example, the existing tripartite framework involving the LTA, taxi operators and the National Taxi Association can also be expanded to include the third party taxi booking services operators. Incorporating them into this framework may enable them to emulate efforts by existing taxi operators, for example, by contributing towards helping taxi drivers with their Medisave contributions and other positive efforts that they can do to create a better industry for all."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00684,2015-05-11-T-026,684,Ang Hin Kee,"Under the new regulatory framework, I am also uncomfortable with the restriction that says taxi booking services cannot ask commuters to indicate their destinations. Third-party booking apps allow us to consider the possibility of implementing a taxi shuttling service. While this is not available today, this service can help us resolve some level of our taxi availability issues and make every taxi work harder, but not necessarily every taxi driver. These smart apps can easily calculate the fare for each driver based on the pick-up and drop-off locations, offering separate meters for each commuter in the same taxi. The driver can pick up two to three commuters along the way if the apps can assign the jobs effectively. People do not need to necessarily board the taxi at the same point, but they can be dropped off at points near to one another."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00685,2015-05-11-T-026,685,Ang Hin Kee,"Furthermore, the prevalent use of third-party apps has already hit our shores. We should also find ways to acknowledge their role in addressing taxi availability and also take a re-look at the Taxi Availability Indicators, especially in relation to the 250-km daily mileage requirement where with better taxi matching, there has been less empty cruising and enhanced taxi availability at remote locations."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00686,2015-05-11-T-026,686,Ang Hin Kee,"Mdm Speaker, beyond taxi booking, it is important that our early efforts in regulating apps booking or matching services send the right signal to investors, inventors, users and businesses. To this end, I believe Singapore can be the right place to promote innovations of technologies to solve urban needs – not just taxis but other urban needs – and yet, be the unique location to have the right-sized regulations to ensure that all the stakeholders' interests are safeguarded."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00687,2015-05-11-T-026,687,Ang Hin Kee,"I would only like to urge that at the end of the day, no one single operator or industry player should be allowed to have huge control of the market share, whether in terms of customer base or drivers' fleet, to the extent that the dominant player ends up dictating the service delivery and terms, benefitting neither the commuters nor taxi drivers. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00688,2015-05-11-T-026,688,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, first let me thank all four Members who have spoken on the Bill and for their expression of support. They have raised a range of different issues. Let me start by addressing those issues that are not covered under this Bill called the Third-Party Taxi Booking Service Providers Bill."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00689,2015-05-11-T-026,689,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Seng Han Thong, Mrs Chiam and Mr Ang Hin Kee gave their comments on distinguishing between taxi booking services and chauffeured vehicle matching services. So, there is a taxi part and there is a chauffeured vehicle part, especially if these are offered by the same service provider on the same smartphone application, and how this could give rise to some amount of confusion."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00690,2015-05-11-T-026,690,Lui Tuck Yew,"Some third-party taxi booking services in the market today – GrabTaxi, Easy Taxi and uberTAXI – can also match their users to chauffeured vehicle services. This is actually not a bad thing, because chauffeured vehicle services can plug the gap when taxi demand is extremely high. For instance, on some Friday evenings, it can be difficult to hail a taxi on the roads, or even to book one. And for those who really would like to pay more just in order to be able to get a ride to their chosen destination, chauffeured vehicle services actually can be the means for them to do so. So, some people welcome the convenience. They do not mind paying more to book a chauffeured vehicle service now and then, especially when demand for taxi services are high."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00691,2015-05-11-T-026,691,Lui Tuck Yew,"But what we want to do is to make sure that commuters are allowed to choose and receive the service they want and, therefore, we will require service providers to provide clear, and not misleading, information on the different services available."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00692,2015-05-11-T-026,692,Lui Tuck Yew,"This is why the proposed regulations will require service providers to ensure that their taxi booking service and any other transport matching service that is offered under the same application are clearly distinguished from each other, for example, by using separate and distinct icons. The differences in charges between these services must also be highlighted upfront and highlighted clearly. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, third-party taxi booking service providers can only dispatch licensed taxis and taxi drivers if the commuter requests taxi services specifically. So, the third-party booking app is prohibited from sending a chauffeured vehicle and charging chauffeured vehicle rates if a commuter books only a taxi on his third-party app."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00693,2015-05-11-T-026,693,Lui Tuck Yew,"I note also Mr Ang and Mr Seng's concerns over the impact that the growth of chauffeured vehicle services has on taxi drivers, and their suggestion to perhaps consider imposing more regulations on chauffeured vehicle service industry. While this is not within the scope of this Bill, I do acknowledge the concerns raised. Let me briefly outline the Government's current approach towards this issue."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00694,2015-05-11-T-026,694,Lui Tuck Yew,"Chauffeured vehicle services are not new. They have been available in the market. They are commonly used especially for corporate trips and special occasions like weddings, for instance. But what is different today is that the technology has made these services much more easily accessible in terms of matching passengers to chauffeured cars more seamlessly, just like how technology has improved the matching of taxis to commuters."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00695,2015-05-11-T-026,695,Lui Tuck Yew,"There are regulations in place for chauffeured vehicle services. They must be pre-booked. They cannot be hailed on the streets or to pick up passengers at taxi stands like taxis – this is one distinction between taxi services and chauffeured vehicle services. I know Mr Ang mentioned this point, and we certainly welcome feedback and specific information that we can use to track the individuals and the use of such vehicles so that LTA can investigate this more thoroughly."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00696,2015-05-11-T-026,696,Lui Tuck Yew,"Chauffeured vehicle services can only use private hire vehicles, which must be registered to business entities. They must also have the necessary insurance cover to be used for hire or reward. Private cars cannot be used to provide chauffeured vehicle services, and any person who does so is liable on conviction to a fine, imprisonment and/or forfeiture of his vehicle."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00697,2015-05-11-T-026,697,Lui Tuck Yew,The law is clear on the classification of the various types of vehicles and the regulations for each class. The penalties are stiff. LTA will strictly enforce against people who are found to flout the law.
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00698,2015-05-11-T-026,698,Lui Tuck Yew,"Similar to taxi services where fares have been deregulated since 1998, fares for chauffeured vehicle services are also not regulated. Different service providers charge fares in different ways, depending on the type of services offered and market conditions. This, I believe, encourages more competition and provides a wider variety of services for commuters, although commuters need also to be mindful of the terms and conditions before engaging such chauffeured vehicle services."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00699,2015-05-11-T-026,699,Lui Tuck Yew,"Let me also clarify that it is not against the rules for chauffeured vehicle services to utilise their apps as a ""meter"" to charge passengers based on distance travelled and/or time. Some chauffeured vehicle services already do this, while others offer a flat rate. Commuters are free to choose which service they prefer, taking into account the charging methods."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00700,2015-05-11-T-026,700,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Seng has suggested requiring drivers offering chauffeured vehicle services to hold some form of vocational licence or certification. This is something that we are prepared to consider in the future, if we decide that we need to further regulate the chauffeured vehicle services industry. But at this point in time, I would encourage the service providers to do more to train and to develop the competency of their drivers and to monitor the performance of their drivers more closely."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00701,2015-05-11-T-026,701,Lui Tuck Yew,"We will continue to monitor the chauffeured vehicle service industry. We will refine the regulations if needed. We know that in many countries and cities, there is a tussle involving the taxi companies and taxi drivers on one side, who feel that the responsibilities on them are much more onerous, versus chauffeured vehicle services on the other side, with a lot less regulation and a lot less pressure on these other services. So, we are watching it closely and you can be assured that we will take steps, if necessary, to address any concerns that may arise in our current situation."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00702,2015-05-11-T-026,702,Lui Tuck Yew,"Overall, to sum it up, the chauffeured vehicle service industry is fundamentally different from the taxi industry, even if the line today is no longer as clear as it was before. Also, to some extent, many chauffeurs are today former taxi drivers and they welcome the flexibility of another employment option. And so, it is also necessary for us to be quite cautious in how we go about further regulating the chauffeured vehicle industry if we are mindful to do so."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00703,2015-05-11-T-026,703,Lui Tuck Yew,"Having addressed that, let me move back to the main topic on third-party taxi booking services. One of the more innovative features offered by some apps is the ability to provide post-trip feedback on taxi drivers. Such feedback mechanisms help to improve accountability, which in turn enhances safety for commuters and encourages higher service standards. In fact, one taxi company – ComfortDelGro – has recognised this benefit and built in a similar feature in the latest version of its own booking app. So, there you see the interplay between third-party taxi booking apps and some of the features that they have, and how it links back to what the taxi companies are doing. And some of these features can actually help to raise the overall standard of the provision of taxi services in Singapore."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00704,2015-05-11-T-026,704,Lui Tuck Yew,"It is also understandable that third-party service providers would want to set internal service standards for their drivers to meet, so as to differentiate themselves to attract as well as retain commuters. On the other half of the equation, some service providers charge a cancellation fee if a commuter cancels his booking, or ban commuters for repeated no-shows . This helps to protect the taxi drivers to some extent. Overall, there are positive developments which benefit the taxi industry."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00705,2015-05-11-T-026,705,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang also spoke about some taxi drivers receiving late payment from service providers, causing them cash flow problems. I understand these concerns. That is why even while we want to try and keep the market competitive, and we do not want to over-regulate, there has to be certain minimum thresholds before we allow some of these service providers into the system. On one hand, certain Members have talked about clause 10 of the Bill, and asked why LTA needs some of those criteria to assess an applicant, why not allow this to be a completely free market. On the other hand, I think Mr Ang has also talked about the need to hold third-party service providers financially accountable because they can exit the market suddenly, and they need to treat the drivers fairly. So, we are trying to find the right equilibrium point, the right balance. We need to keep the market competitive so that there is every incentive for service providers to manage their drivers well and provide good services to commuters. It is not good for the taxi industry in Singapore if we just let any and every applicant, even though it may be below the threshold, into the market. As we have seen in Singapore today, we have quite a number of third-party service providers competing with each other. We think that there is actually more room for others to come in as well, provided they are serious players, provided they treat their drivers fairly and provided that they are financially strong and they are able to last the competition in the market."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00706,2015-05-11-T-026,706,Lui Tuck Yew,"Having said all that, I think there may still be occasional disputes between taxi drivers and service providers. And here, I encourage the National Taxi Association – as the representatives of taxi drivers – to assist them in exploring the avenues of recourse available. And LTA stands ready to assist, if necessary."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00707,2015-05-11-T-026,707,Lui Tuck Yew,"To Mr Seng Han Thong's query, LTA will modify the Taxi Service Operator Licence to apply the regulatory conditions on third-party taxi booking services, to taxi booking services offered by taxi companies, where relevant."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00708,2015-05-11-T-026,708,Lui Tuck Yew,"Moving on to possible concerns from commuters, Mr Ang may wish to know that third-party taxi booking service providers must comply with all applicable laws, such as the Personal Data Protection Act, and ensure that the privacy of commuters is appropriately safeguarded, as well as the data that they hold."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00709,2015-05-11-T-026,709,Lui Tuck Yew,"Some service providers collect personal information, such as credit card details, to provide a more seamless booking and payment experience for their customers. There are also other service providers that do not necessarily require such information, and these can cater to commuters who are not so comfortable with providing their personal information."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00710,2015-05-11-T-026,710,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang and Mrs Chiam voiced some discomfort that the regulations will prohibit third-party taxi booking services from mandating commuters to specify their destination when making a booking. This condition is important. It addresses concerns amongst commuters that some taxi drivers may not accept bookings when they see that the passengers are travelling only short distances, or to certain locations that are more far-flung or where there is a lower chance of picking up another fare on their return journey. We do not want taxi drivers to cherry pick their fares. This is consistent with the approach that we have taken for street hail."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00711,2015-05-11-T-026,711,Lui Tuck Yew,"So, I think we need to clarify and make sure that it is properly understood that commuters, if they choose to do so, can still indicate their destination if they want to. Commuters can still choose to indicate their destination if they think that this will increase their chances of getting a taxi. But what the regulations spell out is that they are not compelled to do so. So, the choice is with commuters – you choose or you choose not to. You choose maybe because you think it gives you a better chance of getting a taxi or, in certain instances, commuters say that ""I better choose not to so because if it is too short a distance, or if it is to a far-flung place, the taxi drivers may actually prefer not to take me or respond to my booking""."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00712,2015-05-11-T-026,712,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mrs Chiam had another area of discomfort, which is that the booking fee that third-party service providers can charge cannot exceed that charged by taxi companies. She felt that we should let the free market prevail, and let the service providers charge what they wish, to a limited extent."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00713,2015-05-11-T-026,713,Lui Tuck Yew,"I will explain the reasoning for this. I do not want to give third-party service providers the flexibility to charge higher than the taxi companies because I know that in a very short while, the taxi companies will come back to me and say, since MOT allowed a third-party app to charge $4, instead of $3.30, for instance, as a taxi operator, I also want to do the same. I do not want that to happen, because I think it will lead to price inflation for the commuter. Today, there is a certain standard that we have arrived at over time. This is what the taxi companies charge, so we require the third-party apps to charge at this level or no more than this level."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00714,2015-05-11-T-026,714,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Seng Han Thong asked whether LTA would look into the existing QoS standards imposed on taxi companies for call booking. So far, we have not observed any significant deterioration in their QoS performance. What we plan is for the third-party service providers to give us their data on bookings and which taxis from what companies answered to these bookings, so that we can match this together with the data provided to us by the taxi companies. If some taxi companies fall short and they claim that it is because their taxis have all been answering to all these other bookings, we can match the information provided by the third-party taxi service providers and the taxi companies. That is the intent behind some of the regulations."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00715,2015-05-11-T-026,715,Lui Tuck Yew,"In a nutshell, Mdm Speaker, this Bill aims to safeguard commuter interests by implementing a basic regulatory framework for third-party taxi booking services. At the same time, we hope it provides sufficient space for those services to grow, and we believe that over time, as we have seen already, it will benefit both commuters as well as taxi drivers. Thank you."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00716,2015-05-11-T-026,716,Speaker,"Clarifications. Yes, please."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00717,2015-05-11-T-026,717,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Thank you, Madam. I would just like to seek Minister's answer to the question I asked about clause 10(b)  why LTA would be basing its decision on licensing the third-party taxi booking services on the existing demand of these taxi booking services. It should not matter whether or not there is demand, because if there is demand, then the service would be used, and if there is no demand, then the service would just fade out. So, there is no need for the regulator to decide for the consumers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00718,2015-05-11-T-026,718,Lui Tuck Yew,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I think the Member has made a fair point. Overall, clause 10 gives LTA the opportunity to more comprehensively assess the potential of a possible player as well as the potential impact that an additional third-party taxi booking service has on our transport landscape. We always need to have that flexibility in order to assess the impact as well as to assess that individual applicant. But I do agree with the Member that all service providers, ultimately, need to assess the market conditions for themselves and the viability of their business case. Our approach and intent is to be light touch, to be facilitative, but we also want to avoid some of the problems that Mr Ang had mentioned where third-party service providers have delays in paying the drivers, refunding monies, and so on, and we want to try to minimise those situations as much as possible."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00719,2015-05-11-T-026,719,Ang Hin Kee,"I would like to ask the Minister  earlier you mentioned that chauffeured services vehicles, basically, will regulate their drivers, put them on training and the likes of it, but the reality in the market today is, a lot of the limo leasing companies are urging individual drivers to register themselves as a company. After you register yourself as a one-man company, you go ahead and rent a vehicle from this limo services and you take on bookings from the third-party apps."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00720,2015-05-11-T-026,720,Ang Hin Kee,"In essence, they are flying under the radar and trying to operate without having to be a company with drivers assigned to themselves. They are themselves one-man show. This in itself leads to many behaviours and activities on the ground such as vying for taxi stand commuters, operating very much like taxi drivers."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00721,2015-05-11-T-026,721,Ang Hin Kee,"So I hope that LTA will pay particular attention to this category because, in all intents and purposes, what they are basically doing is to operate like taxi drivers without having to comply with any of the regulations. In reality, if this phenomenon is allowed to grow, it will really put a lot of delays in our efforts to try to ensure that the third-party taxi booking services in Singapore grow in a proper manner whereas you have another group that is basically behaving in an illegitimate manner."
2015-05-11-T-026-S-00722,2015-05-11-T-026,722,Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the feedback. It is something that we are mindful of and, in fact, LTA has been stepping up its checks both in response to whistleblowers as well as mystery shopping that it is doing on its own. In recent months, there were a couple of cases that we managed to catch where these people were flouting the law. Moving forward, if you know of more of such cases, or if taxi drivers know of more of such cases, please do report them to LTA. Like I said, we will be happy to step up the checks but also, over time, look more carefully into the issue that you have raised, whether there are measures that we need to take, regulations that we need to adopt, in order to arrest this issue."

2015-05-11-T-028-S-00732,2015-05-11-T-028,732,Benedict Tan,"asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider shifting key school sports competitions to the night during the rainy season, to avoid the 2-6 pm thunderstorm peak hours, and to facilitate attendance by parents, extended family, and alumni."
2015-05-11-T-028-S-00733,2015-05-11-T-028,733,Heng Swee Keat,"The Ministry of Education promotes sports as it is an important platform for the holistic development of students. Specific to the inter-school sports competitions, organisers have to safeguard the safety and well-being of students, while bearing in mind the needs of parents, staff and stakeholders."
2015-05-11-T-028-S-00734,2015-05-11-T-028,734,Heng Swee Keat,"Inclement weather will invariably affect sports in our schools, given Singapore’s tropical climate. MOE has built more indoor sports facilities to allow more physical activities and sports competitions to be weather-proofed. However, for sports like football, hockey, rugby, softball and those that cannot be played indoors, schools will postpone the games to another day when there is inclement weather."
2015-05-11-T-028-S-00735,2015-05-11-T-028,735,Heng Swee Keat,Scheduling games in the evening will result in competition for use of the already heavily utilised public sports facilities in the evening. This will result in inconveniences to public users. Holding competitions in the evening will also increase students’ school hours and lengthen working hours of teachers.
2015-05-11-T-028-S-00736,2015-05-11-T-028,736,Heng Swee Keat,The Ministry of Education has no immediate plans to host the games in the evenings. We will continue to explore how parental involvement and support for the competitions can be further strengthened while balancing the needs of different parties involved.
2015-05-11-T-029-S-00737,2015-05-11-T-029,737,Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for Health over the past five years (a) what is the success rate of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments in public and private hospitals; (b) how many Singaporean couples have been undertaking these treatments and what are their rates of success; and (c) what percentage of these treatments are funded under the Government subsidy for assisted reproduction technology treatments.
2015-05-11-T-029-S-00738,2015-05-11-T-029,738,Gan Kim Yong,"Over the five-year period from 2009 to 2013, the average success rate of IVF treatment, calculated in terms of the percentage of fresh cycles performed which resulted in a live birth, was 22% in public hospitals and 20% in private healthcare institutions."
2015-05-11-T-029-S-00739,2015-05-11-T-029,739,Gan Kim Yong,"A total of 11,979 fresh cycles were performed for Singaporean couples (ie where at least one spouse is a Singapore citizen) during that period, and the success rate was 22%."
2015-05-11-T-029-S-00740,2015-05-11-T-029,740,Gan Kim Yong,"The co-funding policy for Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) treatment, which applies to ART centres in public hospitals only, was enhanced in January 2013 and also extended to cover frozen cycles. In that year, more than 80% of IVF treatment cycles for Singaporean couples in the public hospital ART centres benefited from the co-funding. Couples can also make use of their Medisave to pay for IVF treatment in both the public and private centres."
2015-05-11-T-030-S-00741,2015-05-11-T-030,741,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Manpower when processing S Pass and Employment Pass applications (a) what checks does the Ministry conduct to determine if (i) the academic qualifications and work experience stated in the applications are true and correct and (ii) the academic qualifications are obtained from accredited educational institutions; and (b) since 2012, what percentage of S pass and Employment Pass applications have been subject to these checks."
2015-05-11-T-030-S-00742,2015-05-11-T-030,742,Lim Swee Say,"Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass applicants are required to declare their qualifications and working experience in their applications. MOM assesses each application based on a combination of factors including qualifications, working experience and salary. Even though academic qualifications are not the sole determining factor for the granting of an EP or S Pass, it is certainly an important part of the assessment."
2015-05-11-T-030-S-00743,2015-05-11-T-030,743,Lim Swee Say,"Employers have a primary responsibility to ensure the authenticity and quality of the academic qualifications of the foreigners they wish to hire. As an additional safeguard, MOM conducts additional checks and verifications for applications submitted by a majority of the employers."
2015-05-11-T-030-S-00744,2015-05-11-T-030,744,Lim Swee Say,"To detect forged qualifications, MOM conducts internal database checks, as well as external checks through third-party screening agencies, direct verifications with the issuing institutions, and by requiring the employer to show proof that they have verified that the submitted qualifications are genuine."
2015-05-11-T-030-S-00745,2015-05-11-T-030,745,Lim Swee Say,"Those who are found to have submitted forged documents or false particulars in a deliberate attempt to mislead the Ministry are dealt with firmly. They may be fined up to $20,000, and /or imprisoned for up to two years. They will also be barred from working in Singapore."
2015-05-11-T-030-S-00746,2015-05-11-T-030,746,Lim Swee Say,"As for qualifications obtained from an unaccredited institution that does not ensure that its students are properly qualified (commonly known as qualifications from “degree mills”), MOM conducts 100% checks and disregards these qualifications completely. They will have to meet more stringent criteria in terms of experience and salary in order to qualify for the EP or S Pass."
2015-05-11-T-031-S-00747,2015-05-11-T-031,747,Png Eng Huat,asked the Prime Minister whether the Public Service Division will consider setting up a central authority to screen foreign degrees for public service employment purposes in light of the proliferation of degree programmes and degrees of varying qualities offered in the education industry.
2015-05-11-T-031-S-00748,2015-05-11-T-031,748,Teo Chee Hean,"The Public Service offers a wide range of jobs with different requirements. Hiring is not based on academic qualifications alone. We take into account other important factors such as relevant work experience, personal attributes and motivations, and commitment to public service. For a mid-career candidate, relevant work experience is more important than academic qualifications for a good job fit. Therefore, the extent to which a candidate’s degree, whether local or foreign, is considered in the hiring decision will differ from job to job, and person to person."
2015-05-11-T-031-S-00749,2015-05-11-T-031,749,Teo Chee Hean,"Each public agency is in the best position to decide on the relevance and appropriateness of a candidate’s degree to recruit the best person for the job, considering his other credentials and the requirements of the job. In assessing foreign degrees, the Public Service Division’s guidance to agencies is to check whether the foreign degree is accredited by the home government where the degree originates. For professional qualifications obtained from foreign institutions, the qualifications must be recognised by the relevant professional bodies in Singapore to be considered for the relevant public service post. This is a practical approach and not something a central authority can do."
2015-05-11-T-032-S-00750,2015-05-11-T-032,750,Baey Yam Keng,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources why smoking is currently prohibited only at certain parks and not at all parks.
2015-05-11-T-032-S-00751,2015-05-11-T-032,751,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Ministry’s long-term vision is to prohibit smoking at all public places except at designated smoking points to protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke.
2015-05-11-T-032-S-00752,2015-05-11-T-032,752,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Smoking is currently prohibited in nature reserves under the Parks and Trees Regulations as it poses fire hazards that can harm the rare and endangered flora and fauna in the nature reserves. There are also some parks which have been designated as smoke-free parks as they are in close proximity to institutions such as hospitals and polytechnics. Smoking is also prohibited in selected areas of other parks, such as covered spaces, buildings like shelters and toilets, playgrounds and fitness corners. The National Parks Board works with the Health Promotion Board and its volunteers under the Blue Ribbon project on outreach efforts to discourage smoking in all parks. The Ministry is also considering enhanced smoking prohibition in other premises such as Institutes of Higher Learning."
2015-05-11-T-033-S-00753,2015-05-11-T-033,753,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Department of Statistics has an updated figure for the Average Household Expenditure on Basic Needs (AHEBN); (b) how frequently does the Department intend to publish the AHEBN; and (c) whether the Department plans to define AHEBN for different types of households, including those of persons with disabilities."
2015-05-11-T-033-S-00754,2015-05-11-T-033,754,Lim Hng Kiang,"The Average Household Expenditure on Basic Needs (AHEBN) is an estimate of the average monthly expenditure that households spend on essential needs such as food, clothing and shelter."
2015-05-11-T-033-S-00755,2015-05-11-T-033,755,Lim Hng Kiang,"The data used to compile the AHEBN is primarily from the Household Expenditure Survey (HES) which is conducted once every five years. Based on the latest HES conducted in 2012/13, the AHEBN for a four-person household was about $1,250."
2015-05-11-T-033-S-00756,2015-05-11-T-033,756,Lim Hng Kiang,"As the HES does not collect information on whether households include persons with disabilities, it is not possible to compile the AHEBN for households consisting of persons with disabilities. The AHEBN is also not available for other household types besides household size."
2015-05-11-T-034-S-00757,2015-05-11-T-034,757,Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Government will consider introducing measures to help small retailers in shopping malls by (i) disallowing the practice of landlords pegging the rental charge to the tenant retailers' sales volume when renewing their leases; and (ii) introducing a platform by which tenants can take reference on what should be the fair market rates for the shop rent.
2015-05-11-T-034-S-00758,2015-05-11-T-034,758,Lim Hng Kiang,"Rental leases are decided based on commercial considerations, with the rates determined by supply and demand. As a general principle, we should allow the market to operate without the Government prescribing how landlords and tenants structure their leases. This would lead to inefficient outcomes and make all parties worse off."
2015-05-11-T-034-S-00759,2015-05-11-T-034,759,Lim Hng Kiang,"There are other ways to help our companies manage their rental costs. In consultation with key stakeholders and with support from the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Singapore Business Federation released the Business Leasing Guide in January 2015, which provides information and shares best practices to guide companies when they negotiate lease contracts with their landlords."
2015-05-11-T-034-S-00760,2015-05-11-T-034,760,Lim Hng Kiang,"Information on retail rental rates is also publicly available on the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s website. The data is updated every quarter. The user is able to access statistics on monthly rents at the postal district level, broken down by the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile for a range of floor areas and floor levels. This provides useful information for companies when they are making leasing decisions and negotiating with their landlords."
2015-05-11-T-035-S-00761,2015-05-11-T-035,761,Fatimah Lateef,asked the Minister for Manpower whether there is a comprehensive and integrated plan with multi-agency inputs to review and uplift the conditions of foreign worker dwellings at Lorongs 1 to 42 of Geylang.
2015-05-11-T-035-S-00762,2015-05-11-T-035,762,Lim Swee Say,"Private residential properties, including those in Geylang, are covered by existing rules that regulate the rental of properties whether to locals or foreigners. This is to safeguard the well-being of tenants and reduce overcrowding in the neighbourhoods. These rules include standards pertaining to maximum occupancy, fire safety as well as illegal subletting and conversion of premises. The Government takes a serious view of persons who breach these rules."
2015-05-11-T-035-S-00763,2015-05-11-T-035,763,Lim Swee Say,"For example, under the Planning Act, persons who house more than eight tenants, in private residential properties can be fined up to $200,000. Under the Fire Safety Act, owners who make unauthorised changes that affect the fire safety at their premises, such as illegal partitions, may also be fined up to $200,000, jailed up to two years, or both."
2015-05-11-T-035-S-00764,2015-05-11-T-035,764,Lim Swee Say,"Correspondingly, the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) requires employers to ensure that their workers are housed in conditions that comply with the relevant agencies’ rules. Employers who neglect this would have violated Work Pass conditions and are subject to a maximum penalty of $10,000 or 12 months’ imprisonment per offence and may be banned from hiring foreign workers."
2015-05-11-T-035-S-00765,2015-05-11-T-035,765,Lim Swee Say,"Agencies actively enforce these rules, and special attention is paid to higher risk areas such as Geylang. Public officers are empowered to enter premises under specific circumstances for the purposes of conducting an inspection. MOM, SCDF, SPF and URA regularly conduct joint enforcement; and this can be stepped up when necessary. For instance, over the past six months, agencies have systematically inspected more than 600 units known to be housing foreign workers in Geylang. All errant owners or operators of overcrowded properties, and negligent employers, uncovered as a result of these inspections are being taken to task. Agencies will continue to take a targeted, intel-driven approach to prioritise inspections."
2015-05-11-T-035-S-00766,2015-05-11-T-035,766,Lim Swee Say,"Beyond enforcement, we are also seeking to raise public awareness so as to change behaviour on the ground. For instance, public notices will be placed around Geylang to remind foreign workers and the public of URA’s rules. MOM will also be sending advisory letters to employers, especially those, whose workers stay in Geylang to remind them to ensure that their workers’ housing complies with the relevant rules."
2015-05-11-T-035-S-00767,2015-05-11-T-035,767,Lim Swee Say,"We urge all relevant parties to be vigilant to ensure that they are not in violation of the law. In particular, homeowners should regularly check their residential properties, and employers should check their workers’ accommodation, to ensure compliance with existing rules and regulations. Anyone with information on overcrowded premises should contact the authorities so that appropriate investigations and enforcement actions can be taken."
2015-05-11-T-036-S-00768,2015-05-11-T-036,768,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"asked the Minister for Education (a) whether there are distinctions in how students of 7-12 years old, 13-18 years old, and Institutes of Higher Learning are being sensitised to inter-cultural issues and coached in thoughtful communication over racial and religious issues; and (b) how are youths being educated in issues of online communication particularly the issues of online mob mentality and the social, political and legal boundaries surrounding online postings."
2015-05-11-T-036-S-00769,2015-05-11-T-036,769,Heng Swee Keat,"In schools, students are taught about intercultural issues primarily through Character and Citizenship Education but it is also found in a variety of other subjects like English and Social Studies. Younger students learn through stories of our daily interactions with different people in school and the community. As students mature, they discuss and reflect on current and relevant case studies from newspapers and social media, where they are encouraged to consider various perspectives and clarify their values."
2015-05-11-T-036-S-00770,2015-05-11-T-036,770,Heng Swee Keat,"Every year, Racial Harmony Day is specially commemorated in all education institutions to focus on social cohesion and racial harmony. Learning experiences through Values in Action, Learning Journeys and Co-curricular activities (CCA) further provide our students of all ages with opportunities to engage and interact with people of different backgrounds."
2015-05-11-T-036-S-00771,2015-05-11-T-036,771,Heng Swee Keat,"Through classroom discussion and school organised activities, students understand and appreciate our major religions, how to share and maintain common spaces, and the consequences of prejudice and stereotyping others. Dialogues with community leaders and interactive drama are also programmes for older students to strengthen their understanding for social cohesion and community engagement."
2015-05-11-T-036-S-00772,2015-05-11-T-036,772,Heng Swee Keat,"Such exposure deepens as our students progress to the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). Within the classroom, our students participate in scenario discussions, projects and deep structured reflection. Outside the classroom, students are exposed through experiential activities, such as community service projects, field trips, and dialogues with community leaders. Through these experiences, our students come to appreciate the importance of respecting diversity and maintaining racial and religious harmony, and to develop empathy and the skills to achieve effective intercultural communication. The importance of respect and cultural sensitivities are also instilled through student code of conduct which prohibits inflammatory content and emphasise mutual respect in all social interactions and online exchanges."
2015-05-11-T-036-S-00773,2015-05-11-T-036,773,Heng Swee Keat,"For online communication, students learn how to use digital technologies safely and responsibly in Cyber Wellness lessons. These are designed based on the principles of ""Respect for Self and Others"" and ""Safe and Responsible Use"". Through discussions on authentic case scenarios and reflection, students practise responsible decision making in the context of online interactions."
2015-05-11-T-036-S-00774,2015-05-11-T-036,774,Heng Swee Keat,"At a younger age, the students are taught basic netiquette and how to safeguard themselves in cyberspace. Older students are taught to take on a more active role to promote positive online relationship management. They learn about responsible online behaviour, the consequences of one’s online expressions and greater social and cultural awareness in online interactions. In addition, students are educated on the concerns relating to the use of social media such as mob mentality, and the far reaching consequences of online expressions and impact on lives. They also learn the laws, regulations and ethics related to online communications."
2015-05-11-T-036-S-00775,2015-05-11-T-036,775,Heng Swee Keat,"As students move on to the IHLs, expectations regarding appropriate online etiquette are discussed via a mixture of compulsory modules, elective modules and school-wide programmes. As students discuss the benefits of social media, they are also acquainted with how it can be misused for seditious or malicious acts. Students also learn about the social impact and potential legal implications of their online actions."
2015-05-11-T-037-S-00776,2015-05-11-T-037,776,Fatimah Lateef,"asked the Minister for Health (a) over the last three years, what is the take-up rate for the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccination amongst the recommended age group of 9 to 26 year-old females; and (b) what course of action is being planned to enhance the take-up rate."
2015-05-11-T-037-S-00777,2015-05-11-T-037,777,Gan Kim Yong,HPV vaccination was added to the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) in November 2010. The vaccine is recommended by the Expert Committee for Immunisation (ECI) for girls aged 9 to 26 years old.
2015-05-11-T-037-S-00778,2015-05-11-T-037,778,Gan Kim Yong,"As notification is voluntary, our data on the take-up rate for HPV is based on the numbers who have made claims from Medisave. Based on this, over the past three years, from 2012 to 2014, 34,209 persons have taken up HPV vaccinations."
2015-05-11-T-037-S-00779,2015-05-11-T-037,779,Gan Kim Yong,"To raise the awareness of HPV vaccination among girls aged 9 to 26 years, information on HPV infection and the vaccination is included in print media, such as parents and women’s magazines, and disseminated through professional healthcare societies such as the Obstetrics & Gynaecological Society of Singapore (OGSS) and the College of Family Physicians. HPV-related information will also be made available to the public on digital media in May 2015 on HPB’s Screen for Life website. We will continue to monitor the uptake of HPV vaccination and work to increase awareness of the benefits of vaccination."
2015-05-11-T-038-S-00780,2015-05-11-T-038,780,Lee Li Lian,"asked the Minister for Transport whether ex-offenders qualify to apply for the taxi vocational licence and, if not, what are the reasons."
2015-05-11-T-038-S-00781,2015-05-11-T-038,781,Lui Tuck Yew,"LTA takes into account offences that may affect an individual’s suitability to be a taxi driver. Ex-offenders who have committed extremely serious offences, such as rape, are debarred from obtaining a Taxi Driver’s Vocational Licence (TDVL) for life. Those who have committed less serious offences, such as housebreaking, are debarred for three to five years, after which they can apply. Other offences, such as being a member of an unlawful assembly, do not result in debarment. This calibrated approach is needed to maintain public confidence in the safety of our taxi services, especially as it is common for taxi passengers to travel alone and sometimes late in the night. At the same time, it provides ex-offenders with a second chance."
2015-05-11-T-039-S-00782,2015-05-11-T-039,782,Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the person involved in the track intrusion at the North-South Line near Chua Chu Kang MRT that disrupted services on 27 February 2015 has been identified and arrested; and (b) what measures have been taken to prevent such future track intrusions.
2015-05-11-T-039-S-00783,2015-05-11-T-039,783,Lui Tuck Yew,The suspected male intruder was charged in court on 28 April 2015.
2015-05-11-T-039-S-00784,2015-05-11-T-039,784,Lui Tuck Yew,"To further reduce the likelihood of intrusions onto at-grade tracks, SMRT has strengthened the perimeter fencing between Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Gombak. In addition, SMRT has enhanced their inspections of all at-grade tracks. The Public Transport Security Committee, which comprises Government agencies and the operators, is also implementing a number of additional measures, including installing crash-rated bollards and strengthening structures against forced entry."
2015-05-11-T-040-S-00785,2015-05-11-T-040,785,Yee Jenn Jong,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the results of the two diesel hybrid bus trials conducted by the public transport operators since 2010; (b) what are the costs incurred for conducting those trials; (c) what are the lessons learnt from those trials that can be applied to the new one-year diesel hybrid bus trial mentioned in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015; and (d) when will diesel hybrid buses be implemented on a larger scale in Singapore.
2015-05-11-T-040-S-00786,2015-05-11-T-040,786,Lui Tuck Yew,"The two trials that were conducted from 2010-2012 indicated an approximate 25% improvement in fuel efficiency, with less conclusive results for emissions. The fuel savings were, however, insufficient to offset the 140% higher cost compared to normal buses. ComfortDelGro Engineering, which partnered LTA for the trials, estimated the trials to cost $1.7 million. LTA’s share came up to about $660,000."
2015-05-11-T-040-S-00787,2015-05-11-T-040,787,Lui Tuck Yew,"SBST’s on-going diesel hybrid bus trial, as mentioned in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015, was started in March this year at the manufacturer’s initiative. It is intended to test the performance of the manufacturer’s diesel hybrid buses in Singapore’s climate. There is no funding from Government for this trial."
2015-05-11-T-040-S-00788,2015-05-11-T-040,788,Lui Tuck Yew,"In view of the significantly higher cost and unproven reliability in our local climate, we have decided not to adopt diesel hybrid buses on a large scale for now. However, we will continue to monitor prices and find opportunities to trial different models of such buses."
2015-05-11-T-041-S-00789,2015-05-11-T-041,789,Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Police has received complaints about (i) the activities of itinerant door-to-door salesmen who peddle their wares when most people are at work leaving only the domestic helpers, the elderly and the children at home; (ii) the coercion put on residents by these salesmen to let them into their homes; (b) what are the common complaints received about such salesmen; (c) what action has been taken; and (d) whether Neighbourhood Police Posts can organise campaigns for HDB residents on what to do when such salesmen call at their homes."
2015-05-11-T-041-S-00790,2015-05-11-T-041,790,Teo Chee Hean,"The Police do not track the number of reports lodged against the activities of itinerant door-to-door salesmen, as door-to-door sales does not constitute a criminal offence that police officers attend to. Itinerant hawkers who carry and peddle food or goods from place to place or door-to-door without a licence are liable to be charged for illegal hawking under the Environmental Public Health Act, which is enforced by the National Environment Agency (NEA). First-time offenders will face a fine of up to $5,000."
2015-05-11-T-041-S-00791,2015-05-11-T-041,791,Teo Chee Hean,"The Police will work closely with the NEA in cases where door-to-door salesmen cause public nuisance or commit other offences such as cheating under the guise of door-to-door sales. Members of the public are advised not to allow anyone to enter their houses, whether door-to-door salesmen or other persons, without verifying the identity of the person. If in doubt, members of the public should verify his identify with his company. If a person enters or attempts to enter a home without permission or proper authority, then the home owner or occupant should seek assistance from the Police. The Neighbourhood Police Centres will include such advice to residents in their crime prevention outreach activities."
2015-05-11-T-042-S-00792,2015-05-11-T-042,792,Foo Mee Har,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether charities and Institutions of a Public Character are eligible to buy Singapore Savings Bonds; and (b) if so, whether a higher investment cap can be applied to these organisations as compared to individual investors."
2015-05-11-T-042-S-00793,2015-05-11-T-042,793,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Since the Government announced its plans to introduce the Singapore Saving Bond (SSB), there have been suggestions for charities, Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs), and other not-for-profit organisations like trade unions to also be eligible to purchase SSBs."
2015-05-11-T-042-S-00794,2015-05-11-T-042,794,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The SSB is intended to provide retail investors with a safe and flexible option to save for the long term. Therefore, the SSB has features such as the small minimum investment amount and non-transferability which were designed with individual savers in mind."
2015-05-11-T-042-S-00795,2015-05-11-T-042,795,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Organisations like charities, IPCs, or unions that are interested to invest in Government securities are currently able to invest in conventional Singapore Government Securities. The returns on SSBs are based on those of conventional Singapore Government Securities, and both securities are guaranteed by the Government."
2015-05-11-T-042-S-00796,2015-05-11-T-042,796,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,There is no limit on the amount of conventional Singapore Government Securities that can be held by institutional investors. Organisations can also consider other safe fixed-income products such as bonds issued by Statutory Boards.
2015-05-11-T-042-S-00797,2015-05-11-T-042,797,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The main difference is that the SSB can be redeemed with the Government before maturity, for the full principal amount and no penalty. The added protection against capital loss is intended to encourage individuals to save notwithstanding concerns about immediate liquidity needs, which organisations are in a better position to plan for."
2015-05-11-T-043-S-00798,2015-05-11-T-043,798,Ang Hin Kee,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether are there adequate spaces for the parking or stopping of tour buses to ensure safe boarding and alighting of tourists at attraction sites such as the Merlion Park and Chinatown as well as the smooth flow of other motorists in those areas; and (b) what are the common challenges faced by our tour guides and tour bus drivers in ensuring their own safety and those of the tourists they are in-charge of at attraction sites.
2015-05-11-T-043-S-00799,2015-05-11-T-043,799,S Iswaran,"In areas of tourism interest, such as the Chinatown Conservation Area and the Merlion Park, the Government has implemented temporary roadside and surface coach parks where it is feasible and there is available State land."
2015-05-11-T-043-S-00800,2015-05-11-T-043,800,S Iswaran,"However, it is not always possible to have such coach parking facilities in the immediate vicinity of the attraction. To further assist travel agencies, tourist guides and their coach drivers, the Singapore Tourism Board has issued advisories to inform them of all the coach parking locations and drop-off/pick-up points for popular tourist spots and retailers in central Singapore."
2015-05-11-T-043-S-00801,2015-05-11-T-043,801,S Iswaran,"The Singapore Tourism Board, the Land Transport Authority, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority actively monitor the situation on the ground to ensure that safety is not compromised. Agencies have also instituted mitigating measures wherever possible. For instance, the Land Transport Authority has been working with private developers prior to the construction of new tourist attractions to estimate the travel patterns, so that adequate provision for both parking as well as drop-off/pick-up spaces can be made within the new attraction itself."
2015-05-11-T-044-S-00802,2015-05-11-T-044,802,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Manpower whether he can clarify what the definition of ""lifetime wage"" is, for the purpose of qualification for the Silver Support Scheme and what is the rationale for this criterion."
2015-05-11-T-044-S-00803,2015-05-11-T-044,803,Lim Swee Say,"The Silver Support Scheme aims to supplement the retirement incomes of the bottom 20% to 30% of elderly Singaporeans. As the scheme is for Singaporeans aged 65 and above, many could have retired, so their wages today would not be meaningful in determining eligibility. To ensure that assistance goes to those with lesser means, the Government will therefore look at lifetime wages earned before their retirement, together with the level of household support they have and the type of housing they live in. For lifetime wages specifically, we will look at the individual’s total CPF contributions accumulated over his or her working life as a proxy, and consider those with lower total CPF contributions before they reached 55. We will not look at CPF contributions after 55 so that Singaporeans are not discouraged from continuing to work in their later years. We are aiming to implement the scheme around the first quarter of 2016, and will provide further details closer to implementation."
2015-05-11-T-045-S-00804,2015-05-11-T-045,804,Ang Hin Kee,"asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider introducing a scheme, similar to the Temporary Employment Credit scheme, whereby the Government does a CPF top-up for freelancers and self-employed individuals who make voluntary contributions into their CPF or Medisave Account."
2015-05-11-T-045-S-00805,2015-05-11-T-045,805,Ang Hin Kee,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry can provide an update on (a) whether the current level of Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings for freelancers and self-employed individuals are adequate for their retirement and medical needs; and (b) what further measures have been put in place to encourage them to make regular CPF contributions or savings into their Medisave Account to finance the premiums for MediShield Life.
2015-05-11-T-045-S-00806,2015-05-11-T-045,806,Lim Swee Say,"Mr Ang has suggested introducing a scheme, similar to the Temporary Employment Credit (TEC), to top up the CPF accounts of Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) who make voluntary contributions to their CPF. Today, under the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme, the Government already tops up the Medisave Account of SEPs who make Medisave contributions. Such WIS payouts are limited to SEPs and employees with incomes below $1,900, or about the bottom 30% of the working population. SEPs are also given incentives to make voluntary contributions to their CPF accounts through a tax relief on their contributions."
2015-05-11-T-045-S-00807,2015-05-11-T-045,807,Lim Swee Say,"Mr Ang has asked whether the CPF savings of SEPs are sufficient to meet their retirement and healthcare needs. Today SEPs are only required to contribute to their Medisave Accounts to save for their healthcare needs. The median Medisave balances of SEPs1 was $21,700 in 2014, compared to $14,300 five years ago. This is still lower than the median Medisave balances of employees, which was $27,700 in 2014."
2015-05-11-T-045-S-00808,2015-05-11-T-045,808,Lim Swee Say,"Making sure SEPs comply with mandatory contributions to their CPF Medisave accounts has been challenging. The CPF Board reaches out to SEPs through mailers and road shows to encourage them to make regular Medisave contributions. CPF Board also facilitates arrangement for those who wish to make their Medisave contributions via instalments, and has partnered several Licensing Authorities (LAs) to ensure that their licensees contribute to Medisave. These efforts are complemented by industry or company-led initiatives, such as the Drive-and-Save Scheme by the National Taxi Association and the Serve-and-Save Scheme by Woodlands Transport Services, where the companies make co-contributions to their SEPs Medisave. In addition, the CPF Board has recently introduced the Earn-and-Save Scheme to the real estate industry. Under this scheme, SEPs can authorise their companies to deduct Medisave contributions from their commissions."
2015-05-11-T-045-S-00809,2015-05-11-T-045,809,Lim Swee Say,"With effect from 1 January this year, CPF contribution rates to the Medisave Account was increased by one percentage point. The higher CPF contributions will go towards helping all CPF members including SEPs meet their ongoing healthcare needs including paying for MediShield Life premiums. In addition, with effect from 1 January 2016, the Government will pay an additional interest of 1% on the first $30,000 of CPF balances for members aged 55 and above. This will be on top of the existing 1% extra interest on the first $60,000 of CPF balances. This means that CPF members aged 55 and above can earn up to 6% interest in total on their CPF savings."
2015-05-11-T-045-S-00810,2015-05-11-T-045,810,Lim Swee Say,"The Government will also provide substantial MediShield Life premium subsidies to eligible Singaporeans. These include Premium Subsidies for the lower- to middle-income, Pioneer Generation Subsidies, and Transitional Subsidies to phase in the shift to MediShield Life. For those who are in financial need and are unable to pay their share of premiums even after subsidies and Medisave, the Government will provide Additional Premium Support, to help them pay for their MediShield Life premiums."
2015-05-11-T-045-S-00811,2015-05-11-T-045,811,Lim Swee Say,"As SEPs are not required by law to contribute to the Ordinary or Special Account, they may not have much in their CPF for retirement. CPF members who are SEPs throughout their working lives may have to rely on family or other avenues such as monetising their housing, if they need a source of income in retirement. Ultimately SEPs must take personal responsibility for their retirement planning and make regular contributions to their CPF accounts if they wish to have enough in CPF for their basic retirement needs."
2015-05-11-T-046-S-00812,2015-05-11-T-046,812,Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the regulations on rental of properties by foreign workers; (b) what regulatory powers are available to public officers who knock on doors but are denied entry; (c) over the past year, how many checks have been conducted on suspected illegal rentals of HDB flats to foreign workers; (d) how many have been evicted and whether these numbers have increased over the years; and (e) what measures are in place to encourage residents and community leaders to report suspected overcrowding in rental flats and whether these need to be improved."
2015-05-11-T-046-S-00813,2015-05-11-T-046,813,Lim Swee Say,"Property owners who wish to rent out their units or rooms to foreign workers are subject to guidelines and rules issued by URA and HDB for the renting of private properties and HDB flats respectively. These include the maximum allowable occupancy by tenants in each unit. In addition, requirements set by agencies, for example, SCDF’s fire safety standards which, amongst others, prohibit illegal partitioning of units, must continue to be complied with by the owners and tenants of rented premises."
2015-05-11-T-046-S-00814,2015-05-11-T-046,814,Lim Swee Say,"Correspondingly, MOM’s Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations requires employers to ensure their work permit holders are housed in accommodation that meets the rules set by various agencies."
2015-05-11-T-046-S-00815,2015-05-11-T-046,815,Lim Swee Say,"Agencies have regulatory powers to enter units for inspections or investigations where they were previously denied entry. For example, the recent amendments to the Housing and Development Act have increased the powers of investigation for HDB officers and allow them to enter premises, if necessary, with a search warrant. Similarly, public officers from agencies like the SCDF, NEA and MOM are also empowered to enter premises for the purposes of conducting an inspection under specific circumstances."
2015-05-11-T-046-S-00816,2015-05-11-T-046,816,Lim Swee Say,"HDB investigates and takes action for cases that have infringed HDB’s rules for renting out the whole flat or rooms. However, HDB does not have statistics on cases involving foreign workers."
2015-05-11-T-046-S-00817,2015-05-11-T-046,817,Lim Swee Say,"Our agencies will continue their concerted enforcement efforts. Residents who suspect that their neighbouring units are housing more than the allowed numbers of subtenants should make a report to HDB. Similarly, if neighbours suspect that a private property is overcrowded with foreign workers, they should report this to URA. Both HDB and URA will investigate and take up enforcement actions as appropriate. MOM will also hold the errant employers who allowed their foreign workers to be housed in such conditions to account."
2015-05-11-T-047-S-00818,2015-05-11-T-047,818,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) of the 12,930 workers laid off in 2014, how many were (i) citizens and (ii) permanent residents; and (b) of the residents (citizens and permanent residents), how many received retrenchment benefits (over and above notice period pay) that are equivalent to their last drawn salary of (i) more than 6 months; (ii) between 4 and 6 months inclusive; (iii) between 1 and 3 months inclusive; (iv) less than 1 month; and (v) none at all."
2015-05-11-T-047-S-00819,2015-05-11-T-047,819,Lim Swee Say,"Fewer residents were laid off in 2014 compared to 2013. Of the 12,930 workers laid off in 2014, 7,240 or 56% were residents. This is lower than their two-thirds representation in the workforce. Data on the retrenchment benefits paid to this group is not available."
2015-05-11-T-047-S-00820,2015-05-11-T-047,820,Lim Swee Say,"As the economy restructures, some consolidation and exit of businesses will take place. MOM, WDA and the tripartite partners stand ready to help locals who have been laid off to re-skill and upgrade, to put them in a good position to take on new jobs. The resident long-term unemployment rate, reflecting those who have been unemployed for 25 weeks or more, has been low at 0.6%, and is among the lowest globally."
2015-05-11-T-048-S-00821,2015-05-11-T-048,821,Randolph Tan,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the number and proportions of PMEs who have successfully found jobs through CaliberLink each year since its launch in 2012; and (b) whether the introduction of the Jobs Bank has had any impact on CaliberLink's career services.
2015-05-11-T-048-S-00822,2015-05-11-T-048,822,Lim Swee Say,"The Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) set up CaliberLink in December 2011 to provide training advisory and employment assistance for local Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs). CaliberLink provides career coaching for PMEs, workshops to help them improve their job search skills, as well as recruitment and networking events to connect PMEs with hiring employers. Today, these services for PMEs are available at our five WDA Career Centres and e2i. More than 26,000"
2015-05-11-T-048-S-00823,2015-05-11-T-048,823,Lim Swee Say,"The Jobs Bank, launched in July 2014, was intended to make job opportunities more transparent to Singaporean job seekers and allow employers to access a larger pool of Singaporean candidates. The Jobs Bank complements the assistance delivered through WDA Career Centres and e2i by giving job-ready PMEs an on-line avenue to search for jobs on their own. There are an average of 60,000 ""live"" job vacancies available weekly4 on Jobs Bank, with some 30,000 positions offering a monthly salary of at least $5,000. We encourage our PMEs to explore all avenues in their job search, including the Jobs Bank."
2015-05-11-T-049-S-00824,2015-05-11-T-049,824,Randolph Tan,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the Ministry's assessment of the outcomes of the Max Talent place-and-train programme; (b) what are the main reasons which cause participating PMEs to leave within six months of joining an SME under that programme; and (c) whether there are factors which will cause the enhanced programme known as P-Max to perform differently.
2015-05-11-T-049-S-00825,2015-05-11-T-049,825,Lim Swee Say,"The Max Talent place-and-train programme was well-received by Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). From its inception in April 2012, the programme successfully placed a total of 1,000 PMEs in 954 SMEs across various industries such as Retail, Education, Marine Engineering, and Logistics. As part of the programme, newly-hired PMEs undertook the three-day Talent Workshop to equip them with the skills and knowledge that are essential to working in SMEs. And SMEs were provided with assistance to adopt the practices in the Talent Resource Kit to hire, manage and retain PMEs."
2015-05-11-T-049-S-00826,2015-05-11-T-049,826,Lim Swee Say,"About 88% of the 1,000 PMEs remained employed in the SMEs for six months and above, after being placed by the programme. Of the PMEs who left the SME within six months, personal reasons was the most commonly cited factor."
2015-05-11-T-049-S-00827,2015-05-11-T-049,827,Lim Swee Say,"In March this year, we introduced ""P-Max"", which builds on Max Talent with two new enhancements. First, we will introduce a new SME Workshop for SME supervisors. The SME Workshop will support SMEs in adopting progressive human resource practices, and strengthen the capabilities of SME supervisors in talent management and retention. Second, we will enhance the PME Workshop for newly-hired PMEs. The enhanced PME Workshop will better cover topics such as goals setting, managing workplace relationships and performance management. Taken together, this will help more SMEs with their recruitment process and human resource capabilities, and help place more PMEs in SMEs. We will work towards matching 3,000 PMETs with SME jobs over a three-year period."
2015-05-11-T-050-S-00828,2015-05-11-T-050,828,Zaqy Mohamad,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information in respect of the Prime Minister's speech at the Founders Forum Smart Nation Singapore Reception on 20 April 2015, whether there have been any cyber security incidents involving IT systems belonging to the Government."
2015-05-11-T-050-S-00829,2015-05-11-T-050,829,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Around the world, the IT systems of various governments are probed regularly, and experience daily attacks. In October 2014, the US media reported that computer networks in the US State Department email network were breached. This breach also ended up infecting some computers in the White House. This case is still under investigation, and agencies like the National Security Council and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have reportedly declined to comment on the investigation."
2015-05-11-T-050-S-00830,2015-05-11-T-050,830,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"In cyber security, it is said that the difference is not between organisations that have been breached and those that have not. Rather, it is between organisations that know they have been breached, and those who are still unaware that they have been breached."
2015-05-11-T-050-S-00831,2015-05-11-T-050,831,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"This is why the Government takes cyber security very seriously, and invests in systems to monitor its IT networks and to detect attacks. To ensure the continued effectiveness of our defensive measures, we are neither able to comment on the specific nature of these defences nor on the attacks that have been detected."
2015-05-11-T-050-S-00832,2015-05-11-T-050,832,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"We can confirm that the Government’s IT networks are probed all the time. While most of these attempts are unsophisticated, we have also detected serious and advanced attacks. For example, during the passage of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Bill in March 2013, the House was informed that, in the lead-up to the APEC 2009 meetings held in Singapore, there were at least seven waves of malicious email attacks which targeted members of the APEC Organising Committee and APEC delegates from various countries. In a more recent case that occurred last year, the Government detected a security breach in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) IT system. Immediate steps were taken to isolate the affected devices and appropriate security measures were implemented to further strengthen the network."
2015-05-11-T-050-S-00833,2015-05-11-T-050,833,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"The Government takes cyber security very seriously. The Cyber Security Agency works with the Infocomm Development Authority -- the lead agency for the protection of Government IT systems -- to ensure a high level of vigilance over the security of our Government networks and readiness to respond rapidly and appropriately to any incident. IDA works closely with Government agencies to ensure good security practices, which cannot remain static but must adapt to new and emerging modus operandi of the attackers. Due to the nature of their operations, some agencies are unfortunately highly attractive to potential cyber attackers, and they will need to do even more to defend and protect their networks."
2015-05-11-T-051-S-00834,2015-05-11-T-051,834,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many properties were sold in each of the last 10 years for more than $1.5 million, with a break down by residential, commercial and industrial properties; (b) of those sold for above $1.5 million, what were the (i) average and (ii) median selling prices, with a break down by residential, commercial and industrial properties."

2015-05-11-T-052-S-00839,2015-05-11-T-052,839,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for National Development in the last three years, how many Singaporeans have purchased after subsidy (i) 2-room BTO flats for less than $20,000 and $40,000 respectively (ii) 3-room BTO flats for less than $100,000 and $120,000 respectively and (iii) 4-room BTO flats for less than $250,000."
2015-05-11-T-052-S-00840,2015-05-11-T-052,840,Khaw Boon Wan,"Between 2012 and 2014, a total of"
2015-05-11-T-052-S-00841,2015-05-11-T-052,841,Khaw Boon Wan,"a. 47 households booked 2-room Build-To-Order (BTO) flats for less than $40,000, of which 3 households did so for less than $20,000;"
2015-05-11-T-052-S-00842,2015-05-11-T-052,842,Khaw Boon Wan,"b. 283 households booked 3-room BTO flats for less than $120,000, of which 27 households did so for less than $100,000; and"
2015-05-11-T-052-S-00843,2015-05-11-T-052,843,Khaw Boon Wan,"c. 1,721 households booked 4-room BTO flats for less than $250,000."
2015-05-11-T-052-S-00844,2015-05-11-T-052,844,Khaw Boon Wan,"These prices were after subsidies given to eligible households which could enjoy up to $40,000 in Additional CPF Housing Grant and $20,000 in Special CPF Housing Grant."
2015-05-11-T-053-S-00845,2015-05-11-T-053,845,Png Eng Huat,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) over the past five years, what is the number of feedback that PUB has received each year on low water pressure from HDB flat dwellers; (b) how are these feedback addressed; (c) why is there no requirement to specify the minimum pressure for the supply of water to individual HDB flats under the Code of Practice for Water Services; and (d) whether PUB will consider doing so."
2015-05-11-T-053-S-00846,2015-05-11-T-053,846,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Over the last five years, PUB received about 100 feedback on low water pressure from HDB units each month. The causes of low water pressure are mainly due to partially closed valves in the water supply pipes to the units, stoppage of pumps, and chokage in service pipes and fittings due to encrustations. These fixtures are usually installed and maintained by either the Town Council (TC), or the building or unit owner."
2015-05-11-T-053-S-00847,2015-05-11-T-053,847,Vivian Balakrishnan,"PUB works closely with the TCs to attend to feedback received. For partially closed valves (often due to earlier works which required them to be closed), the problem is resolved by fully opening the valve in the water supply pipe, either by the customer, by the TC, or by PUB. Many of these cases are resolved easily by PUB advising owners over the telephone. For cases due to stoppage of pumps (usually caused by power failure or a faulty valve in the pump system), the problem is resolved by restarting the pump by the TC. For cases of chokes due to encrustation of older pipes, PUB would advise the household to replace these pipes. In most cases, the problem is resolved within the day."
2015-05-11-T-053-S-00848,2015-05-11-T-053,848,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Currently, the Singapore Standard CP 48 - Code of Practice for Water Services (SS CP48) stipulates the requirements for all plumbing systems. This is a national standard on water services, drawn up in consultation with engineering professionals, members of the industries and other Government agencies. It specifies the maximum and best water conservation flow rates for different fittings and appliances in the customers’ premises. The Code does not specify minimum pressure at each HDB unit. This is similar with practices in England, Wales and Hong Kong. The actual flow rate available at fittings and appliances vary based on the types of water fittings/appliances used, the size and layouts of the units, and the number of concurrent use of the fixtures. The Professional Engineer has to work closely with the developers and architects on the design for the water installations, and ensures that it complies with SS CP48."
2015-05-11-T-053-S-00849,2015-05-11-T-053,849,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In view of the recent proliferation of water appliances and the need to conserve water, PUB is reviewing the requirements for minimum pressure standards at residential units. Extensive consultation with industry stakeholders and the public will be necessary, and we will not rush into formulating new regulations."
2015-05-11-T-054-S-00850,2015-05-11-T-054,850,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs in light of apparent satellite images showing China building an airstrip on contested territory in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, what is the Ministry's assessment on how this may affect long-term peace and cooperation within ASEAN and the surrounding region."
2015-05-11-T-054-S-00851,2015-05-11-T-054,851,K Shanmugam,"Mr Christopher de Souza brought up the recent satellite images of construction activities in the South China Sea and sought MFA’s views on how they may affect peace and cooperation within ASEAN and the surrounding region. This issue was also recently discussed at the 26th ASEAN Summit held in Malaysia in April, where some ASEAN Member States expressed concern over recent developments in the South China Sea, including the reclamation activities."
2015-05-11-T-054-S-00852,2015-05-11-T-054,852,K Shanmugam,"At the outset, let me reiterate that Singapore’s position on the South China Sea disputes is clear and consistent. As a non-claimant state, we do not take a position on the merits of the competing claims. However, as a maritime nation that is highly dependent on trade, we have a fundamental interest in the maintenance of peace and stability as well as freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea."
2015-05-11-T-054-S-00853,2015-05-11-T-054,853,K Shanmugam,"That is why we have constantly emphasised the importance for all parties concerned to resolve their claims peacefully and adhere to international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, in their conduct of activities in the South China Sea. Freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea should also not be jeopardised. This is critical because the South China Sea contains important Sea Lines of Communication that many countries depend on. All parties should also refrain from activities that will raise tensions or precipitate confrontation, and fulfil their international obligations."
2015-05-11-T-054-S-00854,2015-05-11-T-054,854,K Shanmugam,The long-term prospects for peace and cooperation on this issue largely depend on the extent to which the parties concerned adhere to these key principles. It also depends on whether the parties concerned can manage the situation constructively.
2015-05-11-T-054-S-00855,2015-05-11-T-054,855,K Shanmugam,"If the situation is not properly managed, tensions may escalate, which could potentially lead to miscalculations and incidents leading to loss of assets and lives. In this regard, while ASEAN takes a neutral position on the competing claims, it can play a role to help keep temperatures down. ASEAN and China should work more closely to fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), and conduct cooperative activities to enhance mutual trust and confidence. Both sides should also accelerate their efforts toward an early conclusion of the Code of Conduct (COC). Recent developments point to the growing urgency for an instrument to govern behaviour and reduce the chances of miscalculation in the South China Sea."
2015-05-11-T-054-S-00856,2015-05-11-T-054,856,K Shanmugam,"Fundamentally, the relationship of ASEAN and China is deep, multi-faceted and mutually beneficial. Both sides prize regional peace and stability, which has contributed to the rapid growth in the region over the past few decades. It is in the long-term interests of both sides to continue promoting their strong cooperation in many other areas, while managing the South China Sea issue constructively. I am optimistic that both sides will work towards this outcome."
2015-05-11-T-055-S-00857,2015-05-11-T-055,857,Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for Health whether there will be a review of the pricing policy of items sold at various Government and restructured hospital pharmacies to further widen the price points between items sold at these pharmacies and in the retail industry so as to make them more affordable to the public at the hospital pharmacies.
2015-05-11-T-055-S-00858,2015-05-11-T-055,858,Gan Kim Yong,"To help keep medicines affordable for patients, the Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach."
2015-05-11-T-055-S-00859,2015-05-11-T-055,859,Gan Kim Yong,"First, our public hospitals procure the majority of their drugs in bulk to enjoy economies of scale. The savings are reflected in the pricing of the medicines in the public hospital pharmacies and passed on to patients."
2015-05-11-T-055-S-00860,2015-05-11-T-055,860,Gan Kim Yong,"Second, subsidised patients enjoy heavy Government subsidies off the prices of drugs listed under the Standard Drug List (SDL) and the Medication Assistance Fund (MAF). These are drugs that have been assessed to be clinically- and cost-effective."
2015-05-11-T-055-S-00861,2015-05-11-T-055,861,Gan Kim Yong,"Since 1 January 2015, subsidies for SDL drugs at the Specialist Outpatient Clinics and Polyclinics have been enhanced to 75% for lower- to middle-income patients. On top of the enhanced subsidies, Pioneers can enjoy an additional 50%-off for their subsidised drugs. This move has significantly lowered the cost of subsidised drugs in the public healthcare institutions, and widened the gap with prices in private retail pharmacies."
2015-05-11-T-055-S-00862,2015-05-11-T-055,862,Gan Kim Yong,"MOH will continue to review our policies to ensure that healthcare remains affordable for Singaporeans. For needy patients, they can also apply to Medifund for financial assistance."
2015-05-11-T-056-S-00863,2015-05-11-T-056,863,Zaqy Mohamad,"asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry has plans to (i) upgrade Chua Chu Kang Bus Interchange to cope with increased bus services, commuter demand, and resident population growth by 2016 with new BTO developments in Keat Hong; and (ii) develop Chua Chu Kang Bus Interchange into an integrated transport hub."
2015-05-11-T-056-S-00864,2015-05-11-T-056,864,Lui Tuck Yew,"LTA is working with the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the relevant land use agencies to review the redevelopment plans for the town centre, which will include an assessment of when the Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange can be upgraded or redeveloped into an integrated transport hub. In the meantime, to improve the flow of buses exiting Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange, LTA had removed a taxi stand and installed railings along Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4. A stretch of Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4, between Choa Chua Kang Loop and Choa Chu Kang Drive, will be widened to improve the nearby traffic junctions by the second quarter of 2016. The bus operator has also deployed marshals on the ground to facilitate passenger and bus movement."
2015-05-11-T-057-S-00865,2015-05-11-T-057,865,Tin Pei Ling,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) how is enforcement carried out to prevent cyclists riding in areas where cycling is prohibited such as covered walkways and overhead bridges; (b) what is being done to better ensure the safety of the general public especially in such areas; and (c) whether he can provide an update on the consultation exercise on wider use of bicycles, motorised bicycles and scooters."
2015-05-11-T-057-S-00866,2015-05-11-T-057,866,Lui Tuck Yew,"Currently, enforcement of cycling prohibition rules is carried out by agencies such as the Traffic Police and National Parks Board, and is conducted in a targeted fashion, usually in response to public complaints. Some Town Councils also enforce against errant cyclists on HDB common property, such as covered walkways. We announced in March this year that going forward, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will be the lead agency for cycling-related policies. One of its roles will be to coordinate the enforcement effort across agencies to ensure consistency."
2015-05-11-T-057-S-00867,2015-05-11-T-057,867,Lui Tuck Yew,"However, we cannot rely on enforcement alone. We need cyclists to also play their part, to follow the rules, cycle safely and give way to pedestrians. To this end, LTA and the Traffic Police work closely with community leaders to conduct talks and distribute information at schools, workplaces and foreign worker dormitories to promote safe cycling habits."
2015-05-11-T-057-S-00868,2015-05-11-T-057,868,Lui Tuck Yew,"LTA is finalising the details of the consultation exercise, and will share them shortly."

For children below the age of seven, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) works with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and other partners to equip pre-school educators with basic skills to identify children with special needs and learning difficulties, and to raise their awareness of early intervention strategies to assist such children."

In addition, MOE collaborates with the Institute of Mental Health to make available REACH (Response, Early intervention and Assessment in Community mental Health) services at mainstream and Special Education schools. Students may be referred to the Child Guidance Clinic after assessment by the REACH team for further psychiatric evaluation and intervention such as psychotherapy, group or family work and advice for parents and other caregivers."
2015-05-11-T-061-S-00880,2015-05-11-T-061,880,Heng Swee Keat,"To create public awareness and support parents with special needs children, mainstream schools and SPED schools have parent support groups (PSGs). Resources and information on special needs are also provided at MOE’s Parents-in-Education website."
2015-05-11-T-061-S-00881,2015-05-11-T-061,881,Heng Swee Keat,"MOE also works with relevant departments in restructured hospitals, such as the Department of Child Development in KKH, and Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) to support students with SEN and their families.

2015-05-11-T-062-S-00888,2015-05-11-T-062,888,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Youth on probation or in juvenile rehabilitation centres have access to support including specialised treatment by psychiatrists and psychologists, therapeutic programmes and offence-specific programmes. To improve their socio-emotional wellbeing, the youths are usually also encouraged to participate in school, work or vocational training, and other enrichment activities such as sports or arts. Likewise, youths in prison with mental health issues are seen regularly by a team of doctors, including prison psychologists and psychiatrists. Where necessary, they are referred to IMH for further specialised treatment."
2015-05-11-T-062-S-00889,2015-05-11-T-062,889,Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Government agencies also work with the youth’s family and larger community support network in his or her rehabilitation. For example, schools or voluntary welfare organisations such as the Singapore Association of Mental Health may be roped in to help monitor their progress and strengthen social support to them to prevent relapses."
