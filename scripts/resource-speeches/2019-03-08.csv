2019-03-08-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Mr Chairman, I beg to move, ""That the total sum to be allocated for Head X of the Estimates be reduced by $100."" Before I begin, let me wish all the ladies here ""Happy Women's Day"".",1,3,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00003
2019-03-08-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Our Nation, Singapore is a young country. We are celebrating our 54th National day this August. The task of nation building is an endless one. It is one that needs all Singaporeans regardless of race, language or religion to come together, rally together as one united people and one nation. We come together to celebrate every success Singapore achieved, to celebrate our uniquely Singaporean culture, food, arts and sports.",2,4,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00004
2019-03-08-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"It only seems like not so long ago when young Singaporean were thought to be politically and socially apathetic. Yet today, we have an increasingly mature citizenry with a diverse array of views and hopes for their own future, and for the future of Singapore. These can be attributed to a society with growing literacy and affluence, where they are able to take the focus off from bread and butter issues to other matters and issues that affect their lives. The widespread use of social media certainly helps them and rallies them in expressing their views. And, the Government needs to do more to engage and partner Singaporeans in the next exciting phase of nation building.",3,5,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00005
2019-03-08-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Our youths and our older Singaporeans who have found common ground have bandied together and created groups to promote their causes. They participate in forums and focus group discussions. They are vocal on social media, some are more sophisticated with their analyses and feedback, others less so. But it is evident that many Singaporeans would like to have an active role in nation-building and shaping the future. Some expressed their views through arts, music and culture. However, some are unsure of the available avenues, or lack the capability to do so.",4,6,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00006
2019-03-08-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"MCCY has been taking the lead in ensuring that citizens are actively involved in our nation building, in policy deliberation and design. Online feedback portals, community outreach events, facilitation of networking events for stakeholders and volunteers to come together are some examples of ways in which Singaporeans can engage in nation-building. Nevertheless, majority of the engagement feels top-down, in the sense that citizens provide feedback, and Government works on it. We need to move away from a top down approach to a less paternalistic approach. The Government need to create more space, room and opportunities for Singaporeans to participate. For those who are ready to do more, particularly Singaporeans with leadership qualities, good ethics and are socially well-connected, they should have more opportunities to participate. They could create social projects and lead teams of volunteers.",5,7,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00007
2019-03-08-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"For those who are not ready, perhaps they lack comprehension of policies, or skills to articulate their aspirations and feedback, and we must help them to grow their capability. This can be done through giving them access to the necessary information, and the skills to participate. Many Singaporeans still find certain policies to be too complex to understand and they do not get why certain policies have to be this way. If the Ministry could come up with more creative means to break down these policies for the layman, that would be helpful. It is prudent that all citizens in Singapore have a stake in nation-building, to ensure equality and for everyone’s interests to be cared for.",6,8,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00008
2019-03-08-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Our population has always been and will always be our best resource, and with a more well-informed population, there will be more and better possibilities. As we face more complex issues, we will be able to tap on the collective wisdom and expertise of our citizenry. There is strength in numbers; as we build Singapore together, we can work towards creating the best Singapore that we can, one that all citizens have a stake in. I would like to ask how will the Ministry continue engaging citizens in nation-building? How can we raise the commitment levels towards building a Singaporean society where everyone can continue to be proud of our country and its achievements?",7,9,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00009

This would enable collaborations between the three organisations to be better coordinated, thus improving support from Government organisations, while streamlining the process for beneficiaries to seek assistance and resources. Even before they came together under this joint office, the three organisations already began their first collaboration in September last year, where they rolled out an enhanced version of MENDAKI's Tiga M Programme, which helps participants improve their Mathematics skills and creativity as well as strengthen family bonds. It is a promising programme which not only seeks to educate children but also parents who want to help their children improve important skills.",2,25,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00025

What new projects and developments can we expect from M3? Additionally, MENDAKI has some satellite centres around Singapore, including in some of the neighbourhood estates and ITE College campuses.

Since 2017, graduates from overseas Islamic colleges have had to attend a compulsory four-week programme organised by the MUIS Academy, titled “Islam in Context” (ICON) Certificate, before they can be accredited under the ARS. Over the past two years of running ICON, MUIS has received positive feedback from ICON participants that not only has the programme been useful, but that the scope of the programme could be widened to include more work-relevant skillsets. This acknowledges that our asatizahs today serve in many domains beyond the religious sector, including counselling and consultancy services.",10,123,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00123
2019-03-08-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Thus, starting in 2020, MUIS will introduce a one-year programme, titled the Postgraduate Certificate in Islam in Contemporary Societies programme (PCICS) for returning graduates. The PCICS programme will replace ICON. The PCICS will offer modules that deepen our returning graduates' understanding of our geo-political and socio-religious context and how Islam can be practised effectively in our multi-racial and multi-religious society. This is important to prepare them for their role in providing religious guidance to the community. The PCICS will also equip participants with work-relevant knowledge and skillsets, such as in social work and counselling, digital literacy as well as entrepreneurship, to open up more opportunities for them.

Geopolitical forces are evolving and shifting, the economy and its demands on Singaporeans are changing. Likewise, our religious landscape and social norms are also evolving. Singaporean Muslims need to move with the times, in their professional and socio-religious lives. The same goes for our asatizahs. This is why we formed the Community on Future Asatizah (COFA). COFA was formed to help us gain a better understanding of the evolving needs of the community, react to the trends that will shape the community's future, and hear ground-up feedback on how we can prepare our next generation of asatizahs.",12,125,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00125

The COFA's work is a critical step towards the college, because it will deepen our understanding of what the community desires of our future asatizahs. Through these engagements, MUIS will be able to chart the holistic development of our asatizahs, from the madrasahs to the Universities, and into their employment. MUIS will also be able to map out the skillsets that our asatizahs will require to serve our community effectively, and develop pathways for careers within and beyond the religious sector.

Enrolment and regular attendance at pre-school are hence critical. To Ms Rahayu Mahzam’s question on strengthening pre-school outreach and support, MENDAKI has been appointed by ECDA as a pre-school outreach agency to reach out to Malay children aged between four and six not already enrolled in pre-school. We want to raise awareness among families of the importance of pre-school education and the need for regular attendance, and assist them in enrolling their children into pre-school and related-MENDAKI programmes.",3,134,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00134

At the same time, research has shown that play is important for child development. Hence, under MENDAKI's School Ready Campaign, MENDAKI pioneered PlayFest to encourage and support parents of pre-schoolers from age zero to six in adopting a play-based approach to develop their children’s reasoning skills, and in setting up a stimulating learning environment at home. MENDAKI reached more than 2,000 parents and children through PlayFest and mini PlayFest in 2018.",4,135,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00135

The past cohorts of Tiga M students have done well. In particular, over 80% of children who attended Tiga M did not need to enrol in the Learning Support Programme for Mathematics at Primary 1.

Back then, I already had my condition and needed leg braces to assist my gait. But seeing how much fun my brothers were having, I asked my parents if I could join them and learn how to swim. That was in the 1990s.

2019-03-08-T-002,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"On hindsight, it probably took a lot of guts for my swim coach then to take on a student with disability. But if not for her courage to include me, I may not be here today. We are no longer in the 1990s. We hear about inclusion every other day. But out of close to 100 swim clubs in Singapore today, I can count the number that have opened their doors to persons with disabilities in five seconds. I hear stories from my peers on how they started in swimming, which can almost be considered a national sport for our little island. For able-bodied friends, the opportunities are boundless. Parents are spoilt for choice on whom they can engage to coach their children. But for parents of children with disabilities, it is a different story altogether. Not every child has been as fortunate as me to meet a coach that brave. Not many will be, if we do not set out to make changes.",4,254,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00254

2019-03-08-T-002,Yip Pin Xiu,Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member),"The outcomes, therefore, depend heavily on the individual's own effort to accept this change. We know there are two possible outcomes. One, the individual is convinced; and two, the individual is not. This gives us a 50% probability. Let us take the first scenario where the individual is convinced, and ready to make a change. Are our systems prepared to support such a change?",6,256,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00256

If we have neither the systems nor the environment, then the probability of the returns on our investment would likely drop. It is thus rather compelling to look at how we can boost our returns. Can inclusion be scaled up beyond the individual and into the system? How can this change take place?",7,257,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00257

Coaches and administrators are starting to realise that the spirit is the same amongst athletes, regardless of the number of limbs they have or whether they can speak.

They also care about achieving personal success on their own terms, in the eyes of their peers and society at large, and wonder whether they can do so, all at the same time. They sometimes worry about whether there are gaps between what they love to do, and what others want for them.",39,465,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00465

In attending Youth Conversations, I encountered some views I had anticipated, and some that I had not – all of which were intriguing and rewarding.

SOAR aims to combat the social stigma associated with mental health issues through community workshops. Other youths from the same Youth Conversation have also stepped up, with some forming a panel of resource persons for the Health Promotion Board (HPB).

Spaces along Somerset Road, such as *SCAPE, The Red Box and Skate Park, have already been serving as congregation points for youths, featuring music and media, entrepreneurship, learning and urban sports. But as Orchard Road renews itself, we have a unique opportunity to re-imagine the Youth Belt.

In the same period, our arts and heritage activities have seen increases in number, variety, and attendance. However, we recognise that our strategies and approaches must be updated to address new developments that have taken place since then.

I will touch on the key initiatives that will support each thrust. To inspire audiences, our artists must be able to produce high-quality and impactful work. We will provide capability development platforms for our artists across various art-forms. One example is in the literary arts. The National Arts Council (NAC) will partner Nanyang Technological University to introduce the Asia Creative Writing Programme later this year.

Over four months in 2018, the residency supported visual artist Terence Lin, who organised house-visits, invited residents to his open house, and facilitated art-making sessions with seniors and youths living in and around Taman Jurong. The project culminated in an exhibition of residents’ artworks, items, and audio interviews at the Taman Jurong Community Club.

NAC consulted over 370 members of our arts community last year to understand the specific needs of freelancers that will enable them to be more self-sufficient and financially independent, not just during their working life, but prepare them for retirement. To address some of the findings, NAC will establish freelance resource hubs, and work with partners to offer shared resources and services. These include insurance coverage, connecting freelancers with relevant service providers, and making available jobs, contracts and projects; as well as a database of talents and expertise.

Therefore, NAC will strengthen research support in the arts so that artists can further grow their practice. Research can also help arts groups better understand and develop their audiences. In addition, we want to better understand the long-term value and impact of arts engagement on different population segments.

There is still a difference in the level of funding between the multi-year programme as well as the spexScholarship.

In certain cases, the athlete does not take up the scholarship because their current income is already higher than what the spexScholarship would provide. So, for them to take up the spexScholarship is a loss of income.

So, it sounds very ideal. I was very attracted to the idea that if the parents so request – you can request for any school, mainstream school, to house the child, to provide education to the child, accept the child. But when I went there, what I found was that, indeed, a child with special needs was in that school, but I must say that the teacher was not well equipped, and the child was left pretty much alone.",1,562,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00562

But if they are not ready, if they do not have the coaches, if they do not have the training facilities because some of them do require special training facilities, then we may not be serving the interest of the athletes with disabilities.",2,563,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00563
2019-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"While SDSC currently has many sports under its umbrella, it has some advantages as well. For example, when it is promoting sports to persons with special needs broadly, they can do so because resources are within them, the coaches are in their network. When they want to organise a disability sports festival, they can do so with good effect. So, we must always make changes carefully.",3,564,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00564
2019-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As we said in the speech, it is the interest of the athletes that we place front and foremost in our decision. While NSAs can be persuaded sometimes by funding, but we are also quite realistic about how effective funding can be used as a tool to influence. As we have seen in many cases, it can only go that much. NSAs are independent bodies. They have can elect members into their council. They also can decide how they want to run the sports. So, it has to be a partnership that we build up over the years.",4,565,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00565
2019-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We understand, we totally appreciate the points that Ms Denise Phua and Ms Yip Pin Xiu talked about, if I may use the word – ""mainstreaming"" athletes with disabilities with able-bodied athletes. But in this process, I would just like to urge Members' patience and due consideration, so that we do not dismantle an organisation that has already worked for many years, and has worked well for a long period of time. The main consideration really is whether the interest of athletes with disabilities are better-served. Can they be served in the mainstream, so-called able-bodied, NSAs?",5,566,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00566
2019-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NSAs that have the capability, we would like to encourage them, we would like to work with them to make the change. But at the same time, we also need to consider all issues.",6,567,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00567
2019-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Also, we would like to mention that it is not just in high performance sports that we have an interest in getting sports into persons with disabilities. It is also the broad-based participation. Very often, it is the ability to bring in a suite of activities that makes a lot of sense and provide value to the SPED schools, because people like Whee Boon started with swimming, goes on to scuba-diving, and goes on to do rugby. It is because we have the ability to bring options to him.",7,568,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00568
2019-03-08-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"And so, if we have the sports embedded in 20-over NSAs, sometimes, I think, we may lose some of that synergistic effect of having it in one. So, it is a long story. And the long or short of it is this  we are always looking at how to improve the system. We are making our facilities a lot more accessible. We are offering more programmes so that more persons with disabilities can participate and we definitely want to support persons with disabilities like Ms Yip and many others inspiring athletes. All of them, every single one of them has inspiring life stories. And they are such good role models for everyone of us. We like to support them, but we need to find the best modality. We are not starting from a blank canvas. We are starting with an existing set of organisations, so just let us move at the pace and the direction that is acceptable to all stakeholders.",8,569,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00569
2019-03-08-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I am totally convinced that MCCY and sports and Government have become very inclusive. So, I want to honour the Minister and the team for that. I have seen it myself from the sector. I am just asking for, perhaps what Pin Xiu has been asking, just more re-imagination to have a continuum of operation models. Some sports might be best left alone at the moment because of the nature of the game and so forth. But sports like running  even when someone is intellectually challenged, some of them may be able to run very, very fast and together with the able-bodied athletes can give them a run for their money.",1,570,2019-03-08-T-002-S-00570

2019-03-08-T-005,,,"First, that we need to put Singaporeans at the heart of our policies. A good many Members stressed that in pursuing economic progress, we must not leave our workers behind. Ms Denise Phua, Prof Daniel Goh, Mr Chong Kee Hiong and Dr Intan reminded us that our workforce needs to be an inclusive one, as those with special needs and those advanced in their years also have much to offer, and ought to be treated with dignity. Miss Cheryl Chan and Prof Lim Sun Sun talked about improving the working environment for women. Putting Singaporeans at the centre of what we do extends also to the social sector. MOH shared plans to improve access to affordable healthcare, and to give every Singaporean outpatient medical subsidy through CHAS. My Ministry has made its focus to ensure that Singaporeans from all walks of life can engage in sports and enjoy the arts. MOE talked about what it will do ensure that every Singaporean has a strong foundation in education, starting from pre-schools. Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Charles Chong and Mr Louis Ng urged a re-examination of our approach to educating Singaporeans. And so, with Singaporeans at the core of our policy considerations, we did not shy away from making major changes like removing streaming in Secondary schools.",4,618,2019-03-08-T-005-S-00618
2019-03-08-T-005,,,"Second, Members agreed that while we work on the present, we must keep an eye on the future. There are key challenges that lie ahead. Mr Pritam Singh pointed out that we must leverage technology, to ensure that critical functions, like national security, are not affected by our shrinking population. MTI and MCI spoke about how we must focus on innovation and creativity and help our businesses digitalise, to ensure our competitiveness in the future economy and that the purpose of future-proofing our economy is so that our workers will seize the new opportunities that the future will bring.",5,619,2019-03-08-T-005-S-00619

2019-03-08-T-005,,,"Several Ministries are conducting public consultations, so that Government and the people can co-develop effective solutions. Through the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, the Government gathered feedback from workers, employers, union leaders and other stakeholders to inform policies to support older workers. MCCY worked with other public agencies to conduct Youth Conversations, where over 8,000 youths came forward to share their perspectives on topics ranging from mental health to social inequality. MSF, MCCY and MOH are building an extensive network of community support and volunteers to care for the elderly and uplift low-income families. To ground our work in designing housing and facilities for assisted living, MND and MOH will be consulting senior citizens and healthcare providers.",8,622,2019-03-08-T-005-S-00622

To address inequality, no fewer than four Ministries have come together to ensure that we deliver practical solutions to help low-income families in Singapore. To help businesses navigate the digital future, Minister Iswaran shared how MCI and the economic agencies are working together to raise the digital capabilities of our SMEs. These follow from initiatives like the Industry Transformation Maps, where Government agencies partner each other to drive enterprise growth, support worker training, and address regulatory matters. In a complex world, combining our expertise, assets and strengths is the best way to overcome challenges. And our public service has the will and ability to do this.",9,623,2019-03-08-T-005-S-00623

I was actually quite tempted to repeat the same speech from last year, not because you would not notice it, because I am sure you paid rapt attention to it last year, but also because some fundamentals actually do not change. At the heart of everything we do and we have heard that, it is that it surely must be about Singaporeans.

Streaming changes are much welcomed but as Minister Ong Ye Kung explained, there was a reason for that cow. While every cow is a good cow, no cow is perfect. There are sometimes unintended consequences. Because over the years, we have learnt that it emits methane gas so, therefore, it impacts environment. So, over the years, as he has shared, we have sought to trim the cow, adjust its diet, sliced off its rump, have a little barbeque, its flanks, and finally, we lay it to rest.

A key objective of the criminal justice system is to produce accurate and equitable outcomes, through procedures that are fair – not just fair but seen to be fair as well.

The Prosecution will not be allowed to redact sensitive information from material disclosed to the Defence (a) where the Prosecution intends to rely on that sensitive information as evidence, or (b) where the law requires the disclosure of the sensitive information because it tends to undermine the Prosecution’s case or to strengthen the defence's case.

2019-03-08-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I am generally supportive of the amendments proposed, but i would like the Ministry to clarify two matters. Firstly, relating to the video recording of interviews (VRIs), and secondly, on reformative training (RT) sentences.",2,689,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00689
2019-03-08-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, on Video-Recording of Interviews, or VRIs, I must commend the Ministry on how far it has moved on VRI over the years. When I first broached the idea of video-recording of statements during MinLaw's COS in 2008, more than ten years ago, it was met with a negative response. Today, we are here discussing how to enhance the VRI framework to cover law enforcement officers outside of the Singapore Police Force. This is indeed progress, and progressive.",3,690,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00690
2019-03-08-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to enable non-police officers to investigate offences relating to a statement made by an audiovisual recording. The rationale for this change was explained in MinLaw's press release of 11 February, as to enable Central Narcotics Bureau officers who had used video-recorded interviews as part of their investigations to be able to investigate VRI-related offences. This makes sense. As to which types of cases are being investigated with the use of VRI, section 22 of the CPC currently makes VRI mandatory only in cases of rape under section 375(1)(a) of the Penal Code. It is discretionary in all other circumstances.",4,691,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00691
2019-03-08-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To get a sense of how widespread the use of VRI is among our law enforcement agencies, could the Minister inform the House as to which agencies have commenced using VRI, and for what kinds of offences? Also, what has been the assessment thus far of the usefulness of VRI as an investigation tool and as evidence in Court?",5,692,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00692
2019-03-08-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, on Reformative Training Sentences. Clause 6 of the Bill basically removes the right of the sentencing judge to backdate the period of custody to an earlier date. Currently, backdating a sentence to start running at an earlier date could happen if the offender was remanded in custody from the time of his arrest and continued to be in custody for weeks or months before he is eventually sentenced. Such backdating recognises that he has lost his liberty from an earlier date, and takes that pre-sentence period into account.",6,693,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00693
2019-03-08-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"MinLaw has explained that it is removing the possibility of backdating sentences of Reformative Training, because Reformative Training is geared towards rehabilitation and if sentences are backdated, the offenders may not have enough time to complete the prescribed programmes. That I understand due to the changes made to Reformative Training over the years. But when backdating does not happen, how do we account to the individual for the period he or she has spent in pre-sentence custody. Not backdating may cause injustice to the offender.",7,694,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00694
2019-03-08-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I see that MinLaw is alive to this injustice, as in its media release, it has stated that agencies will work together to ensure that where Reformative Training is a likely sentence, remand is avoided or minimised where possible. As Reformative Training will be imposed on young offenders, namely those below 21, it is certainly important to ensure that these youths are not incarcerated for longer than necessary, as it would affect their reintegration into education, society and work.",8,695,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00695
2019-03-08-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In order to avoid or minimize remand as MinLaw has stated, what practical things will be done? For example, will the prosecution be more prepared to ask for lower bail amounts, or will the cases be fast tracked in a specific way?",9,696,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00696
2019-03-08-T-006,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, the wording of clause 6 is that the sentence of Reformative Training is to take effect on the date it was passed ""or at such later date as the court may determine"". It would be important for the Ministry to clarify that such post-dating would only occur if the offender is not incarcerated while waiting to commence a sentence of Reformative Training.",10,697,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00697
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, the amendments in this Bill relate to different stages of the criminal justice process – from investigations, to pre-trial disclosure, as well as post-trial procedure.",1,698,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00698
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In terms of investigations, clause 3 of the Bill allows officers of prescribed law enforcement agencies to investigate offences relating to video interviews. This is good as it streamlines the process by allowing the agency which is most familiar with the circumstance to investigate the offence, thereby smoothening the process.",2,699,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00699
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In order to fulfil such duties, is it envisioned that the skillsets and expertise will be slightly different from what the officers from the prescribed law enforcement agency are already using? If so, what training or arrangements will be provided to ensure that the officers would be able to develop the necessary expertise – tap into the requisite resources – to investigate each case? Still staying on this issue, why does the new section 40B remove the need for an officer to be of an equivalent rank to that of an inspector of the police without seemingly replacing it with an equivalent safeguard?",3,700,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00700
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Allow me, Sir, in this stage, to declare my interest as a lawyer in private practice who sometimes acts as Defence counsel.",4,701,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00701
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Moving on to amendments relating to the pre-trial and trial stages, clause 9 provides for the non-disclosure of sensitive information and a process for it, that is, seeking a balance between the accused’s rights and interests with that of others’. For instance, while sensitive information may prejudice public safety, safety of any particular person or future investigations, the prosecution may still need to disclose it if it is required by law and if it undermines the prosecution’s case or strengthens the Defence's case according to the new section 425B(3). Additionally, by the words ""if the Defence is aggrieved by the removal or redaction"" in the new section 425B(4), it seems as though the court’s determination on the matter can be easily sought by the Defence. Is this the case?",5,702,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00702
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"While not allowing the Defence to be present as the court views the document makes sense in order for this non-disclosure to be effective, would this be an exception to Rule 30 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 under which legal practitioners are ethically bound not to initiate any communication with the court unless he or she has given each legal practitioner acting for another party to the proceedings an opportunity to be present or to reply? That is my question to the Senior Minister of State. Further, how does the process take into account the general understanding that the Defence would be best placed to know whether something would strengthen its own case?",6,703,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00703
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Another question, these concerns must be weighed against the importance of protecting sensitive information. A correct balance must be struck. The provision could protect public safety, public security or propriety, public order, national interest, national security, safety of individuals, ongoing and future investigations and interests of justice in criminal investigation or proceedings. Even as the accused must be able to present the best case, such important concerns cannot be compromised if there is no need to, especially if it does not weaken the prosecution’s case or strengthen the Defence's case. However, when there is a need to disclose such information even though it is sensitive information, what will be done to safeguard the sensitive information from being abused? Similarly, how can we be sure that information is indeed disclosed even where it is valuable or relevant and necessary to the Defence's case?",7,704,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00704
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Post-trial, certain timings for both the application for leave of review application as well as the hearing of a review application can be abridged through clauses 7 and 8. As these two powers would be able to shorten the timeline from those prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Rules, potentially prejudicing the relevant parties, would the Senior Minister of State please explain the rationale behind these amendments?",8,705,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00705
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The fourth area of substantive amendments that I want to speak about, in this very short speech, is that of reformative training. The reformative training regime is an important feature of our criminal justice system through both rehabilitation and deterrence. Clause 6 removes the ability of courts to backdate reformative training. While this removes the period that the accused was remanded for pre-sentencing, this amendment furthers the aim and purpose of reformative training.",9,706,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00706
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As the Singapore High Court in the case of Nur Azilah bte Ithnin vv Public Prosecutor opined, backdating reformative training will shorten the period of training and could undermine or hinder the effectiveness of such a programme. As such, this amendment will promote the effectiveness of the reformative training regime. Following the Criminal Justice Reform Bill 2018 which allowed for a more calibrated rehabilitation program through changes to the duration of the reformative training regime, this amendment will further enhance the effectiveness of reformative training and is a welcomed amendment. Nevertheless, what will be done to ensure that the duration of remand will be reduced or minimised?",10,707,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00707
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Additionally, since corrective training also contains rehabilitation as part of its focus, did the Ministry consider introducing a similar change to disallow backdating for corrective training and, if so, why was it not extended to corrective training?",11,708,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00708
2019-03-08-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, in conclusion, all stages of the criminal justice process are important. The criminal procedure code is integral to our criminal justice system. In order to achieve justice in our criminal justice system, the process must be robust yet flexible, balanced and fair. It has to take into account both the interests of not just the accused, not just the victim but also that of the broader society. Hence, I support this Bill.",12,709,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00709
2019-03-08-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong.,1,710,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00710
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Members who have spoken up in support of the Bill. Let me address the questions directly.",1,711,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00711
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, questions about VRI. Mr de Souza asked if non-police law enforcement officers will need different skills, training and resources to investigate these offences. As with all legislative amendments, before bringing the changes into force the relevant agencies will assess what kind of training or preparation is needed and will get that done. There is an inter-agency workgroup comprising MHA, MinLaw, AGC, the police and other law enforcement agencies, which oversees the development of policies, operational procedures and also training plans to ensure uniformity in VRI implementation across the agencies. This workgroup will work towards ensuring that the investigation of VRI offences is done to a common high standard across all agencies.",2,712,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00712
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr de Souza also asked why the non-police officers exercising the new powers to investigate VRI offences do not need to be of a rank equivalent to an inspector of police, but are deemed to be of that rank for these purposes. This is to match the existing powers of those officers. For example, under section 32 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), a CNB officer investigating an offence under that Act has the same CPC powers as a police officer investigating an arrestable offence. In exercising those powers, the CNB officer is deemed by section 32(3) to be an officer not below the rank of inspector of police. Provisions like section 32 of the MDA and the proposed section 40B of the CPC recognise the fact that officers of specialised law enforcement agencies such as the CNB are highly-trained, and are able to competently and responsibly exercise the investigative powers given to police officers of the rank of inspector and above.",3,713,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00713
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked which agencies have commenced using VRI, for what kinds of offences, and for the assessment of the usefulness of VRI in investigations and as evidence. VRI has been used by the Serious Sexual Crime Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department, in investigations into rape, and by the Central Narcotics Bureau to investigate certain drug trafficking offences. Several Police land divisions are also preparing to use VRI. Early feedback from the ground and from these agencies is that VRI is useful to investigators and our officers are confident in the VRI system. So far, there has not yet been a case where a VRI recording has been used as evidence in court. As more cases go through the criminal justice system, we will continue to gather feedback from the implementing agencies in order to further refine and improve the VRI process.",4,714,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00714
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I thank Ms Lim for being supportive of this and with reference to the suggestion in 2008, that MinLaw was dismissive of this during COS, let me just clarify the position. [Please refer to ""Clarification by Senior Minister of State for Law"", Official Report, April 2019, Vol 94, Issue No 102.] The answer then was that MHA will take ownership of this issue and at that stage whilst MHA had no plans to implement VRI, they were nonetheless, and I quote, ""MHA's position is that the issue of video recording as well as other operational issues should be looked into, in the following manner  there should be a fair system which seeks to ensure that crimes are solved and the system should also ensure that the rights of the accused are protected. If an accused wishes to challenge the statement given by him, there are clear avenues available today"". So, that was the position in 2008, not quite so dismissive as Ms Lim has suggested.",5,715,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00715
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Next, there were several questions on the removal of sensitive information from disclosed materials. Mr de Souza asked if the Defence can easily seek the court’s determination of whether such a removal or redaction should stand. The Defence may apply for the court’s determination without any procedural barrier – for example, leave of court will not be required. However, to succeed the Defence will need to satisfy the court that the Prosecution should not have redacted the relevant information, either because it was not sensitive information, because the Prosecution is relying on it as evidence, or because it tends to assist the Defence or undermine the Prosecution’s case and, therefore, must be legally disclosed. That is the test in Kadar's case.",6,716,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00716
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr de Souza asked whether the requirement that the court view the disputed redacted material in the absence of the Defence violates an ethical rule against a party communicating with the court without the other party also being present or able to reply. I would like to make it clear that the rules of natural justice will continue to apply to those proceedings just as they have done in other proceedings. This means that both parties will be able to make submissions on the legality of the redaction, and also rebut each other's submissions. While the court must view the disputed material in the absence of the Defence, this does not mean that the Prosecution will be allowed to make submissions in the absence of the Defence.",7,717,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00717
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In other words, you make the submissions, the Defence can respond and the court views the disputed material in the absence of the Defence.",8,718,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00718
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr de Souza also asked how this procedure takes into account the understanding that the Defence would be best placed to know whether something would strengthen its own case. This question relates to the common law principle from the case of Kadar, which I mentioned earlier, that the Prosecution must disclose unused material that tends to strengthen the Defence's case.",9,719,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00719
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr de Souza's question calls to mind the argument, sometimes advanced before the courts, that the Defence should receive disclosure of material for the purposes of arguing that it should be disclosed. The High Court in fact considered this precise point in Winston Lee's case and held that even where it fell to the Prosecution to show that in compliance with its Kadar disclosure obligations, the disputed material may be shown to the court but not to the Defence. And, to quote the judgment on this, ""[t]o allow the Defence to examine the undisclosed material on a preliminary basis simply because there is a dispute on disclosability has a similar practical effect to disclosure and this would in essence be going further than the situations of disclosure envisaged in [Kadar]"". The wording in the proposed legislation is entirely consistent with this common-sense position.",10,720,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00720
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In a similar vein, Mr de Souza asked how we can be sure that information is indeed disclosed where it is valuable or relevant and necessary to the Defence's case. The courts have set down detailed procedures to fairly balance the competing interests in this area. And the High Court's decision in Winston Lee's case was then subsequently brought before the Court of Appeal in a Criminal Reference, and our apex court stated that while the Public Prosecutor is presumed to have complied with his disclosure obligations on account of his constitutional office, this presumption can be rebutted. Once the Defence satisfies the court that there are reasonable grounds for belief that the Prosecution has failed to comply with its Kadar obligation, the court will look to the Prosecution to show that it has complied. With the Defence assisting the court in this regard, we are confident that the outcomes will be fair when the Kadar principles are applied in the context of the redaction of sensitive information.",11,721,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00721
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Finally, Mr de Souza asked a question from the other perspective, from the other side of the spectrum, I think, which is, when there is a need to disclose such information even though it is sensitive information, what will be done to safeguard the sensitive information from being abused.",12,722,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00722
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Prosecution will weigh very carefully, in the first place, whether to use sensitive information as part of its evidence, and will only do so where it is necessary. If unredacted sensitive information has to be used in a criminal proceeding, various measures can be taken to mitigate the risk of publicity.",13,723,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00723
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, if there is sensitive information in materials disclosed in the statutory pre-trial disclosure process, the court may order that the accused and his advocate cannot communicate it to any person. Breach of this order would be an offence. It is also worth noting that generally, the media are not allowed to publish reports of information contained in materials disclosed during the statutory pre-trial disclosure process, except the basic facts of the case.",14,724,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00724
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, the court may order that the matter be heard behind closed doors – in camera.",15,725,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00725
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Finally, if the sensitive material contains or concerns the identity of a witness, the court can order that such information not be published. This is commonly known as a ""gag order"".",16,726,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00726
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Moving to the next area being amended, Mr de Souza asked for the rationale of giving the courts and the Registrar the power to shorten timelines in relation to procedure for re-opening of concluded cases.",17,727,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00727
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I should highlight that both parties will be given a chance to make arguments about the timelines before the court makes the decision to either shorten or extend them. So, that is the usual way where the court will entertain submissions from both parties. The court will take on board all the facts and arguments, taking them into account in deciding whether it is in fact just to make the order or not.",18,728,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00728
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I stated in my opening speech that this proposal was designed to enhance efficiency, and allow for more flexibility. Let me illustrate the point with one example. Let us say an application to re-open a concluded case is filed very late and close to the time the sentence is to be carried out, for example, a caning sentence, which will be irremediable. With this amendment, the court will be able to consider whether to shorten the procedural timelines to have the application heard and resolved more quickly. We have no doubt that the courts, in applying its discretion to the facts of each case, will have the fair balance between the parties' interests at heart when deciding.",19,729,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00729
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Finally, there were a number of questions on the backdating of RT sentences, and let me deal with that.",20,730,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00730
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Both Ms Lim and Mr de Souza asked what steps the agencies will take to avoid or minimise remand where RT is a possible sentence.,21,731,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00731
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, as I mentioned earlier, the agencies will work to identify the remand cases where the accused is under the age of 21 early. This age group includes all accused for whom RT may be ordered. The identification of these cases may be done even before charge. Once such cases are identified, the Prosecution and investigators will take steps to expedite the case and reach the sentencing stage as quickly as possible.",22,732,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00732
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In addition, in appropriate cases, remand can be avoided by offering a reduced bail amount, for example, if the sureties have difficulty raising bail in those situations. Release on bail with electronic tagging can also be used as an alternative to higher bail amounts where appropriate. The CJRA amended the CPC to expressly allow the use of electronic tagging as a condition of bail.",23,733,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00733
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Ms Lim also asked for confirmation that a court will not have an RT sentence take effect on a date later than the date it was passed if the offender is already in pre-sentence remand, as I understand the question. Yes, that will be so, and in such a situation, it will be started immediately. Generally, the CPC empowers the courts to direct a sentence of imprisonment, RT or Corrective Training or Preventive Detention take effect at a later date than the date it was passed. This, however, is usually done on the request of the offender, in most of these cases, to allow, for example, time to sort out personal affairs and so on before serving a sentence. So, the usual position is if you are already in pre-sentence remand, then unless the offender requests, he will simply carry on. If the offender is already in remand in that situation and they are not requesting bail to sort out personal affairs or other matters, then there is generally no reason to postpone the commencement of sentence.",24,734,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00734
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Finally, Mr de Souza asked whether the Government also considered disallowing backdating for Corrective Training (CT) sentences. As background, although CT sentences share the rehabilitative element with RT, they apply to a different group of offenders. CT applies to adult offenders – as opposed to RT – who have committed one or more offences with maximum sentences of two years' imprisonment or more, and also have relatively serious previous convictions. These adult repeat offenders can be sentenced to CT for a minimum of five and a maximum of 14 years, without entitlement to remission. Considering the long minimum duration of CT sentences, there is less risk that backdating of such sentences will interfere with any rehabilitative efforts during the sentence.",25,735,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00735
2019-03-08-T-006,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I thank the Members for their contribution, both Ms Lim and Mr de Souza, to this debate. The Government is continuously working towards a progressive, balanced and modern criminal justice system that protects society from crime. This Bill contributes to this effort by building on past reforms and also, at the same time, enhancing their effectiveness. With the support of the House, I beg to move.",26,736,2019-03-08-T-006-S-00736
