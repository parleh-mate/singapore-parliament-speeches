2013-02-08-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,asked the Minister for Transport if LTA will modify the current COE bidding system to allow for balloting of fixed-priced COEs by user categories while retaining the quota ceiling.,1,1,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00001
2013-02-08-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mdm Speaker, let me first thank the Member for her suggestion, which we ourselves in the Ministry have considered before.",1,2,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00002
2013-02-08-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"The big challenge in a balloting system for COEs is that even those who have no real intention to buy a car would try their luck. This is especially because the ""prize"" of the ballot, in this case a COE, will be much sought after and a person who wins the ballot can quite easily decide to cash out and literally ""make a small fortune"". It is not that we have anything against people getting lucky but such a system will, in fact, generate additional demand and reduce the chances for those who really want to buy a car. It would also lead to a black market where balloted COEs are resold to genuine car buyers at a much higher price.",2,3,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00003
2013-02-08-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"This, in fact, was the experience when Beijing introduced a balloting system for cars in 2011. The Beijing municipal government released about 240,000 quotas that year, allocated through a monthly lottery system. This number is only one-third of the 750,000 cars registered in the previous year of 2010. Applications to the lottery have since increased exponentially, exceeding a million applicants for the monthly quotas of 20,000 and that number is still rising. So, every month, 20,000 quotas, but also, one million applicants every month right now. It is anybody's guess how many of those one million applicants are trying their luck for the first, second or even nth time. Furthermore, the lotteries have made under-the-table deals a very lucrative business.",3,4,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00004
2013-02-08-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Balloting also does not help us to better satisfy the demand for cars, unless we give special preference for certain user groups. This, however, has serious drawbacks, as I have explained to the House earlier this week. In addition, we would have to fix some arbitrary price for COEs given out under a balloting system. It has to be high enough to deter speculators and yet not too high for people who would like to own cars. The Member will agree that this is next to impossible as any price that is lower than what people are willing to pay will attract speculators.",4,5,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00005
2013-02-08-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"To summarise, balloting essentially means telling genuine buyers, whether they are families or businesses, that getting a COE depends on the luck of the draw or having to resort to the black market. Neither of these is very reassuring and, clearly, not an improvement over the present system.",5,6,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00006
2013-02-08-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for the reply. The ever-escalating COE is a bug bear among Singaporeans, and there is also talk that potentially, the COE can go up to more than $100,000. I was just wondering if the Ministry could consider at least studying what are the models available around the world and get Singaporeans to maybe come up with our own model, and address this bug bear. We could use the Singapore Conversation series as a platform to do that. I think we need to engage Singaporeans to look into this. Let them have the information about the fact that you already have studied this model or other models, and engage them, so that we can perhaps draw some wisdom from them as well.",1,7,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00007
2013-02-08-T-001,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Ms Denise Phua for her comments. Indeed, we share the concerns that Members have over the COE prices. As I have shared earlier this week, we are open to reviewing a number of ways in which we could improve the system. For example, we could look at how the categories are defined.",1,8,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00008
2013-02-08-T-001,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I totally agree with the Member that it is an area that we need to reach out more and share with Singaporeans why some of the options that are very well-intentioned do, however, have some serious drawbacks or difficulties in implementation. Madam, what I can share with the Member is that, for a start, in the Ministry's website, there is something that we are preparing that will help to articulate all the different considerations for suggestions that members of the public have put forward, which are really good suggestions to begin with but then they have some implementation difficulties. So, that is something that we are working on. And I would also agree with the Member that if there are opportunities for us to go out and explain the different options that the Ministry has considered, we would be very happy to do so. At the same time, let me reassure her that this is an area that we will try and see if there are ways to refine.",2,9,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00009
2013-02-08-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for the response. As a follow-up question, and to raise the issue that I raised two days ago again, if there could be a re-consideration for those who treat the road as their livelihood. Therefore, commercial vehicles, companies, SMEs, who are requiring transport or transport of their workers and tools for their trade, and if there is a review of the COE system or a tweak of it, could priority or consideration be had to this group? I understand that there are two auction processes for the COE, but if that could be tweaked, I would be every grateful for that.",1,10,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00010
2013-02-08-T-001,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Madam, again, I thank Mr Christopher de Souza for raising this concern on behalf of especially small businss owners. I do have a lot of sympathy for this group because they do need it for their livelihood. Yes, we have made the additional registration fee as low as 5% for Category C vehicle owners, as compared to 100% of the Open Market Value for car owners. So, there is already a big price difference between what business owners will have to pay for goods vehicles and what individual owners are currently paying for the privilege of car ownership. But I take his point and it is something that we are very mindful of, and we are looking at some possibilities.",1,11,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00011
2013-02-08-T-001,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister of State whether the review of the COE is on the way. If it is, then when will this review be completed?",1,12,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00012
2013-02-08-T-001,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The COE system is actually quite complex, with many different dimensions. One of the key things that we are trying to do is to ensure that whatever it is that we do to the COE does not distort the market inappropriately. I understand that there is a sense of urgency. What I can say to the Member is that we are also very mindful of the urgency.",1,13,2013-02-08-T-001-S-00013

2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, the White Paper has reinforced the reality and seriousness of our population's demographic trend of a shrinking and ageing population as currently being experienced in most of Asia.",1,26,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00026
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"From now till 2030, we will have more than 900,000 Baby Boomers turning 65 years of age. This is about a quarter of the existing citizen population entering their silver years. To contribute towards reversing the current trend of low birth rates, the recent enhanced Marriage and Parenthood Package (M&P Package) which encourages young Singaporeans to get married and have more than one child, is a commendable initiative. I would like to raise several concerns and make suggestions in four key areas to further contribute to the initiatives in the Population White Paper.",2,27,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00027
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"First, holistic approach, infant care and childcare. I thank the Government for accepting some of the NTUC's proposal to build a pro-family and pro-creation Singapore. While the new M&P Package, including the enhanced Baby Bonus, encourages couples to have more children and helps alleviate child-raising costs, it is, however, a one-off incentive and does not take into account that child raising is a lifelong journey.",3,28,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00028
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"In order to improve fertility rates, it is important that families have support throughout the years as the child grows up. Parents need to feel confident that they can adequately provide for their children a quality life while enjoying opportunities for personal development.",4,29,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00029
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),Strong measures must be in place to ensure that women do not lose out at work when they take time off to start a family. We urge the Government to take bold steps to implement a holistic approach on family-friendly workplace practices. I would like to ask if the Minister would consider legislating the right for employees to ask for flexible work arrangement similar to Australia and UK.,5,30,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00030
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"The additional subsidies for infant care and childcare are definitely a step in the right direction. It reduces the burden of infant care and childcare costs for working parents and is an incentive for full-time mothers to return to work. These enhanced subsidies are pegged to household incomes, and, therefore, vary, depending on the family's incomes.",6,31,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00031
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"However, while these measures are welcomed, would the Government consider taking a bigger step and moving towards the Scandinavian model which has improved Total Fertility Rate to 2.1? For the Scandinavians, the affordability of infant care and childcare is just part of the answer. Equally important is that the network of facilities where fees and standards are equal across the board. This removes the anxiety of fighting for a spot at the best day-care centres and gives children the same preparation for school regardless of their socio-economic status.",7,32,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00032
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"I urge our Government to continue to work towards strengthening the infrastructures of our infant care and childcare centres to provide quality services, so that parents are confident to raise their children without monetary worries and over reliance on domestic helpers.",8,33,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00033
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Instead of our current staggered system of enhanced subsidies based on household income, can we consider a similar model where infant care and childcare is very much close to being state-funded? After all, children are our National Treasures and the leaders of tomorrow. What we spend on them today is an investment for our future. This would be in line with the current practice where the fees in our Government Primary and Secondary schools are nominal and a flat rate for all Singaporeans, and there is no discrimination and income differentiation. This simplified scheme further reduces the manpower required to administer the different tiers of subsidies.",9,34,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00034
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"We can further look into a longer and more flexible system of parental care leave. In Sweden, couples enjoy 13 months of paid leave, plus another three months' leave at a fixed rate. The 13 months can be split between parents, so families can decide which parent would best perform the role at home. By law, employers have to hold a mother's job during her maternity leave, so the job will still be there after one year. This is one of the contributing factors to the Swedish fertility rate of 1.9.",10,35,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00035
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"I hope that the Minister will continue to look into NTUC's request of a longer maternity leave of six months paid by the Government and, if possible, up to another six months' unpaid maternity leave.",11,36,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00036
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Although Singaporean working mothers enjoy maternity leave, there remains a segment of the women population, employed on short term contracts, who may not get their contracts renewed when their employers become aware of their pregnancy.",12,37,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00037
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"While the Government Paid Maternity Benefit offers some income for mothers who are contract workers, if family support is inadequate, it will be a challenge for the mother to go out to look for employment when no one is taking care of the newborn. In this instance, she would not be eligible to fully benefit from the infant care subsidies. These mothers find themselves without income when they need it most. A flat, nominal infant care fee would, however, be very beneficial in her circumstance.",13,38,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00038
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Second, Singapore women and serving the nation. As the Singapore population continues to age, there will be considerable demands for facilities for the elderly, including healthcare, rehabilitative care, retirement homes and others. The Government is looking to build some 17 new and replacement nursing homes, 39 senior care centres and 56 senior activity centres by 2016, with facilities to be added in tandem with future demand and growth. Whilst work is being done to develop these national infrastructures to support our ageing population, is the same effort being made towards building a manpower base for these facilities?",14,39,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00039
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Healthcare is such an essential aspect in ensuring the well-being of our national population. Whilst our male population in Singapore are obliged to serve their National Service, the women can also contribute to our nation by being trained in healthcare and eldercare as part of a mere mandatory minimum of three month's commitment similar to our men serving in National Service.",15,40,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00040
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"They will become better caregivers for their immediate families and be equipped when they start families of their own. This will serve as an exposure, as well as encouragement, for women to consider healthcare as a career option but, more importantly, the skills and knowledge in medical care, healthcare and eldercare will remain a core life skill that will be embedded in our young women for life. This will contribute to the currently lacking manpower base of healthcare workers and help reduce our reliance on foreign talents. Madam, I am often being asked by male colleagues and Members lamenting to me why are we women not serving National Service whereas they have to. I have to gently remind them that their mothers served life-long National Service because of them.",16,41,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00041
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Third, housing and transport infrastructure. In our Singapore journey to 2030, preliminary projections indicate that we may have some 2.5 million non-residents, who are predominantly foreign workers, supplementing our Singaporean Core in the workforce.",17,42,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00042
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"To cope with our population growth, the Government has plans to add to our infrastructure with 700,000 additional homes, so that we can all live and co-exist in this high quality living environment. In this quest for quality living, I hope that decent quality living infrastructure will also be developed for our foreign labour in the form of better dormitories.",18,43,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00043
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Although some of our foreign workforce may be from third world countries seeking better work opportunities, it does not mean that they only deserve third world standards of housing in Singapore. I, therefore, urge the Government to consider, as part of the infrastructure development plans, to also place serious consideration into how we can provide a comfortable living environment for our foreign workforce. They deserve decent work, decent wages and a decent living environment, as with all workers all over the world.",19,44,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00044
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"With regard to transport, I am heartened that the Government has also announced plans to implement a $43 million National Cycling Plan to construct dedicated off-road cycling paths that segregate cyclists from on-road vehicles and pedestrians in HDB towns and estates to facilitate intra-town cycling, one of which would be through capitalising on the extensive park connector networks.",20,45,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00045
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"It is a great proposal, as cycling is a mode of transport that has a reduced environmental impact and, on a recreational level, promotes healthier living through exercise. However, I hope the Government will look beyond the recreational benefits of cycling and recognise that cycling is an alternate mode of transport. Studies from Copenhagen concluded that after cycle tracks were constructed along the main roads, there was an increase in the use of bicycles and a decrease in the use of cars or other modes of transport for daily commute to work. When I was in Copenhagen last October, I was amazed to see so many well-dressed professional men and women riding bikes to and from work. Then I was told by the Danish unionists that their Labour Minister cycled to work. I started to imagine our Acting Minister for Manpower Tan Chuan-Jin doing the same. But I am not quite there yet.",21,46,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00046
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"With our increased population projections in 2030, it would be worthwhile to alleviate the crunch of cars on the road and the masses using our rail networks by encouraging some of our citizens to embrace a healthier and more economical way of transportation.",22,47,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00047
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"While the National Cycling Plan is looking into off-road cycling paths, would the Government consider the feasibility of implementing cycling infrastructures into the building of future roads, including bus lanes, or designated routes for cyclists to use in their daily commutes?",23,48,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00048
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Lastly, better pay, better jobs and better lives. In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, I must confess that, like many others, I was concerned when I first read the headline of 6.9 million population in 2030. Looking at the current infrastructure, social tension and the competition we face, it did not give me the assurance that Singaporeans will be better off in 2030 with a 6.9 million population.",24,49,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00049
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"However, I appreciate our prudent Government for being honest, for taking the bold steps in sounding the alarm and planning ahead before it is too late. On this note, I would like to join my brothers and sisters in the Labour Movement to call upon the Deputy Prime Minister to focus on the following important areas.",25,50,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00050
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"First, we must be mindful that the slowdown in economic growth could lead to higher unemployment and stagnation of wages. Whilst we recognise that as our economy matures, our economic and manpower growth will slow down, but we must not overdo it and lose sight of keeping unemployment low and fending off wage stagnation. At the same time, we must pay special attention to vulnerable workers to ensure that they, too, can have better jobs, better pay and lead better lives.",26,51,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00051
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Second, assure Singaporeans that the infrastructure of 2020 and 2030 will be better than the infrastructure of today. It is important to solve the problems of today decisively so as to build confidence and prevent the problem of today from snowballing into a bigger problem tomorrow; in particular, the availability and affordability of housing, reliability and adequacy of public transport, shorter waiting times and affordable healthcare.",27,52,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00052
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Third, Singaporeans must always come first as we grow our population. As we see more non-residents in Singapore, we must also see more babies born here. From education to healthcare, jobs and wages, we must ensure that the interests of Singaporeans come first. The standard of living and quality of life of Singaporeans must only get better and not worse. Putting Singaporeans first would also mean protecting our Singaporean PMEs as well. I fully support the call by the hon Member Patrick Tay for the Minister to look into setting up a quota for foreign PMEs so that our Singaporeans will not be disadvantaged.",28,53,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00053
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Fourth, a bigger population should not lead to higher inflation and a less sustainable environment. There will be greater demand for daily essentials. A bigger population will also put a greater strain on our environment with higher energy consumption, air pollution and others. Steps must be taken to ensure the security of supply and a greener and cleaner environment.",29,54,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00054
2013-02-08-T-002,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew (Nominated Member),"Last but not least, the journey towards Singapore 2030 should be a journey of all-round engagement between the Government and Singaporeans. The five-day debate in Parliament and the adoption of the White Paper should not be a one-off exercise. There must be periodical reviews and continued engagement. This will strengthen trust, co-ownership, confidence and involvement by Singaporeans in creating our Singapore 2020 and 2030 together. On this note, Madam, I support the Motion as moved by the hon Member Liang Eng Hwa.",30,55,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00055

2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Recently, we have been discussing how large a population Singapore will have in the future. The reality is that Singapore does not have enough people and has a low fertility rate and an ageing population.

2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"To ensure a Singaporean core, we must first raise our citizens' fertility rate. In this regard, we must have strong determination. We have talked about this enough during the last several days. Now, I would like to focus on childcare and eldercare.",4,59,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00059
2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Many families rely on maids to look after their children. It would be most helpful if the Government could reduce or waive the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy. At the same time, employers should adopt more pro-family measures. When a person's family is harmonious, his productivity will also increase. As the saying goes, ""a harmonious family can lead to the success of everything"".",5,60,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00060
2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Besides maids, many couples also hope their parents, that is, the grandparents, could help look after the children. If the elderly can help look after our next generation, our family and social cohesiveness would be strong. The elderly can play with their grandchildren and the latter can receive more love from them. Youngsters will be able to feel more warmth from the family. Grandparents are more experienced and caring; therefore, couples will be more comfortable with leaving their children with them. Hence, the Government can subsidise the grandparents who help look after the grandchildren with a childcare grant. This is a form of recognition of their contributions and will be seen as pro-family.",6,61,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00061

2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Looking after the elderly means they can age gracefully. Quite often, we hear people say that they are not afraid of death but sickness instead. This shows how the elderly are worried about high medical expenses. I hope the Government can relieve the elderly of their worries and consider waiving GST for all medical expenses, regardless whether they are subsidised by the Government or not, and relax the criteria for using ElderShield.",8,63,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00063
2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Besides physical health, we should also look after the elders' mental health. Ageing-in-place is a very good proposal. There is a saying that nowhere is as good as one's home. If the elderly could age in place and continue to live in a familiar environment, they will have better mental health. We need to expand the scope of ageing-in-place and build more pro-senior facilities in the community.",9,64,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00064

2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In conclusion, to keep Singapore vibrant and to stay true to the Singapore spirit, we must have enough Singaporeans.

2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Firstly, the Government should continue to create as many opportunities for every Singaporean to be successful in life. In 2030, I hope all Singaporeans will live out their own ""Singapore dream"", have great and good career options and excel in different pathways they wanted. To do so, I urge the Government to invest heavily in education. We must preserve our social mobility and allow every child to realise their potential to the fullest.",19,74,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00074
2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Our investments in education should address our demographic challenges. Our ageing population will require more healthcare services. From NPTD's Paper on Foreign Manpower Demand, the projected growth of foreign healthcare professionals and support care workforce is about 9,000 and 6,000 respectively. I believe that more should be done to encourage locals to join these sectors instead. I urge the three medical schools here to do more to attract and nurture medical professionals amongst Singaporeans.",20,75,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00075
2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Most parents applaud the recent announcements on the enhanced child and infant care subsidies.

This will increase the level of professionalism in this sector.",21,76,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00076
2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Besides affordability of childcare courses, parents continue to be concerned by the accessibility and quality of early childhood development programmes.

2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The rising cost of living continues to be one of the chief concerns among Singaporeans, particularly the lower income group who have seen their real income stagnate. With rising income inequality a global phenomenon, we must help our low-income Singaporeans upgrade, take on good jobs and earn better wages. We need to attract better foreign investments so as to secure good quality jobs, better-paid jobs for our Singaporeans. I am heartened by the Government's drive to create high-value jobs, with two-thirds of Singaporeans holding PMET jobs by 2030.",23,78,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00078
2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),The rental costs for commercial and industrial properties also affect the rising costs of living among Singaporeans. I would urge the HDB and JTC to assume bigger and more active roles in controlling the rental for these properties. A good example is the role of the NEA and its active co-management of new hawker centres with non-profit organisations.,24,79,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00079
2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Thirdly, we must continue to build good affordable homes and implement pro-family housing policies. On good affordable homes, I welcome MND's move to delink the prices of new flats from the prices of resale flats. This will address many young couples' anxieties. May I also suggest that MND continues to price future new flats at not more than five times of the eligible applicants' annual income of this flat type.",25,80,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00080
2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"We also can do more for three generations of families staying together. The new Multi-generation Priority Scheme allows parents and their married child to submit a joint application to purchase a studio apartment or 2-room flat together with another flat in the same project. I suggest that MND looks at making bigger sized flats, that is, 4-room and 5-room, a priority to larger families to encourage them to live together.",26,81,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00081

As a Pasir Ris-Punggol Member of Parliament, I am pleased to note that Punggol will be developed further. The existing Punggol Town Centre will be expanded into Punggol Downtown with a Town Square and a Creative Cluster.

2013-02-08-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On pro-family housing policies, I think we can go a step further than the newly introduced Parenthood Priority Scheme. We can also explore a special housing grant for HDB couples for each child they have, subject to a minimum of two children. Young families also need the support of their immediate families, such as their parents and in-laws. We can do more for them.",29,84,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00084

As Punggol becomes one of the largest HDB towns under the Punggol Downtown, I would like to request that LTA expedite the building of the Cross Island Line. This will facilitate better connectivity for the larger number of residents from Punggol to towns in the central and western region.

2013-02-08-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak in this debate. When the White Paper was released, I had strong reservations. I wondered how Singapore can accommodate 6.9 million, when every day we are faced with crowds in places such as the housing estates, wet markets, shopping malls, MRT trains, buses and carparks? How can I feel that this is still my country if Singaporeans are at the brink of becoming the minority with 55% of the population being citizens in Singapore in 2030?",1,91,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00091
2013-02-08-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Singaporeans shared these reservations. The White Paper evoked a strong reaction from many Singaporeans. The media headlines were stark and set the tone for the vigorous debate that was to come. The Internet was abuzz with concerns and critical comments.

2013-02-08-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"When we talk about the Singaporean Core, it is also about preserving our Singaporean identity. Being a Singaporean, a citizen should be beyond just holding a pink IC. There has to be a sense of togetherness and shared destiny. It is natural that Singaporeans worry if some of these new immigrants are opportunistic and will exploit us for their own gains. It is natural that Singaporeans want to know  will they stay and fight with us if a war breaks out tomorrow? Can they speak our language? And will they sing our National Anthem with the same feeling that we have?",27,117,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00117
2013-02-08-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Clearly, we cannot have zero immigration. However, we need to do more and try harder in our efforts to integrate new immigrants faster and better. And to prevent Singaporeans from becoming a minority in our own country, I hope the Government will consider setting a baseline percentage of Singaporeans that cannot be breached. That will ensure that foreigners will never be admitted into Singapore beyond an acceptable level and that Singaporeans can be better safeguarded.",28,118,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00118

The Population White Paper is one of the most important issues considered in this Parliament.

This is evidently an unpopular task; some may question if this is fool's courage; some have even described it as ""political suicide"" for the ruling party. I would like to think that any political party in a democracy will not shoot itself in the foot; the Government would not have introduced this White Paper unless it believes that this is the best proposal, or at least the least bad for Singaporeans and for the future.

In all my years, Singapore has enjoyed high GDP growth of about 5% to 8% every year, except during the short periods when Singapore went into recession.

Are there specific data or cases that can be explained so that we would know the trade-offs and, therefore, make an informed decision?

2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),My first concern touches on how serious we are about raising our citizen Total Fertility Rate (TFR) and making sure we will have a strong and not diminishing Singaporean core in the long term.,2,140,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00140
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"The White Paper acknowledges that many East Asian societies and Western European countries have fertility rates below replacement levels, but it fails to present or consider examples of other countries that have been successful in gradually reversing their declining TFR. These include Norway, Sweden, France, Iceland, Ireland and the UK.",3,141,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00141
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Some of these more successful countries have relied, to some extent, on immigrant births to reverse declining TFR, but research also shows that as these nations become more developed, better systems are put in place to help families take care of children, such as extended paternity care and more equitable working environments.",4,142,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00142
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"The reversal of declining TFR, most notably in the Nordic countries, is due largely to the adoption of women-friendly and family-friendly social policies and labour market practices. Women enjoy relatively unhindered access to the labour market, and are able to easily withdraw from and return to it after taking parental leave. In Singapore, however, the women's workforce participation rates decline and do not recover from age 30 onwards. This indicates that many who leave the workforce do not return.",5,143,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00143
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"In Norway, on the other hand, women benefit from extended paid maternity leave of 46 weeks and their jobs are protected by law. Both partners, mother and father, are actively involved in child-rearing, with men being offered a minimum of 10 weeks paid paternity leave. There is access to high quality, heavily subsidised childcare and a guaranteed place for every child. Companies are obligated to offer benefits to pregnant women and new mothers. For instance, expectant mothers get free medical check-ups and breastfeeding moms are allowed to leave early from work.",6,144,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00144
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"In the Singapore context, these would be considered very bold measures. However, like several Members in this House have stated, we need to implement bold measures if we expect a paradigm change. If this projection of 6.9 million people by 2030 is really ""a worst-case scenario"" to help Government plan for our long-term infrastructural needs, then, by the same argument, should we not explore all means and ways to raise the TFR of our resident population under worst-case scenario circumstances?",7,145,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00145
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Studies have shown that social policies that help women to reconcile work and family life have a positive effect on fertility. If we are serious about raising TFR, we need to support women who wish to continue working and making a living after childbirth, and give them the assurance that having more children will not have a negative impact on their and their children's quality of life. We should do more to make gender equality a core value in all our policies in order to support shared parenthood. We need legislation to eliminate workplace discrimination against mothers and pregnant women, and provide greater job security for them. Like Ms Mary Liew, I would like to ask that Government also consider legislating for companies to provide options for flexi-work arrangements for women after childbirth, as well as advocate and incentivise them to support the needs of new mothers in the workplace. And, finally, we must ensure that all our children, no matter their economic background, have good and easy access to high quality and affordable pre-school education and childcare.",8,146,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00146
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),My second and more pressing concern relates to Singaporeans' capacity to embrace a much bigger foreign population into our midst.,9,147,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00147
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Singapore has a high proportion of PRs and foreigners who live and work alongside our citizens every day. The current ratio is about 38% of the total population. And by 2020, this will climb to about 40%. And by 2030, the number projected will be close to 45%. That is almost half! Is it any surprise then that there is so much anxiety and insecurity amongst Singaporeans over who will constitute this Singaporean Core in 2030?",10,148,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00148
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Reading MND's Land Use Plan paper and after listening to Minister Khaw's reassurances, one could argue that it is reasonable to trust the planners on the carrying capacity of our island.

2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"First, our psychological deficit. Madam, I am not sure if Singaporeans are psychologically ready to accept a lot more immigrants.

2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"It is out of our character, but I believe some of this angst stems from our worry over limited national resources.

2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Sure, the 6.9 million figure is only a planning parameter but, psychologically, it is still a hard pill to swallow because Government has yet to convince citizens on how it intends to effectively deal with the serious infrastructural gaps and address the more fundamental questions related to the rising costs of housing and healthcare and the challenges of retirement faced by Singaporeans today. This has led to a growing sense of insecurity about our future, a break in trust between Government and the people, and a lack of confidence that what we work for counts for something. I would, therefore, like to echo Mr Inderjit Singh's call for Government to focus first on solving the problems created by past policies of rapid economic and population growth, and on improving the lives of Singaporeans.",14,152,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00152

Social spending in Singapore has decreased significantly from about 25% of GDP in the 1980s to only about 16% of GDP by 2011, even less than in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. In this respect, I agree with Mr Seah Kian Peng that Government should review its bias against welfarism.",16,154,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00154
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"We need to also assure citizens that they are not discriminated against in their own country. We can do this by ensuring that Singaporeans are not discriminated in favour of foreigners when it comes to employment, especially with the rise of more Singaporeans in PMET jobs. We can also make it easier for overseas-born Singaporeans to get their citizenship when they turn 21. I know of Singapore children, born overseas to Singaporean parents, who face an endless line of bureaucratic hoops and hurdles just to prove their right to citizenship. In the meantime, they are upset that there are foreigners who are wooed and courted, and then fast-tracked through the system to getting their citizenship.",17,155,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00155

2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Second, our social deficit. Madam, in a recent letter to TODAY, someone warned that Singapore was in danger of developing into three broad enclaves  one, foreign workers living in dormitories; two, Singaporean heartlanders; and three, wealthy foreigners living in the central region. This does not sound like the Singapore we love and remember, where friends and neighbours of various ethnic, cultural and economic backgrounds, would mix and mingle despite our language differences. This sounds more like a Singapore that is at risk of racial and class divisions. The rapid PR and foreign population growth in the last few years has caused some of these fractures and reduced our empathy for difference.",20,158,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00158

Singaporeans then do not want to take up certain jobs because they are seen as lower status jobs done only by foreigners. This creates a further dependency on foreign workers. The recent decision to grant our Foreign Domestic Workers a mandatory day off was a step in the right direction, but more can be done to protect the other labour rights of these workers. Policies and practices that place a lower value on the lives and well-being of certain human beings also lead to Singaporeans to devalue the lives of other Singaporeans.",22,160,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00160

2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Finally, our cultural deficit. Madam, the White Paper talks about providing a high quality of life, and celebrating and safeguarding our heritage, but adds this qualifier  ""wherever it is practical to do so"". It wants Singapore to be a ""liveable, lively and well-loved"" city, but does not earmark any new spaces for heritage, culture and the arts. In fact, in MND's entire 68-page paper on Land Use, ""the arts"" is only mentioned in one brief paragraph, and not much is said about preserving spaces for historical, cultural or sentimental value to Singaporeans. It is a glaring omission, and I refer to this lack of consideration as our ""cultural deficit"".",26,164,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00164

The Arts also entertain us, educate us, revive us and provide the much needed leisure outlet to unwind and relax. Our cultural wealth and heritage are built on history, tradition and memories. It roots us and gives us the tenacity to face change. It provides us with the necessary cultural depth to strengthen our Singapore identity. On this aspect, I have two points.",27,165,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00165
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"First, a sense of shared history and a strong sense of belonging amongst Singaporeans make it easier for new citizens to actively connect with their new home. How do we develop empathy and mutual understanding of each other's worldviews and differences if we do not continue to develop cultural spaces like museums and art venues where stories, traditions and memories can be shared? Several Members have questioned the effectiveness of some of our integration initiatives. Mr Seng Han Tong felt that the citizenship ceremonies, grassroots events and audio-visual presentations may not have been as impactful as they should be. Integration efforts should not be a one-way street. Singaporeans, too, need to build these cultural capacities. A vibrant arts scene can provide far more enriching ways of encountering and bridging differences, and celebrating diversity.",28,166,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00166
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Secondly, public spaces to which Singaporeans have made long-lasting attachments help us develop a keen sense of home. It is an emotional attachment. There is no ""practical"" reason to safeguard it except to safeguard the hearts of our citizens and their sentimental connection to this island. Valuable historical resources are in danger of being lost if a concerted effort is not made to assess them in detail, prior to any land use decisions. These decisions cannot be made as and when an infrastructural need arises.",29,167,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00167
2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Madam, at the risk of sounding repetitive, I would like to recall MND's response to the Bukit Brown issue at last year's Committee of Supply debate. The Minister of State recognised that hard choices on how our land is used need to be made. He recalled the late Mr Lim Kim San's words, ""Do you want me to look after our dead grandparents or do you want me to look after your grandchildren?"" It would be hugely ironic if, in order to make way for more people in 2030, most of whom will be new immigrants with no ancestral links to this land, we had to give up our own cultural and historical treasures and legacies. Worse still, if the 6.9 million figure is truly a stretched projection in a ""worst case scenario"", then we need to ask ourselves, are we willing to permanently sacrifice, say, parts of Bukit Brown, for instance, to build infrastructure based on a figure we may or may not achieve?",30,168,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00168

2013-02-08-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, to conclude, I would like to remind the House of the wisdom and foresight of S Rajaratnam in 1967. He had written an article for the Petir newsletter entitled, ""Preparing for the Seventies"". At that time, we were a society of transient immigrants, where many thought of Singapore, and I quote, ""not as ‘our island' but as a treasure island in which one stayed so long as there was treasure available"". He goes on to say, ""To instill in them a deep concern for not just their personal future, but for the future of Singapore… This is partly a psychological problem.""",32,170,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00170

Is it just about the economy? Or is it about the well-being of Singaporeans in 2030? Upon closer examination, I realised that some one-third of the Paper deals with issues of jobs, family, environment, living environment which are the basic quality of life issues – the same issues that concern us all. Hence, to be fixated on the 6.9 million figure is simply missing the wood for the trees.",1,174,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00174
2013-02-08-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"But then, why such strong response from the residents? Politics aside, there is a real concern if our tiny island of 500 square metres of developable land can actually accommodate 6.9 million people comfortably. Already, there is congestion on the road, overcrowded public transport and hawker centres, rising housing prices and cost of living. These are clear and present challenges that residents are frustrated with today, so adding more people just does not feel right. Ironically, as the Government reiterated many times, it is precisely the responsibility to plan ahead of demand, and avoid the present day problems, that a planning figure of 6.9 million for 2030 was proposed.",2,175,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00175

Do it now and if we over-project the number for 2030 by some margin, it is still much better than the overcrowded situation now. Let us have some buffer as all these projects have a long gestation period – a situation we are struggling with today. However, this Paper cannot be cast in stone.

2013-02-08-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On tapping the latent workforce, I have been speaking in this House about putting in more measures to encourage tapping of workforce since 2005. According to the Report on Labour Force in Singapore 2011, it states that the resident labour workforce participation rate of people over 15 years old is 66.1% versus 64.4% in 2001. For older residents of age 55 to 64, the labour participation rate has, in fact, jumped from 45.6% in 2001 to 63.4% in 2011 and the women workforce participation rate between age 25 and 54 also increased substantially from 65.4% in 2002 to 75.7% in 2011.

2013-02-08-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"To do so, suitable incentive frameworks, part-timers/freelancers' guilds and a supportive community are pre-requisites. And if the Singapore workplace is truly inclusive and if the social enterprise sector can develop further, then more needy and disadvantaged people will also be able to contribute to the economy, find good employment, achieve good livelihoods and gain a sense of self-worth and dignity.

If we simply talk about the numbers, a rise on one side from tapping on the latent Singaporean workforce will mean the need for workers in building and running childcare and eldercare facilities.

If we are all too successful at tapping the latent workforce but do not address the demand for care, the flexi-work arrangements, then we may not see an increase in our fertility rates. Our women will be stretched every which way – they are not machines, and they do not live according to mathematical formula or financial spreadsheets! So, let us not make the situation worse on one side when we think we are solving problems on the other side.

He asked if it is possible for the state and the community to develop a common tools room or workshop at the void deck so that social entrepreneurs may teach their skills to 1-room flat residents who can, in turn, make high-value artisanal products using community-owned tools or machines which they would otherwise not be able to afford.

We have moved to the norm of one-child or two children family as a result of the strong anti-natalist policy in the 1970s and our dalliance with eugenics from the mid-1980s, which turbo-charged the natural contraceptive effect of education, wealth and more opportunities for women.

This requires a whole and radical mindset shift, and not more talk or money. We need to move more resolutely on this front, especially in our schools and workplaces. Stress levels are high and we should look at the concern that our children do not have much of a childhood, and that many parents run home schools after they finish work. Yes, our schools may be teaching less so that our children may learn more. But it seems like they are studying more and have even more homework.

Madam, this is inaccurate and inappropriate. My nursing colleagues are dedicated, hard-working skilled professionals, doing a challenging job in difficult conditions. They take pride in their work, they have specialised knowledge, specialised skills. They are not interchangeable warm bodies and pairs of hands. Many have degrees and years of post-graduate training. We need to inspire more Singaporeans to join the caring profession, and to label it in this way serves no one. This should be fixed.

2013-02-08-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The Land Use Plan clearly explains how and where we will obtain land for building more homes and amenities. Instead of emphasising the parts of Singapore which will be built up, developed and redeveloped, is it possible that we can have lists of more sites that will be preserved, identified as such, and protected? There are many plans for green spaces. How many will be permanent? Would the Government be prepared to identify more areas which will never be redeveloped? Would we be able to reassure citizens that they can enjoy specific green or open or communal spaces in perpetuity? Preserving the old and the familiar spaces is important as it ensures that people do not feel constantly displaced, which is likely to happen when their physical environment keeps changing. The Land Use Plan does detail the many parks, and park connectors that we have and that are planned. But it fails to specify to what extent these and other shared spaces are protected, and to what extent we commit to preserving our surroundings.",4,343,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00343

2013-02-08-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Grandchildren are my next concern. There is a severe shortage of childcare places, nationwide 20,000 more childcare places are being planned by 2017, four years from now, but I have childcare centres that are now struggling to recruit staff. How is the Government planning to deal with the severe shortage of labour in this sector, in the face of plans to further restrict foreign labour growth? What plans are there to ensure that these places will be operational in good time?",6,345,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00345
2013-02-08-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Our towns, especially our new towns, are populated over a relatively short time. If we ramp up childcare capacity too aggressively, in about 10 years or more, some of it is going to be oversupply. Would the Government consider solutions to significantly increase the provision of childcare facilities at the workplace instead? The proportion of employees within a company or cluster of businesses that need childcare is less likely to vary significantly over time, as compared to within a new housing estate. This approach will address the issue of over-demand for services in a young housing estates as well as the later oversupply when the children grow up. It will also make it easier for working parents, rather than having to rely on the grandparents. With our changing demography, the age gap between a grandchild and a grandparent is increasing. For some families I know, the grandparent is unable to care for the child, nor take their first-born grandchild to the childcare centre. I am suggesting that we augment the current capacity with a different emphasis, to serve the needs of families with different challenges.",7,346,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00346
2013-02-08-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Similarly, the Government has put forth proposals to increase our infrastructure, and has defended these with confidence and certainty. Minister Khaw has repeatedly said ""Don't worry"" and reassured us that ""It will be awesome"". Madam, the plans are indeed awesome, but I do worry. How will this infrastructure get built on time in the face of a tightening labour pool? To what extent will the cost of providing this infrastructure rise, as the cost of labour rises?",8,347,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00347
2013-02-08-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, one further concern I have is the lack of explicit discussion in the White Paper of its possible inaccuracy. Population science is not exact, and as past experience has shown, forward projections can turn out to be off the mark, sometimes by a very significant margin. We have in the past reached particular milestones of population size or fertility rate drop way ahead of the forecast. The presentation of facts, statistics and projections with such confidence has given rise to the perception that many of these factors are under the direct control of the Government, when they are not. As Acting Minister Tan Chuan-Jin alluded to yesterday, there is no master control for GDP, nor for migration numbers. There are instead hundreds of daily individual decisions to serve specific purposes  do we support this company? Do we support this business? Do we allow this family to bring in their relative? Do we allow this person to stay in Singapore and become a citizen? An explicit statement of the bigger uncertainty would be a completion of the commitment to transparency.",9,348,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00348

Others have suggested that if we are still debating these issues in the future, we will be in trouble. Respectfully, I disagree with both. These issues and the way we struggled with them have defined us since independence. We have discussed and debated them time and time again. How we deal with these challenges and issues going forward will continue to define us as a people. We should not shy away from debating these matters in the future, and we should not pre-suppose that we can set in motion a single path that will solve all our problems for the future.",10,349,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00349

Building ahead of need, slowing down the pace of economic growth, reducing the inflow of foreign labour. This is on top of recent other ideologic changes, such as the institutionalisation of Workfare, making permanent GST vouchers. But, amazingly, in this House, in this week, we are not debating the fundamental ideology, we are not debating the fundamental positions, we are not debating where we want to go.

Antonio Gramsci, an Italian writer, who was a communist jailed by the fascists, his most famous quote attributed to him is ""Pessimism of the intellect and Optimism of the Will"". In 1929, writing from prison, he went on to explain and expand upon this, as that ""The challenge of modernity is to live without illusions and yet without becoming disillusioned"".",15,354,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00354

If we look at the White Paper, the Government is pessimistic about its ability to affect some things, perhaps the falling fertility rate, the ageing population certainly, the labour participation rate. Conversely, it is very optimistic about delivering infrastructure, restructuring the economy, and maintaining a standard of living for all Singaporeans. The Opposition seems to be pessimistic about everything, but that is the role of an Opposition in our democracy. If we examine their position closely, however, they do have hope and they do have faith. The Opposition believes that the Government, the PAP government, can turn around the TFR. The Opposition has faith that MOM policies will be able to increase the labour force participation rate. The Workers' Party believes that business will survive the restrictions on foreign labour. They have hope and they have faith. They are pessimistic, however, that Singaporeans cannot adapt to the changing realities of the world. They believe that Singaporeans cannot be happy in the Singapore of today. They cannot imagine a bright future for Singapore and Singaporeans.",16,355,2013-02-08-T-002-S-00355

Besides for the sake of carrying on our bloodline, or the security for parents that offspring can provide later in life, many people actually have children to enjoy being in a family unit and to create a relationship with their young ones.

Regardless of 5.9 million or 6 million or 6.9 million, I think the important thing is for us to keep moving forward.

I recalled having very mixed feelings myself. Instinctively, I could understand why Singaporeans were up in arms.

Singaporeans. It has to be! Although some segments are saying it is not meant for Singaporeans. I wonder why. Is it about ensuring that our children continue to enjoy a high quality of life in 20 years' time? Definitely! As parents, we want the best for our children.

They were afraid they cannot give the best for their children. They were not prepared to subject their children to the pressures and stressors of living in a competitive society like Singapore.

I am not familiar with the research in this area, but this seems to correlate with the reactions of the young couples I have met who are concerned about having more children. Having emerged from the academia, I have always appreciated the importance of keeping our minds open. When evidence of such research is thrown up in the midst of our discussion of such sensitive issues, how do we respond?

Because if the research on TFR and population density were true, what might be its implications on our strategies to increase TFR while at the same time bringing in more foreign workers to supplement the local workforce? Perhaps, it would be good for the NPTD to review the research to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how else we can turn around the TFR tide.",24,421,2013-02-08-T-004-S-00421

First, let me clarify again that 6.9 million is not a target. This number is a planning parameter to help us plan for future infrastructure. When we expand our MRT network, hospitals, public housing, parks and other amenities, we use this number as a reference. We want to prepare for more, to plan for the just-in-case. And if we do not have the need, at least we have a fallback. We do not plan to increase the population to 6.9 million. This is not our intent.",3,445,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00445
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"The Government's reason for proposing this White Paper was to spur Singaporeans to look into the long term and start implementing some solutions. We are facing problems such as an ageing population and low birth rate, which would bring about negative consequences. If we do not start tackling these problems now, our population would dwindle and our economy would lose its vitality. I feel that we should not leave this problem to the next Government to solve because that would be irresponsible.",4,446,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00446
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Some Singaporeans feel that we should slow down the pace of life and strive for a better life instead of being too concerned with economic growth. I agree that we should not focus only on economic progress and neglect other important aspects of life such as building a better living environment, narrowing the income gap and building a more harmonious society. In fact, we are already doing so. We have deliberately slowed down the influx of foreigners, which will slow our economic growth. We have accepted slower growth so that we can achieve our larger objectives. But the economy is not like a tap which we can adjust to vary the speed of growth. Policies which are too tight may stall the economy; or we might overheat the economy and cause bubbles to form. Many countries face this problem. And an open economy like Singapore would be especially vulnerable. If we look at other countries, we will find that countries which have slower economic growth are usually not the happiest, most united or harmonious countries. The experience of the Western economies shows that a slow-growth economy tends to have higher unemployment, which affects young people the most, with youth unemployment reaching 30% or even 50%. We have seen this happening in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. There are many other examples.",5,447,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00447
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"This White Paper proposes a compromise between economic growth and giving Singaporeans a high quality of life. Our solution is two-pronged  to encourage more births and raise productivity, and at the same time, bring in an appropriate number of immigrants and foreign workers. Actually, this is a three-pronged approach. A specific suggestion in the White Paper is to reduce the influx of foreign workers from now to 2020. This is in line with public expectations and would help reduce congestion and the sense of unease. At the same time, it will also help us maintain economic stability and create good job opportunities. From 2020 to 2030, which is very far from now, the picture is less clear. Nevertheless, we will further tighten the influx of foreign workers. We will monitor and review the actual situation and put down more specific policies then.",6,448,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00448

We are not pursuing economic growth blindly, neither are we are blindly growing the population. These are the means and not the end. Our eventual objective is to ensure that this generation and our future generations can continue to live happily and peacefully on this island. Every generation can continue to do well and lead better lives than the preceding one.",7,449,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00449

I would like to assure Singaporeans that the Government is already doing our best to tackle various bread-and-butter issues. These measures are already being implemented. I am sure that you will see the results soon. HDB has already gone full steam on building more flats and we will keep prices of new flats affordable. The rail network would double by 2030, and more trips will run during the peak hours to make it more convenient for everyone to travel to and from work and play. Public transport will be more convenient everywhere you go. The Government will provide more training opportunities for workers to increase their productivity and wages. We will strengthen our social safety net and help the less privileged, building on our important first step in our Budget last year.",8,450,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00450
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"However, when we deal with our more immediate problems, we cannot ignore our long-term concerns. And one of our most important longer term concerns is the population issue. It is not some abstract or theoretical concept. We are worried about it because we are worried for Singaporeans. Which group of Singaporeans are we worried about?",9,451,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00451
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"First, we are worried about our elderly. It is obvious that the baby boomers, those born after the Second World War, which include me and some of my fellow Cabinet Ministers, are entering old age. In the next 20 to 30 years, we will all be retired and become retirees and senior citizens. We will need to be taken care of. We hope to lead a peaceful, stable and healthy life. This is a major shift in our demographic profile. How to take care of this group of Singaporeans is a big challenge. In other words, how Singaporeans of today can take care of old Singaporeans 30 years from now is a very big issue. Of course, we can talk about this later but time waits for no man. I know that many Singaporeans are filial and willing to take care of their elderly parents. But I also know that this is not going to be easy, especially when their parents are very sick, or when they have few siblings to share the load, or when their parents are very old and immobile. We all know that being filial is a child's duty, but it is easier said than done. They have parents and children to take care of. They have heavy burdens, both mentally and financially. One way to help them is to bring in foreign workers, particularly domestic helpers and nurses.",10,452,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00452
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"The other group I am worried about are the low-income earners. The Government is helping them to increase their income because they are facing the most pressure from competition. And the most practical way is to increase their skills and employability. However, they need jobs and companies to hire them. If we allow companies to have foreigners as part of their workforce, it may help these companies lower business costs and maintain competitiveness, so that they can continue to employ Singaporean workers. In this way, lower income workers can be protected and cushioned from the impact of globalisation. Minister Lim Swee Say pointed out yesterday that if companies are affected, our workers would ultimately be the ones who suffer. These are words from the leader of the union movement and he knows the real situation. Many Singaporeans either work in SMEs or are owners of SMEs. Our SMEs need time to adapt, upgrade and expand into new markets. If they cannot survive because of a shortage of labour, the first to be affected would be low-wage Singaporean workers. Therefore, when we think of the interests of Singaporeans and try to help them solve their problems, we not only have to deal with the direct issues but also need to consider the indirect factors and economic issues. And foreign labour is one of these factors.",11,453,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00453
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Besides elderly and low-income Singaporeans, we also have to think about the prospects for younger Singaporeans. We have to keep our economy vibrant so that younger Singaporeans can fulfil their potential. Without economic growth and opportunities, younger Singaporeans may just decide to migrate to other places, and leave behind the elderly folks here to take care of themselves.",12,454,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00454
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Therefore, because we are worried about the future for elderly Singaporeans, younger Singaporeans and low-income Singaporeans, we need to be very careful when dealing with immigration and foreign worker issues. When we bring in new immigrants, we are concerned about whether they can integrate into our society. Singapore today is very different from our pre-Independence days. Back then, we were not yet a country. Since Independence, because we have gone through the trials and tribulations during the colonial period, the merger and the early years of Independence, our society has become increasingly mature. The different races have gradually developed a sense of identity, with unique social norms and values.",13,455,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00455
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Under such circumstances, it is more difficult for new immigrants to integrate into our society. As such, the Government will have to double our efforts to help these new immigrants adapt to our society, and ensure that Singaporeans can live harmoniously together with them and integrate the new immigrants as part of us. But at the same time, the Government will also control the number of new immigrants to ensure that it does not go beyond what we can accommodate. Mr Low Thia Khiang said that only Singaporeans who are born and bred here can make up the strong Singapore Core. Foreign immigrants, unlike us, cannot form the Singapore Core. I do not agree with this. I think that this is very pessimistic and narrow-minded thinking. We have all heard of this classical Chinese saying  ""The ocean admits all rivers, thus achieving greatness"". Chinese wisdom accumulated over thousands of years has taught us that accepting talent from all over the world is the way to build a strong nation. No matter which era we live in, no matter where we live, foreign immigrants, as long as they have the determination, can integrate into the society they migrate to and make contributions. We will consider carefully the number we would take in and how we would bring them in; we will make our policies more comprehensive, but our principles remain steadfast. I believe that in time to come, these people can become ""true-blue Singaporeans"" as well.",14,456,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00456

2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"The overarching principle in our population strategy is very clear. The Government will always put Singaporeans first. Singaporeans will continue to make up the majority of the population here and form the strong Singapore Core. All along, the Government has given differentiated treatment to citizens and non-citizens. Singaporeans enjoy preferential treatment in education, housing and healthcare so that they can enjoy the fruits of our economic growth. In recent years, the Government has sent a clearer signal by further differentiating the benefits of citizens and non-citizens. This is necessary and the right thing to do, as Singapore citizens are the owners of this society and the Government is elected by Singaporeans and has to be accountable to Singaporeans. However, Singapore's success cannot rely on the Government alone. Singaporeans need to be the mainstay of our society. They need to strive for the best and be the driving force for the progress of the country and themselves; they cannot be mere passengers. Singaporeans also need to help one another and move forward together as a nation. The Population White Paper is built on this principle. It is drafted to safeguard the interests of this generation and future generations of Singaporeans, to ensure that Singapore continues to develop steadily and become an even better home for all Singaporeans. The White Paper has set out the various challenges we are likely to face, as well as the policies and solutions to tackle these challenges. But a White Paper cannot solve every problem. Therefore, I hope that Singaporeans will continue to discuss these issues, so that the Government can continue to improve on our policies and better prepare Singapore for its future.",17,459,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00459

For example, declare that we are ""setting KPIs for our TFR"". And then by the time you find out that nothing has happened, well, perhaps the awkward moment has passed.

All human beings have this desire to build on what you have inherited, to pass on to your children something better than what you have. I think Singaporeans share this deep human desire. They want to do this individually in their families; they want to do it in their work; we want to do it collectively as a society.

I think I should make my position quite clear. We are not pursuing growth at all costs. We are trying to juggle many different objectives including population, including cohesion, including our social tensions.

If you are in the top 5% or 10% of the population, you may say, well, I have enough, I manage, I can live within my means. If you are at the bottom 10% or 20% of the population, or even the medium Singaporeans – not poor, not rich – I think it would be patronising and cavalier for us to say they do not need more; growth is unimportant. It is important for us to raise the income of the low-income Singaporeans. It is important that we are able to have growth which enables a broad mass of Singaporeans to improve their lives. When people say that the cost of living is high, I want to help with cost of living. Really, the best solution is if your incomes can go up, and you have more means to afford the things that you want, then you will be under less pressure. But for the incomes to go up, unless the economy grows, I must rob Peter to pay Paul. Somebody has to volunteer, take the money from me, give it to them. It is not a sustainable solution.",33,475,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00475
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Our experience has shown that, in fact, when the economy is growing, the low-income Singaporeans benefit; their incomes go up. When the economy crashes or slows down, it is the low-income Singaporeans whose salaries stagnate. And at the top, quite often, incomes continue to rise. It is a problem with us; it is a problem with many countries. And so, that is why, while although we have many objectives and we are trading off, growth still counts, together with sense of belonging and nationhood, together with work-life balance, together with family-friendly environment. One of the things we must not forget is we need to make a living for ourselves.",34,476,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00476

But, finally, you are trying to look at it from the angle of how does it affect Singaporeans? And which Singaporeans are going to be affected when you are talking about population? I think there are three groups which I specifically like to mention.",35,477,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00477
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"First, the older people. Older Singaporeans, not just today's old people whom you can see and are not so few already, but tomorrow's Singaporeans. That means some of us who are here today who still consider ourselves approaching middle age, but in 18 years' time, 2030, we will say, well, this is the new 50. And that is a very big group of Singaporeans. The numbers are growing rapidly because we are the Baby Boomers, the bulge of kids born after the Second World War. I can see this on the ground. All Members can see this on the ground. In Teck Ghee, when I first became a Member of Parliament, I used to attend a lot of baby shows. Today, there are still baby shows once in a while, but far more senior citizen activities. Just last weekend, I opened a Seniors Activity Centre – very popular, lots of old folks playing bingo, exercising, socialising, and asking for more facilities. That is the face of Singapore tomorrow. What do we do with it?",36,478,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00478

By 2030, without immigration – if we freeze everything and just depend on the citizens – it is going to be 2 1. That means the burden, the responsibility on each working-age person is going to triple. We have to look after the seniors. Yes, they have their CPF. That is very helpful. Yes, the Government is there with HDB schemes and with Medisave, Medifund Silver and with all sorts of schemes, to help the senior citizens look after themselves. But, finally, we also need an economy which works; we also need the young people to provide the services to look after them.",37,479,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00479

They come to me and they ask me for help. And I say well, ""What about your family?"" They say my family – so many reasons – ""I have lost touch with them or, you know, young people these days."" Sometimes, a family is helping, the family comes to see us and they do not have a very easy time because they have aged parents, they have young children and they are trying hard to be filial sons and daughters. Not so easy looking after parents, children and work; sometimes, looking after siblings who have special needs – with healthcare expenses, care-givers feeling emotional stress.",38,480,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00480

But is it so simple? We will all get old one day and we will need healthcare and support one day, hopefully, later rather than earlier. But can we solve this problem with re-employed retirees becoming caregivers in old folks' homes? Can one child look after two elderly parents, whether financially or physically? Is it sustainable? Is it fair? So, that is the first group I worry about when looking at their demographic trends.",40,482,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00482

And they need good jobs. They do not want handouts, in fact. They prefer to stand on their own feet, learn a new skill and provide for themselves as Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Zainudin Nordin reminded us. But to do this, we have to be able to have a pie which is expanding and the low-income people cannot be burdened heavily looking after senior citizens and old folks at home.",42,484,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00484

Otherwise, if they close, it is not the foreign worker who has the problem. He goes home but it is the Singaporean who has lost his job, and the employer, the SME boss, who has lost his business, as Mr Inderjit Singh vividly reminded the House.",43,485,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00485

You have heard some of them, as the Members have spoken over the last few days, Mr S Iswaran talked about Khoo Xue Ni, who wants to become a forensic pathologist; Ms Grace Fu talked about Joelle Ng who wants to be a cartoonist; Mr Baey Yam Keng talked about hawker-preneurs, who have a vision, a dream and a passion.",44,486,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00486

It is community engagement. They get satisfaction and I think the people who are helped, are very, very pleased. I see other young people. I was at Zion Riverside Hawker Centre one evening, and ran into a bunch of them – turned out to be Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) students – full of life. They were from the Rotaract Club on an orientation and bonding camp; passionate about their education, passionate about what they are going to do next in Singapore, looking forward to boundless opportunities. When you are young, all possibilities are opened and it is a marvellous feeling. We have a responsibility to them, to make sure they have those opportunities in Singapore.",45,487,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00487

We have invested heavily in them – developing their potential, especially through education, so they can thrive in many places, not just in Singapore. We have educated them, so many of them are going to come out as PMETs (Professionals, Managers, Executives, Technicians). Educating them as PMETs is not so hard. Finding PMET jobs for them to do, to match their education, is not so easy. And in many countries, people come out as PMETs and end up in unskilled jobs because the jobs are not there.

You have to complement them with others who can work with them and that means foreign workers to do jobs, whether it is construction, whether it is as a domestic maid, whether it is in manufacturing, jobs where we do not have Singaporeans and jobs where Singaporeans have graduated out of.

They are part of our global community. It is fine.

The Motion also lays out the priorities and approaches which the Government should take to resolve the current strains on infrastructure, particularly transport; to plan and develop our infrastructure for the future, ahead of demand; to make sure that the benefits from our population policies flow to Singaporeans.",52,494,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00494

There are two clear phases because between now and 2020, we have some clearer idea of what the world will be like; beyond 2020, we have to wait and see. So, between now and 2020, we are slowing down the inflow significantly and we expect to slow down growth significantly. We are reducing the intake of foreign workers; we are moderating the inflow of new citizens and immigrants to top up the population. We are maintaining Permanent Residents' numbers at about the present size, half a million or so. And in my judgement, this is the most viable path for Singapore to balance our different objectives, to slow down our ageing, to make up for the shortfall in our babies and, at the same time, to keep our economy healthy and create jobs and push companies to upgrade.",53,495,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00495

I believe that the total population in 2030 should be significantly below 6.9 million and beyond 2030, in the very long term, it should not increase beyond that.

Couples want to move in to their own flat before they marry and have babies; even if they are registered, they will wait till their house is ready, which means waiting three to four years from now.

I hope that Singaporeans will make families one of their core priorities and would be flexible when thinking how and when they want to start families and how they can fit their families into their lives – flexible in their careers, flexible in their aspirations, flexible in their arrangements – with parents, with in-laws, with childcare centres.

2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Let me share my thoughts. The Singapore Core is really made up of people, of us. People who have our families and homes here; people who embrace our values, ideals, who have sunk roots here, who have given their loyalty to Singapore – for whom when you say the pledge, when you see the helicopter flying past National Day, it is a special moment.",75,517,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00517

Emeritus Senior Minister Goh talked about some recently in this debate  National Service, SARS, the global financial crisis, 9-11. Fears as well as joys; people willing to defend our nation, our families and friends, our way of life because we feel as one together. We share sorrows together even if they are not our own personal and immediate family.

Some will be born elsewhere but have embraced our values and decided to make this their home and nation. Immigrants have been critical to Singapore's success. And over the years, many have embraced Singapore's cause and made important contributions to Singapore, been the fiercest defenders of Singapore and the most able propounders of our cause, pushing our story worldwide. Rajaratnam was just one of them.",80,522,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00522
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"That is how we became a shining red dot. As Mr Rajaratnam said, and many of you have quoted, being Singaporean is not a matter of ancestry; it is conviction and choice. I accept that the situation today is different from what it was at Independence in the 1960s. The founding generation was brought together by an accident of history at a time of great change. They were bound together by a cause of survival and building a nation. Because of them, they built a nation with a distinctive Singaporean identity. So, you can recognise a Singaporean – you do not have to wait for him to speak; you do not have to hear him. You just look at him, see how he walks, his body language – there is something about him that says, ""I know he is one of us."" Not in Singapore but you can be in America, you can be in India, anywhere in the world, he is distinguishable.",81,523,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00523
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Therefore, because we are distinguishable and identify with one another like that, it is harder for a new arrival to come in and become like those who are born and bred here. Never quite the same; the accent will be a bit different; the body language will be a bit different. Over time, the accent maybe will become more like Singlish, especially if you come when you are young. But the first generation immigrant has something not quite the same about him – which is also why he is valuable to us because he or she adds something to us. We still need them to strengthen our core, to reinforce our talent pool and to make lives better for Singaporeans.",82,524,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00524
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"We expect the new citizens to make the effort to integrate into our community, to commit their loyalty to Singapore. Indeed, there are non-Singaporeans who have lived and worked here, who deeply appreciate what Singapore stands for and they want to contribute to the Singapore story by being Singaporeans. They have seen the world; they have seen how things work elsewhere; they have seen how Singapore is and they say, ""Yes, let me make this my home and nation."" I say, we should have a big heart and the open spirit to welcome such people and help them become Singaporean. Let their children grow up in our schools; let their children be part of the next generation of Singaporeans.",83,525,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00525
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"The US has such a philosophy of citizenship. The ideal is the Statue of Liberty and the poem, ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free."" And in fact, they have brought in successive generations of emigres – Irish, Germans, Scandinavians, Polish, Russians, Jews, Asians – and greatly enriched their society, not without difficulty, not without indigestion, sometimes, tensions, but it has made America what it is. It is still not easy and immigration is a vexed issue today – us against them. They cannot get a good immigration law passed in Congress. As Mr Obama says, ""A lot of folks forget that most of us used to be them."" And I think, sometimes, we forget that, ""Most of us used to be them."" But this is the US' great strength compared to many other countries.",84,526,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00526
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Japan is the opposite. Very difficult to absorb immigrants, even people who are partly-Japanese who have lived overseas and come back to Japan do not find it easy to integrate into their society. They have people who are half-Japanese – born of American GI fathers after the war – they could not fit in and they were shipped to live in Brazil, which is a much more mixed and tolerant society. Then, the Japanese were short of population. They brought some of them in to live in Japan and try to integrate – it did not work. In the end, they gave them free one-way aeroplane tickets, and said, ""Please go back to Brazil and please do not come here again."" It is sad but that is the way their society is. One Japanese who is the director of the Japan Immigration Policy Institute says, ""America manages to stay vibrant because it attracts people from all over the world. On the other hand, Japan is content to all but shut out people from overseas.""",85,527,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00527

If you bring in a few hundred thousand of a new ethnic group, there are some who can melt into the population, or there is some corner of America where they can fit in. Singapore is not like that. But Singapore cannot be like Japan either. Otherwise, we will suffer the consequences which Japan is now suffering, and which you have heard discussed over the last few days.",86,528,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00528

2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"Around the Singapore Core, our society will need a pool of transient non-residents – people who come to live and work here for a time, not to retire, not permanently. They serve Singaporeans – build our flats and MRT lines, take care of our elderly, bring skills and experiences that we ourselves lack. This is the other aspect of the problem which vexes people. If the non-residents outnumber the core, then the core asks, ""Are we being diluted?"" And the young Singaporeans – like the young girl whom I met in Teck Ghee market – will ask me this question. I did not give her such a long explanation but after a short explanation, she asked a supplementary question. She said, ""Will there be a Singapore Core in 2030?""",88,530,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00530

I think the numbers do matter. We will track and control the numbers of non-Singaporeans and the inflow of immigrants so that we are not overwhelmed just by the sheer flood of people coming in. Whether the core is strong or not, and how the transients fit in, also depends on the role which the different groups play in Singapore, how they fit into our society.",90,532,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00532
2013-02-08-T-006,Lee Hsien Loong,Mr Lee Hsien Loong,"For example, if a big group of the transients are construction workers here – which is a fact today; I think we have about 250,000 or 300,000 construction workers – temporarily for a project, to do something for us, I do not think that that will weaken the Singapore Core. They are here, they do a job, we are grateful to them, the job is done, they go home. Provided we can house them and transport them suitably and provided that the numbers do not cause problems in our housing estates or in our public transport. If we can manage that, this is a transient population. We are not expecting you to integrate. You are doing a job and we are grateful for what you are doing for us.",91,533,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00533

And thirdly, in our workforce, giving Singaporeans every opportunity to upgrade and take up good jobs and enjoy fair and equal treatment from employers.

We are not an oil state where citizens can live on the oil wealth and non-citizens do the work. For Singapore to thrive, we Singaporeans must always stay lean and hungry. If we lose our drive, we will lose out. Mr Teo Siong Seng, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and others talked about this but I would like to underline this point that there would be privileges to be Singaporeans.

It is going to be a one-time occurrence in our population profile in Singapore. After that, the bulge would have moved through. The senior population in Singapore will stabilise and, eventually, it will decline. But how do we deal with this very large and very fast ageing of our population in Singapore over the next 18 years and still maintain our stability, our economy, our drive and, most importantly, our ability to support these seniors, and make sure they have the life, the dignity that they deserve because they built Singapore?",2,544,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00544

2013-02-08-T-006,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Third, up to 2020, the White Paper is proposing a major shift – a significant slowdown in our rate of workforce and population growth, and GDP growth, compared to the path that we were on. This is a carefully balanced path between two extremes – neither carrying on with the rapid growth rates of the last three decades which would take us beyond our capacity; nor having a freeze which would stall the economy, and be harmful to Singaporeans. Hence, supporting the Motion is supporting making this significant shift, but in a balanced way, and signals that we should not take either extreme.",24,566,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00566

The amended Motion from Mr Liang makes clear that the population projections beyond 2020 are for the purpose of land use and infrastructure planning, and not a population target. The Motion calls for the Government to plan, invest in, and implement infrastructure development ahead of demand. Major infrastructure takes years to build, and once built will be there for decades. Preparing the infrastructure ahead of time and ahead of demand provides Singaporeans with more options in the future. Under-providing will give Singaporeans less flexibility in the future, and risks facing the sort of bottlenecks that we are facing today when plans are not properly aligned and meshed.",25,567,2013-02-08-T-006-S-00567

It started slowly but earnestly, about a year ago, when we started consulting Singaporeans of all ages, from different walks of life. Similarly, the conversation does not end in this room today.

For those who would like to see more discussion and exploration of possibilities, there is no need now to come to a final decision, yes or no. I invite you to keep an open mind as the conversation on the future pathway continues. We must continually review our approach and adapt our strategies depending on Singaporeans' changing social and economic needs, and how our domestic and external circumstances change; while always putting the interests of Singaporeans at the heart of everything that we do.
