2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"When he began his first term of office as the Elected President, the then Senior Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew wrote to him to give this advice  ""Never try to be what you are not. If you can keep this position and tone for the next six years, you will do Singapore proud.""

He also had a most distinguished career in both the trade unions and civil service.",4,4,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00004
2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"The title of his memoirs, ""An Unexpected Journey  Path to the Presidency"", aptly captures the humility and that rare common touch that he so well epitomised but which has escaped many a leader. His is a story of a runaway boy who was determined to return home once he had established himself in life. Working through his wits in the PWD in Muar, Johore, he had his first opportunity to work with the unions, an experience that was to come handy in later years.",5,5,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00005
2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"With a diploma in Social Studies from the University of Malaya, Mr Nathan began his career in the civil service, starting off as a hospital social worker and moving on to become Seamen's Welfare Officer and, later, landing himself in the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees.

2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr S R Nathan's career then took him to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs and then the Ministry of Defence where he was to be the Director of SID, holding the rank of Permanent Secretary.",7,7,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00007
2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"It was during this period that Singaporeans came to know about Mr Nathan when he volunteered himself to be one of the hostages in exchange for the release of the other Singaporeans held by the Japanese and Palestinian terrorists who had hijacked the ferry ""Laju"".",8,8,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00008
2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"After his retirement from the civil service, Mr Nathan joined the Straits Times Press Group to see that the local newspapers were properly managed, developing a core of competent local journalists who could understand Singapore's circumstances and the problem of nation-building.",9,9,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00009
2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"His services to the nation were again needed when he was called upon to assume responsibility as Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia where he defended Singapore's position on many issues, including that of military facilities for the US in Singapore. In his next challenging posting in Washington he robustly defended Singapore's position on the punishment meted out to the American teenager Michael Fay, for acts of vandalism committed in Singapore.",10,10,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00010
2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"After his return from Washington, he was requested to head the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (IDSS).

2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr Nathan's path to the presidency was paved by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. According to Mr Nathan, he received a telephone call from Senior Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew around 11 pm sometime in 1996. He was subsequently told that he was one of those being considered for the presidency. Mr Nathan was elected unopposed and sworn in as our sixth President on 1 September 1999.",12,12,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00012
2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr Nathan had a humble disposition and a deep abiding desire to help the less fortunate in society, which drove him to set up the President's Challenge to involve the community in helping the less fortunate. The President's Challenge is now an established institution and enjoys the strong support and patronage of our current President and all Singaporeans.",13,13,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00013
2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr S R Nathan was equally at home with ordinary citizens and those who held high positions, and always had kind words for everyone, extending help whenever he could.

2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"By any measure, Mr S R Nathan had led an extraordinary life and was an exemplary citizen. I hope that his life story will not just find a place in our history books but will inspire successive generations of Singaporeans. The values that he had held are timeless. His belief in the importance of multi-racialism and his personal journey recording a life filled with hard work, resilience and a deep and abiding love for Singapore, are great lessons for our young. He rose to the occasion every time the nation needed him.",15,15,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00015
2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"When I became Speaker of Parliament in 2013, Mr Nathan sent me a personal, hand-written note in which he said that, ""Nothing gave Mrs Nathan and me greater joy than the news of your appointment as Speaker of Parliament"" and he concluded by saying that he prayed that ""God will be with you as you undertake your new responsibilities"". Such was the measure of the man. He had walked among kings and presidents but he remained fully rooted to the ground, never losing his bearings and keeping his humanity to the end.",16,16,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00016
2016-09-13-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"The House records with deep regret the passing of one of our esteemed sons of Singapore, Mr S R Nathan.

2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Throughout his life, Mr Nathan lived by a simple code based on an unyielding sense of duty to the nation.

This is what Mr Nathan said, reflecting on his path to the presidency.",2,21,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00021
2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Nothing demonstrates this better than the ""Laju"" incident in 1974. Mr Nathan risked his life to lead a team of Singapore officials to accompany the hijackers to Kuwait. Thanks to his courage, quick thinking and calm temperament, the Singaporean hostages were released and no innocent lives were lost. Many Singaporeans were unaware of Mr Nathan's role in this episode until recently. With his passing, he has become a hero for a new generation.",3,22,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00022

2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Time and again, Mr Nathan was entrusted with important responsibilities. He was known as a man who will get the job done. In 1979, when he was appointed Permanent Secretary at the MFA, he was given an ultimatum of two years to raise standards in the Ministry – failing which, the Prime Minister intended to disband MFA and make it a part of the Prime Minister's Department. The Prime Minister was not disappointed. Mr Nathan implemented decisive reforms and set high standards that are still upheld in today's MFA.",6,25,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00025
2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mr Nathan's accomplishments as a diplomat would later hold him in good stead. I had the opportunity to accompany Mr and Mrs Nathan on a State Visit to Japan in 2009. I was impressed by how he won everyone over with his sincerity and easy demeanour, while maintaining the dignity of a Head of State. These qualities were undoubtedly honed over his years in the Foreign Service. But they must ultimately have come from within; from a genuine and authentic place in his heart.",7,26,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00026
2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mr Nathan was a public-spirited man and a leader in the Indian community.

2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mdm Speaker, Mr Nathan is perhaps best remembered for his role as Singapore's third president with Elected President powers, our longest-serving President, serving two terms from 1999 to 2011.",10,29,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00029
2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"As a minority race President, Mr Nathan embodied the best of multi-racial Singapore.

When he was sworn in as President in 1999, he said, ""I will be a President for all Singaporeans, with every community of Singaporeans as my parish"".",11,30,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00030
2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Indeed, Mr Nathan's warm embrace of Singaporeans across different races and religions and all strata of society is what all of us will remember fondly. He connected effortlessly with others from all backgrounds and was a familiar presence at countless events, big and small. He also had a talent for remembering names and faces, including the names of one's family members. He always made time for others, even as he occupied the highest office in the land.",12,31,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00031
2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Another of Mr Nathan's enduring legacies is the President's Challenge. Since 2000, it has raised about $160 million to help the less fortunate.

2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mr Nathan helped steer Singapore through our ups and downs with a steady hand. During his 12-year Presidency, we experienced the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, and recessions in 2001 and 2008. Mr Nathan was focused on the need for Singaporeans to stay united as a people, and forge ahead as one nation.

2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mr Nathan also made important decisions as a steward of our reserves.

Singapore's economy duly recovered, and by 2011, two years after his decision, the Government returned the sum to the past reserves.",16,35,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00035
2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mr Nathan did not make these decisions lightly. He consulted closely with his Council of Presidential Advisers. He would ask questions and express his independent views. His former principal private secretary, Mr Tan Eng Beng, has shared how Mr Nathan would meticulously examine every item put up by the Government before making his decision. In all things, he discharged his duties with the utmost diligence and did full justice to his role as President. Mdm Speaker, I will now say a few words in Mandarin.",17,36,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00036

With his outstanding wit and courage, he managed to protect the safety of Singaporeans. Mr Nathan dedicated himself to the country, and devoted his life to the people. He is a role model for all public servants.",20,39,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00039
2016-09-13-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"When Mr Nathan was sworn in as President, he promised to look after every community in Singapore and to become a President for all Singaporeans. During his 12-year Presidency, Mr Nathan fulfilled this promise impeccably. Coming from a humble background, Mr Nathan constantly had the people's interests at heart. The President's Challenge which he set up in 2000 encourages people to give back to the society.

2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Madam, when Mr S R Nathan shook your hand, you felt his warmth. When shaking your hand, he would often also place his other hand, his left hand on your wrist. It was a warm handshake.",1,49,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00049
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"When there was a person who joined in the group, Mr Nathan would use his left hand to reach out to that person and hold his hand. He would engage two people, holding their hands. He used every fibre in his body to connect with you, and you felt it. He would recall shared memories so as to bring you further into his fold, further into his conversation. You felt cared for. I did. But it was not only warm, fuzzy feelings with Mr Nathan. He made sure you got his point, especially so when he thought standards needed to be improved. In that area, Mr Nathan was a standard bearer.",2,50,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00050
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I remember on a state visit to Istanbul in 2009, Mr Nathan called for a meeting at the end of the trip. We thought it would be an internal debrief with the political delegation accompanying him. It was not. He called for the whole delegation to be present and asked for the representatives from the private sector and the Statutory Boards to be present.",3,51,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00051
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I remember the scene vividly. It was in a small conference room at the hotel we were staying in which overlooked the calm Bosphorus Strait. But Mr Nathan's message was far from calm or serene, he asked why some representatives from the Statutory Boards and companies left the trip early before it ended. He got straight to the issue. I remember him saying, ""You may think the socials aren't important, but they are important. Staying back discussing and engaging with your hosts are how we make Singapore relevant. I have come here to do that. Send this message back to those who left the trip early.""",4,52,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00052
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Although the political delegation was not Mr Nathan's target audience, his message was nonetheless relevant to us. The point he was making was this  on national duties, you better give it your best. Nothing less is sufficient. That is what standard bearers do. They maintain standards for a cause. Mr Nathan's cause was Singapore.",5,53,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00053
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In a military battle, a standard bearer is a soldier who bears the colours, the flag of the formation or the army. For as long as that flag flies, it means that there is a man carrying it and the whole force deploys itself toward a common goal – victory. In so doing, the force of soldiers musters all its capability to live up to the highest standards it has come to require of itself. Nothing short of its best.",6,54,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00054
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The force that Singapore is, and her Singaporeans, require high standards of ourselves, because we have had a band of standard bearers who soldiered ahead of us, leading by example. In that band were men like Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr Hon Sui Sen. In my view, Mr S R Nathan is part of that original band of men. These men set the standards early.",7,55,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00055
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"What then is our role as Members in this House, as Singaporeans in our workplaces, or as Singaporeans in our homes or abroad? It is to maintain these standards and improve them. Then, these standards become living standards, not set in stones or in history, but standards that are alive and shapeable.",8,56,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00056
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Madam, like many Members of this House, I had the privilege of listening to President Nathan's Addresses at the Opening of a new Parliament or after it had been prorogued. Some longer serving Members would have heard Mr Nathan speak in this House more times than I have. For Mr Nathan served in office for a term longer than any other President. I studied his Addresses, five in total – one before the turn of the century, four after. Those speeches were key landmarks on the trajectories of governmental policy as we moved into the 21st century and through to 2011.",9,57,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00057
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"True to his own beliefs, the Addresses always harked back to the need for policy to positively impact the Singaporean, his family and the opportunities. In fact, Mr Nathan stated in his 1999 Address to this House, ""People will be the major focus of my Government's policy for our citizens to develop their full potential"". He then addressed the idea of differing views, exhorted us to debate, but, and here I quote, ""always with a view to determining what is best for Singapore"".",10,58,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00058
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Those Presidential Addresses were important, but also of significance was the Debate we had in this House in 2009 to draw $4.9 billion from past reserves to help fund the Resilience Package to preserve jobs and businesses during the massive Financial Crisis.",11,59,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00059
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The ballast of the man, as well as the moral authority of his Office, were significant in giving me the assurance that Mr Nathan would not turn the second key unless he was convinced of the merits of the Resilience Package. Both keys must suffer the scrutiny of an Election or a potential Election. That gives mandate moral authority.",12,60,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00060

Singapore got out of the rut sooner than expected. In fact, in his 2009 Address to Parliament, Mr Nathan stated  ""We could take decisive measures to help companies and workers to save jobs, we did not have to borrow. Having steadily built up reserves, we could draw on them and with my approval, fund the Jobs Credit scheme and Special Risk-Sharing Initiative"".",13,61,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00061

2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Singaporean-Eurasian community felt part of his plot. We never felt small with him. He was completely at ease in a Eurasian setting, he visited and engaged the community often at the Eurasian Community House and loved Eurasian food, especially our Almond Sugee Cake for dessert. It was a historical camaraderie. Many Eurasians served alongside him in the civil service and in the security services, especially in the early years of Independence, but he was also focused on the future of the community, especially in ensuring Eurasian school-going children were doing well.",15,63,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00063
2016-09-13-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"At one meeting, Mr Nathan told the community, ""Please ensure that no Eurasian child is deprived of a proper education"". He went on to say, ""if there was a finance issue, inform me and I will help to source funds"". Indeed, he did. He learnt of a family who needed help beyond what the Eurasian Association was already providing – a mother, widowed, sole breadwinner, three children. Mr Nathan asked if he could personally help the family. He paid towards the first child's University fees for three years and asked to donate in advance for the second sibling who was just completing National Service. The family was deeply touched.

At just after 10 pm, someone at the neighbouring table showed me her phone, carrying the news that President S R Nathan had passed away. My immediate thoughts were  how typical of him. August had been an extremely busy month for national events, what with the National Day Parade and celebrating our athletes' achievements at the Rio Olympics. It may have been a sheer coincidence, but he passed away just after the National Day Rally, as if to ensure that his death would not disrupt the national calendar nor pose an inconvenience to the country's leaders.",1,68,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00068

When Singapore was forced out of Malaysia in 1965, the survival and future of Singapore was by no means assured. During Mr Nathan's time in the Ministry of the Interior and Defence (MID), he and my father got to know each other, as my father was in the first batch of officers in a very young army. They and their colleagues work voraciously alongside the late Dr Goh Keng Swee to build our defences and lay the foundation for Singapore to stand tall in the world. I was a young child then. I would occasionally go with my father to army camps and wait for him while he worked on such matters.",2,69,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00069

Working together in those testing times, must have built lasting bonds among the Pioneer Generation. I understood recently from a mutual friend of theirs, that while Mr Nathan and my father were quite different in temperament, they, nevertheless, enjoyed very cordial relations founded on mutual respect.

Out of nowhere, one of the senior management called me on the phone frantically and asked, ""Where are you now? The President has requested to talk to you."" I went over and met President Nathan, much to the relief of the event organisers who generally do not like surprises. And what did the President want? Nothing more than to say ""Hello"" and to spend a few moments together shooting the breeze.",5,72,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00072

2016-09-13-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"On one such occasion, one of the lunch group was sharing some observations he had made about political leaders in another country he had just visited. This person had concluded that one of the ministers there was not up to the mark, as the minister had remained silent throughout an official meeting with Singapore's high level delegation. This drew a swift rebuttal from President Nathan, who proceeded to give all of us a primer into the way governmental power was organised in that particular country, and why a minister there would deliberately remain silent in certain contexts. By the time lunch was over, President Nathan had not only shown his depth of world view but had simultaneously put some of us in our places, diplomatically of course.",7,74,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00074

When his body was lying in state at Parliament House on 25 August, the Workers' Party Members of Parliament queued to pay our respects. We were then kindly marshalled to meet Mrs Nathan who was sitting behind the screen. When Mrs Nathan saw Mr Low Thia Khiang, she queried, ""Can I ask you a question? Were you a teacher?"" Apparently she had been having arguments with her husband over this, and wanted to clarify the matter once and for all.

His passing, however, was also an opportunity to remember his immense courage in the service of Singapore. Specifically, his role and that of his compatriots in the ""Laju"" incident bears witness to traits any young Singaporean would look up to proudly.",1,78,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00078

I went to the stadium with my wife and as we walked along the grandstand section, I heard some voices calling out. It took a while to confirm where they were coming from. I was surprised to see President Nathan, who was chatting with the then Minister in charge of Sports, Mr Lawrence Wong. As I made my way to where President Nathan was seated, the President joked that having recently gotten married I appeared to be more interested to sit alone with my wife, and had therefore chosen to ignore him when he was calling out to me! I protested of course. President Nathan smiled, took my hand and invited my wife and I to sit next to him.",2,79,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00079
2016-09-13-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Throughout the match, President Nathan did not make things intimidating or uncomfortable. He would occasionally lean over to query why the referee had made a certain decision or why play was being stopped when a tackle or infringement seemed innocuous. A telling moment, however, came when Johor, who were already leading from an early goal, nearly extended their lead as the Lions pressed for an equaliser. As the stadium gasped, President Nathan with the critical eye of a coach, pointed out to me the Lions XII player who lost concentration and was dispossessed of the ball close to the middle of the pitch. It was an eyebrow raising observation because 10 or 15 passes has elapsed between the player he was referring to losing possession and the chance that was created by the Johor team. In a very different context and in a rather unanticipated way, I bore witness to his eye for detail and his ability to focus on the issues that mattered, traits for which he was widely known for in the public service.",3,80,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00080
2016-09-13-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The most unforgettable incident of the night came shortly before the game ended when President Nathan's words were marked by a palpable seriousness. He said, ""You must always look after the interests of Singaporeans and Singapore."" At no point did he raise any doubts or concerns about serving Singapore in a different colour, cause or capacity. It was clear what motivated him all his life. President Nathan's simple words and the lyrics of his favourite Tamil Song, ""Taking Sand from Tanjore"", which was played at his State Funeral, remind us that regardless of our differences, we are one people and must remain so.",4,81,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00081

Did he not fear for his safety? Did he not worry for his family with young children? How heroic! From his wheelchair, his reply was matter of fact, understated and brief. He said he was not a hero.

This vision drove him to go beyond merely assisting trade unions to become a front-liner in championing workers' interests. He was shaped by his days looking after the welfare of sailors. He felt keenly the suffering that befell sailors and their families. Importantly, he got things done. He did it by achieving resolutions through being a good judge of people and the disputes at hand, coupled with some ingenuity and quick decision-making.",3,113,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00113
2016-09-13-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"It was Mr Nathan's knack for getting things done that led our former Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew to second him to the Labour Research Unit. It was an autonomous unit in 1962, to help unions that broke away from their pro-communist affiliations and joined the National Trades Union Congress. It was a time of upheaval, rife with pro-communist elements. He had to navigate the choppy waters. He tactfully worked alongside union leaders and workers. He alternated with ease from standing upfront to manage difficult relations to entering into discussions with employers behind the scenes, at great personal danger of being labelled a betrayer. The LRU was subsequently absorbed into the NTUC in 1965.",4,114,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00114
2016-09-13-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Nathan was more than just a champion of workers' rights. He also understood deeply how labour relations underpinned the success of a young Singapore. In the 1960s, Dr Goh Keng Swee was trying to attract foreign investment. Assisting Jurong Shipyard, a joint venture involving Japan's Ishikawajima-Harima Industries and Economic Development Board, Mr Nathan negotiated to establish a fair and efficient wage structure. Without any precedent, he combed through countless collective agreements filed with the Industrial Arbitration Court to work out a structure that both the union and employers accepted. This structure paved the way to properly-regulated working conditions and terms of employment for workers. It laid the foundation of wage structure, applicable even today. This episode shifted the Labour Movement's mindset. Our union leaders realised that they had a vital role to play in the economic growth of Singapore.",5,115,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00115
2016-09-13-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Nathan recognised that it was crucial for the trade union movement and NTUC to build a core of Industrial Relations Officers to assist unions if they were to effectively play its role in the nation's success. He painstakingly took the time to identify and train IROs, and arranged meetings between foreign university professors and the NTUC. Such groundwork eventually paved the way to the formation of the Singapore Institute of Labour Studies, now known as the Ong Teng Cheong Labour Leadership Institute. Today, unionists and IROs are very well-equipped to rally to the labour cause and safeguard the interests of working people in Singapore.",6,116,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00116

2016-09-13-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Nathan was also one of the key persons who were instrumental in the Modernisation Seminar in 1969, which charted the future of the labour movement as we see today. At the seminar, he advocated for ""the need for financial autonomy, leadership and structural development"" of the Labour Movement. This led to the introduction of a ""check-off"" system for the collection of union dues and helped to standardise monthly union subscription rates.",8,118,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00118
2016-09-13-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Nathan defined what an effective unionist should be as well.

When he visited NTUC ten years ago, he spoke passionately on the early struggles of LRU and the Labour Movement. He reminded labour leaders on the larger national and worker interests they had to protect. He called on the union leaders to prepare our workers on the consequences of globalisation, the changing nature of the workplace, and of work itself.",10,120,2016-09-13-T-001-S-00120
2016-09-13-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Earlier this year, he visited NTUC again. Once again, he encouraged union leaders to stay rooted to the cause; be close to the ground and change with the times with an eye for the future.

2016-09-13-T-003,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, since 2005 by MUIS and Pergas, the Singapore Islamic Scholars and Religious Teachers Association, the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS) currently recognises 1,805 asatizahs, which is about 80% of those providing Islamic education in Singapore. It is an inclusive system that recognises asatizahs from various schools of thought, so long as they meet the standards and training requirements set by the Asatizah Recognition Board (ARB), which comprises senior asatizahs.",1,135,2016-09-13-T-003-S-00135
2016-09-13-T-003,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"In January 2015, the ARS was enhanced with the introduction of a further requirement for ARS asatizahs to attain ARS renewal every three years by completing 30 hours of training. This training requirement is part of a larger Continuous Professional Education (CPE) programme for our asatizahs. The courses within the CPE programme support the professional development of our asatizahs and help update them on contemporary issues and challenges related to the socio-religious life of our Malay/Muslim community. Through this, our ARS asatizahs are better equipped to serve and retain the confidence of the community.",2,136,2016-09-13-T-003-S-00136

With effect from 1 January 2017, all asatizahs who provide religious guidance and Islamic education will be required to be under the ARS. MUIS and Pergas will continue to reach out and offer additional training to those who do not yet qualify under the ARS to facilitate their registration.

In fact, it was proposed by senior asatizahs more than a decade ago but our focus at that time was on developing a suite of quality ARS programmes to benefit our asatizahs. It is important that our asatizahs have recognised these benefits for themselves and see the value of the ARS. Now, with the asatizah fraternity's strong support and the calls from community leaders for mandatory ARS, the time is right to strengthen the ARS further.",4,138,2016-09-13-T-003-S-00138

The Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) already provides MUIS with broad powers, but we will provide for additional measures, if necessary.",5,139,2016-09-13-T-003-S-00139

Yet, at the same time, we must also educate the public on which teachers are to be engaged and also which should not. So, the list of ARS teachers is already made available online. We hope that parents who want to run home classes will engage those who are already on the list.

2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The Silver Support Scheme is the latest addition to the third tier of support. In other words, it is only meant for the minority of seniors. It is targeted mainly at the bottom 20% of elderly Singaporeans aged 65 and above, with a smaller degree of support extended to up to the next 10% of seniors. Specifically, we identify them as seniors who not only have little or no family support currently in their retirement years, but also did not manage to save enough for their retirement because they earned low wages over their prime working years.",5,180,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00180
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,The eligibility criteria for Silver Support were announced by the Finance Minister at Budget 2016. The first criterion is total CPF contributions made during prime working years until the age of 55.,6,181,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00181
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Wages were generally low in the early years of Singapore's economic development. As a result, a vast majority of our workers earned low wages during their younger days. Notwithstanding the changes in CPF contribution rates over the years, a majority of our seniors, in fact, about two-thirds of them, have total CPF contributions of $70,000 or less when they turned 55. Among these two-third seniors, some owned smaller homes with less scope to monetise their assets and some currently continue to have lesser family support and lower household income.",7,182,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00182
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"By combining the three criteria of total CPF contributions capped at $70,000, home ownership of 4-room HDB flat or smaller, or living in 5-room flat or smaller, and lastly, household monthly income per person of not more than $1,100, we ensure that Silver Support goes to those seniors who need more help than the others. One hundred and forty thousand of them received their first Silver Support payouts in July 2016.",8,183,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00183
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"To help our seniors better understand the new scheme, we have set up a Silver Support website for them to check their eligibility and get clarifications on frequently asked questions. Seniors can also call the Silver Support hotline or visit any of the CPF Service Centres. To date, CPF Board has handled more than 28,000 enquiries.",9,184,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00184
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"We also disseminate information and distribute brochures on Silver Support through the grassroots network such as the Community Centres.

2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"So far, CPF Board has received about 2,300 appeals for Silver Support. Among the cases processed, some have been rejected because these seniors have far exceeded the thresholds of the three criteria. Some cases have been approved because the seniors' circumstances have changed in the last 15 months and they now meet all the three criteria. There were also some marginal cases where seniors narrowly missed out on one criterion, but met the other criteria by a big margin. For such appeals, we consider their circumstances in total and decide on a case-by-case basis. However, the majority of the appeal cases are still pending because CPF Board is waiting for the appellants to provide additional information and documents for us to reassess their eligibility.",11,186,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00186

It complements the extensive range of support schemes for our seniors. Seniors who do not qualify for Silver Support but require financial assistance can approach any Social Service Office for help. As the Minister for Finance said at Budget 2016, and I quote, ""the majority of our seniors, even if they do not qualify for Silver Support, will continue to benefit from substantial existing support schemes"".",12,187,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00187
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Just to ask a couple of supplementary questions. I have residents who said that their children are staying with them to help look after them because they are advance in age and then because their children are staying with them, their household income have exceeded the requirement for the scheme. The solution seems to be to ask the children to shift out and that seems to defeat the purpose of having children look after the elderly. Would the Ministry consider situations like these, where the children stay to look after their parents but their income should not be included because they are doing it as a matter of filial piety.",1,188,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00188
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Secondly, in respect of Minister's reply about having a website or hotline, many of the recipients are actually above 65, I think that they probably do not have ability to go to the website. Is CPF Board open to having, say, open houses at community centres to do better outreach to try to better explain to the seniors who do not really understand what this scheme is about? Many of my residents do tell me that they feel disadvantaged because their neighbours get it and they do not.",2,189,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00189
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, on the first question about seniors staying with their children and because of the higher income of the children, as a result, the seniors do not qualify for Silver Support because they exceeded the per capita household income of more than $1,100. The solution is not for the children or the senior to move out of the house, the solution is for the children to continue to take care of the senior.",1,190,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00190
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The second point about the outreach, website and hotline, I agree with the Member. In fact, we discovered that as well. Most of the seniors would come to CPF Service Centres. At the same time, we are also arranging a series of community outreach. Many of the PA staff are equipped with the information. I am also happy to say that quite a number of our grassroots advisers are also helping to bring the information out there to the community.",2,191,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00191
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In short, I think in cases whereby if the senior does not meet the requirements, we will look at it from a total perspective. If the children are of a higher income group and if they exceeded the per capita household income criterion by a big margin, those cases are likely to be rejected. But if they are marginal cases where the number of persons in the household is small, for example, a mother living with a son and the son actually is earning only about, say, $2,500. If this is divided by two persons, the per capita income becomes $1,250, which exceeds the requirement. In those cases, we will look at it from a total perspective and would consider it on a case-by-case basis. In any case, I hope that the children or the seniors do not move out of the house. They should continue to live together and take care of each other.",3,192,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00192
2016-09-13-T-007,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Madam. In line with what Minister has mentioned about whether the children should stay at home to continue to look after the senior, could the Minister explain why we are just including the income of children who live with the seniors and not the children who are not living with the seniors? We seem to suggest that children should only look after their parents if they live with the parents. So, could the Minister clarify on this, please?",1,193,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00193
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, whether the children live with the seniors, we hope they will all take care of the seniors. Mr Louis Ng asked the point, if I get him right, is that why is it when we compute the per capita household income, we included only children who live with the seniors and we do not include children who do not live with the seniors. This means not so much using per capita household income but per capita family income as a criterion. In other words, we look at it as a family, whether the children are staying together or not and so on.",1,194,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00194
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"I think, on the whole, no outcome is perfect and so one of the key considerations of this scheme is that we would like to make the scheme as convenient for the seniors as possible. For example, under the Silver Support Scheme, the seniors need not apply for the scheme. On the per capita household income, we are able to gather the information through various sources but that should not rule out, who knows, one day in the future, when we have enhanced our information network, we may one day evolve towards per capita family income basis. But as of now we do it on a per capita household income. And let me emphasise, again. For cases if, indeed, the seniors feel that they deserve special consideration, help them to put up an appeal and, as I mentioned, we will look at the three criteria in totality. If they do not qualify based on the per capita household income criterion, but if we take into consideration the other two criteria, if we feel that, on the whole, they deserve that extra help, we will extend the Silver Support to them.",2,195,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00195
2016-09-13-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Just a supplementary question. For those who qualify for Silver Support, the criteria, are they subject to review annually or is it set for life?",1,196,2016-09-13-T-007-S-00196
2016-09-13-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"I thank Member for the question. The eligibility for Silver Support is reviewed annually.

2016-09-13-T-008,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Allow me to first emphasise that every suicide, whether amongst youths, the middle aged or the elderly, is one too many. It is very sad and we should endeavour to prevent them when we can. A number of local studies have been done on suicide in the young. The common reasons for teen suicides in Singapore are interpersonal relationship and family issues, as well as social stressors.",1,205,2016-09-13-T-008-S-00205
2016-09-13-T-008,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As the causes of suicides are often complex and multi-faceted, we do want to take a whole-of-Government approach in dealing with suicides in the young. These include efforts from agencies such as the Ministry of Health, the Institute of Mental Health, the Health Promotion Board, the Ministry of Education, and my Ministry.",2,206,2016-09-13-T-008-S-00206
2016-09-13-T-008,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Psychological resilience is crucial when youths face circumstances that overwhelm them. Within the school environment, HPB runs a series of psycho-emotional programmes to equip students with skills to manage stress and emotions, build positive and supportive relationships with peers, and recognise when and where to seek help. Students may also be referred to school counsellors, community agencies and mental health professionals such as the Child Guidance Clinic in the Institute of Mental Health, where necessary. Parents are alerted when required. MOE will further elaborate on its strategy to care for the socio-emotional well-being of students.",3,207,2016-09-13-T-008-S-00207
2016-09-13-T-008,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Outside of the schools, there is a strong network of community partners that have important roles in preventing teen suicide. Healthcare and social service professionals are trained to identify and intervene appropriately when they come into contact with higher-risk individuals, such as those with a history of suicidal and self-harming behaviours. The Samaritans of Singapore or SOS conducts programmes to teach teenagers how to identify suicide warning signs and where to seek help.",4,208,2016-09-13-T-008-S-00208
2016-09-13-T-008,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"SOS also runs a 24-hour crisis hotline, manned by trained adult volunteers, to counsel persons in distress. Counselling such persons requires relevant training, skills, emotional maturity and understanding of life's challenges. I think it would not be reasonable to expect teenagers to possess all these pre-requisites to take crisis calls. For better awareness and dedication of resources, there should be just one hotline for such calls. Teenagers can play a role, certainly as friends, as fellow students, to look out for tell-tale signs. Or if we are concerned about the well-being of our friends, do let our teachers know or let the family know.",5,209,2016-09-13-T-008-S-00209

The Minister mentioned the strategies that have been taken holistically by cross-agencies to address the teen suicide across the country. I was wondering how far away is Singapore compared to international best practices in terms of handling of teen suicide? In Britain, for example, they have a teen suicide prevention strategy and how far away we are from there? Are we moving towards that sort of strategy or campaign to address the teen suicide problem?",1,212,2016-09-13-T-008-S-00212

We are working with the various agencies. Our numbers, admittedly, while they are low, like I said, every suicide case is one too many. We have been tracking the numbers over the years. They have been relatively stable, fluctuating in the last 10 years. For example, in 2015, the numbers were a bit higher but no discernible patterns as of now. We are coming together to undertake a deeper study to understand whether there are new developments.

As teachers are always viewed as authority over these vulnerable young people, what sort of formal training do they have to ensure an informed and sensitive understanding of depression, other mental health difficulties and counselling?",1,214,2016-09-13-T-008-S-00214

They will be following up with a response subsequently but I would say that it would not be fair to highlight one specific example to reflect how our teachers approach these issues generally. I think teachers are trained, as far as possible, to pick up some of these concerns. When these are flagged out in students, the teachers generally would refer them to the counsellors. There is a system in place in MOE.",1,215,2016-09-13-T-008-S-00215

I just have one point to suggest to Ministry of Manpower on the collation of retrenchment statistics. It is to pay more attention to some of these cases where they are ""disguised retrenchments"", meaning they may have, through ""golden handshake"" or some voluntary withdrawal service, laid off people in small numbers without notice of the public or even within the companies. I think we should pay particular attention to these small numbers of disguised retrenchments so that we accurately reflect the retrenchment situation.",1,242,2016-09-13-T-010-S-00242

Firstly, can I confirm in terms of the survey questions and the survey language, when we talk about retrenchment benefits, are these over and above the payment for notice, that is the salary that is paid for serving notice or the salary that is paid in lieu of serving notice. Is the retrenchment benefit as defined in the survey over and above that?",1,244,2016-09-13-T-010-S-00244

2016-09-13-T-010,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, on the first point, whether this payment is above the payment for notice pay, the answer is yes. On the issue of industry norm, the Tripartite Partners do issue the tripartite guidelines and these industry norm of two weeks to one month is actually in the guideline.

If it is not, can we make it compulsory for them to notify so that we know the exact statistics and do something about it if non-payment is made?",1,248,2016-09-13-T-010-S-00248
2016-09-13-T-010,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, first of all let me separate the two issues of notification with statistics.

So what we did was since early this year, we have established a tripartite retrenchment response workforce, comprising of e2i, WDA, MOM and NTUC as well.

At the same time, the CSP is also especially designed for mid-career PMETs aged 40 and above.

With regard to the Professional Conversion Programme and it is across 11 industries or sectors, are there any plans to increase the cap of $4,000? Because we have increased numbers of PMETs who are older and generally, their income will probably be higher as we go on and there will be increasing numbers of PMETs who are older who would be unemployed? Are there any plans to increase the cap of $4,000?",1,271,2016-09-13-T-012-S-00271

That is the reason why besides the PCP which has been around for a few years, last year, in October, we have also introduced the CSP. Under the CSP, we are able to provide wage support for salary ranges from $4,000 to $7,000. So, in short, matured PMETs can be supported under our programmes through a combination of both the PCP and the CSP.",1,272,2016-09-13-T-012-S-00272

2016-09-13-T-013,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"This is the reason behind the implementation of Workfare Income Supplement and Training Support for all lower wage workers, and likewise, the use of policy levers to implement the Progressive Wage Model in the cleaning, security and landscaping sectors.

For example, the Progressive Wage Model is today a ladder of minimum wage points. We are working to transform it to become a ladder of wage ranges so as to provide more scope for wage growth for our low-wage workers. This will help prevent wage stagnation at the various wage points, a common challenge faced by other countries with minimum wage policies.",7,280,2016-09-13-T-013-S-00280
2016-09-13-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I thank the Minister for his answer.

I am aware that, as the Minister had mentioned just now, the range of policies that Singapore has undertaken  the Progressive Wage Model, the transfers and also the transformation of the economy and creating jobs for the future. But there is a sustainable manner in which we want to undertake over the long term, in terms of addressing the income inequality in a longer term strategy perspective. What other measures can there be – are you concerned about a potential risk of rising inequality from global trends that may actually impact Singapore even though we have not seen it at the moment?

I am happy to say that the approach adopted by Singapore has drawn some interest from the other countries because having implemented minimum wage for a long time, many countries have found that they have not found a way to help the low-wage workers to break away from this wage stagnation at the bottom. They have expressed interest in what Singapore is doing under our Progressive Wage Model.",2,283,2016-09-13-T-013-S-00283
2016-09-13-T-013,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Let me emphasise again that the implementation of Progressive Wage Model in Singapore is still at its early days. There is still a lot of room for us to strengthen it further. For example, in the case of the cleaning sector, we are now talking about transforming the ladder of minimum wage point into a ladder of wage ranges, so that there will be more scope for our cleaners to see their wages moving up within the wage range. This is something that the Tripartite Committee on Cleaners is now working on.",3,284,2016-09-13-T-013-S-00284

2016-09-13-T-013,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In other words, we are not stopping at this Progressive Wage Model in terms of the basic framework but rather, we are still looking for ways to further sustain that. Our aim is to ensure that the wage increase at the P20 level in the coming years will be at least be able to keep up with that of the median wage, if not, higher. I think this is something that the NTUC, the Labour Movement have been calling for, for the past few years. At MOM, we share the same commitment. I think the employers are with us as well. There is no easy way forward, but I believe that the tripartite partners working together must find a way to sustain the wage increase at the low-wage worker level.",5,286,2016-09-13-T-013-S-00286

2016-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"asked	 the Prime Minister given SGX's challenges in recent years relating to the quantity and quality of listings, turnover, technical disruptions, risk management, including a half-day disruption on 14 July 2016 (a) whether the Government is optimistic that SGX's performance and reputation can be revived; (b) what role it sees for SGX in broader economic development; and (c) what steps it is taking to work with the SGX management to catalyse the desired outcomes.",1,292,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00292
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"Mdm Speaker, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) has indeed faced a number of challenges in recent years. Some of them are not unique to SGX or Singapore. Globally, there has been a significant decline in Initial Public Offering (IPO) activity, including in markets like the US and Hong Kong. A weak economic outlook and heightened market volatility have been cited as reasons for this lacklustre IPO activity. The rise of alternative private financing markets, offering comparable scale and pricing, also poses increasing competition to public stock exchanges globally. There are other challenges faced by SGX more particularly, such as low levels of liquidity and many poorly performing counters. While its derivatives business remains among the most dynamic in Asia, its cash equity business has lost some ground to competitors.",1,293,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00293
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"SGX has embarked on several initiatives to strengthen and develop the stock market, with the support of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). A key priority of SGX is to raise the quality of listings. The entry bar for companies seeking to list on the Mainboard has been raised. A minimum trading price was introduced to address risks associated with low-priced securities and to improve overall market quality. Three independent Listing Committees were established last year to strengthen the process for admitting new listings and enforcing against listing rule breaches. In July, SGX announced plans to transfer its regulatory functions to a subsidiary company which will focus exclusively on the task and would be governed by a separate and independent Board.",2,294,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00294
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"SGX is also adapting to competition from alternative private financing markets. Recently, it partnered Clearbridge Accelerator, one of Singapore's leading venture capital and incubation firms, to set up Capbridge, a securities-based crowd-funding platform. Capbridge may also contribute to SGX's IPO pipeline by incubating and providing last-mile funding to high-tech companies before the IPO stage.",3,295,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00295
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),It will take time for SGX's initiatives to bear fruit. But some improvements can be seen. IPO activity has increased in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year.,4,296,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00296
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),A second area that needs improvement is the management of technology and operational risks. It is not uncommon for exchanges to experience trading disruptions. System failures and trading halts have occurred in several major exchanges in recent years. But SGX needs to do better in reducing the frequency of these disruptions and in managing any disruptions well. It is taking this seriously. MAS is closely supervising SGX's progress in enhancing the resilience of its systems and recovery processes and in engaging stakeholders effectively.,5,297,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00297
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"Thirdly, SGX is creating new business opportunities, by building on its strengths. For example, it has the largest listed Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) and Business Trusts sector in Asia, excluding Japan, and continues to attract such listings from local and foreign sponsors. SGX plans to launch its first exchange-traded fund for Singapore REITs in the later part of this year.",6,298,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00298

It expanded its Nifty suite of futures contracts in June this year. The exchange is growing its capabilities in foreign exchange (FX) derivatives, and is collaborating with a leading electronic trading platform in FX to offer block FX futures in the later part of this year.",7,299,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00299
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"To summarise, SGX is not sitting still.

2016-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have three questions for the Acting Minister. Earlier in his answer, he mentioned that the MAS is closely supervising SGX's efforts to build IT resilience. I would like to ask him a little bit more about what MAS is doing in that respect, and what are the options or levers open to MAS in its dealings with SGX, to either incentivise or to give some pressure to SGX to resolve this IT problem.",1,301,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00301
2016-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"My second question is, notwithstanding what the Acting Minister said about falling trading volumes worldwide, it was reported that from 2011 to 2015, the value of shares traded per day on SGX had fallen by a third over these last four years. I would like to ask the Acting Minister whether he thinks that is a cause for concern.",2,302,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00302
2016-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),My third question is I understand that some Singapore companies are choosing not to list themselves locally but are going to regional bourses to list. Has SGX or even the Government looked into the reasons why they do not find listing in Singapore attractive?,3,303,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00303
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. On IT resilience, I would say that it is totally in SGX's interest to make sure that it performs well. There is no agency issues here, where the interests of MAS or the economy or the Government are different from the SGX's. Therefore, it is totally in their interest to make sure that it performs well. MAS will supervise that closely. The Member would recall that when the disruption happened on 14 July, within five days, by 19 July, SGX came out, explained what the technical issues were that led to the breakdown, and took it very seriously. I think it was last week that they had started a new industry working group. This will engage all industry experts and stakeholders as a working group to seriously look into these issues. They will study all the responses that are needed to make sure that if and when such disruptions happen again, SGX can respond more effectively and in a more timely manner to minimise the disruption. They are all taking this very seriously. MAS is watching this closely. Let us wait for the work of the industry working group.",1,304,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00304
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On the other two questions, I would perhaps answer them together. One is the fall in the trading volume from 2011 to 2015. It is source for concern because it is also a global phenomenon. On the other hand, we also recognise that SGX and IPO activity might have come down, but on the other hand, financing activities are coming up globally. For example, angel invest funds, private equity funds, REITs – all these continue to do very well, including crowd-funding. Crowd-financing platforms are also coming up. Notwithstanding one area of the financial sector maybe facing lacklustre performance, overall, the financial sector can actually continue to do well.",2,305,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00305
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The analogy is not very different from let us say, taxis. On the one hand, traditional cabs may be feeling the squeeze but on the other hand, commuters are benefiting from other options of commuting such as Uber and Grab.",3,306,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00306
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This is what we are seeing, too, in the financial sector. Innovation is coming onboard; we are seeing different kinds of financing options; and these will still serve the Singapore market and Singapore economy fairly well.",4,307,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00307
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Within SGX, I would say that there are pockets that are still doing very well. I mentioned in my reply earlier that in the first half of this year, IPO activity went up, more than last year – 16 listings in the first half of this year compared to 11 last year. Things are looking up. If you look at specific clusters or counters, such as technology stocks or healthcare stocks, we are actually performing well. REITs as well are performing well.",5,308,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00308
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"All in all, jobs are also at stake here. We will do our best to prop up this sector as well as we can. If anyone requires skills upgrading, we also have the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF), so those in the financial sector can continue to upgrade their skills so that the sector will continue to do well.",6,309,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00309
2016-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Mdm Speaker, just to follow up, I think the Acting Minister did not touch on my question about Singapore companies that choose not to list locally, whether SGX or Government has monitored the reasons why.",1,310,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00310
2016-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Secondly, just to understand a little bit more again about MAS' role, especially in terms of IT resilience. In the past, when the first two glitches happened in 2014, there were very strong statements made by Government leaders, in fact, saying that this is unacceptable coming from SGX. When this recent incident in July 2016, there were observers expecting that MAS might consider the option of fining SGX. I would like to understand whether those are options that MAS is looking at or has it ruled these out? Or what are the levers available to MAS?",2,311,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00311
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On Singapore companies listing overseas, I think this will have to be left as their business strategy. Some Singapore companies list on regional bourses maybe because their businesses are there. So, they will make their decisions. What we need to do is make sure that our stock exchange is also competitive, and so foreign companies can also list here. We have to position ourselves as part of the landscape so that it is not very different from other businesses. Some go overseas, some come here. We must maintain our position. That is what we are doing.",1,312,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00312
2016-09-13-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for the technical disruption, MAS takes it very seriously. As I mentioned earlier, the industry working group will come up with their recommendations. Let us look at what they come up with, what are the steps. I think it is much more important to look forward, to make sure that we have a resilient, responsive SGX system. We take it very seriously and we certainly do not want to see another one, but unfortunately, around the region, around the world, technical disruptions do happen from time to time. We want to make sure that when it happens, if it ever happens, we will respond to it as fast as we can.",2,313,2016-09-13-T-014-S-00313
2016-09-13-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked	 the Prime Minister (a) how many financial institutions have been investigated from 2013 to 2016 for bypassing loan restrictions on motor vehicles; and (b) whether there are any plans to tighten the regulations to effectively authenticate the purchase price of motor vehicles stated in the loan agreements.,1,314,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00314
2016-09-13-T-015,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),Financial institutions (FIs) regulated by MAS are required to ascertain the reasonableness of the stated purchase prices of motor vehicles quoted in loan applications. They have in place policies and procedures to do so. These procedures include obtaining multiple motor vehicle valuations from independent sources and comparing them against price lists published by authorised dealers.,1,315,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00315
2016-09-13-T-015,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"As part of MAS' ongoing supervision, MAS monitors FIs' compliance with rules and regulations, including through on-site inspections. Since the motor financing rules were reintroduced in 2013, MAS has not had to take any regulatory actions against FIs. There is hence also no immediate need to tighten the regulations.",2,316,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00316
2016-09-13-T-015,Ong Ye Kung,The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"It is also in the interest of an FI to ensure that motor vehicles are appropriately valued so that loans are adequately collateralised and comply with MAS' financing rules. However, where an FI is found in breach of any of our regulations, MAS will not hesitate to take regulatory action.",3,317,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00317
2016-09-13-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Two follow-up questions, Mdm Speaker. From 26 May this year, MAS stated that the revised Loan-to-Value ratio and loan tenures will be extended to motor vehicle financing on a hire-purchase basis. Prior to the latest set of regulations, it was widely reported that MAS' curbs of 2013 were being breached quite blatantly in the motor industry by way of overtrade, disguised leases and various other inflationary strategies and creative measures. Can the Acting Minister clarify if companies that advertise private-hire-purchase schemes, the hyphenation being between private and hire, or with loans which are sold as ""own a car with 10% downpayment"", are in breach of MAS' latest guidelines? These are available today on the market.",1,318,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00318
2016-09-13-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question is has MAS considered reviewing the inclusion of motor loans in the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework, in view of the loopholes that seem to govern MAS' rules on motor vehicle financing.",2,319,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00319
2016-09-13-T-015,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On the first question, I thank the Member for highlighting this. MAS is aware that for hire-purchase arrangements, there have been loans given out that are not in line with the motor vehicle financing restrictions. Therefore, the same restrictions are now applied to the hire-purchase regulations. This comes under MTI, who is the regulator. They will monitor this and they will take enforcement actions should they be breached.",1,320,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00320
2016-09-13-T-015,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"If I heard the Member correctly, he mentioned about private-hire vehicles. Private-hire vehicles are businesses, so they hire vehicles to rent out or run as Uber services. They are not really caught by this policy, because it is revenue-generating. Therefore, because it is revenue-generating, it comes under a separate consideration as if you are funding a business. That is why it is not captured under this.",2,321,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00321
2016-09-13-T-015,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for the third question, whether this would be part of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR), I believe it is. I am afraid I do not have the exact information but I believe motor vehicle loan financing is part of the calculation in TDSR.",3,322,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00322

2016-09-13-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"A final question, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Minister for the reply. The issue now appears to be focused on hire-purchase agreements which are found in the market. And what has happened is while, indeed, they are set up ostensibly for a business or commercial purpose, there is also the prospect of not running it for that purpose at all; as in, you register a company or a private hire under the Uber or Grab framework but in actual fact what you are doing is you are owning a vehicle but not exactly using it for the purpose for which it is registered. That in way it is a loophole or a workaround the existing MAS curbs. Does MAS have any plans to address this matter?",1,324,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00324
2016-09-13-T-015,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Member for the comment. If this is indeed the case, I think it is in violation of the spirit of the policy. If there is specific feedback on practices like that, do let us know. Between MAS and MTI, we will look into it. I do not think it is correct for this to proceed.",1,325,2016-09-13-T-015-S-00325

2016-09-13-T-016,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Law),"For Singapore to have an extradition treaty with another country, for example, Thailand, there must first be a common desire from both countries to have an arrangement for the reciprocal handing over of fugitives in the interest of law and order. Both countries must find it mutually beneficial to enter into such an arrangement. The next step is then to examine each other's legal systems and procedures to determine compatibility. Sometimes, these arrangements are easier to conclude when countries come from the same legal traditions and have very similar legal systems and procedures. Where there is greater divergence in the respective legal systems and procedures, the differences will need to be rationalised or a consensus be reached as to the legal procedures to be applied before an arrangement can be concluded.",4,330,2016-09-13-T-016-S-00330

I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether there is a plan to sign more such extradition agreements with our neighbouring countries.",1,332,2016-09-13-T-016-S-00332
2016-09-13-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mdm Speaker, as I indicated in my response earlier, it much really depends on the country in question because there are a number of factors in play. Compatibility of legal system is one of them, obviously. But I think in the context of neighbours, I am able to say that ASEAN has been discussing a model ASEAN Extradition Treaty as a sort of a template, and this model will, when finalised, provide a useful basis for ASEAN member states in their own bilateral negotiations for extradition treaties with one another. So, it is something that is being looked at, a sort of framework that member countries can tap on should it turn out that the circumstances and conditions are right for them to enter into bilateral arrangements.",1,333,2016-09-13-T-016-S-00333

With demand aggregation, we plan to increase solar generation capacity to 350 MWp by 2020, with solar panels deployed on around 5,000 HDB blocks and 100 Government buildings. In addition, the BCA Green Mark Scheme encourages the adoption of renewable energy sources, which include solar power.

2016-09-13-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, just one supplementary question for the Minister of State. I thank him for his reply. Is the Ministry monitoring the experience of other countries in the world that are making this mandatory, at least for some categories of buildings? I believe this is either being considered or has already been implemented in some cities in America, India and France. So, will the Ministry be monitoring their experience and try to draw some lessons when reviewing this at some future point in time?",1,347,2016-09-13-T-018-S-00347
2016-09-13-T-018,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Madam, I thank the Member for his question. Indeed, we are always watching out what other people are doing and trying to adopt best practices and also to see how the technology evolves as far as solar photovoltaic panels are concerned. But, today, because of the competing use on limited rooftop space, and the bigger challenge is the fact that rooftop can be shaded by a building nearby, I think commercially it would not make sense for us to mandate that across all buildings, because then you would have installed the solar panel and not get any use out of it. Hypothetically, even if were to install panels across all our rooftops, that will probably only satisfy about 10% of our total electrical demands. So, it would not have been able to fulfil the total needs of the country.",1,348,2016-09-13-T-018-S-00348
2016-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked	  the Minister for Transport (a) how has the average income of taxi drivers been affected by the greater number of private hire vehicles; and (b) how should the taxi availability framework be fine-tuned.,1,349,2016-09-13-T-019-S-00349
2016-09-13-T-019,Ng Chee Meng,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mdm Speaker, the average monthly gross earnings of taxi drivers, before netting off rental and fuel costs, have remained relatively unchanged since 2013. Average monthly net income has, however, increased by about 5% in real terms due to lower fuel costs.",1,350,2016-09-13-T-019-S-00350
2016-09-13-T-019,Ng Chee Meng,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"The taxi availability standards benefit the street hail customer. Today, about 80% of all taxis are able to meet the daily minimum mileage requirement of 250 km per day. Of these taxis, more than three quarters ply more than 300 km per day. In addition, the proportion of two-shift taxis has increased from 53% to 68% since the introduction of the standards. This means that there are now more taxis available on the road for the commuter.",2,351,2016-09-13-T-019-S-00351
2016-09-13-T-019,Ng Chee Meng,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"I should also point out that the standard for daily minimum daily mileage is not meant to be achieved at the individual taxi level, but at the company's fleet level. For example, during weekends, the standard is that 75% of a taxi company's fleet must meet the daily minimum mileage.",3,352,2016-09-13-T-019-S-00352
2016-09-13-T-019,Ng Chee Meng,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"With the growth of hailing apps and the private hire car industry in recent years, there may be room for us to adjust the taxi availability standards.

2016-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. Indeed, it is heartening to know that livelihood would not be affected. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State how we would balance the greater convenience for commuters versus ensuring that taxi drivers continue to enjoy a good livelihood.",1,354,2016-09-13-T-019-S-00354
2016-09-13-T-019,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"I thank the Member for the question. We are monitoring the situation closely, gathering data on commuters' preferences, availability of taxis on the roads. So, where appropriate, we will further level the playing field for the industry and we will, as I said earlier, review the taxi availability framework with a balanced view towards commuters' needs and also the welfare of taxi drivers.

2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Madam, on 27 August 2016, Singapore detected its first confirmed case of locally transmitted Zika virus infection. As of noon yesterday, 333 persons have tested positive for Zika, including eight who are pregnant, and involving seven clusters. Most of the patients have recovered and are no longer symptomatic. Although we had been expecting it, many Singaporeans were concerned when Zika cases first emerged in Singapore. Their anxiety is understandable given that Zika is little known here. We have learnt much over the last two weeks. Allow me to give the House an update on the situation.",1,358,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00358
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"First, what is Zika? Zika is not a new disease. The first documented case of Zika was in Africa in 1947. The first reported large outbreak occurred in 2007, in Micronesia. Zika was unknown in the Americas until last year when a number of cases were reported in north-eastern Brazil. By now, 72 countries and territories have reported evidence of Zika virus transmission. On 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases in Brazil, which are suspected to be linked to Zika, constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.",2,359,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00359
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Zika is transmitted via the Aedes mosquito, which can also carry the dengue and chikungunya viruses. Zika can also be spread through sexual transmission in some cases.",3,360,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00360
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"About four out of five infected with Zika virus will not have symptoms. They are asymptomatic. The rest will only have mild symptoms, which include fever and rash, and other symptoms such as red eyes and joint pain. On rare occasions, patients may also develop Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome (GBS), a disease that temporarily affects the nervous system.",4,361,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00361
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Zika is, however, of concern among pregnant women.

Research is still on-going to better understand the association between Zika and microcephaly.",5,362,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00362
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"We had expected Zika to come to Singapore sooner or later, given the large volume of travel in and out of Singapore. When it did, we also expected to see local transmission, because of the presence of Aedes mosquitoes here. Hence, we have put in place an action plan with a three-pronged approach  first, preparing for Zika; second, responding to initial cases; and third, managing Zika in the long term.",6,363,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00363
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),Let me first talk about preparations for Zika. We prepared for Zika on a few fronts.,7,364,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00364
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"First, MOH worked with NEA's Environmental Health Institute to put in place a sentinel surveillance programme for Zika two years ago. We partnered about 200 clinics island-wide to collect blood samples from selected patients with symptoms associated with Zika, which are quite similar to dengue, and tested them for the Zika virus.",8,365,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00365
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"From January this year, we stepped up our surveillance and testing efforts, and increased the number of samples tested for Zika to more than 500 a month, a majority of them from people who had no travel history to Zika-affected areas. Close to 4,000 samples were tested between February and August, before the first confirmed case happened. All the test results then were negative.",9,366,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00366

2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"As a second layer of defence, we kept our doctors, especially our GPs, abreast of the developments on Zika. Our GPs are the first line of care for most Singaporeans. They have been helpful in alerting us to unusual disease patterns. We have also made Zika a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Act from January this year, so that MOH would immediately be alerted if any doctor or laboratory in Singapore detected a case of Zika.",11,368,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00368
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Third, we sought to reduce the risk of importation of Zika. We issued travel advice to outbound travellers to Zika-affected areas, and inbound travellers returning from these areas.",12,369,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00369
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Fourth, we stepped up public education and issued health advisories. In early February, we set up the Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) on Zika and Pregnancy, to develop a health advisory for pregnant women, and also to advise doctors on the clinical management of pregnant women with Zika. An interim clinical guidance was issued in mid-April.",13,370,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00370
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Fifth, we strengthened our operational readiness for an outbreak. In January this year, MOH worked with partner agencies to prepare our operational plans in case of an outbreak. In July, we conducted a multi-agency exercise where we simulated the import of an infectious disease into Singapore.

2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"To determine the extent and the locations of the spread, we not only looked out for new cases, but also looked backwards in time to investigate past cases in the vicinity. As a number of such cases were construction workers, we went back to the construction site on 27 August to trace and test workers who had recently recovered from fever, and also assessed and tested new patients. We obtained most of the results by the next day and included them in our subsequent announcement.",24,381,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00381
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"This active back-tracing was why the number of confirmed Zika cases increased from one reported on 27 August to 41 on 28 August. This sudden jump was surprising to some people, who wondered if these cases had in fact been detected earlier but held back by MOH. In reality, the number of confirmed new Zika-positive patients – and I repeat – new Zika-positive patients increased only by five. The other 36 were from our proactive back-tracing of workers at the construction site. Many of them have already recovered from the sickness.",25,382,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00382
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Through the back-tracing, we also checked the onset of symptoms to determine the epidemiology of the outbreak. The analysis showed that the earliest case had onset of symptoms on 31 July. Some people misinterpreted this as MOH having known of the first Zika-positive case since 31 July. This is not so. As I explained, we only confirmed the first locally transmitted Zika case on 27 August, and we released the information the same evening.",26,383,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00383

These were aligned with WHO guidelines which advise that Zika testing for asymptomatic pregnant women is not routinely recommended. However, WHO's guidelines do recommend testing for symptomatic pregnant women and those whose male partners had tested positive for Zika. Symptomatic pregnant women and those whose male partners have tested positive should seek the advice of their doctors. They will be provided with free Zika tests at both public and private healthcare institutions if their doctors assess that testing is needed.",37,394,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00394
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),Pregnant women who are tested positive for Zika will be referred by their doctors to an obstetric or maternal-foetal medicine specialist for counselling and subsequent follow-up. Regular ultrasound scans will be carried out to monitor the development of the foetus. Zika infection does not always result in abnormal foetal development. It is therefore important that pregnant women be appropriately advised and monitored by the relevant specialists.

2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"First, it is important to be transparent and timely in sharing accurate information.

2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Madam, the journey in our fight against Zika is likely to be a long one, because of the presence of Aedes mosquitos here. Even if we can control the present outbreak, we will need to continue to guard against imported cases, as the Zika virus is still circulating among many countries, including several in this region. Therefore, as we tackle Zika, life must go on. By working together, I am confident that we can succeed in managing Zika in the long term. Thank you.",61,418,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00418

2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"As everyone knows by now, Zika and dengue are conveyed by the same mosquito – the Aedes aegypti. Our key strategy for dengue control, and now Zika, is source reduction – the detection and removal of breeding habitats and larvae. This integrated vector management strategy is in line with the World Health Organization (WHO)'s recommendations and remains especially critical now as we are in the traditional dengue peak season.",2,421,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00421
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Using a risk-based approach in NEA's vector control, our officers conduct pre-emptive checks and vector control efforts as precautionary measures in areas identified with high Aedes mosquito population. When a dengue or Zika cluster is identified, we intensify our source eradication efforts by partnering with the community and premise owners to eliminate mosquito breeding habitats. Fogging is also conducted to kill the mosquitos as an additional measure to quickly curtail the transmission of dengue or Zika quickly.",3,422,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00422
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Following the Zika outbreak, we have heard calls for fogging to be conducted at various residential estates. Currently, the NEA carries out indoor spraying of insecticides and outdoor fogging or misting to kill adult mosquitoes in the Zika clusters. This is the same thing we do in the dengue clusters. These measures are helpful in the clusters because they have infected adult mosquitoes which must be destroyed before they bite and infect more people. However, it would not be wise to conduct fogging indiscriminately outside of the clusters as a preventive measure.",4,423,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00423
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Firstly, fogging is only effective if the chemical has direct contact with the mosquitoes. This means that fogging will have to be repeated frequently as new batches of mosquitoes continue to emerge from breeding habitats that are not removed. Routine fogging is not a sustainable vector control measure. Secondly, the right chemical and sufficient number of fogging guns needs to be deployed to achieve an effective kill. Thirdly, the overuse or indiscriminate use of chemical treatment may cause the build-up of resistance in the local mosquito population. Fogging should only be used when there are Zika or dengue clusters or when the adult mosquito population is observed to be high so that we can mitigate the situation quickly and again, I qualify, is only effective when worked together with source eradication.",5,424,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00424
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"I just read an article in The Economist where experts fighting the same Aedes aegypti mosquito in Florida have come to the same conclusion that fogging on its own is not effective and that the only real solution is in fact ""boots on the ground"". And this is the best way to destroy the breeding habitats. Given that this particular mosquito, the Aedes aegypti, likes to be around humans, live in crowded places, and lay eggs in clean water, the only way to mitigate the risk of dengue or Zika is to prevent the mosquito from emerging in the first place. Indeed, human blood is needed by the female Aedes mosquitoes to lay eggs and breed – they will go everywhere where there is human blood to feed on and water to breed their offspring.",6,425,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00425
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),That is why our NEA officers' boots have been on the ground for years to eradicate breeding spots in accessible and public areas. That is why we have to emphasise repeatedly that every household must also constantly do the necessary ground actions to remove potential breeding spots in their own homes where it is not easily accessible to our officers.,7,426,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00426
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),Why does Singapore remain vulnerable? I would like to share that we remain vulnerable to dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases for a few reasons.,8,427,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00427
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Firstly, the dengue cases have been increasing globally. The WHO reported 2.2 million cases in 2010 and this number has increased to 3.2 million last year.",9,428,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00428
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Secondly, we are in a dengue-endemic region and there are four different dengue virus serotypes circulating concurrently. Historically, we notice a change in the predominant virus is usually followed by a spike in dengue cases.",10,429,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00429
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Thirdly, a large proportion of our population lack immunity to dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases as a result of intensive mosquito control in the past decades. In many other countries where dengue is endemic, the affected are often children. This is not the case in Singapore, which is good. Our success has, therefore, and however, paradoxically lowered our herd immunity so that disease transmission occurs easily even with a very small mosquito population.",11,430,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00430
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Fourthly, our region's constantly warm climate and high humidity allow the mosquitoes to breed all year round. The warmer climate also supports faster breeding and the maturation cycle of the mosquitoes which contributes to a higher population and the spread of diseases.",12,431,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00431
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Finally, our high population density is very helpful to the breeding of Aedes aegypti. This specific mosquito, as I have mentioned, has adapted particularly well to our urban environment because it loves human beings as compared with animals and likes to breed, mate and feed near human dwellings.",13,432,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00432
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"We must acknowledge that all these extraneous factors make it impossible to eliminate the Aedes aegypti here. Indeed, if we had done anything less, Dengue and Zika would have spread throughout the whole island more quickly and thoroughly. Therefore, we are far from helpless and can do much to mitigate the risk. We have put in resources for surveillance. NEA has deployed about 37,000 Gravitraps around Singapore and this number will reach 48,000 by the end of the year. These Gravitraps will allow us to identify areas with a large Aedes aegypti population and take targeted mosquito control measures proactively even if there are no Dengue or Zika cases. This sort of risk-based, preventive surveillance work will go on well ahead of any peak transmission season.",14,433,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00433

Between January and July this year, we conducted about 748,000 inspections – 638,000 of these inspections were in homes and 4,400 in construction sites. More than 10,000 breeding habitats were destroyed during these inspections – about half were in homes and about 5% were in construction sites. Besides conducting preventive surveillance, we inspect all the premises and public areas within the cluster, conduct indoor spraying of insecticides and outdoor fogging to kill adult mosquitoes, as well as oiling of breeding habitats to kill any mosquito larvae.",16,435,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00435

Earlier this year, given the potentially large number of dengue cases as well as the impending threat of Zika, the NEA renewed the call for everyone to safeguard our own home. Since 14 March 2016, NEA has taken enforcement action against all the home owners found to have breeding, regardless of whether the homes are within the existing dengue clusters – 2,200 households were fined between January and July this year.",21,440,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00440

I recently announced plans to trial a novel method of suppressing the mosquito population through the release of male Aedes aegypti mosquitos carrying Wolbachia to mate with wild female Wolbachia-free Aedes mosquitos. Eggs produced from the mating between the male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito and a wild female Aedes aegypti mosquito will not hatch.",22,441,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00441

From October 2016, male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitos will be released in three selected sites. If successful, this will complement our existing mosquito control efforts and eventually lead to the suppression of the Aedes aegypti mosquito population and a possible curtailment of dengue or Zika transmission. That said, the Wolbachia technology is not a silver bullet. It will take some years before we can deploy it in scale.

I think, firstly, we should not go overboard by implementing more measures and also adding more costs when we can do things well publicly. The combination of the CVPA measures which includes having ECO on site for those $50 million construction sites and then those between $10 million and $50 million, having a part-time one every two weeks, we think this is sufficient.",1,461,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00461
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Again, I would like to stress the importance of having the support of all the premises owners, including construction site supervisors so that they do not let their eyes off the ball. Sometimes, there are dry seasons; the rain may not fall and therefore, there may not be any mosquitoes. But the Aedes aegypti mosquito can breed any time of the year.",2,462,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00462
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Therefore, we must never let our vigilance down. We are thankful that the Singapore Contractors Association (SCAL) continues to encourage the supervisors to be on the look-out, always be on their toes, so that whether it is their site or their workers, they must care for them enough not to allow the mosquitoes to breed and, therefore, spread Zika or dengue.",3,463,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00463
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We have also extended our CVPA to the dormitories because I think it is a good precautionary measure, although this is not a construction site. The workers live there and they may also spread or transmit to one another. Therefore, the CVPA will require the dormitory owners to step up their housekeeping of the premises as well as misting quarterly, to ensure that mosquitoes if they were ever to exist in that place will die if they were to land on the walls, because this is where most of them would be during the nights when they are resting. So, we must continue to work with them. We will monitor, And if these actions are not sufficient, if the WHO or other experts tell us to do other things that will help us to fight in this, we will definitely take it up.",4,464,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00464
2016-09-13-T-020,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Thank you, Madam. First of all, I thank the Ministers for their comprehensive Statements. Please also allow me to place on record appreciation to MOH and NEA officers for their hard work on the ground since the start of the Zika infection.",1,465,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00465
2016-09-13-T-020,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"A couple of questions for MOH. First of all, are we able to ascertain, at this point, the original of this particular local transmission? Secondly, I understand from the Minister's Statement that there was a look-back exercise. I would like to ask what we did with the look-back cases that were Zika-positive. Were these patients informed that they were Zika-positive and was this particular exercise helpful in reducing the spread of Zika further?",2,466,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00466
2016-09-13-T-020,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"On microcephaly which is perhaps the most visual and the most frightening aspect of Zika, are there any other causes of microcephaly in babies and how many non-Zika microcephaly cases have there been in Singapore since the tracking began in 1993? Also, in terms of public awareness that both Ministers spoke about, whether both Ministries have ascertained what is the level of public awareness on Zika at this moment, and what more can the Government do to stress the whole-of-society approach to containing Zika and preventing vector breeding?",3,467,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00467
2016-09-13-T-020,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Last of all, a question for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. Under the CVPA, from the start of this year, how many section 36 orders have been served to inspect vacant or non-cooperated households in premises for dengue or Zika areas?",4,468,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00468
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, perhaps, I can answer some of the questions first and then I will allow my Colleague to answer. First, Mr Yam asked about the origin of the local transmission. I presume he is asking about the first case locally. It is very difficult to determine the first case of Zika because Zika is not transmitted from person to person. From epidemiological studies, it is very difficult to trace who passes on to who because there is an intermediary factor, and that is the mosquito. We are unable to trace the mosquito for obvious reasons. Therefore, we do not know who is the first so-called index case.",1,469,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00469
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We also have to be quite careful not to identify the person with the earliest onset of symptoms on 31 July as the first case. It may well not be because, again, 80% of the patients actually do not have symptoms. So, it is not necessary that the first person with symptoms is the first case. I hope I have addressed the Member's question. So, the answer is we do not really know who is the index case in this outbreak.",2,470,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00470
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Secondly, Mr Yam asked about the look-back exercise. The look-back exercise was important to us in order to have a sense of how wide the cluster was and how many patients were involved, to allow us to determine very quickly rather than to have to wait for further cases to be investigated, and to size up the situation. We decided to look back to allow us to have a quick assessment of the size of the cluster and to also allow NEA to focus its efforts where it matters. It is helpful in that sense.",3,471,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00471
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For patients who are tested positive, we do inform them and for those who are still symptomatic, we isolated them in the beginning, as I had explained earlier. They were hospitalised for us to observe them, as we wanted to be sure that they did not have complications either. By the time of the look-back, in fact, most of the patients in the look-back exercise had already recovered. They were no longer symptomatic because in the look-back exercise, we looked quite far backwards and many of them had already recovered. We were just approaching them and asking them whether they were ill before, what their symptoms were and when their symptoms started. That is how we did the look-back exercise.",4,472,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00472
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On microcephaly, Zika is not the only cause of microcephaly. Microcephaly can be due to a number of factors. It could be due to genetic and environmental factors, such as Down Syndrome, exposure to drugs and alcohol, rubella, as well as other infectious diseases. Even before we encountered the first case of Zika, microcephaly cases were present in Singapore. Over the last five years, we had, on average, between five and 12 microcephaly cases per 10,000 live births. For these patients with microcephaly, we continue to provide support and manage them in the same way as we manage children with congenital conditions.",5,473,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00473
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Yam also asked about the level of public awareness. I think those of us who have done home visits would know that the level of awareness is very high among the public. Every door that we knock on, I always tell them, ""I want to remind you about Zika."" They will say, ""Yah, Zika I heard of it. I read about it in the newspapers. I watched the TV."" Most of them are aware of Zika. Based on a recent survey by the Ministry of Communications and Information, more than 90% of Singaporeans found it easy to access information with regard to Zika. And we will continue to raise public awareness. Because research on this is still on-going, our knowledge of Zika is still very limited, in terms of scientific knowledge. There will be new discoveries and new developments, and we need to continue to engage the public and keep them informed of these new developments.",6,474,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00474
2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. There was a question about section 36. To date, this year, before the detection of Zika, there were 13 section 36 orders served, and after the Zika, 24 such orders were served. Of these 24, three were found with breeding but with very few larvae.",1,475,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00475
2016-09-13-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"First of all, because part of MacPherson was part of the first general cluster, I would like to also thank MOH, NEA, Town Councils, pest control workers and grassroots leaders for their relentless efforts in the anti-Mozzie and anti-Zika efforts.

2016-09-13-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"I have got a few questions. First of all, I would like to ask if Zika is now considered endemic in Singapore and if a full eradication is even possible.

2016-09-13-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Thirdly, is the current testing capacity enough to deal with the demand in case of a national outbreak again – hopefully not – and whether there is a need to increase the capacity for testing? Finally, will there be funds specially set aside to conduct Zika research and this is especially so given that mosquitoes are considered endemic in the tropical countries like ours?",4,479,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00479
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, whether Zika is endemic in Singapore, I think it is too early to say. It is actually not productive for us to discuss on terminology, whether it is endemic or otherwise. Our immediate task is to focus on vector control, to do our level best, to try to eradicate as much as we can and if not, to minimise as much as we can. That is our immediate task and we should focus on the this. I certainly hope that Zika will not be endemic but it is something that we will have to monitor over a longer period of time before we can make a definitive assessment.",1,480,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00480
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On pregnant ladies, WHO did not recommend regular routine testing for non-symptomatic pregnant women because to test them, there is a very narrow window. You have to test them while they are infected. After a period of time when their infection has recovered, it will be very difficult to detect whether the lady has been infected before. Therefore, the window is very narrow and it is not practical to keep testing the lady every day, or every week, or every other week. WHO did not recommend regular testing for those who are non-symptomatic. Our Clinical Advisory Group also advised against it.",2,481,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00481
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For symptomatic pregnant women, the advice is for them to consult their doctors because each case is different, their risk factors are also different.

2016-09-13-T-020,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I have three questions, two for the Minister for Health. The first one is, whether the 36 construction workers were discovered to be infected in the look-back exercise, whether they went to a clinic and, if they did, why were the clinics not able to detect an uptrend in the Zika symptoms and report that to MOH?",1,486,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00486
2016-09-13-T-020,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is, what processes are in place to ensure construction sites' contractors would report large numbers of workers who display symptoms of dengue or Zika infection to MOH in a timely manner, and if none exists, whether there should be such processes?",2,487,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00487
2016-09-13-T-020,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"For the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, whether, other than size, the location of construction sites should be considered for more stringent surveillance, namely, how close the sites are to residential areas? Thank you.",3,488,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00488
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, first, on the question of the 36 patients we detected in the look-back exercise, some of them went to the clinics. But the symptoms were very mild; so very often, the clinics may not be able to identify them as having potential Zika infection. Members would remember that I had explained how we identified the first case. It was because of a GP clinic that had identified a large number of patients with similar symptoms, and they were not able to determine the cause of the symptoms. They had tested the patients for dengue, and tested them for chikungunya, and they were not able to determine what infection the patients had. And so, they alerted us. That is part of our surveillance system.",1,489,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00489
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As I had also explained in my reply, our primary care system is, in fact, at the frontline of our surveillance. They are more sensitive because they are trained and on the lookout for unusual trends. If they identity trends like what I mentioned earlier, they will alert us and then, we would go in and investigate.",2,490,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00490
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition to the GPs network that we work with to identify unusual trends, we also have a sentinel surveillance system, where we work with partner GPs and our polyclinics to monitor and to test selected samples regularly to ensure that even if they have no significant symptoms, if we are not able to determine the cause of the symptoms, we also test them for Zika to make sure that we are able to identify Zika infections if it is transmitted in the community.",3,491,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00491
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Most of the clinics, when they do testing, under normal circumstances, the focus is on imported cases as well. So, if they see symptoms that resemble Zika, even if they are light symptoms, they would check the travel history. If the patient has been to Zika-infected countries, then alarm will be raised. And they would then inform us. That is also part of the system to track imported cases. That was how the first case in Watten Estate was discovered, because he had a travel history to Brazil. When he returned, we discovered that he had symptoms. Therefore we sent his blood for testing and we discovered Zika that way.",4,492,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00492
2016-09-13-T-020,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Your second question on a large number of patients in the construction sites, again, as I had explained, the key gatekeeper is our primary care system. We work through our GPs when they notice unusual trends, whether it is Zika or any other infection. We are on the lookout not just for Zika but also other potential infectious diseases, including diseases that we may not be aware of as well. So, our frontline GPs are the most important. When they see cases that they have doubts about, or when they see patterns that are unusual which they cannot explain, they will usually alert MOH and we will work together with them to find out the truth. This was how we discovered a locally transmitted case in the first instance.",5,493,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00493

Singapore is a very unique built-up area. In other areas, they just have to fly horizontally. We have to know whether these mosquitoes will fly high and how high and whether they will survive long enough in our urban environment. So, after six months, if successful, and I hope it is successful so that we do not have to recalibrate again, we can then deploy them across for small scale study and field suppression trials. And then if successful, we will roll out for higher risk areas. The whole programme will take up to 2020.",1,497,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00497

Our scientists the A*STAR scientists as well as the National Public Health Laboratory scientists – have worked together to sequence the virus and based on their analysis, the Singapore strain that we have discovered so far, came from the Southeast Asian strain, which is not the same as the strain in Brazil. In fact, the strain in Brazil is a later strain that was derived from the Asian strain. So, the strain that we have is an earlier generation which means that it has been circulating in Asia even before Brazil had a Zika outbreak, so this is the current strain that we have identified. But research is still on-going.",2,499,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00499

Would Minister be able to share in what other areas, besides these, can these sites of breeding be found?",1,505,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00505
2016-09-13-T-020,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"The second question relates to a back-of-the-envelope calculation that I did, based on the figures Minister provided. Minister mentioned that about 5,000 breeding sites were found in the 638,000 homes that were assessed. That adds up to about one breeding site per 128 homes. On the other hand, the 5% figure means 500 breeding sites were found out of 4,400 construction sites studied. That means about one in 9 construction sites has mosquito breeding sites discovered and destroyed.",2,506,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00506

2016-09-13-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Even for public housing, our HDB flats, we do not specify which unit exactly where the breeding happens. It is enough for the information that in this particular building or block, that is a cluster, because there is more than one and there is a chance that it was infected by one or the other. Therefore, it is enough for people to take heed and to know that some form of transmission is happening and take more precaution to go round their house to eradicate the source of breeding. Therefore, I think it is not important to know the exact unit. That is taken care of by NEA. That is their role. Everyone's role is to ensure that there is no breeding at home and then if there are adult mosquitoes, particularly seen in large numbers in the condominium, to do the fogging as appropriate.",1,514,2016-09-13-T-020-S-00514

2016-09-13-T-022,Koh Poh Koon,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"The Government's approach to consumer protection is based on promoting fair trading by businesses, and helping consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. This is a two-pronged approach. This two-pronged approach has benefited consumers and businesses who seek to serve their customers well, and helped resolve disagreements between businesses and consumers amicably.",2,520,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00520
2016-09-13-T-022,Koh Poh Koon,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"It is important for consumers to know their rights and be alert to unfair trading practices so that they can be in a good position to make sound purchasing decisions. To this end, MTI works closely with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) which plays a key role in championing consumer education and raising consumer awareness. CASE also helps consumers to resolve disputes with businesses through negotiation and mediation. The majority of consumer disputes with businesses are resolved, in fact, in this way. Consumers are also able to file claims against businesses with the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT), which hears cases of up to $10,000, or $20,000 if both the consumer and the business agree.",3,521,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00521

When consumers encounter a problem, our consumer protection framework provides for an escalating set of measures, ranging from negotiation and mediation, which is facilitated by CASE, to assist consumers in resolving disputes, or by taking up voluntary compliance agreements by retailers to stop unfair practices and compensate consumers, or civil actions through injunctions issued by the courts for errant retailers, and if need be Police investigation and prosecution of egregious cases which involve criminal activities.

So among the whole spectrum, we identified a gap in the injunction process.

2016-09-13-T-022,Koh Poh Koon,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Currently, the CPFTA does not provide CASE and STB with investigation and enforcement powers. Hence, they face challenges in gathering evidence to file injunction applications with the Courts. Clause 8 inserts a new part 3A on investigation powers to be conferred on SPRING to obtain information, enter premises which it reasonably believes are being used for unfair practices, and to gather evidence. Under new part 3B of the same clause, any person who obstructs SPRING's investigations such as by destroying documents and providing SPRING with false information will be committing an offence.",17,535,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00535

CASE and STB's previous roles as specified bodies under the CPFTA which can submit injunction applications will be repealed to avoid duplication of effort. CASE and STB however will remain the first points of contact for locals and tourists, and will focus on assisting consumers with their disputes; including obtaining redress or compensation through negotiation, mediation and voluntary compliance agreements.

Clauses 4 and 5 provide for the additional measures or accompanying orders that a court may take or may make in addition to an injunction order. These accompanying orders serve to raise consumer awareness of errant businesses, both business entities and individuals, who are under injunction orders. They also make it harder for errant businesses to side-step injunction orders by closing business and setting up new ones under another person's name. Taken together, the additional measures that the Courts may impose will enable SPRING to monitor these errant businesses, and take swift enforcement action if the orders are not complied with.",23,541,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00541

2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, please allow me to declare my interest in speaking on this topic as the President of the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).

2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Under the Act, the Government empowers specified bodies like CASE and Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to take action against suppliers who engage or are likely to engage in unfair practice. As Specified Bodies, CASE and STB are empowered to invite a supplier to sign a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) and even to apply to court for an injunction against errant trade suppliers.",2,561,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00561
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"With the proposed amendments, the power to take injunction action would be removed from CASE and STB. SPRING will be appointed as the administrative agency for CPFTA with powers to investigate and to enforce.",3,562,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00562
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"CASE supports the proposed amendments. Ever since the CPFTA took effect in 2004, CASE has entered into 20 VCAs and taken out six injunctions against retailers who had breached the CPFTA.",4,563,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00563
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"However, there are limitations to the operation of the CPFTA when dealing with dishonest retailers. An example would be the few dishonest retail operators at Sim Lim Square who were ripping off consumers and tourists. Their antics were reported in the media in late 2014. Instead of selling their products in an honest and ethical manner, these retailers practised deception and cheated consumers and tourists, and this resulted in many cries of foul play by consumers. The actions of a few bad hats affected the reputation of the other honest retailers in Sim Lim Square.",5,564,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00564
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"CASE had worked with the Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) of Sim Lim Square. We helped them to set up a consumer complaint terminal, put up consumer alert notices naming retailers with the most number of complaints. However, there is little effect as consumers continued to be deceived and lured into buying products due to the perceived lower prices. Once the consumer made payment for the product, the retailer imposes additional costs like ""phone unlocking fees"" or ""in-house insurance"" and illegally refuses to allow the consumer to collect their purchased products.",6,565,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00565
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The presence of such recalcitrant retailers who flout the law, who engage in unfair practices suggest that more muscle must be given to the authorities to take punitive action.",7,566,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00566
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"CASE does not have any power under the existing CPFTA to take criminal prosecution against dishonest retailers. The Police often classify disputes between consumers and retailers as civil disputes. They refer consumers who had lodged police reports to CASE. The Police expects CASE to advise the consumers and retailers to resolve their disputes and to mediate a settlement. However, dishonest retailers are no respecter of the law. Due to the perceived lack of action, a small minority of retailers persist with their unfair practices and consumers suffer when they are taken advantage of.",8,567,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00567
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Court Injunctions are also of no effect on retailers who are not serious about their business. Out of the six injunctions taken out by CASE, every one of them had ceased operations after the injunction. Some retailers who have signed VCAs had used the names of their relatives to set up another company to operate a new business, and this defeats the intent of VCAs and court injunctions as any restrictions imposed can easily be overcome.",9,568,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00568
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thus, I welcome the amendments to the CPFTA to give SPRING the power to investigate, to require production of documents and to enter premises to inspect and seize documents. These are wide powers needed when dealing with errant retailers, and once the evidence has been obtained, SPRING has the power to apply for injunctions against egregious errant retailers.",10,569,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00569
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),I also support the provisions for SPRING to seek court orders that require suppliers to publicise the details of the declaration or injunction and to notify the consumer about the court orders. This will ensure that such retailers cannot try to cover up their unethical conduct. They should understand the severe consequence for breaching the CPFTA.,11,570,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00570
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I am also pleased that the proposed Bill includes a provision at Clause 10 for the court to grant an injunction restraining a person from knowingly abetting, aiding, permitting or procuring a supplier to engage in an unfair practice. This means that an injunction order can be extended to third parties like employees and agents and can even extend to family members of the supplier as long as they knowingly help the supplier to carry out unfair practices. This will ensure that the injunction order cannot be side-stepped by using other people's names to start a new business.",12,571,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00571
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Much as I am happy with the amendments, the proposed changes to the CPFTA are not a magic bullet to solve all consumer disputes. The reality is that consumers too, must do their part to exercise caution when buying goods or services from suppliers. And here I just want to assure Minister that CASE will do its part to continue to educate consumers on their duties as well.",13,572,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00572
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),There are a few concerns which I hope that the Minister can address.,14,573,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00573
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"First, much of the frustration in respect of the Sim Lim Square fiasco arose because the conduct of the supplier was not just about ""unfair practice"". The supplier was dishonest. He cheated consumers by asking them to pay for non-existent unlocking phone fees or he could ask the consumers to buy fake compulsory insurance. In such instances, any court injunction by SPRING would be of limited effect as well.",15,574,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00574
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"So, may I seek an assurance from Minister that if SPRING discovers evidence of criminal conduct during the course of investigation, they would not hesitate to refer the wrong doing to the police for prosecution? This would be a stronger deterrent to crooks as compared to a court injunction. They face imprisonment if they continue to behave in such criminal manner. Likewise, if retailers act in breach of the court order, can I seek Minister's assurance that SPRING will take up contempt proceedings against such retailers? And if SPRING does not initiate contempt action, then surely retailers will not bother any injunction taken up against them.",16,575,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00575
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Second, I notice that the proposed amendments make no attempt to discourage the taking of pre-payment or deposits for future services. CASE has always been concerned at the losses suffered by consumers who had paid deposits or made pre-payment to companies which had subsequently become insolvent. We had received many complaints from consumers who had lost money when travel agencies cease operations, when wedding boutiques or other companies go into liquidation.",17,576,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00576
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The latest company closure which adversely affected consumers is the liquidation of California Fitness. I read the report by the provisional liquidators. I was appalled that even though the company was clearly in negative equity position of $21.7 million as at January 2015, the company continued to sell platinum memberships and collect pre-payment from their customers. It was reported that one member paid $1,700 for a 26-month package just nine days before the company closed. When company management behave in such dishonest manner and consumers get cheated, something must be done.",18,577,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00577
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),I urge the Government to take strong action against the directors and management of any company whose management knowingly continue to collect large sums of pre-payment when they are fully aware that the company is insolvent and cannot continue its operations. This will send a strong signal to directors and management of a company that they must not act dishonestly or recklessly.,19,578,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00578
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Third, may I ask the Minister whether the Government would consider issuing a ""grey"" list of contractual terms which the Government considers to be unfair? This can be done by subsidiary legislation. It would help consumers and businesses alike, to understand which contractual terms may be considered as unfair.",20,579,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00579
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"An example of such an unfair term which may be included in a ""grey list"" would be terms that require all disputes with consumers to be referred to arbitration. The use of the arbitration clause in contracts makes it near impossible for consumers to seek redress for small claims as this is because arbitration is simple too expensive when the claims are too small. Consumers also cannot turn to the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT) for help due to the arbitration clause which oust the jurisdiction of the SCT. So, one option, if I may propose to the Minister, is to disallow compulsory arbitration clauses if it relates to claims below $10,000, which is similar to the limit for SCT.",21,580,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00580
2016-09-13-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I hope that the Minister can clarify my concerns. Before I end my speech, I wish to acknowledge my appreciation to MTI for carrying out public consultation for the proposed changes. I also thank the Minister and the staff from MTI for their strong support and constant engagement with CASE to improve consumer protection. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.",22,581,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00581
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mdm Speaker, I am in support of strengthening existing laws to provide better protection for consumers, whether it is to protect local shoppers or foreign tourists. It will only takes a few bad hats to give Singapore a very bad name, and we cannot afford that as Singapore is a major retail centre of the world.",1,582,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00582
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, I have a few clarifications for the Minister. Clause 12(i) of the Bill provides that in connection with an investigation under section 12(g)(i), the authority may have a power to enter premises without a court warrant. It sets out the requirements of a prior written notice, for example, giving two working days' notice of the intended entry indicating the subject matter and the purpose of the investigation, and also to be accompanied by a copy of the offences alleged.",2,583,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00583
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Under this provision, an investigations officer may be empowered to inspect and search the premises, take photos or videos of the premises or persons in the premises, seize or detain goods, bring necessary equipment, require someone at the premise to produce documents, or to take away information stored in digital form.",3,584,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00584
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Clause 12(j) of the Bill then provides the power to enter premises under a court warrant in cases where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there are documents on the premises which have not been produced or may be required to be produced, or where officers attempted to enter under the conditions in Clause 12(i), but failed to do so.",4,585,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00585
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, I would like to know from the Minister the rationale for having the power to enter premises without warrant under clause 12(i) of the Bill, to search, to take photos, to seize and detain goods. Would it not be more appropriate to require officers to seek a court warrant first in all the cases, just like in clause 12(j)?",5,586,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00586
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"We should not be lowering the threshold for entering premises and carrying out searches or seizures for different kinds of offences. Let the courts be a point of control and oversight to decide whether any entry, search or seizure is actually necessary. The presence of a notice, while admittedly is better than no notice at all, does not take away the fact that the powers to enter and take photos, seize or detain without a court warrant are rather draconian.",6,587,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00587
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Let us not take such searches too lightly. Carry out searches by all means, if the court sanctions it. But do not make it easier for searches to be carried without a warrant from the court.",7,588,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00588
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, next, I would like to ask the Minister how does the new administering authority intend to ensure that retailers who are subject to injunctions should, as the injunction requires them, put up notices to all and sundry that they are objects to such injunctions and that potential customers see such notices before they enter into any transactions with the retailer. How is this going to be administered?",8,589,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00589
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I am concerned that if it is not administered effectively and consistently by the authority, the injunctions will be less effective and may fail in preventing the very acts that the present Bill is seeking to prevent. It will be too late when the customer enters into the transaction and be subject to unfair practices.",9,590,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00590
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Above all, consumers, local or otherwise, must be confident that when they go into any shop in Singapore, whether in Orchard Road or Sim Lim Square, or when they shop online, they can without question expect retailers to behave honourably and ethically and will not engage in unfair practices.",10,591,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00591
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, I am in support of proposed amendments in Schedule 2 which included various forms of conduct as unfair practices, but I also wonder whether the current Act and the proposed Amendment Bill may be sufficient to deal with businesses where customers sign onto a term subscription package, like gym, spa, hair or nail salon, or travel packages.",11,592,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00592
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, on one hand, I recognise the attraction of the bulk business that may come to small businesses with a term subscription package, and how it can help to keep customer loyalty and provide good cashflow for the business. On the other hand, I also recognise that the discounts that come with a fixed term package may be attractive to customers.",12,593,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00593
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I myself signed up with California Fitness many years ago, shortly after they opened in Singapore. And as my hon colleague, Mr Lim Biow Chuan has pointed out, California Fitness was recently in the news for its sudden collapse, leaving many customers who have signed up for valuable packages in the lurch.",13,594,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00594
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"My wife and I have also signed up regularly for foot massage packages. Such term packages can often be a win-win deal for both businesses and customers. I am aware that CASE has the CaseTrust Accreditation Scheme which covers certain businesses, for example, renovation companies, employment agencies, spas and travel agencies. Under the scheme, some form of deposits or insurance may be required for participating businesses, but the scheme does not cover all businesses, and is dependent on CASE working out the arrangements and accreditations with the relevant trade associations.",14,595,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00595
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"May I ask if the Minister has considered amending legislation to require a secured payment mode such as customers making payment to a reliable third party or body who can then dispense payment to the retailers as each of the session is utilised by the customers, or by use of a performance bond? This may already be in place by a voluntary or more limited basis than I am thinking here, but Madam, we really should do more to prevent retailers from looking to bulk payments for packages as quick and easy solutions for business cashflow and to give consumers peace of mind when they sign up for term subscription packages.",15,596,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00596
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Alternatively, the Government maybe should consider starting a scheme to encourage and allow retailers from all industries and not just those who have signed up with CaseTrust to voluntarily opt for a secured payment or performance bond practice. Such schemes can be driven by good business incentives. The Government may even wish to consider incentives such as suitable tax reliefs.",16,597,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00597
2016-09-13-T-022,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, despite things having become more expensive in Singapore in recent years, Singapore still has a reputation as a shoppers' paradise which saw investors pour $10 billion into retail developments here in the past five years. We must continue to maintain our reputation as a major retail centre in the world. And to do this, we must continue to improve our consumer protection laws in a fair and responsible manner.

I rise in support of the Bill and want to thank the MTI for introducing the proposed amendments to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. The proposed appointment of SPRING Singapore to be the administering agency for the Act, with powers to investigate and require errant retailers to publicise that they are under injunction, will help to strengthen the measures that may be taken against rogue traders and service providers engaged in unfair trading practices.",1,604,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00604
2016-09-13-T-022,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Previously, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) primarily depended on mediation between the two parties.

2016-09-13-T-022,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"In particular, I am very happy that the Act also covers renovation contractors.

2016-09-13-T-022,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Upon receiving complaints, these contractors would then be uncontactable. Some residents who pursue their case against these contractors in the Small Claims Tribunal would find that the company is only a $2-company with very little assets and the contractor could easily set up another $2-company under another trade name.",4,607,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00607
2016-09-13-T-022,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),Unfair practices in the renovation industry is especially painful for consumers because the sums involved could run into tens of thousands of dollars and it may cost as much to fix a poorly renovated flat as doing everything from scratch.,5,608,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00608
2016-09-13-T-022,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"I hope that SPRING Singapore will look into the possibility of publishing a list of blacklisted renovation contractors together with their contact details such that consumers have more information when deciding on which renovation contractor to appoint.

2016-09-13-T-022,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, we have to be cognitive of the nature of the problems that have surfaced so far. Errant retailers can impose a parasitic cost on others in their business community. By encouraging the growth of a network of shady operators engaging in unacceptable practices, errant retailers obscure the view of their neighbouring businesses about positive business opportunities and gradually sapping the confidence of those around them about their ability to expand in a positive manner.",9,634,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00634
2016-09-13-T-022,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Fortunately, relative to the size of the economy, problems with errant retailers have been confined to only a very small group. Unfortunately, reports about how certain practices have arisen to exploit loopholes have a certain repetitive ring to them. In view of this, it is important that the agency tasked with enforcing consumer protection laws takes a proactive approach. Rather than plugging each loophole as it arises or seeking to have an ironclad protection from the get go, it may be better to address the development of such negative practices by looking at what are the root causes giving rise to them within our business eco-system.",10,635,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00635

2016-09-13-T-022,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"With the assignment of investigative and enforcement powers to SPRING Singapore, one area which I would urge the agency tasked with the new role to look into is whether the occurrences of claims and conflicts are synchronised with the general state of the economy, and if so, whether they tend to increase or decrease as the economy weakens. Although there is no conclusive evidence that either is true, the statistics published on the CASE website about the top 10 categories in which complaints are received cover virtually all the main areas of domestic economic activity that we know. Understanding whether the frequency of complaints from consumers about errant business practices is related to cyclical business activity would help in the management and education about potential areas of conflict.",12,637,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00637

Will it also be given the authority to address flaws or weaknesses in the business eco-system, if its investigation of cases reveals that there are, for instance, perverse incentives, which fuel the growth of poor business practices? For the same reasons that I believe that the involvement of the Police in consumer disputes is not the correct approach, I would urge the agency – when it takes on the appointment under this Bill – to explore how to promote efficient and sustainable approaches to enforcement, with a view to keeping costs as low as possible.",14,639,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00639

Unfair practices are defined in the Second Schedule of the CPFTA. However, many retailers will not be aware of these provisions or how they are operationalised and practised.

For example, in Australia, the Consumer and Competition Commission requires grocery stores to display unit prices clearly for the produce that they sell. That Commission also defines certain types of contract clauses as oppressive and, hence, illegal. Will this kind of proactive preventive groundwork also be done in Singapore?

An effective and responsive consumer protection framework helps to provide this check and balance.

They are timely changes, strengthen our consumer protection framework by increasing the measures which may be taken against the few egregious players, to maintain a high level of trust in our retail sector.",3,692,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00692

I was very happy to hear from my resident, Mr Choo Ming Yong, 69 years old. He is an avid photographer who recently bought a camera worth about $3,000. He checked out different retailers to compare the prices of the model he was interested in and he also noted the warranty terms and period before finally deciding on his purchase. This practice, he told me, has resulted in him being a happier consumer, who is more satisfied with his current buy than the previous camera purchases a few years back. For Mr Choo, being more aware as a consumer paid off. I am therefore strongly of a view that even as we strengthen the CPFTA, our efforts on the consumer education front must also continue.

MTI has worked with CASE on broad-based initiatives and targeted efforts to reach more vulnerable consumer segments, for example the elderly, based on their specific concerns. With effect from this month, CASE will also work with the five CDCs, Community Development Councils, over the next three years to roll out consumer education talks and reach out to heartlanders. The talks will teach consumers what they should look out for when making purchases, especially for products and services that have attracted high volume of complains, like the consumers to read and understand the terms of conditions of the deal before entering into a transaction.

Beyond that businesses may go further by volunteering to provide pre-payment protection if they collect advance payments from consumers. They may do so by purchasing business insurance which is already available for spa wellness, fitness and renovation sectors.

In an era where information is widely available, a few errant businesses cheating consumers for short-term gains will not only cause losses for the consumers, but also sully the reputation of the entire retail and service industry.

The Courts may also require the retailers to inform the administering agency of any changes in employment involving consumer transactions to prevent them from side-stepping injunction orders by setting up new entities. Such a measure will only be effective if there are regular spot checks conducted on the ground against errant retailers.

2016-09-13-T-022,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"I would like to take this opportunity to request the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the relevant agencies to look into how we can offer better protection to consumers. There are three areas of concern. The first pertains to consumers who are the initial victims of an errant retailer. Under the revised Act, potential consumers would benefit from the injunction orders as it allows them to steer clear of the errant retailers. But what about the victims in the first instances? How would they obtain compensation? Cost and complexity of process are often reasons given by victims for their reluctance in pursuing compensation.",7,744,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00744
2016-09-13-T-022,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"My second concern is whether the revised Act covers online retailers, both registered and unregistered entities. Currently, it seems like the Act is only able to act on brick-and-mortar retailers, which does not reflect the current landscape of the retail sector.",8,745,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00745
2016-09-13-T-022,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"My third concern is the sudden business closures that impact consumers, particularly in the fitness and beauty industries. More can be done to better protect the interests of customers of businesses that abruptly close. It is a common practice among fitness centres and beauty salons to sell ""lifetime memberships"" and packages spanning several years. Thousands of dollars are paid upfront before any services or products are utilised. While such business models are not illegal, customers will lose their hard-earned money when a gym or a salon closes down suddenly, much like what happened with California Fitness recently. Even when the company undergoes liquidation, the chances of customers getting their money back is remote.",9,746,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00746
2016-09-13-T-022,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"For many victims, legal avenues are the only way that they could possibly be able to get some of their money back, so laws should be strengthened to protect them, regardless of whether the transaction is with an online or a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the Minister could share some thoughts on whether there are any upcoming plans to address these issues, it would be much appreciated.",10,747,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00747
2016-09-13-T-022,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Sir, the proposed amendments in the Bill serve to help create a more level playing field between retailers and consumers. It serves to keep errant retailers in check, which will hopefully enhance our nation's reputation as a retail and shopping haven. However, consumers are still vulnerable against errant retailers and I urge more to be done to address this disparity. Sir, I support the Bill.",11,748,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00748
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill, which I feel touches the hearts of many as not only were we at times at the receiving end of unfair practices but also from public feedback. The events in the last 12 months have seen a clamour for tighter laws so that the likes of Jover and others like him would not resurface to haunt innocent shoppers. I can still recall the pitiful look of the Vietnamese tourist who begged for the return of his money from the shop. This must never happen again in Singapore. We must come down harsh on such operators. However, in this fast-moving modern age, I feel consumer protection is one topic which will need a recurring review.",1,749,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00749
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I am pleased that the Bill would put a stop to the practice of unscrupulous retailers who open multiple outlets so that they can continue with their malpractices after they are caught. The new section under 12(G) would give the Board and its investigation officers very wide ranging investigative powers from pursuing the culprits to seizing of their goods for investigation. The amendment also gives the Court the powers to require the errant retailers to notify consumers that it is under an injunction order. However, speed is of the essence in any investigation.",2,750,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00750
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),I hope with the passage of this Bill the authorities will be able to move more expeditiously so that the errant retailers can be dealt with swiftly and expeditiously so that those are wronged can get early redress. There should be wide publicity so that the public knows where they can go to make reports against errant retailers.,3,751,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00751
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Now that SPRING is the administering agency after the Bill is passed, it would hopefully allow for faster action to be taken and for consumers are aware about the types of unfair practices and are able to seek redress more easily with one single agency.",4,752,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00752
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In taking on this additional role, I believe SPRING will see to it that its investigation team is backed up with the infrastructure to ensure that they are able to carry out their duties. Investigation work, as many of us may not realise, is more than just acting on complaints and recording statements. It is also about collating evidence and often this requires some strategising, maybe even surveillance work, so that the culprits can be caught with some element of surprise. While I know it will tap on the resources of the auxiliary police force, there should also be a team of officers from SPRING who can co-ordinate and liaise with the field officers. The work of the officers will be keenly followed by the public and I hope they will rise to the occasion when the time comes.",5,753,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00753
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"This is the age of consumerism. People work hard, earn more and spend more. As a result, more and more of these issues arise between consumers and retailers. I am sometimes at a loss why despite much publicity, consumers are still taken in by glib-tongued marketers. For example, the timeshare industry was in the limelight with numerous complaints being lodged to CASE by people who were cheated. Often, the victims would be lured with offers of being the lucky ones to win prizes, or specially selected in a draw, or the often-used trick of stopping someone to say ""Today is your lucky day and you are selected"" and so on. Many horror stories appeared in the media year after year, yet we still get people duped into various schemes. I have from time to time also seen a few residents of mine, housewives and retirees with families, become victims of these.",6,754,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00754
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Another nagging area I would like to raise is the question of online trading practices. Besides travel, the other most common purchases are fashion, lifestyle and food products as well as services. We are in an era where we are more reliant on technology for everything that we want. While technology may make it more efficient in the execution of a process, it often leaves gaps and many questions unanswered at times. It is quite impossible to seek clarification under such circumstances and replies are often less than satisfactory.",7,755,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00755
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Today, we have colourful and interactive websites selling products and services online. The sellers post photos, drawings, all kinds of media gimmicks, littered with superlatives. But what you see therein may not necessarily be what they actually represent. I am aware that there is such a thing as a ""return policy"" for online shopping but this is not the norm. Buyers are at the mercy of sellers who find it perfectly acceptable to not offer a return or exchange policy. If they do, they would indicate but in small print. So, you make the click and add it to your cart and you are off to spending good money for bad.",8,756,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00756

Worse, some online transactions are cross border so it probably creates some issues with the voluntary nature of the publicising of injunction orders on foreign-based websites.

2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Some people buy used goods not because they cannot afford new ones, but because they would like certain older designs that have a classic look. I hope the Minister can consider a provision where the buyer can ask for repairs or replacement of the product if it is misrepresented to the buyer. And, if this still cannot result in an acceptable resolution to the dispute, the buyer can choose to keep the goods but with a price reduction. The third option is to be able to return the item and get a full refund.",11,759,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00759
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),Another point I would like to raise is my request that the Bill limits the period in which companies can ask a consumer to sign for advanced payment for services contract. We should limit all such payments to not more than six calendar months. Operators should not ask clients to sign for packages that last for so long and lure them with discounts.,12,760,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00760
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),This practice is especially prevalent in the healthcare and fitness industry and I feel that we should nip this problem in the bud rather than allow the public to continue to be fleeced by unscrupulous operators.,13,761,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00761
2016-09-13-T-022,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Often the operators know that their ship is sinking yet they failed to inform their staff to stop signing on more customers.

Maybe SPRING could look into a certain platform where people can be alerted to scammers, including foreign ones so that at least the buyers can get some form of warning. Otherwise, the spread of word via Whatsapp, e-forums, Facebook and so on, may go unnoticed and people are also wary of believing whether what was posted was true or just a prank. At the end of the day, I feel that there is so much that the authorities can do but as consumers we too must be vigilant and do not fall for the freebies and other gimmicks.",15,763,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00763

But when there is a shortage of trust, consumers become afraid, consumers are worried, customers become scared. Some might say, ""Let the buyer beware"". In Latin, caveat emptor. But taken too far, this becomes harmful. In a market with too little trust, buyers are fearful – caveat emptor becomes timet emptor. Instead of ""Let the buyer beware"", it becomes ""Let the buyer be afraid"". Or to put it another way, without adequate safeguards, caveat emptor can become bo cheng hu – if Mr Deputy Speaker will allow me to use the vernacular. When the market is short on trust, consumers miss out on potentially good offers, while sellers miss out on potential sales. There can be market failure.",2,765,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00765
2016-09-13-T-022,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Trust is also a shared common good for the whole community. In a shopping mall, the whole business community benefits, when the mall has a good reputation collectively for honourable merchants and shop owners. But there is also the problem of freeloaders and, in particular, what I will call ""reputation polluters"" – shops which treat consumers badly and unfairly, making unfair profits, polluting the reputation of neighbouring businesses and the entire mall. And, as we have seen in the past, dishonourable operators evading legal injunctions by changing the name of the company, finding proxies. Other Members in this House have pointed this out.",3,766,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00766

There have been cases in the media involving prepaid packages, where consumers pay a significant amount upfront for goods or services which have yet to be provided. Even if a copy of the contract is provided to the customer, it may be too late to seek justice once the contract has been signed. So, will the Ministry consider introducing a cooling-off period for prepaid packages, especially those involving large amounts of payment upfront? This has precedent in the insurance industry.

I would like to clarify that the current Unfair Practice No 11 in the Second Schedule of the CPFTA already makes it clear that it is an unfair practice for a retailer to take advantage of a consumer by including in an agreement terms or conditions that are harsh, oppressive or excessively one-sided so as to be unconscionable.

I would like to clarify that taking advantage of a consumer by exerting undue pressure or undue influence on the consumer to enter into a transaction involving goods or services is already an Unfair Practice under No 12 of the Second Schedule in the CPFTA. A consumer who encounters such an unfair practice may provide feedback too and seek assistance from CASE to obtain redress from the retailer concerned.

Well, the term in the Bill did say that a retailer charging a price for goods or services that is substantially higher than the estimate provided to the consumer, except where the consumer has agreed to a higher price in advance.

I would like to say that it is common practice for businesses to offer various choices to their customers which include pre-paid packages, early bird discounts and maybe even limited time offers. This is a reflection of the diversity of our retail landscape, as retailers are constantly thinking of new ideas, good ways to attract and to serve customers.

Ms Thanalatchimi also asked if CPFTA covers consumer to consumer transactions. I must clarify that the CPFTA applies only to business to consumer transactions. Agents who carry on a business by assisting local consumers to purchase from foreign websites are considered as suppliers and they are therefore subject to the measures under the CPFTA if they engage in unfair business practices.,23,795,2016-09-13-T-022-S-00795

If you are my friend, and we decide to buy something from each other, then that is a one-off thing, that is not necessarily a business transaction. That is a consumer-to-consumer transaction.

2016-09-13-T-024,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Thank you, Sir. I would like to thank the Minister of State for his clarifications and detailed replies. I just have one point of clarification – will the Ministry consider requiring more operators to display signages, posters or such like to remind consumers of their rights, and the things that they need to look out for and the recourse that they can have, in case they have been cheated?",1,848,2016-09-13-T-024-S-00848
2016-09-13-T-024,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"As the debate today shows, consumers need to be educated and there can be no better way to educate them than at the point of purchase within the shopping environment. I fear that this is something that individual mall operators, left to their devices, may not be inclined to do because it may create an unfavourable impression on the shopper. But that is something the Government could require them to do, and it is something I have seen in other countries as well. Thank you.",2,849,2016-09-13-T-024-S-00849
2016-09-13-T-024,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,I thank the Member for his suggestion. I think this is something that CASE will probably study and see if it is doable with the various malls or trade associations to enhance consumer education.,1,850,2016-09-13-T-024-S-00850

2016-09-13-T-024,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing,"In the case of renovation contractors, the sums are very big; it could be $30,000. Can we sort of lower the bar so that if there is clear evidence of unfair practices where the contractor provide very poor service, then we do not wait until many, many people suffer from this before SPRING investigates? Thank you.",2,852,2016-09-13-T-024-S-00852
2016-09-13-T-024,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not to say that you need to have a huge number of cases before action can be taken. In the first instance, if there is unfair business practice that the consumers have given feedback to CASE, and if CASE genuinely believes, after a few cases, that there is a consistent pattern of behaviour in certain particular retailer and they feel strongly that there is unfair practice going on, they can already refer this to SPRING to consider, to look and see whether there is evidence for further action to be taken. But the quantum of the sum that is involved does not itself mean that there is egregious behaviour on-going, it has to be something that is clearly unfair and in terms of its practices. Thank you.",1,853,2016-09-13-T-024-S-00853

2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"If I were to ask the question  are we a sporting nation? I am sure some will say yes, some will say no. Yes, because many exercise stations in our residential precincts, many brisk-walk groups. We have Vision 2030 and we have Olympic gold medal and Paralympic gold medals. But many would still say, ""No, we have yet to be a sporting nation"". Why? There are several reasons. I will give you four reasons.",2,862,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00862
2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"First, the episode on ""live"" telecast of the Olympics Games. We nearly missed the opportunity to witness ""live"", the historical moment presented by our Joseph Schooling. The Sunday before the start of the Olympics, that is, 31 July, which was six days before the opening ceremony, our Minister reiterated that watching delayed broadcast would be a different way of celebrating.",3,863,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00863
2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Immediately, there was a lot of response on the ground. A lot of discussions in the coffeeshops, friends' gatherings, and a lot of my residents asked me, ""Is our Government too calculative?"" And they said that we can afford to pay hundreds of millions for the English Premier League, and yet, we cannot afford to pay for Olympics ""live"" telecast. And I have residents who even suggest, ""Why don't we collect $1 from each of us? Six million people, $6 million!""",4,864,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00864
2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"And for those of you who are sporting fans, you will know it is miles apart – a lot of difference compared to watching ""live"" telecast and delayed telecast. If you already know the results, the excitement is no longer there. Do we understand sports enough? Is there a lack of sporting culture?",5,865,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00865
2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"We, as a nation, send athletes to compete in the Olympics was not prepared to fork out money for ""live"" telecast. Yet, we proclaim we know the importance and the value of sports in unifying people, in inspiring people, and so on. We must not leave this to commercial decision. An opportunity to unite the nation should not be left to a commercial decision. I hope that in future, the relevant bodies  MCCY, Mediacorp, cable TV operators and telcos can pull their resources together and prepare their negotiations far ahead of time, allocate the budget to ensure we are guaranteed a contract to broadcast major sporting events ""live"", including all major games that our athletes are taking part in.",6,866,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00866
2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"For a first-world nation, it is almost unthinkable if Singaporeans are denied of this.

2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The second reason – it is National Service (NS) deferment. I had lunch with May and Colin Schooling before May left for Rio. I have known May for a long time. From time to time, she would share with me the challenges and the problems that she is facing. During that lunch, she shared with me her number one headache at that time, that is, Joseph Schooling's NS deferment. She said she has submitted reports, however, there was no concrete answer. It gave people the impression that our MINDEF is high-handed, is too rigid, and they will tell you the answer when they are ready to give you the answer. And MCCY gave people the impression that either they have no power or is not interested. And some civil servants even think that Olympic medals are not important.",8,868,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00868
2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"So, our poor Joseph Schooling was under great pressure, not just to prepare for Olympics, but he had to deal with the problem of whether he needed to come back for NS, after end-August.

But still, deferment is ad hoc, and only on case-by-case basis. So, parents are still left unsure if they should support their sons in their desire to pursue their sporting dream or whether they should take the proven route and get back to the academic road.",11,871,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00871
2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I think MINDEF and MCCY could have done better in supporting our Olympic-bound athletes.

2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"In Korea, all male citizens are required to undergo 21 months of compulsory military service. I was told that Korean athletes representing their country get to decide when they serve their national service, so long as they serve before they turn 30 years old. As in the case of Singapore, the issue is a thorny one. The conscription law in Korea states that those who have contributed significantly to the nation through athletic or artistic skills are exempted from military duties. The only requirement is that they must go through four weeks of combat training. This law currently exempts athletes who win a medal at the Olympics or finish first in the Asian Games.",13,873,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00873
2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"In Singapore, athletes falling under this group is very small. For the Rio Olympics, it was only Quah Zheng Wen and Joseph Schooling. Can we afford to let them decide their NS deferment? I am sure we can. As Ang Peng Siong mentioned in his recent interview, one would need at least two Olympic cycles or even more in order to realise their Olympic dream. If the athletes, the swimmers can decide their own NS deferment, it would take away this additional pressure of what if they have to come back to serve their NS? Does it mean their dream of Olympic is dashed?",14,874,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00874
2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The third reason – more funding for Singapore Sports School. A lot of people know that May and Colin Schooling spent more than $1 million on Joseph Schooling. Not many parents can spend that $1 million. While the spexScholarship supports elite athletes and para athletes, can Government do more? Can we further enhance the Sports School or NSAs? Can we set aside more funding so that we can tailor make programmes for those athletes that show potential? We can send athletes with potential overseas for longer term attachment, for example one to two years in Bolles School in USA for swimmers. I was told that it is so much of the curriculum but because over there, it gives the swimmers a lot more opportunities to compete.",15,875,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00875
2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The fourth reason – sports for every student who is keen in sports. When I told my friends that I am going to speak in Parliament on this topic, they tell me that, ""Yes. We need to have more opportunities for every student who is keen in sports to play sports in school."" I thought this is already being made available. So, I asked the principals in schools. They told me, ""Yes. Every student got a chance to play because they can play during recess time."" How long is recess time? Thirty minutes.

Our school only had two table tennis tables, put along the corridor. We have one basketball court which is clay court. And we played after school until it was dark. And in my Secondary school, it was better equipped. It had all the sports clubs – badminton club, table tennis club, basketball club, netball club, athletic club. We were free to join to join any clubs. We can join more than one club. And that is why I could play many different sports and I represented NTU in five games.",17,877,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00877

While the Government will continue to support our athletes, we must not forget the work it takes to groom a Team Singapore athlete – years of training by the committed athlete supported by a dedicated team of coaches and sports specialists. And at the heart of it all, is the special role of family and friends in providing a secure and encouraging environment for our athletes.",18,901,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00901

2016-09-13-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like the Minister  would MCCY work with MINDEF to come up with something that is more transparent so that athletes know very sure that whether the NS deferment has to be on a case-on-case basis. For example, if let us say they have already qualified for the Olympics, can we allow them to decide how long they want to defer their NS so long as maybe we fix the age limit? Would MCCY work on that? Thank you.",1,904,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00904
2016-09-13-T-026,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Indeed, there is a matrix and the matrix actually track the progress of athletes through time and also established milestones. In the case of Schooling, I think whether he medalled with a gold, silver or bronze, he would have gotten a deferment. So, indeed, there is an established matrix and information will be given to the athletes at an appropriate time.",1,905,2016-09-13-T-026-S-00905

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will be reconstructing them to connect all four locations. This will be an improvement over today’s situation. LTA will also be installing lifts at the entrances and exits of the reconstructed underpasses.",1,910,2016-09-13-T-027-S-00910
2016-09-13-T-028,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Home Affairs how SGSecure will help foster the unity needed to overcome threats to Singapore.,1,911,2016-09-13-T-028-S-00911
2016-09-13-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,SGSecure is a call to action to Singaporeans to unite and prepare for the threat of a terrorist attack.,1,912,2016-09-13-T-028-S-00912
2016-09-13-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"SGSecure builds on the work that we embarked upon in 2006 under the Community Engagement Programme, or CEP. The CEP began as an initiative to preserve and strengthen communal harmony and cohesion in the aftermath of a terror attack. We decided to do this because we saw what happened after the London 7/7 bombings in 2005, when some segments of the community became targets of hate crime. Over time, the CEP expanded its objectives to also prepare our people to be resilient and better prepared for any crisis or emergency. In the last 10 years, the CEP has laid the groundwork and built networks of trust, so that we will stand strong and united.",2,913,2016-09-13-T-028-S-00913
2016-09-13-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In today’s heightened security climate, it is even more urgent that we continue to strengthen the bonds among our various communities. Terrorist attacks can have a crippling effect on societies that extends beyond the physical devastation. In some instances, we have seen how terrorism has fomented distrust among fellow citizens, making their efforts to stand united and bounce back as one people more challenging.",3,914,2016-09-13-T-028-S-00914
2016-09-13-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"There are lessons for Singapore in this regard. We must ask ourselves how we will react when a terrorist attack happens here, especially if the perpetrators are fellow Singaporeans. Will our communal ties remain strong? Will we be able to overcome suspicion and fear? Will we refrain from pointing fingers, and instead help and support fellow Singaporeans, regardless of race or religion, to overcome the trauma of an attack?",4,915,2016-09-13-T-028-S-00915
2016-09-13-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To enhance our community response, two key pillars in SGSecure – ""Stay United"" and ""Stay Strong"" – will specifically focus on the need for the community to stay united in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, to pull closer together by helping one another, and to be able to bounce back quickly to show that we will not be cowed.",5,916,2016-09-13-T-028-S-00916
2016-09-13-T-028,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"SGSecure will be officially launched by the Prime Minister on 24 September. Members will hear more about the SGSecure programmes which MHA and its partner agencies will be rolling out across the various domains, such as schools, workplaces, national service community and community groups.",6,917,2016-09-13-T-028-S-00917
2016-09-13-T-029,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,"asked the Minister for National Development what action can be taken towards recalcitrant HDB residents who create persistent problems for their neighbours such as noise pollution, hoarding, cluttering public areas, poor environmental hygiene and disrupting the peace.",1,918,2016-09-13-T-029-S-00918
2016-09-13-T-029,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The approach to take depends on the nature of the issue involved. If there are clear regulatory breaches by these ""recalcitrant residents"", then it is best to approach the relevant agency. For instance, if the issue is over obstruction of the common corridor, and there is a clear breach of the rules, then residents can approach the Town Councils. If it is a case of smoking or littering, then NEA will enforce. Or if it is a case of hoarding, then HDB officers will step in to carry out inspections, and if the hoarding is assessed to be excessive, HDB will ask the residents to remove the unwanted items.",1,919,2016-09-13-T-029-S-00919
2016-09-13-T-029,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sometimes, the anti-social behaviours may not be regulatory breaches but involve private disputes between neighbours. In such cases, we want as much as possible for the individuals concerned to take responsibility and ownership of their own issues. They should first speak to each other and strive to resolve the matter amicably. If the issue cannot be resolved, disputants can seek help from a neutral third party, such as a grassroots leader to facilitate resolution. Such intervention or informal mediation goes a long way to prevent simple conflicts from escalating further.",2,920,2016-09-13-T-029-S-00920
2016-09-13-T-029,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Should informal mediation be unsuccessful, the case can be referred to the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) for mediation. Where the cases involve long-standing and intractable disputes between neighbours, the aggrieved parties can bring a claim to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals as a last resort.",3,921,2016-09-13-T-029-S-00921
2016-09-13-T-030,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what has been the overall take-up rate for pre-fabricated construction in the building industry for (i) the public sector and (ii) the private sector; (b) what have been the key benefits of the Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) method; and (c) how will the Ministry be helping the industry to transit into pre-fabrication over the next few years.,1,922,2016-09-13-T-030-S-00922
2016-09-13-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In prefabricated construction, on-site construction activities are shifted to factories off-site. Components that are prefabricated in the factory are then transported to work sites for installation. This approach is called Design for Manufacturing and Assembly or DfMA. Prefabrication technologies from the DfMA spectrum include structural steel, Prefabricated Bathroom Units, Mass Engineered Timber, and Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction or PPVC.",1,923,2016-09-13-T-030-S-00923
2016-09-13-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The overall take up rate for prefabricated construction has been increasing. In the last three years (from 2013-2015) for example, the prefabrication level for public sector projects, in terms of constructed floor area, has increased from 30% to almost 50%. In tandem, the prefabrication level for private sector projects doubled from around 10% to around 20%.",2,924,2016-09-13-T-030-S-00924
2016-09-13-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This is a positive development because DfMA technologies result in significant manpower savings, shorter construction times, improved workmanship, and reduced dis-amenity to residents. One recent example is the Crowne Plaza Hotel Expansion project at Changi Airport. By using PPVC, the project achieved 40% on-site manpower savings and a three month reduction in construction time.",3,925,2016-09-13-T-030-S-00925
2016-09-13-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"However, we recognise that using new technologies comes with a steep learning curve and a cost premium. So under the Construction Productivity Roadmap, we have taken a multi-pronged approach to build up the DfMA ecosystem and help industry with this transition.",4,926,2016-09-13-T-030-S-00926
2016-09-13-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"(a) First, we are generating lead demand for these technologies through incorporating these building methods in public sector projects, and stipulating certain productivity requirements in government land sales. For example, at selected GLS sites, we have required at least 65% of the applicable floor area to be constructed using PPVC.",5,927,2016-09-13-T-030-S-00927
2016-09-13-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"(b) Second, we are building up our supply capacity by increasing our local production capability and bringing in qualified overseas suppliers;",6,928,2016-09-13-T-030-S-00928
2016-09-13-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"(c) Third, we are easing regulatory hurdles to facilitate the adoption of innovative and productive technologies;",7,929,2016-09-13-T-030-S-00929
2016-09-13-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"(d) Finally, through the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF), we will continue to incentivise the adoption of DfMA technologies and encourage industry practitioners to build up their manpower capabilities.",8,930,2016-09-13-T-030-S-00930
2016-09-13-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Taken together, these measures should drive down the cost premium by achieving greater economies of scale while reducing impediments to DfMA adoption. Ultimately, we hope to see the industry embrace more prefabrication in the future.",9,931,2016-09-13-T-030-S-00931
2016-09-13-T-031,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development whether BCA will consider setting the criteria of thermal comfort as a pre-requisite requirement for air-conditioned spaces in all new and existing non-residential buildings including commercial, industrial and institutional buildings as part of its Green Mark Award certification schemes.",1,932,2016-09-13-T-031-S-00932
2016-09-13-T-031,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The Green Mark certification scheme was launched in 2005 to shape a greener and more sustainable built environment. The scheme allows developers to evaluate and benchmark their buildings to established environmental performance standards. There are both pre-requisite and voluntary criteria in the certification process.,1,933,2016-09-13-T-031-S-00933
2016-09-13-T-031,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Under the revised Green Mark certification scheme of 2015, designing for thermal comfort is now a pre-requisite for certification for all new non-residential buildings. This includes commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings. The specifications for thermal comfort are based on the Singapore Standards on air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation in buildings.",2,934,2016-09-13-T-031-S-00934
2016-09-13-T-031,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Thermal comfort is currently a voluntary criterion for existing non-residential buildings applying for Green Mark certification today. BCA is reviewing the scheme and will consult industry stakeholders for their views.,3,935,2016-09-13-T-031-S-00935
2016-09-13-T-031,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ultimately, how comfortable the indoor environment is depends on how the building is operated. We encourage building owners and managers to be responsive to the needs of their tenants and dwellers.",4,936,2016-09-13-T-031-S-00936
2016-09-13-T-032,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider accreditation and licensing of the psychologist profession and the setting up of professional standards so that the interest of Singaporeans seeking such services is safeguarded.,1,937,2016-09-13-T-032-S-00937

2016-09-13-T-032,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In comparison, Psychotherapy is broadly used for mental health therapy, marriage and family therapy and other personal social problems. Health care professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, medical social workers and nurses can apply psychotherapy or a form of it in their course of work. It is also used in non-health care related counselling. Psychotherapy is thus less well-defined and given its use across different groups and in different life situations and settings, it would be impractical to regulate the practice of psychotherapy currently.",3,941,2016-09-13-T-032-S-00941

We also raised the per capital monthly income for households with persons with disabilities from $875 to $1,125. These changes have enabled another 5,000 households to benefit from the scheme over the next five years. The second enhancement makes provision to allow special education students already on financial assistance to receive a subsidy of up to 75% more easily. Previously, there would be an assessment on whether their subsidies are pegged at up to 50% or 75%. Now, they would qualify for the up to 75% directly.",5,948,2016-09-13-T-033-S-00948

2016-09-13-T-037,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"The Ministry of Education (MOE) places great emphasis on the security and well-being of students and staff in our schools. A three-pronged security approach is adopted. First, schools are fenced and equipped with CCTV surveillance systems and gate barriers manned by security officers to control access. Second, there are security protocol and procedures to regulate movement within the schools. Third, the school maintains close partnerships with the neighbourhood police and the community at large.",1,966,2016-09-13-T-037-S-00966
2016-09-13-T-037,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,School staff and students are reminded to be vigilant and alert the authorities in the event of any suspicious activities or intruders. The Police also engage schools and communities through outreach programmes and disseminate security-related advisories.,2,967,2016-09-13-T-037-S-00967
2016-09-13-T-037,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,These school security measures are appropriately calibrated to the overall security environment of the country based on the threat assessment provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). MOE routinely reviews our security measures for effectiveness to ensure the robustness of our school security measures.,3,968,2016-09-13-T-037-S-00968
2016-09-13-T-037,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,The effort to prepare schools for emergencies has been put in place for some time now since 1990s. It is part of the national programme to prepare for civil emergencies and contingencies.,4,969,2016-09-13-T-037-S-00969
2016-09-13-T-037,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"All schools have a School Emergency Structure to deal with emergencies to respond, recover and restore the situation back to normalcy. School leaders, staff and students do take part in regular emergency training exercises to practise how to handle emergency situations in the school, including security incidents. The Police and SCDF are also involved in such training exercises and drills, and there is a robust relationship between the schools and the communities for effective collaboration in emergency responses.",5,970,2016-09-13-T-037-S-00970
2016-09-13-T-037,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Ultimately, the key to addressing the growing security threats lies in greater community vigilance. Safety and security is a shared responsibility and each of us has a role to play. MOE will continue to review and update our school security and emergency plans, and to work with the Police and MHA to deter terrorist or criminal activity in our schools, and to respond effectively.",6,971,2016-09-13-T-037-S-00971
2016-09-13-T-038,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Singapore Medical Council is aware that some managed care companies require doctors to pay administrative fees for the ""referral"" of patients and, if so, what is their response; and (b) whether this practice will result in patients having to pay more.",1,972,2016-09-13-T-038-S-00972
2016-09-13-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Managed care has been a feature of our healthcare landscape for many years. Managed care companies serve to provide intermediary services to various stakeholders such as insurers, corporations, healthcare providers and patients.",1,973,2016-09-13-T-038-S-00973
2016-09-13-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In recent months, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) have received feedback from individual doctors and the Singapore Medical Association (SMA) regarding managed care companies, or third party administrators (TPAs), entering into contracts with doctors, where the doctor would commit to pay a fee for each patient referred by the TPA.",2,974,2016-09-13-T-038-S-00974
2016-09-13-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"This raises concerns that TPA's decisions on patient referral may be influenced by the fee arrangement rather than the interest of the patients. The doctor may in turn pass on the cost of the referral fee to the patient through higher charges. In some cases, the patient may not be aware of this, especially if his bills are fully covered by his insurance plan or employee benefits. It is of particular concern if the fee is determined as a percentage of the doctor’s charges, without relation to the actual services rendered by the TPA.",3,975,2016-09-13-T-038-S-00975
2016-09-13-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The SMC is revising its current Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines, which already addresses fee-sharing between doctors, to also address fee-sharing between doctors and TPAs. The revised guidelines will explicitly state that doctors must not allow financial arrangements in managed care to lead to any compromise in the care of the patient.",4,976,2016-09-13-T-038-S-00976
2016-09-13-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH is also working with the medical professional bodies and associations to raise doctors' awareness of appropriate arrangements with TPAs. We will continue to work with the Life Insurance Association to remind the Integrated Shield Plan (IP) insurers to ensure that their appointed TPAs, if any, should not have any conflict of interest and should disclose to policyholders any financial arrangements they have with the doctor.",5,977,2016-09-13-T-038-S-00977
2016-09-13-T-039,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider providing subsidised or free health screening packages for the insured under MediShield Life.,1,978,2016-09-13-T-039-S-00978
2016-09-13-T-039,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Evidence-based health screening plays an important role in helping individuals to detect chronic diseases early for prompt treatment. Since 2014, the Health Promotion Board has partnered GP clinics under the Screen for Life programme to provide free screening tests and subsidies for follow-up consultations for Pioneers and Community Health Assist Scheme cardholders.",1,979,2016-09-13-T-039-S-00979
2016-09-13-T-039,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, community health screenings are conducted by our Regional Health Systems.

2016-09-13-T-039,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As part of the War on Diabetes, MOH is reviewing the Screen for Life programme to encourage and support more Singaporeans in the target groups to undergo evidence-based screening, and importantly, to follow-up with a doctor if they have any abnormal screening results.",4,982,2016-09-13-T-039-S-00982
2016-09-13-T-040,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Manpower in view of Indonesia's plans to supply new foreign domestic workers (FDWs) on the condition that they do not have to live together with the employers (a) how will this position affect the supply of Indonesian FDWs to Singapore; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider abolishing the $5,000 security bond for such live-out FDWs.",1,983,2016-09-13-T-040-S-00983
2016-09-13-T-040,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,The Indonesian authorities have not formally informed MOM of its plans for non-live in FDWs. Our employment agencies have also not reported disruption to the supply of live-in foreign domestic workers (FDWs) from Indonesia. We continue to welcome Indonesian FDWs into Singapore.,1,984,2016-09-13-T-040-S-00984
2016-09-13-T-040,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The Security Bond (SB) applies to employers of FDWs, as well as foreign workers. It is to ensure that employers and workers comply with Work Permit conditions and is not tied to the live-in requirement. Hence, the issue of abolishing the security bond for non-live in FDWs does not arise.",2,985,2016-09-13-T-040-S-00985

2016-09-13-T-041,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Minister for National Development what are the considerations and deliberations behind the decision to convert coupon parking to electronic parking systems within residential neighbourhoods.,1,987,2016-09-13-T-041-S-00987
2016-09-13-T-041,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The electronic parking system (EPS) was initially implemented at all car parks serving Neighbourhood Centres and Town Centres to better manage the high parking demand, and thus far, it has been effective in doing so.",1,988,2016-09-13-T-041-S-00988
2016-09-13-T-041,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"With a per-minute charging structure, the EPS is also a fairer system as motorists will pay for the actual duration of parking, instead of half hour blocks if they use parking coupons. Furthermore, it is more convenient for motorists as they are informed when a car park is full so that they can park in another location.",2,989,2016-09-13-T-041-S-00989
2016-09-13-T-041,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"While there are upfront capital costs in setting up EPS at car parks, on average, the EPS has resulted in cost savings of 25% in the of daily operating costs of car parks as compared to the coupon parking system. With the benefits cited above, HDB will be implementing EPS at all residential car parks where it is feasible to do so.",3,990,2016-09-13-T-041-S-00990
2016-09-13-T-042,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the courses of action when a potential teacher or staff tests positive for tuberculosis (TB) during pre-employment screening; (b) what are the precautionary measures that affected and non-affected schools or child care centres should take; and (c) what is the potential for TB spreading in schools or child care centres given exposure to an infected person.,1,991,2016-09-13-T-042-S-00991
2016-09-13-T-042,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Under the Child Care Centres Regulations, new staff members need to undergo a chest X-ray and be certified to be free from active tuberculosis by a registered medical practitioner before they can start work in centres. Centres are also advised to monitor for any persistent coughing among their staff members and children to allow for early diagnosis and treatment.",1,992,2016-09-13-T-042-S-00992
2016-09-13-T-042,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Child care centres are required by law to immediately report any known or suspected tuberculosis cases to parents of all children enrolled in their child care centre, a health officer, and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). Similar precautionary measures are implemented in schools, which are required to pre-screen their staff before they start work, and report known tuberculosis cases to the Ministry of Education (MOE).",2,993,2016-09-13-T-042-S-00993
2016-09-13-T-042,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Upon diagnosing a case of active tuberculosis, the Tuberculosis Control Unit conducts free contact tracing among children and staff members to identify those at risk of contracting tuberculosis. These individuals will then be offered free tuberculosis screening. The Ministry of Health also notifies ECDA and MOE of cases in child care centres and schools respectively. Meanwhile, staff members who test positive for active tuberculosis are not permitted to enter the child care centre or school until they are certified to be fit for return by a registered medical practitioner.",3,994,2016-09-13-T-042-S-00994

2016-09-13-T-042,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Persons without symptoms do not pose further risk of infection to others. Most persons with the latent form of tuberculosis also do not develop the infectious form. Furthermore, persons with active tuberculosis rapidly become non-infectious once they start their treatment. In any case, persons with symptoms cannot transmit the disease through activities, such as sharing utensils or hand shaking. Transmission is limited to close and prolonged contact with persons showing symptoms of tuberculosis.",5,996,2016-09-13-T-042-S-00996
2016-09-13-T-042,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Child care centres and schools generally abide by the precautionary measures and regulatory safeguards. They also work closely with the Tuberculosis Control Unit, and ECDA or MOE to ensure the safety of children.",6,997,2016-09-13-T-042-S-00997

2016-09-13-T-043,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Chironomids or non-biting midges are a type of flying insects that thrive near water bodies such as canals, ponds and reservoirs. They are a natural part of the aquatic ecosystem and are food for fishes and birds. While they neither bite human beings nor spread any disease, they can pose nuisance when they swarm in large numbers. In recent months, PUB has observed an increase in the emergence of chironomids around the HDB blocks near Pandan Reservoir, largely due to the intermittent hot and wet weather.",1,999,2016-09-13-T-043-S-00999
2016-09-13-T-043,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,PUB has been actively monitoring the chironomid population and has stepped up measures to control the population and reduce inconvenience to nearby residents. These include regular removal of chironomid eggs from the reservoir's floating structures; increasing the frequency and dosage of the application of biological liquid larvicide Bti (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) from three times to five times per week along the reservoir perimeter to kill chironomid larvae; and increasing the frequency of fogging and misting around the reservoir dyke and surrounding vegetation to kill adult chironomids.,2,1000,2016-09-13-T-043-S-01000
2016-09-13-T-043,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition, PUB has installed bright spotlights at the Pandan Reservoir pumping station and turned them on at night to attract the adult chironomids and deter them from flying into nearby residential areas. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our measures accordingly.",3,1001,2016-09-13-T-043-S-01001
2016-09-13-T-043,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To keep residents living in the vicinity of Pandan Reservoir informed of the chironomid situation, PUB has recently issued a joint advisory with NEA and the West Coast Town Council on the measures taken by the agencies and actions residents can take within their premises.

Therefore, we also seek residents' understanding and tolerance, should they find these harmless chironomids in their homes.",5,1003,2016-09-13-T-043-S-01003
2016-09-13-T-044,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Government will consider prohibiting shops, supermarkets and sales outlets from providing free plastic bags in order to minimise their usage and reduce the harmful impact they have on our environment.",1,1004,2016-09-13-T-044-S-01004
2016-09-13-T-044,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Plastic bags are of particular concern in countries where waste is landfilled, resulting in the plastic bags remaining in the landfill for a long time, or finding their way into water bodies or the sea, affecting marine life and food sources. In Singapore, this effect is minimised as all incinerable waste, including plastic bags, are incinerated safely at our waste-to-energy plants before they are landfilled as ash.",1,1005,2016-09-13-T-044-S-01005
2016-09-13-T-044,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Notwithstanding this, my Ministry upholds the approach of avoiding excessive consumption of plastic bags to reduce waste generation and carbon emissions. We encourage shoppers to take only what plastic bags they need and to re-use them to bag household trash. We also encourage the habitual use of reusable bags as much as possible. Stakeholders such as retailers also play a role in encouraging and educating consumers to bring their own bags and reduce the use of plastic bags. One example is IKEA which does not provide free disposable plastic bags for its shoppers.",2,1006,2016-09-13-T-044-S-01006
2016-09-13-T-044,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"My Ministry will continue to look into additional ways to reduce the excessive consumption of plastic bags. Last month, the National Environment Agency called for a tender to study how different types of single-use carriers compare in terms of cost and impact on the environment.

If the product is a complex one, the FA's senior management must confirm with the customer that he or she has been properly informed of the risks of proceeding with the investment. Such follow-ups also serve as an additional opportunity for vulnerable customers to state if they wish to proceed with their transactions, having understood the risks of the products.",6,1025,2016-09-13-T-048-S-01025

For example, the forms and sales documents used by some FAs are available in different languages to help customers who are not well-versed in English. FAs also encourage vulnerable customers to bring along a relative or friend whom they trust and who is able to explain to them what is being presented by the representative. Some FAs have made it mandatory for their representatives to seek senior management's approval for all transactions entered into by vulnerable customers even where the product is not complex.",7,1026,2016-09-13-T-048-S-01026

2016-09-13-T-049,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"(b) The risks of developing certain age-related complications during pregnancy are not mitigated by egg freezing. For example, pregnancy-related diabetes and hypertension occurs more frequently in women above 40 years of age.

2016-09-13-T-049,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Medically, these issues can be addressed by regulation, as well as enhanced public education and counselling to potential users. However, this issue cannot be decided purely on medical considerations. There are also social and ethical implications that need to be considered carefully. The expectation that egg-freezing guarantees fertility preservation might not be met, thus resulting in greater disappointment for couples who delay marriage and parenthood4 and yet are later not able to conceive using this method. They will be left with few alternatives then. It also introduces questions about the treatment of unused eggs, including whether these eggs can be used for other purposes.",6,1034,2016-09-13-T-049-S-01034

2016-09-13-T-052,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"These costs have gone up, even with the implementation of the Electronic Parking System (EPS). With automation provided by EPS, HDB is able to save about 25% mainly on daily operating costs such as enforcement, attending to feedback and enquiries, as well as collection of parking charges.

2016-09-13-T-053,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In determining public car parking charges, the key principle is that car owners bear the full cost of ownership and usage of cars. This includes the cost of parking cars. Hence parking charges in our HDB estates are sized to cover the cost of building, operating and maintaining residential car parks. It would not be equitable for the Government to subsidise the cost of parking, as this would mean that non-car owners are subsidising car owners. Today, about 3 in 10 HDB households own cars, that is, the majority of our residents do not own cars",1,1058,2016-09-13-T-053-S-01058

We have adopted the co-mingled recycling approach as this makes it easier for residents to practise recycling and also makes the collection of recyclables more cost-effective. Co-mingled recycling is practised in various US cities as well as in parts of Europe and Australia. At the school recycling corners, educational materials are also made available to raise awareness of waste minimisation and recycling.

However, I think we should keep in mind that in response to higher commuter expectations, the Government has been rapidly expanding our rail network and injecting more buses and trains into the system, and also making costly improvements through restructuring the bus and rail industries. While these initiatives have improved our public transport system significantly, they have and will continue to increase the extent of government subsidies in public transport. For instance, under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme, the Government has committed $1.1 billion over five years. Under bus contracting, the Government will be subsidising about $3.5 to $4 billion in the next five years. Similarly, on the rail side, due to the Government taking over ownership of the operating assets under the New Rail Financing Model, the Government expects to spend over $4 billion on renewing, upgrading and expanding operating assets for the next five years. These will be on top of the $20 billion that the Government has committed to spend on building new rail lines in the same period.

2016-09-13-T-086,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In addition, for new development areas such as Punggol North, Tampines North and Bidadari, residents can look forward to new connectivity features that include pedestrian walkways enhanced with landscaping, and selected pedestrian routes that are lined with shops and social facilities to enhance the walking experience.",2,1213,2016-09-13-T-086-S-01213
2016-09-13-T-086,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For existing estates, residents can also look forward to connectivity enhancements that include new walkways, covered linkways, and also cycling and park connectors, where feasible, to improve the first-and-last mile journey to transport nodes and key amenities. These will be done mainly through the various estate rejuvenation programmes, such as the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) and the Remaking Our Heartland (ROH) programme.",3,1214,2016-09-13-T-086-S-01214
2016-09-13-T-087,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the best practices in terms of mitigation measures to manage dis-amenities arising from disruptive technology such as Airbnb which enable homeowners to list their private residential properties for short-term rental; and (b) what steps will the Ministry be embarking on next with respect to its decision on disruptive technology and homeowners offering accommodation for short-term rental via apps.,1,1215,2016-09-13-T-087-S-01215
2016-09-13-T-087,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Under the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) guidelines, residential premises cannot be rented out for a period of less than six months. Short-term rentals are therefore considered an unauthorized use subject to enforcement action. The basis for URA's enforcement action is to prevent dis-amenity to neighbouring residents, including privacy- and security-related concerns arising from the high turnover of transient guests in residential estates and developments.",1,1216,2016-09-13-T-087-S-01216
2016-09-13-T-087,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"URA investigates all suspected cases of unauthorised short-term rental. In the case of strata-titled developments, Management Corporations (MCSTs) have provided information to URA on specific premises within their developments in which dis-amenity concerns have arisen from the presence of transient guests. Once URA confirms a case of unauthorised short-term rental, it sends an enforcement notice to the person(s) responsible, including the owner of the premises, requiring the unauthorised use to cease.",2,1217,2016-09-13-T-087-S-01217
2016-09-13-T-087,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In 2015, URA conducted a public consultation exercise on short-term rentals. The review is still ongoing. The issue of allowing short-term rentals warrants careful and balanced review without a rush to conclusion. In particular, we must carefully consider the implications of doing so, given the potential impact and dis-amenity of such rentals on neighbouring residents. We are also studying relevant practices and regulations adopted by other cities, as well as their experiences thus far.",3,1218,2016-09-13-T-087-S-01218
2016-09-13-T-087,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In the meantime, URA's guidelines imposing a minimum rental duration of six months for private residential properties continue to apply.",4,1219,2016-09-13-T-087-S-01219
2016-09-13-T-088,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the breeding of dogs, cats and rabbits in Singapore for the purpose of sale as pets (a) whether AVA keeps track of the proportion of these animals sold versus the numbers bred; and (b) what happens to the animals that are not able to be sold.",1,1220,2016-09-13-T-088-S-01220
2016-09-13-T-088,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Currently, AVA does not track the proportion of cats and rabbits sold versus the numbers bred. AVA only has information on the number of dogs bred, via the production records submitted by pet breeders. AVA does not track the number of dogs sold.",1,1221,2016-09-13-T-088-S-01221
2016-09-13-T-088,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But moving forward, AVA will be able to track such data for dogs. AVA will soon require pet businesses such as pet farms and pet retailers to licence all dogs in their establishments, including dogs bred. When a dog is sold, the new owner has to register a licence and provide AVA with his/her particulars. With this information, AVA will be able to determine the proportion of dogs sold versus the numbers bred.",2,1222,2016-09-13-T-088-S-01222
2016-09-13-T-088,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Pet businesses may continue to keep the unsold animals or put them up for adoption. Under no circumstances should pet businesses abandon or ill-treat any animals under their charge. Under the Animals and Birds Act, all owners have a duty of care to animals under their charge. A pet business convicted for failure of duty of care may be liable for a fine of up to $40,000, or a jail term of up to two years, or both, for the first offence.",3,1223,2016-09-13-T-088-S-01223
2016-09-13-T-089,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many HDB void decks are raised platforms vis-a-vis the pavement surrounding the void deck thereby presenting accessibility issues for users of wheelchair and personal mobility devices; (b) how many of such void decks have been modified to improve accessibility; (c) whether the Ministry plans to modify all such void decks to improve accessibility for the disabled and elderly; and (d) whether the Ministry has conducted any safety risk assessments and implemented measures to mitigate such risks.,1,1224,2016-09-13-T-089-S-01224
2016-09-13-T-089,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Raised void decks are mostly found in older HDB blocks, and were meant to reduce rainwater wetting the void decks. Newer HDB blocks do not have raised void decks.",1,1225,2016-09-13-T-089-S-01225
2016-09-13-T-089,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB has been pro-active in promoting a barrier-free environment in public housing developments. In 2006, the Government launched a Barrier Free Accessibility (BFA) Programme to make all HDB estates barrier-free. Under the programme, HDB worked closely with the Town Councils (TCs) to retrofit all estates with ramps and handrails to aid the mobility of residents, including those who are physically challenged. The respective TCs drew up the master plan for the BFA works for each town/estate, in consultation with Grassroots Organisations, and took into account feedback and requests from residents. HDB's Lift Upgrading Programme also complements the BFA Programme by bringing direct lift access to flats, where technically and financially viable.",2,1226,2016-09-13-T-089-S-01226
2016-09-13-T-089,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In implementing BFA improvements, the focus was to provide access in a pragmatic way. For example, ramps could have either replaced existing steps, or were added separately at strategic locations. In particular, where site conditions permitted, ramps were installed near the lift lobbies, thereby providing BFA access to the void decks. However, it may not have been feasible to construct ramps at some locations due to technical issues or existing site constraints.",3,1227,2016-09-13-T-089-S-01227
2016-09-13-T-089,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For this reason, even though TCs completed all their planned works under their respective BFA master-plans in 2012, there may still be opportunities to further enhance BFA in our towns and estates. These works could include levelling-up aprons to eliminate the step or installing more ramps at strategic locations, and could be done through the TCs' improvement works or the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP).",4,1228,2016-09-13-T-089-S-01228
2016-09-13-T-090,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider subsidising the installation of mosquito screens for lower-income households as a form of protection against dengue and Zika.,1,1229,2016-09-13-T-090-S-01229
2016-09-13-T-090,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB does not currently have plans to subsidise the installation of mosquito screens. Vector control remains the key strategy in reducing the spread of dengue and Zika. NEA and PA also conduct outreach activities in dengue and Zika clusters to alert residents and advise them to take precautionary measures such as applying insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing. Residents are encouraged to stay vigilant, and do their part to prevent mosquito breeding in their homes by following the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout.",1,1230,2016-09-13-T-090-S-01230
2016-09-13-T-091,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the anti-slip treatment for bathroom tiles subsidised under HDB's Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme (a) how many households have benefitted from the treatment to date; (b) what is the total cost to the Government for subsidising the treatment; (c) what is the average life span of the treatment before a new treatment is required; and (d) how has HDB responded to complaints about the treatment, if any.",1,1231,2016-09-13-T-091-S-01231
2016-09-13-T-091,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme aims to make homes safer for the elderly. Eligible residents can select from three improvement items, comprising ramps to overcome single-step entrances, grab bars, and slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles for up to two toilets.",1,1232,2016-09-13-T-091-S-01232
2016-09-13-T-091,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Specifically for the slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles of toilets, about 70,000 households have benefitted since the launch of EASE in July 2012. The Government has spent more than $10 million subsidising slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles.",2,1233,2016-09-13-T-091-S-01233
2016-09-13-T-091,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Such treated floor tiles can typically last up to five years. However, the life span will also depend on the usage and frequency of cleaning. For example, the accumulation of excessive dirt or soap residue might reduce the effectiveness of the slip-resistant treatment.",3,1234,2016-09-13-T-091-S-01234
2016-09-13-T-091,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB will investigate the feedback and complaints received on slip-resistant treatment of tiles. In cases where the slip-resistance has deteriorated due to accumulation of dirt or soap residue, residents will be advised on the appropriate methods of cleaning the tiles to upkeep the slip-resistant treatment. If the slip-resistance has pre-maturely deteriorated within the 1-year Defects Liability Period despite proper cleaning, HDB will request its contractors to rectify the situation.",4,1235,2016-09-13-T-091-S-01235
2016-09-13-T-092,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,asked the Minister for National Development (a) why does HDB charge an administrative fee for the temporary extension of stay for sellers of resale flats when this is a private agreement; (b) what recourse do sellers have when buyers suddenly terminate the extension and leave them temporarily homeless; and (c) why the private agreement cannot be made a regulated agreement as part of the resale contract.,1,1236,2016-09-13-T-092-S-01236
2016-09-13-T-092,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Typically, flat sellers are required to move out on the legal completion date of the resale transaction. However, HDB allows them to seek a temporary extension of stay for up to three months, subject to the buyer’s agreement. This is to facilitate the sellers' transit to their next home. HDB charges an administrative fee of $20 to cover expenses in processing the request.",1,1237,2016-09-13-T-092-S-01237
2016-09-13-T-092,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The flat buyers and sellers are advised to discuss all aspects of the extension and come to a mutual agreement before proceeding with the application. As this is a private agreement between the two parties, they may seek their own legal advice on the matter should any dispute arise. Sellers are not expected to be left homeless in case of a dispute, as they should have already bought another property that is ready for occupation.",2,1238,2016-09-13-T-092-S-01238
2016-09-13-T-092,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The resale contract and the private extension of stay agreement are separate arrangements. Not all flat sellers would require an extension of stay after the sale of their flats, and similarly, not all flat buyers are able to accommodate such a request. Hence, it is not practical to make the temporary extension of stay as part of the resale contract.",3,1239,2016-09-13-T-092-S-01239
2016-09-13-T-093,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can provide an update on the delayed construction of Singapore's first co-digestion plant at PUB's Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant; (b) whether fraud is involved in the delayed construction; and (c) what assistance will be provided to the affected SMEs involved in this project.,1,1240,2016-09-13-T-093-S-01240
2016-09-13-T-093,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The purpose of the co-digestion demonstration project at the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant is to test a new technology developed and owned by Anaergia Inc, a leading international renewable energy company. The technology involves co-digesting food waste and used water sludge, thus increasing biogas production and reducing the net energy consumption of used water treatment. The project required Anaergia Inc to set up and operate the demonstration plant over three years under the TechPioneer Scheme, which is co-funded by PUB and EDB and supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF). This scheme promotes the early adoption and commercialisation of new environmental and water technologies.",1,1241,2016-09-13-T-093-S-01241
2016-09-13-T-093,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The co-digestion project had started well in November 2014. However, in October 2015, PUB discovered that the local company representing Anaergia Inc, Anaergia Pte Ltd (or APL), was unable to meet the project schedule. PUB had also been in close contact with the Canada-based Anaergia Inc, who was committed to resolving the issue. The parent company decided to appoint its other Singapore subsidiary, Anaergia Singapore Pte Ltd (ASPL), to steer the project back on track. PUB had agreed to the change as the plant under construction is designed to use Anaergia Inc's proprietary co-digestion technology.",2,1242,2016-09-13-T-093-S-01242

2016-09-13-T-093,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB does not directly contract with or reimburse the sub-contractors for all its projects. For this particular co-digestion project, the sub-contractors had informed PUB earlier this year that APL had not paid them for the work done. PUB took action and advised the sub-contractors to seek legal redress and exercise their contractual rights against APL. We understand that the two subcontractors who took APL to court were awarded court judgments in May 2016 against APL for the amounts owed. We are unable to comment on whether fraud is involved in the delay in construction by APL.",5,1245,2016-09-13-T-093-S-01245
