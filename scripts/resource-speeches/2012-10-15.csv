2012-10-15-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,1 To ask the Minister for National Development (a) what is the Ministry's assessment of the HDB Resale Price Index reaching a record level of 197.9 in the third quarter of 2012 in spite of cooling measures and new releases of BTO flats; (b) whether the cooling measures are effective in managing property prices and curbing property speculation; and (c) what are the Ministry's plans to assure the public that HDB and private properties will continue to remain affordable to Singapore citizens and that the Ministry has a good handle on the property market.,2,2,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00002
2012-10-15-T-001,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,"asked  the Minister for National Development in view of the recent record property transactions, including a $1 million Queenstown flat, whether the anticipated fresh flood of liquidity into the US financial system with QE3 announced by the US Federal Reserve will have an impact on property prices and affordability.",1,3,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00003

2012-10-15-T-001,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),Question No 1.,1,5,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00005
2012-10-15-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will take Question Nos 1 and 2 together. Ample global liquidity and low interest rates in recent years have contributed significantly to the strong demand for residential property, exerting upward pressure on property prices. To restore market equilibrium, the Government has put in place a number of demand management and supply measures.",1,6,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00006
2012-10-15-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Both the private property and HDB resale markets have shown signs of stabilising. For private property, growth in prices has moderated significantly from 18% in 2010, to 6% in 2011, and to 0.9% in the first three quarters of this year. Yearly Resale Price Index (RPI) growth has also come down from 14.1% in 2010, to 10.7% last year and to 3.9% in the first three quarters of this year. Ms Foo Mee Har cited the case of the Queenstown flat which was sold for $1 million. From time to time, there will be some buyers who are prepared to pay way above market valuation as determined by professional valuers. This is an executive flat, measuring 150 square metres at Level 16. So, this is not your typical HDB flat. In some HDB towns, there will be some such units with unique characteristics which buyers are willing to pay way above valuation.",2,7,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00007
2012-10-15-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Nonetheless, we have seen an uptick in RPI in the third quarter of 2012 based on the flash estimates of 2% growth from second quarter of this year. So, while things are improving, we are not yet out of the woods. With the recent announcements of further monetary expansion in both the US and the Eurozone, we expect the current low interest rate environment to persist. This will continue to contribute to the strong demand for residential property, which could cause prices to rise beyond sustainable levels.",3,8,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00008

2012-10-15-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"As these monetary conditions worldwide are far from normal, MAS has announced new curbs on loan tenures to encourage greater financial prudence among property purchasers in both the public and private housing markets. This is a calibrated step to prevent excessive speculation.",5,10,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00010
2012-10-15-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"There is also a significant supply of housing – both public and private – that will come onto the market over the next couple of years. In particular, HDB has ramped up its BTO supply significantly and we will keep up the pace of new flat supply into next year. This will enable us to provide more options to suit individual housing needs and budgets. We remain ready to act, if and when necessary.",6,11,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00011
2012-10-15-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Sir, I thank the Minister for his reply. I have some supplementary questions. Firstly, with respect to the additional BTO housing that is being provided, we still see a rise in the resale flat price index. What would be the acceptable level before MND considers further cooling measures? Secondly, at which point would MND deem that our resale flats are unaffordable, and would act to assure the public about affordability?",1,12,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00012
2012-10-15-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"What is an acceptable Resale Price Index would depend on the economy. Over the medium, long term, there is a strong correlation between GDP growth – which is a proxy for wage growth",1,13,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00013
2012-10-15-T-001,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for the clarification and answers. May I ask more specifically on affordability, and if the Minister could share what planning parameters the Ministry uses to determine prices? And how is average household income used as an indicator to determine affordability?",1,14,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00014
2012-10-15-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, there are international guidelines on this particular subject. What is commonly used in practically all countries is the mortgage burden",1,15,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00015

2012-10-15-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, I would like to ask the Minister  based on the projections on the number of family nucleus and eligible singles, do we have an adequate supply to meet this demand in the next few years? Secondly, would HDB consider building more flats to meet some of this projected demand and to manage some potential surplus as a reserve, so that there is always some buffer? We may not always get the demand-and-supply balance right and so, will HDB consider having some surplus to meet some unanticipated demand?",1,17,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00017
2012-10-15-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, that is what we have been trying to do in terms of meeting family formation demand, at 25,000 units per year, which was the case last year as well as this year. This is many more than the number of family formations. Every year, marriages involving citizens average 15,000; so, 15,000 family formations a year. Twenty five thousand units do provide us with some buffer. Of course, there are other additional demands coming from up-graders, down-graders and second-timers. We have been working on this quantum of 25,000 units per year for two years. In fact, if not for other upcoming policy changes, I would be beginning to wind it down a little. But we now have this new subject of catering to singles. Hence, I have to deliberately ramp it up a little higher in order to cater to singles. We are still mulling over it because it is very hard to put a figure on how much more we should cater for the singles group.",1,18,2012-10-15-T-001-S-00018
2012-10-15-T-002,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien,asked  the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs if he can provide an update on the Government's stance on what it means to keep religion and politics separate.,1,19,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00019
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the separation of religion and politics is a long-established principle in Singapore. Every citizen, regardless of his religious beliefs, has the same rights to express his views on public issues. In doing so, a citizen who belongs to a particular religion will often be guided by his own religious beliefs and personal conscience. However, like other citizens, he should always be mindful of the sensitivities of living in a multi-religious society and the bounds of the law.",1,20,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00020
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Singapore is a multi-religious society. The different religious groups have their own deeply-held beliefs and precepts. While we accept and respect this diversity of religious teachings, we have seen many examples of other countries where religious differences have caused deep social divides and conflict. If one religion pushes hard to have its tenets and views adopted by society at large beyond its own adherents, others will push back, sometimes even harder.",2,21,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00021
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),Page  801,3,22,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00022
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"This dynamic is accentuated if a religious group engages in politics, or if a political group uses religion to further its cause. Other religious groups will feel compelled to also enter the political arena to further their own causes or rival claims. Tensions will arise and social harmony can break down.",4,23,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00023
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Hence, we need to maintain a clear line between politics and religion in Singapore. Our politics and policies must serve all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion. The Government must not take sides with any religious group when making policies. If politicians use the religion card for their own political purpose and agenda, and seek to sway voters through religious appeals, it will sow the seeds of division in our society and undermine the inter-religious and social harmony we have painstakingly built.",5,24,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00024
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"To guard against the dangers of mixing politics and religion, Parliament enacted the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act in 1990. The Act created the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony to help the Government decide on matters pertaining to religious harmony. The current Council is chaired by a retired Supreme Court judge. It comprises members who represent the major religions in Singapore and other members who have distinguished themselves in public service or community relations. Religious representatives form the majority of this Council. Should any individual or group seek to embroil any religious group or use a religious office to further its political agenda, Government will take firm action to protect our religious and social harmony.",6,25,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00025
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Mr Speaker, Sir, religious groups are an important part of our society. They make important contributions to social harmony and nation-building. The Government appreciates the positive role of religious groups in our secular state, and their understanding and acceptance of the need to keep religion and politics separate. At the same time, Government understands and respects that religious groups have deeply-held views which they wish to express and to be given due consideration. There are established formal and informal channels for religious groups to do so.",7,26,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00026
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Government and religious leaders meet regularly on public occasions, such as community functions, religious events and activities under our Community Engagement Programme. Government and religious leaders also regularly meet privately, individually or in groups. Both Government and religious leaders know that when sensitive issues arise that they wish to discuss in confidence, they can do so candidly behind closed doors. This approach has worked well. These interactions help to build mutual understanding and trust, and have enabled our religious leaders to become valued and vital partners of the Government in maintaining religious harmony in Singapore.",8,27,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00027
2012-10-15-T-002,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"Sir, I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his comprehensive answer. I have to declare that I am a Catholic Christian and driven very much by my faith. And it is in this context that I have raised this question. I think we can understand that we live in a multi-religious society and we need to be mindful that religions do not impose their religious tenets and views on the other members of the population.",1,28,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00028

2012-10-15-T-002,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"My question is  do we see only the downsides of what religious institutions and organisations and religious people can offer? Can we not see them as a resource because most religions do look at the common good and do want to further the common good in society and work towards achieving that for the nation? Many people are religiously driven and they have views influenced by religion. Can we not harness that a lot more to help us in the work? This sometimes can be perceived to cross over to the political arena because politics is not just about the political regime, choosing political leaders and policies. It is also about shaping the political discourse, influencing the population —",3,30,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00030
2012-10-15-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Lien, can we keep to the supplementary question, please?",1,31,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00031
2012-10-15-T-002,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien,"Yes, Sir. Can we consider these other aspects that religion and religious institutions can offer?",1,32,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00032
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I appreciate Mr Lien's clear articulation that he feels that politics and religion should be kept separate. If I understood him correctly, that was his opening position. I appreciate that very much because that is the position which the Government takes as well. We do appreciate the good work that religion does in our society. Mr Lien has said that he is a Catholic. I myself am not Catholic, but my whole family has been educated in Catholic schools, and we appreciate that very much. And the reason is a very simple one – Catholic schools provide good education with good values and they have been able to keep their practice of religion and their mission to provide education quite separate. I have never had an occasion, for example, in Catholic schools where they had tried to convert me, and I appreciate that very much. They teach me what their precepts are, but they have never tried to convert me.",1,33,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00033
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"As with all mission schools in Singapore, there is a clear separation between the education mission which is what the Ministry of Education supports and funds, and their religious practices, including what they can or cannot do in schools with the students. They cannot proselytise to the students. They cannot try to convert them, but they can continue to provide good values education for their students. In schools, we recognise that there are many religious organisations, whether they are Buddhist, Christian or others, and they provide a very useful social function. There is also a divide – a clear line – between the education mission, which is for all, and the religious beliefs, precepts and practice which have to be kept on a separate track.",2,34,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00034
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"So, Sir, we certainly do appreciate the contributions that religions and religious groups make to Singapore. In fact, we encourage that, but we also know that we should keep religion and politics separate so that we maintain religious harmony and social harmony in Singapore.",3,35,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00035

2012-10-15-T-002,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien,"Sir, I would like to make a point of clarification. My views are a bit more nuanced. They are not clear, not so black and white. Of course, in certain instances, religion should not cross the boundaries, but my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister to consider that, in some cases, a separation of religion from politics is not entirely reasonable.",1,37,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00037
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Sir, the position is very clear between that of an individual practising his religion and carrying through the practice of his religion and his beliefs into his own personal decisions. And that is quite different from getting religious groups involved in politics. I think those are two quite different things and that, in fact, as Mr Lien has suggested, is a nuanced position, and not very different from Mr Lien's. I think we need to keep that separation; otherwise, once religious organisations get involved in politics, we then run the danger of having a clash. With many religious groups entering into the political arena, or political groups seeking to use religious groups to further their political agenda, we then begin to have a problem.",1,38,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00038
2012-10-15-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, I declare I am a Catholic as well. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his answer. I wonder if I could get some clarification on a recent event. Could the Deputy Prime Minister explain or tell the House whether he had any discussions with the Archbishop on the subject of the event organised by Function 8 (F8) and, if so, what transpired during those discussions?",1,39,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00039
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I will be happy to do so. As I have explained earlier in my reply to Mr Lien, Government leaders meet religious leaders regularly to build mutual understanding and trust. I have met Archbishop Nicholas Chia from time to time over the years and several times since I was appointed as the Minister for Home Affairs last May. Last year, I hosted him and a small group of Catholic leaders for lunch so that I could understand better the issues that concern the Catholic community in Singapore. I also visited the Archbishop in hospital when he unfortunately fractured his leg last August. There was no publicity or fanfare for these meetings. The Archbishop knows that any time he needs to discuss any sensitive issue with me, he can see me in private. Likewise, I would have no hesitation to share my concerns honestly and openly with him if I felt the need to do so.",1,40,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00040
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Sir, it was in this spirit that I asked to meet Archbishop Nicholas Chia on 30 May 2012, together with the Chairman of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony, Mr Goh Joon Seng. I wanted to understand better the context to the Archbishop's letter to the organisers of an organisation which calls itself F8, which was going to stage a political event scheduled for 2 June at the Speakers' Corner. I was anxious to avoid any misunderstanding between the Government and the Catholic Church. When we met, I explained my concerns to Archbishop Chia. The Archbishop stated very clearly that the Catholic Church has always maintained a position that it does not wish to be involved in political activities, and that the Church wants to work closely with the Government and does not wish to set itself on a collision path with the Government. I was greatly reassured by the Archbishop's comments, as they were consistent with his record of service throughout his 11-year tenure as leader of the Catholic Church in Singapore. He has consistently shown that he values religious harmony and appreciates the importance of separating religion and politics in our local context. He has also worked hard to forge inter-religious understanding and harmony, reflecting his strong belief in this fundamental basis of our social harmony. It also became clear from the discussion that, firstly, the Archbishop had intended the letter as a private communication to the F8 organisers. And, secondly, on reflection, the Archbishop felt that the letter did not accurately reflect his views on the subject and, if used in a manner he did not intend, might inadvertently harm our social harmony. Archbishop Chia then decided on the same day to send a second letter to the F8 organisers to withdraw his earlier letter. The F8 organisers acknowledged the Archbishop's request and, according to the Archbishop, returned him his original letter.",2,41,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00041

2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Sir, those who know Archbishop Chia well and the type of person he is, and his contributions to Singapore over the decades, will certainly know that he is not one who would endanger social harmony in Singapore. The position he took in withdrawing the letter was consistent with his words and deeds throughout his leadership of the Catholic Church and as a respected religious leader in Singapore. Mr Goh Joon Seng, who was at the meeting, in his capacity as Chairman of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony, is a retired Supreme Court judge who knows the Archbishop professionally and personally. They have served together on the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony for 10 years and have been friends, I am told, for some 50 years. Mr Goh also is a Catholic himself and he knew that it was not in character for Archbishop Chia to do anything that would entangle the Church in politics.",4,43,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00043
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Sir, although I may not know Archbishop Chia as well as Mr Goh, I have had interactions with him on several occasions. Through my conversations with the Archbishop, we have established mutual understanding and share the desire to respect the religious beliefs of the various communities in Singapore while upholding the wider interests of all Singaporeans and of Singapore.",5,44,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00044

2012-10-15-T-002,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Sir, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he could clarify on what he means by religious leaders engaging in politics. For example, if a religious group were to take the view that the Government could do more for the poor, would that amount to engaging in politics? We also know of faiths, such as Christianity and Islam, which do not draw the distinction between the private and the public realms. I think this could give rise to concerns as to whether there has been a restriction on what people of faith could engage in.",1,46,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00046
2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have tried to answer that question which Asst Prof Eugene Tan has brought up in a different way. It is not very different from the question that Mr Lien has brought up. On an individual basis, individuals in Singapore are free to exercise their political rights as individuals. But when you bring an organisation, like a religious organisation, into politics or when political parties or people with a political agenda start to use religion to further that agenda, then you begin to have a serious problem.",1,47,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00047

2012-10-15-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"If one religion enters into the political arena in that way, or allows itself to be used in the political arena in that way, then other religions may do so as well, and then we have the possibility of a breakdown in social harmony along religious lines. That is very dangerous for society. But as I have said, religious groups do play very important and useful social functions through their social arms. Many of them have charity arms. Many of them run education institutions, welfare homes, old-age homes, and these certainly are very welcomed. These are expressions of their own beliefs and precepts, and we welcome those. But those need to be kept separate from a political agenda of getting the religious organisation as an organisation involved in a political agenda. And I think Asst Prof Tan can see the difference between the two.",3,49,2012-10-15-T-002-S-00049

In fact, this is one of the dilemmas and issues which the Government has to face. MHA assesses both the content and the possible impact of the Internet content in determining whether to request the blocking of the Internet content, in this particular case, this video. The issue at hand is not censorship of Internet content but taking the necessary pre-emptive measures to prevent Internet content from inciting or being used to incite social unrest in Singapore.

However, the second quarter GDP growth was better than expected, resulting in an upward revision from the preliminary estimates of -0.7%, to 0.2%. The revision was due to new data from the construction sector, which showed much stronger growth than originally estimated for the second quarter. While we have avoided two consecutive quarters of decline, economic growth for the first three quarters of 2012 was very modest, at 1.7% on a year-on-year basis.",1,73,2012-10-15-T-004-S-00073

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) recognises the need to strike the right balance between ensuring exporters are not unduly hurt by a stronger currency in the short-term, and capping underlying price and cost pressures in the economy. However, the exchange rate cannot be used as a tool to manage Singapore's export competitiveness. Over the longer term, competitiveness can only be achieved through higher productivity and innovation, such as creating new products that the market demands. The trend appreciation of the Singapore dollar exchange rate is in line with our economic fundamentals. It keeps inflation low and stable, which helps to preserve the purchasing power of Singaporeans' income and savings. It also provides a stable and conducive environment for businesses to undertake long-term investments, thus enhancing competitiveness and providing the basis for sustained economic growth.",6,78,2012-10-15-T-004-S-00078

If it is, indeed, the risk of inflation that we are worried about, then, needless to say, our Asian counterparts, the US and Europe are all seeing a slowdown in inflation.

2012-10-15-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive answer on productivity, and I appreciate the many schemes we have in Singapore to support the productivity initiative. I have two supplementary questions. One relates to whether the Ministry will consider consolidating and simplifying the many assistance schemes under the productivity improvement efforts to make them more accessible. This is in relation to the feedback that many SMEs have given that they actually feel lost in the sea of complexity of schemes and the paper work. The second supplementary question is whether the Ministry will consider doing more to proactively reach out, especially to the SMEs with tailored sector level intervention and support, and help them replicate best practices quickly, just like what we have seen recently in the food manufacturing sector.",1,115,2012-10-15-T-005-S-00115
2012-10-15-T-005,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"We are currently reviewing all the schemes that are related to the SMEs when it comes to productivity, in terms of its applications and ease of access and understanding of the different programmes and schemes. It is definitely our objective also to simplify them so as to make them more accessible. That is exactly why at a certain milestone, we came up with the Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV) scheme. The $5,000 makes it easier for SMEs and even the smaller SMEs, which we call micro enterprises. It is definitely our objective to be able to reach out to them as well, and we are doing that through the Enterprise Development Centres. Today, with the trade associations, there are some centres that are already being set up at the heartlands to help the micro enterprises. It is a journey. We hope to work together with all the federations, associations and the Chambers, including the Merchant Federations. A good example is like what we had done for food manufacturing, by helping them, expanding the market and customising their approaches to what is necessary, because every single sector is different. We have just started this productivity drive. It will take time to see the effect. But, definitely, along the way, we are going to refine and customise as much as we can.",1,116,2012-10-15-T-005-S-00116

The enterprise take-up of NBN services has been much slower than expected. My first question is how many orders OpenNet is able to process each week, and whether the quota has increased and by how much so that service activation delays for its customers asking for services are minimised? The last question is what happens if OpenNet does not meet the Universal Service Obligation (USO) after 1 January 2013?",1,139,2012-10-15-T-007-S-00139

They have further put in place the mechanism to adjust the provisioning capacity on an on-going basis to meet the changing demands and reduce the waiting time for service activation. On his second question, as I have mentioned earlier, Sir, IDA remains concerned and will continue to press OpenNet for a quicker resolution. Should OpenNet not be able to meet the USO on 1 January 2013, the regulator, that is IDA, will have to carefully examine the conditions under which they are not meeting the obligations and decide on the appropriate responses.",1,140,2012-10-15-T-007-S-00140

It is a submission by OpenNet and they have sub-contracted it so that they finish the remaining buildings and homes beyond the 95% mark within the next nine months. There are several reasons that they have given to us as to why there was a delay. One of which, which I have mentioned in my reply, is that they have some commercial arrangements that they have to make with the sub-contractor beyond the 95% mark. We have been pressing them for an early resolution. We have now been able to get them together and they have agreed to have the rollout as soon as possible. They will submit the plans to IDA and IDA will look at them very carefully to ensure that the rollout plan will meet the demands, as mentioned by the Member. But, certainly, we must recognise that beyond the 95% mark, the area that they have to cover is very, very wide and so, it is not possible for them to cover each area with the same speed and frequency as we expect for the 95% rollout.

It is far cheaper for these companies to pay someone a few dollars and for a jerry can of fuel to clear the forests. The only problem is these forests which are being cleared are on peatland, which has millions of years' worth of organic materials trapped in the soil. So, when you burn a forest on peatland, you also set alight organic carbon which has accumulated over millions of years. It is, therefore, extremely tragic that the widespread clearance of forests in Borneo and Sumatra for the sake of plantations has, in fact, led to far greater carbon released into the air than any potential savings from the use of bio-fuels or alternative uses of the agricultural products.",1,160,2012-10-15-T-008-S-00160

Until and unless economic pressure is felt by the companies that are operating these, they will not change their behaviour. What we can do now with current technology, with the ready availability of satellite imagery and of real-time hot-spot monitoring and then persuading the Indonesian government to release and publish those concession maps, it now allows us to ask relevant questions to the relevant companies, ""Why are there so many hotspots in your areas?"" Of course, there will be times when this is purely the result of an act of nature. Beyond a certain point, we really have to make the point that this is a man-made disaster. And it is a man-made disaster that is occurring because of short-term gains and the greed on the part of operators on the ground; making the rest of us pay the price in health and in the environment, because of this greed and short-term actions. What we can do more of now is to introduce more transparency, list out who owns which pieces of land, list out the number of hotspots which are occurring in real time in those pieces of land, and then, after that, this requires the involvement of consumer groups, non-government organisations and international organisations who all have a stake in this value chain. I think that is the only effective way, because you can pass all the laws you like in the respective governments, but if you cannot enforce your laws and you cannot ensure that people comply with regulations and rules which are common sense, this problem will keep recurring.",2,161,2012-10-15-T-008-S-00161

First, if you looked at the list of concessionaries, you would realise that there is a whole web of companies, shell companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures and a variety of business arrangements behind the clearing of land and the planting of oil palms. So, that is the first level. At the second level, in order to achieve prosecution in court, you need to have caught the person in the act. Circumstantial evidence, probability, may not be sufficient.",1,166,2012-10-15-T-008-S-00166
2012-10-15-T-008,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The third difficulty is that these are local crimes and need to be prosecuted in local jurisdictions. In this case, the jurisdiction is that of Indonesia. We do not have extra-territorial jurisdiction as far as haze and environmental concerns go, at this point in time. Therefore, I do not want to jump the gun and I do not want to make promises or threats which we cannot fulfil. But I think we need to accumulate evidence and there needs to be transparency, public pressure and, ultimately, commercial pressure – meaning which products are bought or not bought, knowing the origins and how the products are made. This is an approach that has worked very well for the timber industry. In the case of the timber industry, with DNA analysis these days, they can analyse which forest the wood in this table came from. This has put the commercial loggers on notice that they have to embark on and pursue business in a sustainable and responsible way, otherwise, they face commercial sanctions. We have to explore using this approach to apply relevant, subtle, or maybe not so subtle, commercial pressure on these companies to clean up their act.",2,167,2012-10-15-T-008-S-00167

2012-10-15-T-008,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I hope the Member appreciates that there is a limit to how much we can do but we will work with our partners in the region to maximise the pressures on these companies. Another thing which we can do is to also highlight positive examples. For instance, there are Singapore-based companies with operations in these regions. We need to approach them and say, ""Well, are you willing to open up your operations and subject them to scrutiny and certification perhaps by a non-governmental organisation, who will vouch for your sustainable and responsible way of doing business?"" That way, you start encouraging some who are already complying to do more, to do it better. And you will then put more pressure on those who are not yet willing to subject themselves to that level of scrutiny. I am afraid that there is no magic bullet to this problem.",4,169,2012-10-15-T-008-S-00169

Singapore relies heavily on imported energy. This pre-feasibility study was part of our efforts to continually explore all options to overcome our energy constraints, and enhance our energy security. The study was, thus, a preliminary step to assess the feasibility of nuclear energy as an option to meet Singapore's long-term energy needs.",1,173,2012-10-15-T-009-S-00173

However, the risks to Singapore, given that we are a small and dense city, still outweigh the benefits at this point. As we are planning for the very long term and not for our immediate energy needs, we prefer to wait for technology and safety to improve further before reconsidering our options.

For example, we are a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and are working closely with other member countries on implementing the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. Through such platforms, we can foster greater collaboration to share best practices in nuclear safety, coordinate emergency planning and response, jointly develop human resources, and discuss the implications of regional and global developments.",7,179,2012-10-15-T-009-S-00179

There are also industry codes of practice on data protection, such as the Model Data Protection Code released in 2002, for voluntary adoption by the private sector.

To ensure that the data is properly managed and protected, the public sector has its own set of data protection rules that are based broadly on the same data protection principles as the Personal Data Protection law. In some cases, these rules are even stricter than the requirements under the Personal Data Protection law. Some Acts also contain statutory provisions which regulate the collection, use and disclosure of information by the public sector. Together, these ensure that public agencies and officials are accountable for meeting strict requirements to ensure the confidentiality of personal data in their care.",8,231,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00231

So, I understand activities, such as data mining in the industry, are common, and I believe that most consumers are fine with this if their identities are not identifiable and if mining is done in aggregate form or with identities masked.

2012-10-15-T-020,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, with respect to section 26, relating to the transfer of personal data outside of Singapore, I have some queries on how the PDPB will apply in the following situations because these are increasingly common, especially with the pervasiveness of IT and digital media  (a) firstly, service providers or cloud services that provide multi-country disaster recovery or high-availability options; (b) with duplicate data being resident overseas, will the organisation still be responsible if the data is accessed without proper authority or under legal warrant by a foreign entity or authority? Is the organisation obliged to disclose such a situation to its customers or users if they are legally required to disclose data on their servers overseas? (c) how can the Bill be enforced on a foreign company which may collect data from subscribers in Singapore with the data being outside Singapore? What is the recourse, if such data is subsequently transferred or sold back to a company to market in Singapore?",21,287,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00287

2012-10-15-T-020,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, I know it sounds a bit complicated, but what powers does the Commission have to direct and determine damages on the above cases should the PDPB or subsequent Act be contravened? I think that these considerations should be clarified and perhaps FAQs be made available to companies and consumers to better educate each of the parties on their rights and obligations.",23,289,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00289

And what are the existing obligations that Singapore has undertaken in this respect? What change does the Ministry foresee if the Bill has an impact on the operating environment of our local business context?",24,290,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00290
2012-10-15-T-020,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On the Do Not Call (DNC) registry, I welcome the establishment of the DNC and I think it is a move welcomed by many Singaporeans who have been at the receiving end of repeated calls and SMSes for unsolicited services several times a day. I have just received two this morning, by the way. I am supportive of this initiative and it is about time we enhanced our framework to work in tandem with other measures, such as the anti-spam laws, that are in place.",25,291,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00291

Alternative channels, such as social media and digital messaging such as WhatsApp or Viber, may then become alternatives for unwanted messages because personal data identifiers, such as mobile phone numbers or e-mail addresses, can be used to access and reach users in this area. I think this is an area of development that the Ministry and Commission should consider and continuously monitor to update the laws.

These calls range from the marketing of investment products to various personal services. So, how does the DNC registry affect such companies? This may prove to be a loophole in which contacts can still be sold to foreign marketing agencies whose source of information will be hard to trace legally.

The administration of the PDPB provides for a Commission, Advisory Committees, Administrative Body and other offices in which powers can be delegated. To these functions, how many resources will the Ministry invest into the machinery to regulate and enforce this Bill? Will these resources be sufficient to regulate the pervasive and vast use of consumer data across businesses and the Internet? If the resources are needed to prioritise their focus, what will their priorities be in dealing with electronic and manual data?",30,296,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00296

I hope that the Ministry will consider putting in place timelines in which dispute resolution should be made, so as not to cause lengthy inconvenience to businesses and consumers in resolving their concerns.",31,297,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00297

This will put consumers, companies and auditors on the same baseline and agree on an acceptable degree of compliance. But I also hope that these requirements will not be too onerous on smaller companies. Thus, to support the implementation of this section, are there also readily available funding which companies can access and be assisted to upgrade their systems and capabilities?",35,301,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00301

After which they will be able to continue to use such data which was collected prior to the implementation of the PDPB. I would have hoped that the notice period would be shorter at six to 12 months because this presents a loophole. Much data would have already been collected under the current regime without having obtained consent in section 16. In addition, the fact that an 18-month period is granted provides more than ample time for the industry to go on an aggressive approach in collecting personal data.",38,304,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00304

2012-10-15-T-020,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, I would like to put forth one final recommendation in my speech before I end off. Beyond the existing scope of the PDPB, we have also seen various instances in which personal data is revealed or exploited to intimidate and embarrass individuals online. There have been many cases in which personal data, such as phone numbers, e-mail addresses, even home or office addresses, are disclosed online for the purposes of intimidation or embarrassment of an individual online.",41,307,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00307
2012-10-15-T-020,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I am personally in favour of a light-touch approach and self-regulation on the Internet. However, such acts are tantamount to cyber-bullying and intimidation. The PDPB has made significant strides in pulling together relevant laws across the various Acts to provide some protection to an individual's privacy. As such, why should such instances be excluded? While there may be laws that disparately cover these situations, there is no one consolidated framework with an established machinery, such as the PDPB, to handle such issues. The issue today is that such cyber-bullying and intimidation in disclosing personal data are also not high on the priority of the Police Force, and very likely a costly affair for one to pursue through civil litigation.",42,308,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00308

2012-10-15-T-020,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, I would also like to seek clarity from the Ministry as well. In a situation where posting of personal data is made public, once made public, is the individual's data still covered by the PDPB?",44,310,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00310
2012-10-15-T-020,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, in closing, I would like to commend the Ministry in implementing the Personal Data Protection Bill. The evolving business landscape, in which consumer data is key to sales and marketing, has led to undesirable use of consumer data, a practice which this Bill aims to curb. I hope that the Ministry puts in sufficient resources and protection to ensure the effective regulation of the Bill. The fact that data is pervasively being transmitted – knowingly or unknowingly – by means or devices and applications means that we will also need to put in place an education framework to educate the common person on the street of their rights. I also hope that the law serves to better protect those who are more vulnerable, such as children and the mentally incapacitated, from being exploited. At the same time, while we do more to protect our people, we must also be mindful of the need to balance Singapore's economic interests as an economic and information hub.

The average duration of an Internet session for 41% of Internet users aged 7-14 years is one to two hours. While the Internet can be a channel for education, it also carries a spectrum of risks to children as they share more about themselves online as they view marketing advertisements, join social networks or even transact on the Internet through apps, games and contests. In the course of such activities, they can be targets for unsuitable or aggressive online marketing for commercial gain, cybergrooming, online scams or even identity frauds.",17,393,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00393

Several governments recognise that children need additional protection in this area. I understand that in 1998, the US enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) to protect personal data of children below 13 years of age. The European Commission is reviewing its data protection law to offer greater protection to children. Like in the US, European companies have to get parental consent for all minors under 13 years old. The Commission also wants all communication aimed at minors to be clear and in plain language.

2012-10-15-T-020,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"Sir, let me just go on to my first reservation. The proposed law does not apply to the public sector. The public sector, collectively, has a lot of information about individuals living on this island. Further, given the range and intensity of surveillance technology at the disposal of the Government, the need to regulate how the public sector collects, uses, shares and disseminates personal information takes on greater importance.",6,405,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00405
2012-10-15-T-020,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"Although there are specific legislations that govern the protection of data by the public sector, such as the Official Secrets Act and the Statutory Bodies and Government (Protection of Secrecy) Act, I am of the view that a unified regime is ideal and one that will provide more robust protection of personal data. If a dual regime is preferred, and which I sense is the Government's preference, I hope that the new Ministry of Communications and Information will seriously consider beefing up the legislation that governs the public sector's handling of information, which is primarily geared towards the protection of the secrecy of information.",7,406,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00406
2012-10-15-T-020,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"I move on to my other concern, which relates to the ""deemed consent"" provision in clause 15 of the Bill. In general, actual consent should be encouraged both in law and in practice. While I am not so concerned with the need for explicit consent, there should be adequate safeguards for actual consent, whether expressed or implied. Similarly, while there are safeguards in the case of ""deemed consent"", I would like to suggest that stronger emphasis be placed on the connection between ""purpose"" and ""consent"". To adequately protect the individual, the Bill could go further and state that the connection between purpose and consent given must be clear.",8,407,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00407
2012-10-15-T-020,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"A purpose cannot be so broad as to result in an organisation having the carte blanche to use personal information gathered for a whole host of other incidental purposes. Otherwise, what will result will be an abuse and misuse of the personal information gathered, which is seemingly protected by the law as deemed consent of a broad nature had been obtained.",9,408,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00408

Could the Minister clarify whether it would consider moving towards a shorter sunrise period from the enactment of the PPD Act? Sir, the bulk of the compliance mechanisms that need to be put in place is under the responsibility of the authorities, that is, the Privacy Commission. The private organisations merely have to consult and observe the register in accordance with the law. My concern is that the longer a sunrise period there is, the greater the likelihood that some of the more entrepreneurial organisations will escalate their data collection and use the gathered information for direct marketing activities, in anticipation of the DNC regime coming into force.",11,410,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00410
2012-10-15-T-020,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"Similarly, organisations may also attempt to collect personal data and use them before the law comes into force in order to gain an advantage from the deemed consent provision under clause 15 of the Bill as well as to engage in ""stockpiling"" of personal data to be in alignment with the requirements of clause 17 of the Bill. Sir, regardless of the duration of the sunrise period, I also hope that the Ministry will not provide a further grace period for compliance. To do so would only defeat the purpose of the sunset period, and will reduce the impetus for compliance as soon as possible.",12,411,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00411
2012-10-15-T-020,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"I would also like to propose that the regulation of spam emails be incorporated into the PPD Act's Do Not Call registry regime. Sir, the Spam Control Act of 2007 has not addressed the problem of spam emails. If anything, the Act has probably not made any difference at all! Anecdotal evidence suggests that the incidence of abuse and misuse of email addresses is now greater than it was when the Spam Control Act was passed. By bringing emails under the DNC regime, we will not make an arbitrary distinction between emails and phone calls or phone messages. It is noted that SMSes and MMSes are also covered under the Spam Control Act but they are also included under the DNC regime. A person's email addresses are also personal identifiable information. By harmonising the regulatory regime, we will provide a more comprehensive and consistent approach to unwanted correspondence or communication regardless of the mode of communication.",13,412,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00412
2012-10-15-T-020,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"Sir, another area of concern relates to whether the Bill covers non-Singaporean organisations if they are collecting or handling personal information with a Singapore nexus. I seek the Minister's confirmation of this, and hope that the scope of coverage to include overseas organisations will not be symbolic. More importantly, such a move will emphasise that it is the personal data of individuals with the Singapore link rather than the location or nationality of the organisation dealing with the personal information that is the primary focus of the legislation. Otherwise, the proposed law will provide an escape clause which will certainly be used, given the portability of digitised information.",14,413,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00413

Too often, we see people disclosing their personal particulars, including their National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) numbers, birthdays, without any care or concern that such information could be misused at a time when identity thefts are becoming a lot more common. Sir, I sincerely hope that the to-be established Personal Data Protection Commission, which is provided for in Part II of the Bill, will have a strong public education mandate and that adequate funding will be provided for this role. It is only when consumers value the protection of personal data and their privacy will the proposed law be effective.",16,415,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00415

The Ministry of Communications, Information and the Arts must be commended for seeing through this Bill which is at least a decade in the making. This is also MICA's last Bill. Such a Bill is demanding because of the need to balance the competing and, sometimes, conflicting needs of the different stakeholders. Some of these needs include  the need and perhaps even emerging right of privacy of consumers and individuals; the benefits of enabling information technology to boost marketing reach and capabilities given our aspirations to be a hub for Asian consumer insights; as well as the economic benefits that flow from allowing, within reasonable limits, organisations to collect and use personal data for their business endeavours.

As many other Members have raised, should vulnerable groups, like children and the disabled, be provided with enhanced level of privacy protection? What about the prohibition of the trade and sale of personal information? In any case, the developments in this area mean that our laws will need to be constantly updated to keep pace with the changes and the ingenuity of people seeking to mine personal information for whatever advantage, pecuniary or otherwise. This underscores the centrality of personal data in today's world and its status as an asset.

If this exemption is necessary, then, surely, they should only apply if these employees or public servants have accessed the data, whilst in the proper course of duty.

Clause 11 states that in meeting its responsibilities under this Act, an organisation shall consider what a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.

Have the authorities considered the risk of ID theft?

2012-10-15-T-020,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill before us has been a long time in coming. Back in 1990, the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law published the working paper entitled ""Data Protection in Singapore  A Case for Legislation"". And, today, we have a Bill that proposes a baseline data protection framework to regulate the way organisations in Singapore collect, use and disclose our personal data.",1,431,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00431
2012-10-15-T-020,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"This Bill relates to the protection of personal data. It is developed based on principles derived from the OECD guidelines on the protection of privacy. These principles include, among others, accountability and openness. The data protection provisions being introduced will serve as a ""baseline"" law. That is, we legislate here for a minimum standard to be applied across the board. There are then expressed provisions within the Bill for various exceptions, particularly that any other written laws shall prevail over these data protection laws should there be any conflicting positions. So, this is, in part, how, as the Government stated, ""a general baseline law will apply concurrently with existing sectoral regulations"", such as for banking and telecommunications.",2,432,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00432
2012-10-15-T-020,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"The Bill allows for various other exemptions. For example, an organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data without having to comply with these data protection laws if doing so is ""necessary in the national interests"". Or if the collection, use or disclosure of personal data is ""necessary to respond to an emergency that threatens the life or safety of that individual or another individual"". Or if those personal data is ""publicly available"". Or if the use or disclosure of personal data is ""necessary for any investigation or proceedings"". No need to comply with the data protection requirements in this Bill in these cases.",3,433,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00433

But, unfortunately, this Bill will not apply to public agencies. It expressly carves out the application of personal data protection laws to public agencies that collect, use or disclose our personal data. These include Government Ministries, tribunals and, upon notification by the Ministers, statutory boards like the PA and the HDB. As an extension, the personal data protection laws will also not apply to private organisations when they act on behalf of a public agency.

2012-10-15-T-020,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"The concept of accuracy, and individual access and correction are key provisions contained in this Bill.

Public agencies, during the course of their duties, use personal data to make decisions, such as whether to grant somebody Workfare Income Supplement payments, which have a direct impact on the lives of individuals. Therefore, it is important that individuals should be able to access their personal data on the basis of which the Government makes decisions on and to ask for such data to be corrected if they are inaccurate.",14,444,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00444
2012-10-15-T-020,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"Another reason that we have been given for why the public sector needs to be excluded is that public agencies often have to share information with one another or to deal with national emergencies. And, indeed, we do already have laws that allow public entities to share data. Examples include the Income Tax Act, the Medical Registration Regulations, the Immigration Act. As mentioned earlier, these will continue to apply as they are contained in existing written laws. Also, as mentioned earlier, we have broadly worded exemptions contained in this Bill relating to national interests and to emergencies, which may well be helpful through our public agencies looking to share information in a national emergency.",15,445,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00445

And this property needs to be safeguarded and protected by law against misuse, including by the Government. We must remind ourselves that the proper function of a government and its associated bodies, first and foremost, is to provide essential services to the people. The Government collects our personal data in order to be able to provide us with various services, such as administering our CPF accounts for our retirement needs, or our Medisave accounts for our medical expenses.

Otherwise, if this is seen as just yet another cost to manage, then there will only be lip-service compliance or, worse, creative compliance.",8,458,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00458
2012-10-15-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee (Jurong),"The Personal Data Protection Commission should, therefore, focus its efforts along two main lines  (1) working with business and other federations to educate, help and incentivise organisations and businesses to adopt effective data protection protocols; and (2) devoting sufficient resources to enforce the rules firmly and fairly against organisations that flout basic data protection standards.",9,459,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00459

We have a role to play in safeguarding our own personal information.

2012-10-15-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee (Jurong),"A healthy scepticism about the necessity of giving away valuable pieces of our own information to strangers who ask for it, is something that ought to be inculcated at home and in schools, and reinforced in the community. I, therefore, hope the Commission will consider working with schools, as well as community and grassroots organisations, to bring this message across to all Singaporeans, especially our more vulnerable groups, such as the young and our elderly, and to educate them about the data protection framework that we are putting in place to protect. They should understand what potential harm may be caused if they give away information, such as their NRIC numbers, their birthdays and other types of information.",11,461,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00461

Patients seeking medical assistance from clinics and institutions are in their most vulnerable moments and will certainly automatically divulge information and data to those concerned. Now, healthcare data is, indeed, very intimate, very personal, very private and extremely confidential. We certainly need an utmost level of protection for these data.

Therefore, the Act would affect industries including, but not limited to, insurance, outsourced telephone marketing services providers, data storage service providers, property, banks, financial institutions, health, medical, security, and so on. All industries which need to refer to or make use of personal data to promote or expand their business would feel the impact.

At the same time, organisations have to provide information on the ways the data has been and may have been made use of.

We could stagger the sunrise period, keeping the originally proposed 18 months for MNCs or large companies and selected businesses like headhunters, insurance brokers and marketing companies. Our proposal is to let smaller companies with less than $10 million in annual revenue use the 18 months to draft appropriate compliance policies, while the sunrise period can be extended by another 12 months. This would give them more breathing space for proper implementation.

While we are aware that the Do Not Call registry protects individuals against unsolicited calls like spa packages, bank loans, facials, and other marketing messages, we are concerned that this would become another additional cost for businesses. There are three separate registers  phone calls, SMS/MMS, and fax. Organisations would have to subscribe to the Do Not Call registry for each tier. A company wishing to send marketing messages would have to subscribe with each separate register – for phone calls, SMS/MMS and fax.

2012-10-15-T-020,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"While the business community understands the rationale for having a Personal Data Protection Act and the setting up of a DNC registry, it does introduce many areas of concern, in terms of overall compliance, additional costs, heavy penalties and an overarching impact on the SMEs.",18,518,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00518
2012-10-15-T-020,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"We would also like to understand why the Personal Data Protection Act has now removed the Data Protection Fund which was originally intended to provide financing or incentives, including grants and scholarships, to any public authority, enterprise, education institution, or other person undertaking or facilitating any programme to promote data protection awareness or implementation and running costs of the Commission. This Fund could have been used to alleviate some of the operational and compliance costs for the SMEs. I hope that these relevant concerns will be heeded. In closing, I support the Bill.",19,519,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00519

2012-10-15-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. I will commence in Mandarin.",1,521,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00521
2012-10-15-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg 940.]  The Personal Data Protection Bill comes at the right time. In today's Internet world, personal data can easily be stolen or misused by unscrupulous people. Singapore is unlike the EU, US, Canada, Australia or New Zealand, where comprehensive consumer data protection laws are in force. Quite often, we receive uninvited calls, SMSes or emails trying to sell various products and services. The most annoying is a call like this  ""xxx, you are our bank's valued customer; I call to recommend our newest insurance products/loans."" Banks possess our personal data and they vow to keep the information confidential. However, the banks pass our mobile phone numbers to their agents and partners who in turn promote insurance products we usually do not need. I believe many Members of the House might have similar experiences!",2,522,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00522
2012-10-15-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Therefore, the Do Not Call registry will be welcomed by many people. Clause 40 of the Bill stipulates that customer can apply and register his telephone number with the registry or to have the number removed from the registry in the form and manner determined by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC). I hope that PDPC can simplify the application process. It would be ideal if we could allow consumers to apply through phone, using any of the four official languages, after simple authentication of identity. If the consumer subsequently decides to pull out, I suggest the application to remove his number from the registry has to be made in writing. We do not want unscrupulous people or organisations to take advantage of illiterate Singaporeans by persuading them to withdraw from the registry, or to withdraw on their behalf.",3,523,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00523
2012-10-15-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"While we protect the consumers, we also need to provide some safeguards to SMEs, so as to curb the cost of compliance. Section 3 of clause 11 mandates that an organisation must designate an individual to ensure that the organisation complies with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). For example, EU Data Protection Law stipulates that organisations with over 250 staff must employ one dedicated data protection officer. However, considering SMEs' limited resources, perhaps the Commission could consider establishing a consulting service to help SMEs to comply with the requirements of PDPA at affordable fees.",4,524,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00524

2012-10-15-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In recent years, the technology of digital camera and video camera has improved drastically while the costs remain affordable. Consequently, more and more companies install surveillance camera on their premises to deter crime, help solve customer disputes, etc. At this point of time, I would like to declare my interest as I work in a Public Transport Organisation (PTO). We operate trains and buses that are installed with CCTV. I understand that video images recorded by surveillance cameras could be considered as personal data and come under the ambit of the Bill. I agree. Under clause 24 of the Bill, an organisation shall protect the video images which include taking steps to prevent the images from circulating on websites, such as YouTube, without prior authorisation.",6,526,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00526
2012-10-15-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"(In English)  In the last part of my Mandarin speech, I said I am glad that video images recorded by the surveillance cameras are considered as personal data as the video images can identify an individual. I understand that the PDPC will be issuing guidelines on the application of the PDPA to the use of CCTV and surveillance cameras.",7,527,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00527
2012-10-15-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I suggest that the PDPC could take reference from the data protection legislation in the EU when drafting the guidelines. For example, the guidelines can require organisations to inform their customers or members of the public about the presence of CCTV on their premises. They should also make provision to protect the CCTV video recordings in their possession or under their control by having reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal and similar risks, as stated in clause 24 of the Bill.",8,528,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00528
2012-10-15-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"At the same time, it is advisable that an organisation should only release the CCTV recordings to public agencies, as defined in clause 2 of the Bill, and not to individuals, especially with regard to law and order issues such as allegation of thefts or assaults. This is because CCTV recordings, most of the time, may reveal images of other individuals which could be construed as personal data about these individuals and fall under the provision of clause 21, section (3)(c).",9,529,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00529
2012-10-15-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"On the issue of transfer of personal data outside Singapore, I am disappointed that the Bill does not sufficiently protect the consumer. Clause 26, section 1, states that an organisation shall not transfer any personal data to a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with requirements prescribed under the Bill. However, putting the onus on the organisations that collect the data in Singapore to ensure that a comparable standard of protection is accorded to the personal data transferred overseas is, in my view, asking a fox to mind the chicken coop. Organisations and businesses will be inclined to take the routes most beneficial to their own entities and bottom line. To this end, I would urge the Minister to consider allowing personal data to be transferred to a third country only if that country provides an adequate level of protection, that is, at the country level rather than at the firm level.",10,530,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00530

2012-10-15-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Lastly, I would like to ask the Minister whether the personal data and information collected during the house visits and walkabouts by fellow Members of the House, including myself, would fall under the purview of this Bill. I am of the opinion that the same standards and regulations should apply but I hope the Minister could elaborate.",12,532,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00532
2012-10-15-T-020,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill which will help to safeguard individuals' personal data against misuse, ensuring the interests of our consumers and putting us on par with advanced economies in terms of data protection laws. It is also good to note that most organisations and companies will be subject to this baseline law in ensuring compliance from the way customers' data is collected to establishing the accuracy of its data and defining its retention and usage within and outside of Singapore.",1,533,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00533
2012-10-15-T-020,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"A difficult challenge that this new Bill has to address is to balance between satisfying the consumers' need for information and to prevent the infringement of their private space with spam e-mails, unsolicited SMSes and calls. It seems to me that the measure before and after Personal Data Protection (PDP) may sway to one or the other end for the caller and intended recipient. Before the PDP is proposed, the intended recipient will usually be hounded by sales or telemarketing calls often regarding banking, insurance or property marketing. After the PDP and the Do Not Call (DNC) registry option are implemented, will the majority of people list themselves on the register? It may be easier and faster to reject the call than to list the organisation or person under the register. If the calls are persistent, would enhancing harassment laws not be a more effective deterrent? While the DNC register is a good initiative, I ask whether it will entirely solve the problem of nuisance calls or it will just be a back-up option that is not fully utilised. The fact remains that people do not even know how their personal data is compromised in the business-to-business transactions of customer database.",2,534,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00534
2012-10-15-T-020,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"I would like to provide the classic case of cold calls from property agents to illustrate how seeking a balance for consumers can be tricky. The context of the intended recipient will blur what should be considered as a breach of personal data or what can be considered to be a normal market transaction. For a property owner who is looking to sell or rent his or her property, he or she would welcome as many calls as possible by property agents, solicited or unsolicited, to get the best price or quotation. He or she may even encourage personal data to be passed on from one property firm to the other. Having sold or rented the property, would the individual therefore regard further calls by interested agents to be with or without ""consent""? It may be difficult to apply the DNC regime in such a broad stroke for the customer or consumer. From another perspective, the new privacy laws will also add on to the burden of businesses having to manage their clients' ever evolving needs.",3,535,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00535

2012-10-15-T-020,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Under the new Bill, it is stated that organisations shall not attempt to obtain consent for collection or using personal data by deploying deceptive or misleading practices. We know how easy it is to bypass this by dangling a lucky draw to obtain personal details from the customer. By sharing my personal particulars for the lucky draw, I may have only consented to its usage for the lucky draw alone. I may not have agreed for the business to share these details with other business associates. However, from the company's perspective, they may have already regarded this as a broad consent, which in most cases are explicitly stated upfront in a lucky draw coupon, and for any of its intended commercial purposes such as promotion of products through e-mails, tele-marketing, and so on.",5,537,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00537
2012-10-15-T-020,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"So, when the sales mechanism is activated, one may find oneself unwittingly applying for a credit card or, in the worst case, signing away one's right for our personal data to be used in any way that the company wants. While consent can be withdrawn, it leads to much personal hassle which could have been prevented with better consumer knowledge. How do we ensure consumers understand the terms and conditions that they may have unwittingly agreed to? How about those who are not able to read and understand the fine print well? How does the new law draw the line in this case between promoting commerce and protecting the interests of consumers? What would be considered as deceptive and misleading practices? By putting forth these questions, I would like to highlight that the challenges will be in the execution, implementation and enforcement. This will include the criteria and the interpretation of the law and rules even though consumers can apply to be in the DNC register or carry out withdrawal of consent.",6,538,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00538
2012-10-15-T-020,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"From the business perspective, the new legislation may have adverse effects on the business if they are unable to handle the new privacy demands of their customers well. I am equally concerned on the impact on the livelihood of the many insurance and property agents as some of them may be freelance professionals themselves. With the new Bill, it would be useful to have supporting guidelines or guides in a succinct format, as to how these industries, their stakeholders and individuals are to act in compliance with the new laws and still be efficient and profitable. Perhaps, even the standard form or format which is in legal compliance with the new law is circulated or shared by the Ministry.",7,539,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00539

The apparent inconsistencies in the application of rules are an immediate concern. We know that the Government has its own set of data protection rules that public officers have to comply with. These rules are said to be like the PDP itself and therefore an additional layer of law is not needed.",8,540,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00540

Currently, for NTUC and our affiliated unions, we already have strict internal controls as to how we manage the database of our members to protect their privacy. My concern is whether the new laws will affect our outreach and communications to our workers and members. At the same time, will the Unions' organising efforts to engage more non-members in the public domain be affected?",10,542,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00542

While we understand that there is freedom of association, NTUC and our affiliated unions would like to share our benefits effectively to the working populace. It would be far easier to carry this out without the onerous requirements now set out. NTUC as an inclusive Labour Movement can only play the role of bringing different communities closer together. NTUC and our affiliated unions are driven by a social cause and not for profits. Hence, I submit that we should not be subject to these additional regulatory measures intended for the private sector. I would like to strongly appeal for organisations such as NTUC with a keen interest in workers' welfare to be exempted from this new Bill and Act.",11,543,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00543

The establishment of the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) is meant to implement the law. However, with its wide-ranging powers, I am concerned about the impact that it has on the civil rights of our people and commercial rights of our businesses. Herein lies the challenge of the balancing act again – how do we establish the genuine intention of fair business practices versus the indiscriminate selling of customer databases from business to business. It is important that while we will vest PDPC with its investigative powers such as search without warrant, the composition of PDPC should reflect the diverse perspectives of not just the Government but of businesses and civil rights leaders.

2012-10-15-T-020,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Imagine, if offers in supermarkets are not to be communicated to regular buyers, how would the customers react to their favourite retailers not communicating to them on bargain buys? Clearly, there is a distinction on what we would want to hear and what we do not want to hear from the marketers. A blanket approach may not be a good solution.",22,568,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00568

2012-10-15-T-020,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"This will ensure that the customer later does not cry foul that he was never informed, while the fact would have been that he had opted out of all marketing calls because he was irritated by one stray call for something he did not want. A simple and balanced approach is the way to go forward, than to weave complexity and create more work for all parties, including the judiciary. The cost-benefit analysis may also prove the complexity is unworthy. On the whole, I support the Bill, Sir.",25,571,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00571
2012-10-15-T-020,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. Over the last few years, many consumers have complained about the proliferation of unsolicited calls and SMSes which they received. These calls and SMSes generally try to sell them a service or product which they did not ask for. For example, I am not looking for a house. Yet, each month, I receive several SMSes promoting the sale of houses and the launch of new housing developments. In addition, I also receive cold calls from advertisers trying to sell me hotel packages, financial products and timeshare package.",1,572,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00572
2012-10-15-T-020,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, some of these calls were made at odd hours and some calls were made whilst consumers were overseas. Many consumers complain that they get very irritated each time they are overseas and received unsolicited calls or SMSes from advertisers. They then may have to bear the extra overseas telecom charges for these unsolicited advertising calls and SMSes. It is a waste of their time and disruptive to their work to have to answer to such calls or to read SMSes when they are busy or at a meeting.",2,573,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00573
2012-10-15-T-020,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I have also heard from a friend that once, when he tried to cut short the telemarketer and said that he was not interested in the product, he received a string of expletives and the caller then hung up the phone. Unfortunately, the marketing call was made from an unlisted telephone number and he had no recourse to complain.",3,574,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00574
2012-10-15-T-020,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, the general consensus is that much of the information which is available to commercial advertisers is derived from data which consumers innocently gave whilst filling in forms for lucky draws, for some VIP or privilege cards or completing survey forms. These data are then compiled and then traded for sale. Thus, if we search the Internet, we will find that some 5,000 names can be sold for as little as $250. In this computerised age, it is so easy to replicate and sell the data list again and again to different organisations trying to launch their new products or services. In fact, feedback from many consumers suggest that their details are being circulated amongst timeshare companies as these consumers receive repeated marketing calls from different timeshare companies.",4,575,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00575

I accept, Sir, that there is a need to balance the social benefits and economic advantages of some form of electronic advertising. It is also not in the interest of society to absolutely ban all forms of electronic advertisement, some of which may be educational in nature, some of which may promote a charitable cause and some of which may be for research. Thus, the definition of specified message at section 37 of the Bill with the exclusions at the Eighth Schedule is acceptable for the moment.

I appreciate the Ministry's sincere efforts to take into account the concerns of all stakeholders regarding personal data protection. Not less than three rounds of public consultations were conducted between September last year and this April. Members of the public and industries had contributed close to 1,900 feedback regarding this protection framework, the Do Not Call (DNC) registry and the proposed legislation. I would just like to add a couple of points.",1,591,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00591

2012-10-15-T-020,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Firstly, with 97% of the respondents in the MICA poll supporting the idea for a DNC registry, perhaps we should consider changing the registry to an opt-in list of phone and fax numbers instead. That is, only individuals who do not object to being contacted by organisations seeking to provide goods and services have to register for the list. The assumption is that the rest of the population does not desire unsolicited calls, SMSes and faxes. I think this is a more cost effective and efficient way. In addition, such a registry is more considerate of the needs of the vulnerable members of our society, including many elderly folks. Why should they be inconvenienced with the requirement of opting-out registration? In fact, I suspect after the passing of the Bill, telemarketers will end up targeting this group after the more savvy residents had submitted their opt-out applications.",3,593,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00593

First, I thank the many Members of this House for their support for this Bill, and for sharing their thoughts on important issues that this piece of legislation seeks to address. Sir, Members have raised many different scenarios about the protection of individuals and the concerns of organisations. The Bill is drafted to apply to all sectors in the economy and necessarily contains broad and general principles. It will therefore not be possible to give a definitive answer to each and every scenario, as this would require an assessment of all the facts of the specific case.",1,595,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00595

Sir, to ease organisations into the new law, the Bill provides a transition period of 12 to 18 months for organisations to adjust their practices to comply with the DNC registry and data protection requirements, respectively. During this period, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) will focus on building up the capabilities of organisations to comply with the Act. The PDPC will issue advisory guidelines, provide educational materials as well as conduct education and outreach activities to help both organisations and individuals better understand the Act.

Additional protection for other special groups that is required can thus be catered for by sector-specific laws. I take Ms Low Yen Ling and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef's point that children's personal data will be an increasingly important issue, as tools and platforms for collecting children's data become more prevalent.",29,623,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00623

2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, several Members raised queries about the Do Not Call or the DNC registry. Allow me to clarify some of these concerns. Mr Dhinakaran raised concerns about the DNC registry's impact on organisation practices. Today, nothing prevents organisations from freely collecting, using, sharing, or selling consumers' personal data without consent. The Bill imposes the necessary requirement on how organisations may collect, use or disclose personal data so as to protect individuals from the misuse of their personal data.",32,626,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00626
2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"To clarify a point mentioned by Mr Dhinakaran, the Bill does not prohibit the sharing of personal data between entities, as long as consent is obtained. This approach strikes a balance between allowing organisations to share personal data and allowing individuals to decide how their data may be used. The Bill also does not prescribe a retention period for personal data. It only states that organisations should not retain personal data when such retention no longer serves the purposes for which the data was collected. It does not make business sense – if you do not use it, delete it. This is in recognition that the appropriate retention period will vary according to the legal or the business needs of each organisation.",33,627,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00627
2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Requirements of the DNC registry are not as complex as some Members may perceive. Organisations that send marketing messages must check their contact list with the DNC registry within the prescribed period before sending the message. A 60-day checking interval will be prescribed for the first six months of the DNC registry's operation. Thereafter, we will reduce the checking interval to 30 days. An organisation will not be in breach of the rules if it sends marketing messages to individuals who register their numbers within the interval period, after the organisation has checked with the DNC registry. So, if you check on day one and his number is not there on the registry, you can send a marketing message to him. On day two, he enters his number in the registry. This is still within the prescribed period. However, this individual should not receive any marketing messages after the 60-day or 30-day interval. Organisations may still send marketing messages to registered members if they have obtained clear and unambiguous consent to do so, in written or other accessible form.",34,628,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00628
2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"In the examples raised by Members, seeking consent to use personal data using general or vaguely-worded clause, buried within pages of other terms and conditions, is unlikely to be considered clear and unambiguous consent. This may not comply with the requirement to notify individuals of the purposes of collecting, using or disclosing their personal data and could also be considered a misleading or deceptive practice prohibited under the Bill. Organisations should also retain the records of consent that its customers have given, to indicate that they can be contacted for telemarketing. This is a practical way for organisations to demonstrate that they are compliant with the law.",35,629,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00629

2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, Mr Zaqy Mohamad and Mr Lim Biow Chuan made a valid observation about telemarketing calls originating overseas. Similar concerns of the abuse of personal data by overseas organisations were also raised. While the PDPC may seek to enforce the Act against overseas organisations, in reality it may be difficult to investigate and proceed with any enforcement action against such organisations. Recognising this limitation, clause 37 provides the ability to enforce against any local organisation that authorises sending of the marketing message. So, this will mitigate the problem as marketing messages targeting Singapore telephone numbers are likely to involve goods and services by organisations with a local presence. The Bill also contemplates that the PDPC may establish arrangements with foreign data protection regulators, which may include cross-border co-operation.",37,631,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00631
2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, Asst Prof Eugene Tan asked about covering e-mails under the scope of the DNC registry. We have decided not to include e-mails as unsolicited e-mails can be blocked through e-mail filters and cause less of a nuisance to delete when received as compared to phone calls in the wee hours of the morning, SMSes and fax messages which are more difficult for the individuals to filter out. A significant proportion of spam e-mails also originate from overseas, which makes it difficult for any enforcement action to be taken, even if the e-mail messages were to be included.",38,632,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00632
2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, I take the point raised by Mr Dhinakaran that the DNC registry may lead to more organisations using mass marketing channels such as direct mailers and flyers. Sir, I would suggest that the DNC registry will better focus organisations' telemarketing efforts. This is because the DNC registry allows them to effectively target a group of consumers who are genuinely interested in receiving information on products and services, and eliminate time and resources wasted on those who do not wish to receive such information. It should drive more positive behaviour rather than negative behaviour.",39,633,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00633

2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, the Bill has taken the approach of protecting individuals' personal data without imposing overly onerous requirements on organisations. Requiring organisations to notify or deem consent from individuals for all personal data previously collected, would be too onerous. The Bill, therefore, takes a balanced approach by allowing organisations to use the personal data collected before their appointed date for the purpose for which it is collected, provided the purposes are reasonable. After the law comes into effect, individuals can withdraw consent that was previously given. These measures will help protect consumers from those who seek to use the transition period to misuse personal data before the law comes into effect.",42,636,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00636

Ms Jessica Tan proposed different sunrise periods for 12 months for large businesses and two years for small businesses.

2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, several Members touched on the issue of enforcement and implementation. The Bill provides the PDPC with a range of powers to enforce the Act effectively. It adopts what we call a complaints-based approach to enforcement and the PDPC will have the powers to initiate investigation or investigate if a complaint is lodged. It will have the power to investigate potential non-compliance and the power to issue directions to organisations to correct their non-compliance. In enforcing the law, the PDPC is expected to act on cases in a timely manner and may issue advisory guidelines on its procedures and associated timelines in due course.",46,640,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00640
2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Mr Desmond Lee expressed concern about the dispute resolution and the appeal process being cumbersome. The approach, Sir, takes into consideration that a large majority of cases are likely to be resolved early, which may not require a decision by the PDPC. However, in instances where the PDPC is required to investigate and take enforcement action against an organisation, the appeals process allows for a quicker resolution through reconsideration while providing aggrieved parties the appropriate avenues to appeal to an independent appeal body. Further appeals to the High Court and the Court of Appeal are allowed on points of law or on the amount of the financial penalty imposed. Sir, this is in line with other laws such as the Competition Act.",47,641,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00641
2012-10-15-T-020,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Jessica Tan spoke on the role of the composition of the PDPC. As mentioned in my earlier speech, the PDPC will serve as Singapore's main authority on matters relating to personal data protection. It will also undertake education and outreach activities to promote public awareness of personal data protection in Singapore. An advisory committee will be appointed to provide advice to the PDPC. It will comprise members of the industry, members of the public and civil society. The exact composition of the PDPC and the advisory committee will be firmed up and announced in due course, if the Bill is passed.",48,642,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00642

To provide greater clarity on the interpretation and the application of the Act, the PDPC will issue advisory guidelines which will be developed in consultation with the industry. Public education will also be key as some Members have highlighted and, in this regard, the PDPC will reach out to the public, including our young children and schools, to raise awareness to the importance of personal data protection. So, while the Bill puts in place safeguards to protect consumers' personal data, ultimately, individuals will have to take responsibility for their own personal data.",50,644,2012-10-15-T-020-S-00644

Sir, the issues that Members have raised are among the myriad issues we have considered in formulating a model that takes into account the interests of different stakeholders and Singapore's needs. We also recognise interests and circumstances may change. We will, therefore, need to continue to review and adjust the law to address new and emerging issues.

The campaign sought to instil in Singaporeans of all ages the importance of keeping public places clean. More than just a campaign, there were also changes in public health laws, hawkers were re-housed at hawker centres, proper sewage systems were developed, and disease control was vigorously pursued. The belief was that improved environmental conditions will not only enhance the quality of life for Singaporeans and cultivate national pride but also attract foreign investors and tourists to our shores.",3,705,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00705

So, last Friday, I told Town Council cleaners not to do any cleaning from 5.00 pm onwards. And on Saturday, I went with about 100 grassroots leaders and community leaders to Khatib Central. We picked up bags and bags of rubbish. A lot of cigarettes butts, Toto/4D tickets and a lot of rubbish that was cleared out from the cars onto the carpark lots, and a lot of rubbish left behind at the loading and unloading bays at the back of the shops. And I am sure this is not uniquely Nee Soon South. It happens in a lot of places in Singapore.",6,708,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00708

We have become dependent on an army of 70,000 cleaners, who do two to three rounds of cleaning each day in the public areas. While the various Government agencies have organised awareness campaigns year after year, and enforced penalties on the offenders who were booked, many get away. They know that the enforcement officers cannot be everywhere, every time and any time.",7,709,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00709
2012-10-15-T-021,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"People are disposing litter where they should not. This is despite the fact that we almost ""litter"" our surroundings with bins to make it easier for them to throw their unwanted cups, papers, cigarette butts, etc. To many, they feel  why make the effort to throw the rubbish in the right place when someone will clean up after me? Somebody told me recently that in the radio Programme Capital 958 radio station, there was a caller who called in and said, ""I heard MP Lee Bee Wah say that she wants to implement ‘no cleaner days'. But we all have already paid Town Council fees, why should we be deprived of cleaners?"" This attitude is deplorable, indeed, and need to be changed! Those of us who dine at the hawker centres must have been plagued by the wince-worthy sight of messy tables covered with dirty utensils, food particles and gravy. Never mind that many large hawker centres these days have return points for patrons to deposit their dirty trays and utensils. It is very disheartening indeed! They can return the trays in schools and during their reservist training, why can it not be done when they are out into the working world?",8,710,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00710
2012-10-15-T-021,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Hiring more cleaners is not a long-lasting solution. Eventually, the wages of these cleaners will weigh down heavily upon the shoulders of the tax payers, while promoting further dependence on foreign workers. Neither is increasing the severity of penalties, if we cannot spare the resources to police offenders all over Singapore. The only solution is to change the mindset and habit of all residents of Singapore. There needs to be a commitment from us as individuals to uphold our Clean and Beautiful City image.",9,711,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00711
2012-10-15-T-021,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"It is crucial to understand why people litter in Singapore. I have arrived at a few main conclusions, based on personal observation and research shared by other countries as part of their anti-litter campaigns. Litterbugs have no sense of ownership; they litter at public places, thinking that it does not make a difference to their lives. They litter where litter has accumulated; this is evident in the case of stacks of rubbish found at lift landings or outside rubbish chutes in HDB estates. They litter where they know others will pick up after them; our cleaners are so efficient that litterbugs are under the impression that their offence is of no consequence. There is no reinforcement of anti-littering mentality from a young age. With the prevalence of maid employment, such mentality is probably deemed unnecessary by some parents as the maids would clean up after the children. Some adults, sadly, do not set a good example to their children. According to a survey this year by NEA about littering, about six in 10 respondents say they ""never litter"". This shows that about 60% of our population are considerate people with morals, but may lack the courage to tell off the 40% who litter, and would rather develop tolerance for the offence.",10,712,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00712

2012-10-15-T-021,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"It takes a concerted effort from all parties to make social responsibility obligatory. Government agencies may explore more effective enforcement methods to nab the litterbugs. While the state of cleanliness is deteriorating, I understand that the number of litterbugs nabbed is decreasing instead of increasing. I just wonder, why? Is it because the enforcement officers are not in plain clothes, but in uniforms where people can then recognise them? Or is there a lack of usage of technology?",12,714,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00714
2012-10-15-T-021,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Take South Korea − one of the countries praised for high public cleanliness standards – has likewise had its fair share of littering problems in the past. The Seoul authorities came up with a unique solution – reward citizens for producing evidence of lawbreakers, litterbugs included, caught red-handed in the act. This initiative was so popular and lucrative that courses were created to teach citizens how to take good photos and videos of offenders which could serve as evidence for the police. There is even a term ""ssu-parazzi"" which is used to refer to regular citizens who specialise in catching litterbugs on film.",13,715,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00715

On a serious note, they have proven their keen instincts for bizarre acts around them, as well as a sense of moral responsibility. Otherwise, they would not have taken the trouble and risk to capture those scenes and posting them online to shame the offenders. Let us make the most out of their interest and skills. Encourage them to turn over the evidence to the authorities. These would facilitate easier location and arrest of offenders.",15,717,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00717

2012-10-15-T-021,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Considering that the majority of people in Singapore do not litter, it is essential to grow this population by establishing a social norm where these morally-upright people are not afraid to reprimand litterbugs, where they are keen to spread good practices within their social sphere of influence. This is very commonly practised in Japan. I have a resident who just recently visited Japan with his daughter, and he told me that his daughter saw a Pepsi can left on the floor. With good intention, she picked up the can and she was walking to look for a bin. And she walked and walked and walked but could not find a bin. Then she quietly put it down on the floor again. And at this moment, she was surrounded by a group of Japanese and pointing to her to ask her to pick up the can. I think this is the behaviour that we would like to see in Singapore.",18,720,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00720

I commend such effort. I also propose teaching citizens how they can approach litterbugs in a safe and inoffensive manner to assert their stand, as one of the greatest concerns about calling out illegal acts is being treated with aggression. Perhaps if there is such a scheme, I would volunteer my grassroots leaders and residents who are keen to be trained by NEA. Let us showcase our role models. Let us recognise businesses that make the effort to encourage their employees to support the clean and beautiful philosophy.",19,721,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00721

It is time to instil these values via our education system by imparting knowledge and introducing hands-on projects. Education on social responsibility and public hygiene should be widely encouraged in school activities. My friends in Japan told me that Japanese children are encouraged and taught from a very young age to clean up after themselves. School children are tasked to work in teams to clean their classrooms and corridors after class on a rotational basis. Some schools even assign toilet cleaning duties to the students, although hired cleaners are still responsible for aspects that demand greater skill and difficulty. In local schools, toilet and cleaning duties tend to be delegated to errant students as a form of punishment. This should not be the case. Cleaning up after oneself is a social obligation that everyone should be proud of doing, not punished into doing. At home, parents should be good role models to their children.",20,722,2012-10-15-T-021-S-00722

Encourage them to provide proper facilities for convenient disposal of rubbish, and insist on proper behaviour and responsibility. Let us begin with the meeting rooms.

I just want to make five points. First, I believe, as Singaporeans, we need to reaffirm our vision to ensure that Singapore remains one of the cleanest and greenest cities in the world. This is an ambition that we must maintain. Second, we must start with an honest appraisal of our values, our attitudes, our mindset, our behaviour and our sense of collective responsibilities. Third, I echo Er Dr Lee's point that this has to be an all-out effort by all segments of our society to prevent, to detect, to deter and to enforce against littering and to use the many new technologies which are available. Fourth, litter attracts litter. That means we have to make sure that we have a litter-free environment to start with.

Having said that, let me also equally, honestly state that we can and must do much better. Quite frankly, Singapore today is a clean city, but is it a clean city, or a cleaned city because of our army of 70,000 cleaners?",4,733,2012-10-15-T-023-S-00733

We have to find a way to deal with this problem. In fact, it is a problem caused by a minority but the burden is borne by the majority of us who have to deal with a polluted, dirty and unhealthy environment and ultimately have to also bear the cost of imposing these burdens on to cleaners.

He said that everybody can learn and acquire the habit of treating common user areas as one's own home to be kept clean and maintained. These are words 44 years later but still relevant and we are still challenged by that. The Keep Singapore Clean message was broadcast through the mass media, stamped even on letters from the Government and statutory boards. At that time, the Government brought volunteers out onto the streets. They called them ""Broomstick Brigades"" to clean up the common areas of our constituencies. I can see from recent media reports that some residents have started to undertake their own cleaning brigades albeit only in the vicinity of their homes or outside their common corridors. We need to have more of such efforts. We need Members of Parliament to take the lead in this because we need to rediscover, reaffirm our civic values as individuals and as communities. We need to teach everyone that we have to pick up after ourselves, whether that means picking up rubbish within the home or outside in the common corridor or any neighbourhood.

I am glad that, in fact, Singaporeans do take pride in the fact that we are a clean city and that we are a fine city. Even now, I receive – and I am sure many of you receive – many calls and e-mails from Singaporeans and especially from our constituents when the neighbourhood is littered. Some of them are very, very angry and get almost personal. If you look beyond their anger, in fact, it springs from a sense of wounded pride that their neighbourhood does not meet the standards which they hope for.

In June this year, the youth became cleaners for a day in Tiong Bahru Food Centre. They encouraged their patrons to return their trays and to clear up after they finished their meals.

But I think more important than that, if you stop to realise that every single piece of litter that you picked up is because someone else just could not be bothered and dropped it. Except for leaves on the road, everything else is caused by your fellow men. The purpose of having a Know Cleaners Day – and Er Dr Lee mentioned she is leading one such effort in her own constituency – is that it, in fact, makes you appreciate how selfish a small minority of people in our community are, and how the rest of our community, directly or indirectly, are having to carry that burden.",13,742,2012-10-15-T-023-S-00742

These cameras have enabled NEA to identify and initiate action against two offenders so far. If convicted, high-rise litterers can be fined a maximum of $1,000 and/or be issued a Corrective Work Order (CWO) not exceeding 12 hours.

2012-10-15-T-028,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,Taxi fares were deregulated in September 2008 to allow taxi operators flexibility to price their services according to the cost of service provision and to respond to changes in market conditions. Regulating taxi fares would take away this market-friendly flexibility. It would also not in itself prevent taxi drivers from overcharging their passengers.

The current income ceiling allows about eight in 10 households to qualify for new flats from HDB. We will periodically review and may revise the income ceiling when necessary. Meanwhile, our priority is to ramp up the supply of new flats, to address the imbalance in supply and demand.

For the film industry, MDA has been supporting local filmmakers to travel and showcase their works at international market events and film festivals, including Cannes Film Festival and Pusan Film Festival. MDA also facilitates the submission of Singapore films for overseas showcases or awards, and supports the films' marketing and publicity efforts to increase their exposure and recognition internationally.",2,814,2012-10-15-T-032-S-00814

First, local animation company Sparky Animation, collaborated with Japan's Bandai Visual, Baku Enterprise, Dentsu, and Duckbill Entertainment, on a CGI animated television programme based on the Japanese book series One Stormy Night. The programme premiered on TV Tokyo, TV Osaka and TV Aichi in April this year. A second example is from Singapore's leading Stereoscopic 3D computer graphics animation production company, Tiny Island Productions.

To date, we have established official co-production agreements with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, China and Korea, and facilitated more than 20 projects, ranging from documentaries, animation series to feature films, through this network of agreements. By doing so, MDA hopes to secure a beachhead for our companies to identify co-production opportunities and partnerships with other like-minded companies.",7,819,2012-10-15-T-032-S-00819

For instance, effective from end-July 2012, MDA has put in place a revised copyright ownership framework for MDA-supported, locally produced Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) programmes. This framework recognises and accords ownership of the copyright of PSB productions to content creators, who are generally the production companies that have created and produced the original content. While the production of PSB content is primarily to serve the public viewing interest of Singapore viewers, the revised copyright ownership framework is an important step that will put our production companies in a better position to exploit their assets for sale of programmes overseas, licensing and merchandising.",8,820,2012-10-15-T-032-S-00820

2012-10-15-T-035,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Prior to July 2011, the BCA allowed tempered glass in panels to be used as safety barriers because tempered glass is known for its strength, and can withstand the horizontal loading and impact. Tempered glass does have a risk of spontaneous shattering which is caused by the expansion of nickel sulphide (Nis) crystals over time in the glass. Spontaneous shattering is, however, rare. That is why its use as safety barriers continues to be allowed in many countries, including USA, UK, Australia and Hong Kong.",2,835,2012-10-15-T-035-S-00835

Laminated glass is the bonding of two or more pieces of glass together for greater strength. If one or more of the glass layers break, the laminate will have some residual strength, while the plastic interlayer will hold the broken glass fragments together, preventing them from falling from height. Tempered glass can still be used as glass layers in laminated glass.",4,837,2012-10-15-T-035-S-00837

About a third of the cases are on cleanliness of areas that were previously under the care of other agencies, and the DPC worked with these agencies to resolve them expeditiously, mostly within two working days. Less than 1% of the cases were more complex and took longer to resolve as they involved multiple agencies or review of existing policies and processes. We are happy to note that the initial public feedback from the cases handled so far has been positive given the greater ease in reporting cleaning lapses and the more responsive follow-up actions.",5,846,2012-10-15-T-036-S-00846

2012-10-15-T-042,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The three LUP blocks in Bukit Batok in question have internal voids and balconies. Such blocks require a long lift landing bridge to connect the new lift shaft to the existing staircase. To address concerns over privacy and security arising from the proximity of these bridges to their balconies, the residents selected a design solution with high walls at the bridges.",1,891,2012-10-15-T-042-S-00891
2012-10-15-T-042,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"This design solution, however, reduces cross ventilation at the landing bridge and hinders smoke dispersion in the event of a fire. To comply with the fire safety requirements, a fire-rated door has to be installed at the end of the bridge to separate the lift lobby area from the staircase.

Over the last five years, each race has attracted close to 40,000 international visitors and about $150 million in incremental tourism receipts on average. Of this sum, about one-third or $50 million goes directly to the retail and F&B sectors, of which SMEs form a significant proportion. SMEs also account for about 80% of the race promoter Singapore GP's (SGP) race organisation works annually.",1,896,2012-10-15-T-043-S-00896

For example, the duration of road closures has been halved from 12 days in 2008 to six today. LTA and SGP have also been working with businesses in the Marina Square and Suntec area to help more of their employees, suppliers and key customers drive to and from the malls via Raffles Boulevard, except during race times.

2012-10-15-T-066,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Medisave is primarily meant to help pay for hospitalisation, but we have extended Medisave usage to outpatient treatment, such as diagnostic MRI and CT scans, if they form part of cancer treatment, up to the withdrawal limit of $600 per patient per year.",1,1047,2012-10-15-T-066-S-01047
2012-10-15-T-066,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,Medisave withdrawal limits are generally set to be sufficient for the majority of patients in the Government hospitals and medical institutions. The current $600 limit is able to cover about 95% of the annual costs for Singaporean cancer patients at the Government hospitals and medical institutions. It was also adequate to fully cover the cost of scans for more than four in five such patients.,2,1048,2012-10-15-T-066-S-01048
2012-10-15-T-066,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We need to balance higher withdrawal limits with the risk of cost escalation or over-consumption, especially at the private hospitals and clinics, to avoid premature depletion of Medisave balances.

Recent studies indicate that the incidence rates of smoking among the youth are showing signs of an increase, similar to many countries in the world. Therefore, our efforts need to be sustained, especially for each new cohort of youth, and we also need to ensure that our youth remain smoke-free as they get older. Hence, we have adopted a multi-pronged, whole-of-Government approach. This comprises legislation, health promotion and education, and smoking cessation efforts involving multiple agencies that aim at denormalising tobacco use and establishing smoke-free living as the social norm in Singapore.",2,1055,2012-10-15-T-067-S-01055

2012-10-15-T-070,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The re-routing of flights through Dubai affects about 1% of Changi's total number of flights and up to 2% of Changi's total passenger traffic.

2012-10-15-T-070,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Despite the withdrawal of Qantas' flights to London, Singapore remains well connected to London by British Airways and Singapore Airlines, with SIA having recently started a fourth daily flight between Singapore and London. At the same time, Changi Airport remains an important air hub for Australian travellers, with 10 passenger airlines operating more than 220 weekly services between Singapore and seven points in Australia. We believe that some of these airlines will capitalise on Qantas' partial withdrawal from Changi to gain market share, for example, Australian passengers who may prefer to fly through and stop-over in Singapore en route to London, rather than through Dubai. Changi Airport Group (CAG) will support these efforts. CAG will also work with Qantas on its plans to grow its Asian network through Changi Airport, building on the 90 weekly flights that Qantas currently operates between Singapore and Australia.",4,1082,2012-10-15-T-070-S-01082
2012-10-15-T-070,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The Qantas-Emirates development underscores the rapidly evolving landscape in the aviation sector and the intense competition that Singapore faces as an air hub. It is a timely reminder that we must not take our hub status for granted.

While ultra-long range aircraft allow some traffic to by-pass Singapore and fly non-stop to their destinations, such aircraft can also be used to open non-stop routes that were not previously possible, from Singapore to far away cities, such as in Latin America and North America. Singapore Airlines' ultra-long range flight using the Airbus A340-500 aircraft for non-stop service to New York is one such example.",6,1084,2012-10-15-T-070-S-01084

To encourage airlines (both Singapore and foreign carriers) to grow their operations at and through Singapore, the Government will continue to expand Air Services Agreements with key markets.

We invest in public education to reach out to low-income families with young children. In addition, since 2007, we have implemented a specific outreach programme that reaches out to five- and six-year-olds from low-income families who are not attending pre-school.

Grassroots leaders and social workers would then conduct house visits to explain the importance of pre-school education to these families. They will assist the families to find a place in a childcare centre or kindergarten close to home. Those who need financial assistance will be guided and referred to the Community Development Councils. For families with multiple needs, social workers will assist them with casework support in areas, such as employment and family issues. The child's attendance in pre-school is also monitored to ensure that the child attends pre-school regularly.",2,1129,2012-10-15-T-076-S-01129

2012-10-15-T-077,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Under-employment is commonly defined in two ways. Firstly, time-related under-employment, an internationally accepted statistical concept, examines the extent to which a person is insufficiently engaged in employment based on hours of work. Specifically, it refers to persons working part-time but are willing and able to engage in additional work. Secondly, non time-related under-employment refers to employment which does not make full use of, or pay according to skills that workers could offer.
