2020-03-06-T-001-S-00001,2020-03-06-T-001,1,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry has conducted a study on students from Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools for their attitudes towards inclusivity and respect for people of different cultural backgrounds; (b) if so, to what extent do the results of these studies diverge from those of students from non-SAP schools; and (c) if not, whether the Ministry will consider conducting such a study."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00002,2020-03-06-T-001,2,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, before I answer the Member’s Parliamentary Question (PQ), it is useful to remind ourselves about the origins of SAP schools."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00003,2020-03-06-T-001,3,Low Yen Ling,"We are a diverse, immigrant society. In the early years of our Independence, we established English as the common working language for multi-cultural Singapore, as a practical arrangement, to access global economic opportunities and create jobs for Singaporeans."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00004,2020-03-06-T-001,4,Low Yen Ling,"Recognising this, parents started sending their children to English schools and as a result, enrolment for Chinese-medium schools fell drastically in the 1970s and 1980s."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00005,2020-03-06-T-001,5,Low Yen Ling,"Hence, in 1979, the Government established SAP schools, to preserve the ethos of Chinese-medium schools and promote the learning of the language and its culture, while still using English as the primary language of instruction."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00006,2020-03-06-T-001,6,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, SAP schools did not start as popular schools. On the contrary, they were established as part of a struggle to preserve the Chinese language and culture. But over the years, with the dedicated efforts of the schools and the support of the community, and helped by the rise of China, they have become more popular."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00007,2020-03-06-T-001,7,Low Yen Ling,"Education in Singapore reflects the diversity of our society. We make bilingualism a cornerstone of our education policy. We offer opportunities for students to pursue MTL at a higher level – not just through SAP schools, but also through the Elective Programme in Malay Language for Secondary Schools (EMAS), Language Elective Programmes for Chinese, Malay and Tamil, and the National Elective Tamil Programme. Government schools, clan-based and religiously-affiliated schools, SAP schools and designated schools like the madrasahs all co-exist in our education landscape."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00008,2020-03-06-T-001,8,Low Yen Ling,"At the same time, we ensure that our students get to learn about the languages and cultures of other communities. National programmes, such as Values in Action and the Outward Bound School, offer our students the chance to forge bonds across communities and social groups."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00009,2020-03-06-T-001,9,Low Yen Ling,"Likewise, SAP schools make substantial efforts to encourage and build the students’ understanding of other cultures, through inter-school, cluster-based and community-based activities such as camps, festive celebrations and dialogues. Almost all SAP schools teach their students conversational Malay."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00010,2020-03-06-T-001,10,Low Yen Ling,All these efforts have an impact. A 2018 study found that there is no difference in the attitudes of Secondary school students in SAP and non-SAP schools towards people from different backgrounds and cultures.
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00011,2020-03-06-T-001,11,Low Yen Ling,"MOE will continue our efforts in this area. So, regardless of what school we are from – be it SAP, independent, clan or mission-based – we must do our part to forge a united Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00012,2020-03-06-T-001,12,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00013,2020-03-06-T-001,13,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Sir, and I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. I understand that we teach the students at SAP schools about other cultures, other languages and that there is social mixing between the schools. But could I ask what would be MOE's efforts to ensure that there is social mixing within the school?"
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00014,2020-03-06-T-001,14,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Member for his supplementary question. So, he is asking about social mixing within the school and not about across different schools. Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to reiterate that SAP schools remain relevant and there is a reason why I am explaining this."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00015,2020-03-06-T-001,15,Low Yen Ling,"SAP schools remain relevant from the broader perspective of an evolving multi-cultural Singapore, amidst a changing global dynamic. We all know Asia is the fastest growing region in the world and we all know China is our largest trading partner. We also know that as countries around us catch up in the learning of multiple languages, bilingualism may no longer be a unique advantage that Singaporeans possess. That is why we certainly would want to continue to preserve and improve on the programmes that promote the learning of Mother Tongue Languages as much as possible. I have cited what are the various types of schools in our very diverse education landscape."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00016,2020-03-06-T-001,16,Low Yen Ling,"SAP schools are uniquely positioned to immerse the students in an environment that is rich in Chinese language and culture, with the aim of developing effectively bilingual, bi-cultural talents, given the context that I have explained earlier. But I also want to re-assure the Member, that within the schools, the students do not just learn Chinese language and English language. If they want to learn the Malay language, they would be given as much support to do so. For example, they can learn Malay language or Bahasa Indonesia as a third language at the MOE Language Centre or take up the Malay Special Programme at the Zonal Centre or within the school."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00017,2020-03-06-T-001,17,Low Yen Ling,"I am happy to update the Member that within the school itself, for example, for the SAP Secondary schools – we have 11 of them – seven of them have their own in-house Malay Special Programme. So, seven out of 11 SAP Secondary schools implement their Malay Special Programme within the school. It also allows for social mixing as they learn the Malay language within the same school."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00018,2020-03-06-T-001,18,Low Yen Ling,"Furthermore, we have made Conversational Malay available in almost all SAP schools. This is important because it opens up the ability of our SAP school students to appreciate the Malay language and culture, and then, equips them with the skills to communicate, not just with students within the same school but also with peers from other schools and the community, and also, from the region."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00019,2020-03-06-T-001,19,Low Yen Ling,"I want to assure the Member that the SAP schools will continue to encourage their students to interact with peers within the school and peers from other schools as well as from the community, and give them multiple platforms to learn about and also to interact with other cultures, so that we can forge an inclusive and united Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00020,2020-03-06-T-001,20,Speaker,Minister Ong.
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00021,2020-03-06-T-001,21,Ong Ye Kung,"I think if we are honest and we just look around us, look around the world, in a country where there is a majority community, they will tend to insist that the language that the majority speaks becomes the national language and then, school instruction becomes in that language. You do not have to look very far – just look around us."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00022,2020-03-06-T-001,22,Ong Ye Kung,"In Singapore, we have majority of one community but we have decided we shall be a multi-racial country. And therefore, we use English, that is neutral to all, a common language for everyone. But having done that, let us make sure we respect the fact that every community also values their own language, customs, culture. This is why within our education system, different kinds of schools – from SAP schools to clan-based, church-based ones, specially-designated madrasah schools, the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre – they all exist as part of our education landscape."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00023,2020-03-06-T-001,23,Ong Ye Kung,"This is how we reconcile as a country the fact that we all have multiple levels of identity. Two important ones are  first, we are all Singaporeans; second, we are also a member of our ethnic community. Therefore, there is a place for all these schools."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00024,2020-03-06-T-001,24,Ong Ye Kung,"So, within SAP schools, there is a downside – as the Member mentioned – which is that there are less opportunities to interact with members of other races. But we live in Singapore! So, let us be realistic. If you are a student in a SAP school and you feel that you do not have the opportunities, come, volunteer for the Member of Parliament! We have plenty of opportunities. Just get into the community, visit the hawker centres – this is Singapore. You do not have to confine yourself to just revolving around your classrooms."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00025,2020-03-06-T-001,25,Ong Ye Kung,"I think SAP schools can do more. I would say that they can do more and they have been doing more. Visiting several SAP schools, I am actually quite glad and amazed at the efforts they have taken to teach Conversational Malay. Many SAP school students – Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim has met some of them – are speaking very fluent Malay, and are able to go out to the community and interact with people."
2020-03-06-T-001-S-00026,2020-03-06-T-001,26,Ong Ye Kung,"So, be mindful that in Singapore, do not take extreme positions. We all have multiple levels of identity; they are all important to us, but we have always managed that and we are a society that is, a work in progress."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00027,2020-03-06-T-002,27,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Health what is the rationale for banning ex-offenders from donating blood within one year of their prison release.
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00028,2020-03-06-T-002,28,Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, to ensure a safe and high-quality blood supply for our patients in Singapore, pre-donation interviews are conducted to screen blood donors for risk factors and blood donations are also tested for blood-borne infections."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00029,2020-03-06-T-002,29,Lam Pin Min,"However, infections can only be detected some time after the blood donors have been infected. This is known as the window period. Therefore, donors who have been exposed to infection risks will be asked to defer their donation until after the window period."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00030,2020-03-06-T-002,30,Lam Pin Min,"For this reason, the World Health Organization recommends an appropriate deferral period after ex-offenders have been released from prison before blood donation. HSA has adopted a one-year deferral period, aligned with the practices of other countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States of America. It ensures that the window period after these donors become infected has passed, enabling the screening tests to detect blood-borne infections if any, as patient safety is utmost important and cannot be compromised."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00031,2020-03-06-T-002,31,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I do understand we are following WHO guidelines. But WHO says prisons are extremely high-risk environments for transmission of HIV due to over-crowding, poor nutrition, limited access to healthcare, continued drug use, unsafe injecting practices, unprotected sex and tattooing."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00032,2020-03-06-T-002,32,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"This might be representative of other prisons, but can I ask the Senior Minister of State whether this is representative of the Singapore prisons? And having myself visited the prisons, I am quite sure that this is not. If it is not, then why do we follow the WHO guidelines when our prisons are not the same as other prisons?"
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00033,2020-03-06-T-002,33,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The second clarification is, if we really do believe that the Singapore Prison is an area where there is high infections, then, surely, MOH should be doing something to protect our inmates against HIV, Hepatitis B which we can vaccinate against, and Hepatitis C, rather than the stigma of the ex-offender coming out and then, going to try and donate blood, and the doctor says, ""No, you can't because you are an ex-offender."" And that is a real-life example because it was an ex-offender who emailed me after coming to my blood donation drive in Nee Soon East and being turned away."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00034,2020-03-06-T-002,34,Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank the Member for those clarifications. As I have mentioned, HSA has very high standards on donor criteria to ensure the safety of blood supply. I think that this is something that all of us do support. We also know that studies have shown that inmates of prisons and corrective institutions have a higher incidence of infections from blood-borne diseases such as Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. This is a fact."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00035,2020-03-06-T-002,35,Lam Pin Min,"Although there are no reported instances of inmates contracting blood-borne or infectious diseases while in Singapore's prison – and this is something that we are very proud of as compared to many of the other prisons that Mr Louis Ng has alluded to – we still need to err on the side of caution as inmates may have contracted the infectious diseases before their admission to prison. We also acknowledge that they are considered a higher risk group compared to the population. If I can just quote some statistics  for HIV, for the general population between the age 15 and 45 in Singapore, the HIV prevalence is 0.2% but it is 1.1% amongst inmates or ex-inmates. This is a fact that they are of a higher risk profile."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00036,2020-03-06-T-002,36,Lam Pin Min,"Like I have mentioned in my reply, they may be in the window period, so therefore, we have adopted what WHO has recommended, taking into consideration all these factors."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00037,2020-03-06-T-002,37,Lam Pin Min,"I also thank the ex-inmate who came forward to donate. I think for genuine donors, they can still continue to come forward to donate their blood after that 12-month deferral period."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00038,2020-03-06-T-002,38,Speaker,Ms Anthea Ong.
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00039,2020-03-06-T-002,39,Anthea Ong,"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State. On this topic of blood donation, I mentioned it yesterday in my cut, too, that there are persons with mental health conditions who declared and were also turned away at the blood banks here in Singapore. It just concerns me that between ex-offenders and persons with mental health conditions, our blood donation policy seems to be entrenched deeply in stigma that we are trying so hard to get rid of. Could the Senior Minister of State explain why persons with mental conditions are turned away at blood donation drives?"
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00040,2020-03-06-T-002,40,Lam Pin Min,"I thank the Member for that clarification. As far as I know, not all mental conditions will be excluded from blood donation. In fact, we have checked with HSA. There is a wide spectrum of mental illnesses – from very mild mental conditions to very severe conditions. So, as long as the patient with mental illness is able to prove from maybe some form of certification from their psychiatrist or doctor that they able to make decisions on their own, then, we will be able to accept them as blood donors."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00041,2020-03-06-T-002,41,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, the follow-up question to my second point – what is MOH doing to help the inmates who have been released? We are saying that a year from their release date, they have very high potential of being infected with Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV, surely, MOH should have a programme to help these inmates following their release."
2020-03-06-T-002-S-00042,2020-03-06-T-002,42,Lam Pin Min,"I think we must be cognisant that the reason why they are inmates is because of certain things that have happened, prior to that. That actually pre-disposes them to some high-risk behaviours. While we do not want to say that every single person who has been admitted to prison is considered high risk, we do need to take an approach whereby we have to err on the side of caution. Like I have mentioned, for genuine donors, they are still welcomed to donate after the 12-month deferral period."
2020-03-06-T-003-S-00043,2020-03-06-T-003,43,Anthea Ong,"asked the Minister for Health (a) why is ""treatment of self-inflicted injuries or injuries resulting from attempted suicide"" not covered under MediShield Life; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider removing this from the standard exclusions under MediShield Life."
2020-03-06-T-003-S-00044,2020-03-06-T-003,44,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, the general rule is that treatment of self-inflicted injuries or injuries resulting from attempted suicide is excluded from MediShield Life, so as to not encourage this kind of behaviour. Nonetheless, exceptions can be considered where such injuries might arise from mental illnesses."
2020-03-06-T-003-S-00045,2020-03-06-T-003,45,Anthea Ong,"I thank the Senior Minister of State. In a Parliamentary Question (PQ) that I had filed last month, it was shared that from 2016 to 2018, we had about 300 claims in this category that were excluded every year. Would the Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong please share if there will be a review at least to see if we can include such injuries?"
2020-03-06-T-003-S-00046,2020-03-06-T-003,46,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I had mentioned, we exclude them as a general rule because you do not encourage this kind of behaviour. We do not want to encourage people to self-inflict injuries and that is why MediShield Life does not cover it. Nonetheless, to the extent that these injuries arise as a result of an existing mental condition that might pre-dispose the claimant or the person to inflicting the injuries on himself or herself, in those situations, we can consider exceptions to the general positions."
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00047,2020-03-06-T-004,47,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider providing more incentives, including partial funding, for shopping malls to install tactile paving to aid the visually impaired."
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00048,2020-03-06-T-004,48,Zaqy Mohamad,"Speaker, BCA’s Accessibility Fund (AF) provides co-funding for eligible building owners to upgrade their buildings with accessibility features. These features would also include aid for the visually impaired, such as tactile paving and information signage. For eligible private buildings, including shopping malls, the AF co-funds up to 60% of the construction cost for such features, capped at $300,000 per development."
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00049,2020-03-06-T-004,49,Zaqy Mohamad,"More information on the AF, including how to apply for funding, is available on BCA’s website. BCA will continue to reach out to building owners to raise awareness of the AF."
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00050,2020-03-06-T-004,50,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00051,2020-03-06-T-004,51,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Sir. This feedback actually came from a visually-impaired person who came to a dialogue session. He was sharing how at the Yishun Integrated Transport Hub, it really is very good. And I tried it. If you close your eyes, you can walk there, following the tactile paving. But his question was, it is very hard for him to get to there, to use the tactile paving because at the Northpoint City, there is no tactile paving."
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00052,2020-03-06-T-004,52,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I understand we are encouraging the building owners to provide these for the visually-impaired but I am just wondering whether we can perhaps make it compulsory so that the visually-impaired can find it easier to get around.
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00053,2020-03-06-T-004,53,Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his question. Today, under our building accessibility codes, the new buildings will certainly have such accessibility features on board. The AF is to encourage older buildings to come on board. I know Northpoint City is probably an older building. There are certain limitations with buildings that did not come with such designs. When they undergo A&A, BCA will try to encourage as much as we can. But to enforce it on all buildings is quite difficult because many of these buildings may or may not necessarily have the design features or they were not purpose-built for these. When buildings are being designed, we understand the newer ones, like the Member mentioned, are better equipped to provide such tactile pavings."
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00054,2020-03-06-T-004,54,Zaqy Mohamad,"For the older ones, to be fair to building owners, we will encourage them as they undergo A&A. They can still tap on to the Fund."
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00055,2020-03-06-T-004,55,Zaqy Mohamad,"The Fund is quite substantive – 60% and up to $300,000. It is not a small sum either, to encourage more building owners to come on board."
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00056,2020-03-06-T-004,56,Zaqy Mohamad,"To give an example, more than 90% of existing buildings in the Orchard Road shopping belt have already achieved barrier-free accessibility. Certainly, we can do more, and in the heartlands, especially, and see how we can make it better."
2020-03-06-T-004-S-00057,2020-03-06-T-004,57,Speaker,Order. End of Question Time. Mr Louis Ng.
2020-03-06-T-005-S-00058,2020-03-06-T-005,58,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Mr Speaker, I beg to move*, ""That leave be given to introduce a Bill intituled An Act to amend the Wild Animals and Birds Act (Chapter 351 of the 2000 Revised Edition)."""

2020-03-06-T-005-S-00060,2020-03-06-T-005,60,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, after more than two years of work by the Wild Animals Legislation Review Committee (WALRC), I am proud to say that we are now ready to move the Bill."
2020-03-06-T-005-S-00061,2020-03-06-T-005,61,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The WALRC comprises of representatives from the nature community, animal welfare community, the Singapore Pest Management Association, the Pet Enterprise and Traders Association of Singapore, the Buddhist Federation, academic and legal community and the Nee Soon East Youth Network. It has been a privilege chairing this committee and having meetings where we argue passionately, agree to disagree and work together so that we can have a stronger piece of legislation."
2020-03-06-T-005-S-00062,2020-03-06-T-005,62,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"We conducted extensive public consultations over the past two years. We started with a face-to-face public consultation, followed by an online consultation on REACH where we received over 1,000 responses. This was followed by another round of face-to-face public consultation. We also held closed-door consultations with the pest management companies and separately with religious leaders and also obtained feedback from the MND Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) Members. Later this month, we will publish a post-consultation summary online and on REACH."
2020-03-06-T-005-S-00063,2020-03-06-T-005,63,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I thank the WALRC for their hard work, and also thankful for the strong support and help from MND and NParks."

In particular, it seeks to  (a) control the feeding and release of wildlife in Singapore; (b) enable the Director-General, Wildlife Management of NParks to require wildlife-related measures to be implemented to address the impact of developments or works in relation to wildlife; (c) introduce new offences and enhance criminal penalties in the Act; and (d) enhance enforcement powers in the Act."
2020-03-06-T-005-S-00065,2020-03-06-T-005,65,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Mr Speaker, this Bill is drafted by the people with feedback and suggestions from the people.

2020-03-06-T-007-S-00079,2020-03-06-T-007,79,,"Head X – Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. Dr Lim Wee Kiak."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00080,2020-03-06-T-007,80,Lim Wee Kiak,"Mr Chairman, I beg to move, ""That the total sum to be allocated for Head X of the Estimates be reduced by $100""."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00081,2020-03-06-T-007,81,Lim Wee Kiak,"Today, the global environment is more fractious and societies are increasingly polarised. Disruptive technologies are changing our economies, our jobs, our way of life and challenging our norms. Singapore is a global city state that is multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious and in some way multinational is at the epicentre of these forces. If we are not careful, these global forces can exert tensions that will threaten, disrupt and test the strength of the fabric of our society."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00082,2020-03-06-T-007,82,Lim Wee Kiak,"While MCCY has done well in fostering a strong sense of national unity and pride through sectors of arts, youth, community and sports, new challenges such as the COVID-19, regional political turmoil and international trade tensions are always emerging and we must be prepared to remain resilient and stay united as one Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00083,2020-03-06-T-007,83,Lim Wee Kiak,"MCCY must continue to strengthen the social fabric and the solidarity in the face of these forces. Are the current MCCY's strategies still relevant in the building an inclusive home where everyone feels that we are equal members of the same community, and are given equal opportunities to thrive and to pursue one's passion and interest? Given the increasing diversity and fractious state of our society, can we continue to progress together as a people?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00084,2020-03-06-T-007,84,Lim Wee Kiak,"What unites us as one people, one nation? Is it the Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave when Singapore Lions beat Pahang during the 1994 Malaysian cup? Or the 50.39 secs that Joseph Schooling swam while we all held our breath in front of our TV screens during the 2016 Olympics? Or the nail-biting table tennis finals during the 2008 Olympics when our paddlers brought us a silver medal?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00085,2020-03-06-T-007,85,Lim Wee Kiak,"We wept as a nation as we mourned together during the passing of our beloved founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 2015. People of all walks of life regarding of race, language or religion came together to queue for hours under the weather, rain or shine, day or night, to pay their last respect."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00086,2020-03-06-T-007,86,Lim Wee Kiak,"We faced fear and death together during the 2003 SARS crisis which infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Today, we are again tested and challenged and tested with COVID-19. We are tackling these challenges together and collectively with resolute and resilience."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00087,2020-03-06-T-007,87,Lim Wee Kiak,"As we continue to progress, the natural fault lines in our society – socio-economic divide, racial and religious divide, ideology divide, sexual orientation divide, e-literacy divide and many more – will continue to exist and may surface from time to time to threaten our resolve and unity. Will we be able to rise to the occasion like previous challenges and emerge stronger or will we be divided and withered?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00088,2020-03-06-T-007,88,Lim Wee Kiak,"MCCY needs to intensify the efforts in building a home that provides opportunities for all. It is important while we embrace our diversity and differences as strength of our nation, we need to work hard to create and expand common spaces and experiences that is unique to Singapore. To do this, I have three suggestions."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00089,2020-03-06-T-007,89,Lim Wee Kiak,"One, use arts, culture and heritage unique to Singapore. Make of arts and cultural programmes more accessible and affordable to Singaporeans. Similar to the $100 Active SG credits for sports facilities, MCCY can consider giving all Singaporeans $100 Active Arts and Culture credit to attend arts and cultural courses or attend local arts & cultural performances."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00090,2020-03-06-T-007,90,Lim Wee Kiak,"Two, renew and remake of community clubs to remain relevant so that more Singaporeans will visit and use the CCs. Our CCs should be the Community Centre for arts, culture, wellness and health, social interactions and skills upgrading."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00091,2020-03-06-T-007,91,Lim Wee Kiak,"Three, expand and build up community sports that can unite and bring people together. Top up the Active SG credits on a regular basis to promote community sports and expand the use of Active credits to sports events attendance, including our SG football leagues and national sports events."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00092,2020-03-06-T-007,92,Lim Wee Kiak,"Chairman, building a home that provide opportunities for all is not just an ideal. It is a reality. It is a basic right for all Singaporeans. I would like to thank MCCY for their hard work and invite all Singaporeans from all walks of life to join MCCY to make this arduous task a reality."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00093,2020-03-06-T-007,93,Lim Wee Kiak,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00094,2020-03-06-T-007,94,Amrin Amin,"Mr Chairman, in Malay, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00095,2020-03-06-T-007,95,Amrin Amin,(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Our youths play a vital role in developing our community. MENDAKI has focused its efforts on providing educational support for youths. Some of MENDAKI's programmes include the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme and the Future Ready programme. Emotional support is also important to prepare our youths for the future. How is MENDAKI supporting our youths in their emotional development?
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00096,2020-03-06-T-007,96,Amrin Amin,(In English)  Next cut. Singaporean Muslims live in a diverse multi-racial community. We face unique challenges that are different from Muslim majority countries. Asatizah play a crucial role in guiding our community to live a rich and confident social religious life in a multi-religious Singapore.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00097,2020-03-06-T-007,97,Amrin Amin,Our asatizah have a profound impact on the outlook of Singaporean Muslims including how we practise Islam and how we interact with people of different faith. Almost all our asatizah are trained overseas in Muslim majority countries. MUIS is developing Post-Graduate Certificate in Islam in Contemporary Societies to socialise our returning graduates to our local needs and context.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00098,2020-03-06-T-007,98,Amrin Amin,Could the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs provide an update on this programme? How else is MUIS preparing our asatizah to guide Singaporean Muslim community to live in a multi-cultural modern society?
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00099,2020-03-06-T-007,99,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Chairman, in Malay, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00100,2020-03-06-T-007,100,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] To effectively guide the Muslim community who live in a multi-cultural society, the community depends on the asatizah to dispense religious knowledge that is based on lived reality and are able to address emerging issues, such as cryptocurrency and plant-based food."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00101,2020-03-06-T-007,101,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"It is important that the asatizah are equipped with the necessary skills to engage the community effectively. How can our asatizah further engage and contribute to the community’s needs, beyond that of a religious teacher? Will MUIS provide assistance and support so that the asatizah are better equipped to contribute in the fields mentioned earlier?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00102,2020-03-06-T-007,102,,"Mr Mohamed Irshad, take your two cuts together."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00103,2020-03-06-T-007,103,Mohamed Irshad,"Chairman, for the first cut, I wish to congratulate the Committee on Future Asatizah or COFA, led by Senior Minister of State Dr Maliki Osman, for completing its work. In the report submitted to the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, COFA proposed a bold vision accompanied by 10 key recommendations based on three key thrusts. What can the asatizah fraternity expect from the recommendations?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00104,2020-03-06-T-007,104,Mohamed Irshad,"The Singapore Muslim community is a highly diverse one that speaks a multitude of languages. In addition to a significant number of Indian Muslims who speak a myriad of languages, there is a growing resident community of Muslims who speak Tagalog, Mandarin and other north Asian languages. We also have a large population of Muslim foreign workers who speak Bangla, Urdu and other South Asian languages."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00105,2020-03-06-T-007,105,Mohamed Irshad,"Since 1998, when the first MUIS scholarship was awarded, we have groomed a generation of Malay asatizah who are highly educated and doing some amazing work on the ground. I would like to ask the Minister if there are similar plans to build upon this foundation to groom a generation of non-Malay asatizah who can guide the local non-Malay Muslim communities?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00106,2020-03-06-T-007,106,Mohamed Irshad,"For my second cut, Chairman, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus' statement ""Change is the only constant in life"" is applicable to all of us and all our situations without exception. For our respected asatizah fraternity, this statement is especially important as they have donned the robes of responsibility of guiding fellow Muslims in their faith."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00107,2020-03-06-T-007,107,Mohamed Irshad,"In order to be effective torchbearers and shepherds, our asatizah need to remain relevant by constantly updating themselves with knowledge, skill sets, contemporary issues, and even vocational skills."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00108,2020-03-06-T-007,108,Mohamed Irshad,"Sir, the recently submitted COFA report appears to have set a direction for tuture asatizah. I also note that the current generation of asatizah have the MUIS Academy which offers a range of courses and training as part of their lifelong learning ethos. There is also the SkillsFuture initiative for those asatizah who wish to acquire new skills."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00109,2020-03-06-T-007,109,Mohamed Irshad,"In order to benefit from these effectively, our asatizah need to be more aware of the competencies they ought to possess. This will then enable them to make informed choices about improving themselves. Can the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs share how MUIS will support the asatizah in this regard and the competencies they should acquire in order to stay relevant?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00110,2020-03-06-T-007,110,Zainal Sapari,"Chairman, in Malay, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00111,2020-03-06-T-007,111,Zainal Sapari,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Asatizah play an important role today in guiding the Singaporean Muslim community to help us thrive in a multi-religious and multi-cultural society, as well as globally, in addition to upholding our religious values."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00112,2020-03-06-T-007,112,Zainal Sapari,MUIS will also focus on efforts to enhance the professional development of our asatizah.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00113,2020-03-06-T-007,113,Zainal Sapari,"There are many ways for an ustaz or usatazah to contribute to society, but one of the common grouses amongst this group is that this sector appears to have limited employment opportunities."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00114,2020-03-06-T-007,114,Zainal Sapari,"What has MUIS done to ensure that the religious sector can become an attractive sector for employment, especially for the talented ones who can make good contributions?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00115,2020-03-06-T-007,115,Zainal Sapari,It was also reported that a revision will be made to asatizah's wages. What are the strategies that our community will support in order to ensure that our asatizah’s wages are aligned to market rates?
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00116,2020-03-06-T-007,116,,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap, you take your two cuts together."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00117,2020-03-06-T-007,117,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Chairman, Sir, in Malay."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00118,2020-03-06-T-007,118,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Sir, I would like to ask the Minister how many applications were received by the Syariah Court of Singapore for; firstly divorces, and second, obtaining counselling, between 2017 to 2019. And from these applications, how many applicants eventually divorced."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00119,2020-03-06-T-007,119,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Second, I hope that the Minister can also share three main reasons or factors that are the causes of divorce in the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore within the time period I mentioned earlier."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00120,2020-03-06-T-007,120,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, The Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM) launched the ""Bersamamu"" programme in May 2019. This programme aims to provide holistic support to Muslim couples before and after marriage."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00121,2020-03-06-T-007,121,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,I would like to seek an update on this programme from the Minister.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00122,2020-03-06-T-007,122,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I would like to get the following facts from the Minister. How many appeal cases does the MUIS Appeal Board receive annually in relation to the decisions of the Syariah Court of Singapore for divorce cases in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and what are the main reasons for these appeals?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00123,2020-03-06-T-007,123,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"From this number of appeal cases that were reported, how many cases were reported by the ex-husband and how many by the ex-wife?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00124,2020-03-06-T-007,124,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, in my four years as a counsellor handling counselling sessions for the Syariah Court's Marriage Counselling Programme (MCP), I received feedback from some husbands as well as ex-husbands who felt that the Syariah Court seem to place emphasis on the Women's Charter in their deliberation process when making a judgment. In fact, until today, I still receive similar feedback from time to time from some of my residents as well as the public."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00125,2020-03-06-T-007,125,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, may I seek the Minister’s view and clarifications on this issue?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00126,2020-03-06-T-007,126,,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat, take your two cuts, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00127,2020-03-06-T-007,127,Saktiandi Supaat,"Chairman, in Malay, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00128,2020-03-06-T-007,128,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Preschool education plays an important role in the early years for better development and learning in the later stages of life. In the last few years, there has been a growing emphasis on preschool education."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00129,2020-03-06-T-007,129,Saktiandi Supaat,The Early Childhood Development Agency has been pushing for more children to attend pre-school regularly so that they will not fall behind in their studies compared to their peers when they enter primary school. This is because the early years of childhood are important towards shaping social and communication skills as well as attitudes towards learning. It is a platform to give all children an equal start in life regardless of their backgrounds.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00130,2020-03-06-T-007,130,Saktiandi Supaat,How is MENDAKI supporting preschool learning for the Malay/Muslim community to ensure that our children have access to quality education and other learning opportunities?
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00131,2020-03-06-T-007,131,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] MENDAKI has been playing a crucial role in supporting career mobility among the Malay/Muslim community. Last year, MENDAKI held its first Raikan Ilmu (Celebrate Knowledge) campaign, which celebrates the diverse bodies of knowledge in our society. The campaign saw activities that encouraged both children and adults to explore knowledge in new areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics. I was very impressed by it and I hope to see further extensions of it soon. Such campaigns are important and engaging reminders to the community to be open to learning new skills, especially in today’s economy where the rapid pace of growth has disrupted traditional industries and business models."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00132,2020-03-06-T-007,132,Saktiandi Supaat,"Can Minister share how will MENDAKI continue to support and encourage the community to explore and gain competencies in new skills, so that they can remain relevant and have the confidence to seek employment in new industries?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00133,2020-03-06-T-007,133,Rahayu Mahzam,"Chairman, in Malay, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00134,2020-03-06-T-007,134,Rahayu Mahzam,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I had the opportunity to speak to several groups of asatizah at dialogue sessions organised by Berita Harian last year. In the discussions with them, one of the issues raised was the challenges faced by the asatizah when they perform their duties to educate and provide guidance to the community. Among other things, the asatizah shared that our community members approach them to ask about new issues that they face, and therefore, the asatizah must have knowledge and a fresh approach to manage such issues."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00135,2020-03-06-T-007,135,Rahayu Mahzam,"Our living environment has certainly changed. The Malay/Muslim community needs to adapt religion within a new context that is different from the context long ago. From the way we connect in the cyber world, to the way we do business, to our medical treatments; much has changed. For example, MUIS has produced a compilation of fatwas (Islamic legal ruling) on issues related to science, medicine and health. There have been many new scientific procedures and developments, and our community requires proper guidance. What is certain is that, with rapid global developments, there will always be new issues that our community must face."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00136,2020-03-06-T-007,136,Rahayu Mahzam,"Due to the ever changing needs of the community, our asatizah must also be equipped with the relevant knowledge to manage current issues. Our young asatizah must have a very strong foundation in Islamic education as well as other relevant fields such as science and technology. We must begin preparations as early as primary school. We must develop a younger generation that is well-versed and comfortable with current issues so that they are able to handle future challenges. They may also join other fields apart from Islamic education and therefore they should be prepared. Investment on our madrasah students’ development is highly important."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00137,2020-03-06-T-007,137,Rahayu Mahzam,I would therefore like to ask what are MUIS' plans to ensure that our madrasahs have the resources and capabilities to fulfil the developmental needs of students in current and new fields?
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00138,2020-03-06-T-007,138,Mohamed Irshad,"Chairman, as I previously mentioned in the House, the Singapore Muslim community is a highly diverse one. In addition to the racial diversity, we have Muslims from all around the world coming to study, work, marry and settle in Singapore. Like a garden of flowers, this diversity adds to the beauty and richness of the Singapore Muslim Community, in particular, the Singapore society at large."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00139,2020-03-06-T-007,139,Mohamed Irshad,"Sir, it is vital that these Muslim foreign workers, expatriates, migrants are able to intermingle seamlessly with the larger body of resident Muslims, so that they do not end up creating inward-looking enclaves."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00140,2020-03-06-T-007,140,Mohamed Irshad,"We have seen the introduction of Friday sermons being translated and at times being delivered in English and other languages. In addition to this. I would like to ask the Minister what efforts are being undertaken to reach out to these groups of Muslims, so that they are better integrated with fellow Muslims in Singapore and the wider Singaporean community, and that they are aligned with our Singapore Muslim identity and values."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00141,2020-03-06-T-007,141,Zainal Sapari,"Mr Chairman, in Malay, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00142,2020-03-06-T-007,142,Zainal Sapari,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The 4G leadership recently expressed the Government’s strong commitment to partner Singaporeans of all races, cultures and religions, and working together with them in nation-building."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00143,2020-03-06-T-007,143,Zainal Sapari,"For the Malay/Muslim community especially, what are the new methods of engagement in which the Government is prepared to partner the Malay/Muslim community to co-create and collaborate in co-solutioning for issues faced by our community?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00144,2020-03-06-T-007,144,Zainal Sapari,"Minister had also mentioned about M3 launching a new series of dialogues, Ciptasama, this year. Could the Minister elaborate on the aim of Ciptasama, and provide us with an update on the engagements with our community so far?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00145,2020-03-06-T-007,145,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"In Malay, please, Chairman."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00146,2020-03-06-T-007,146,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In recent years, there have been many changes to the education system and landscape in Singapore. Some of the changes include an increased number of places for Direct School Admission (DSA), Subject-Based Banding (SBB) in lieu of streaming, the removal of mid-year and year-end examinations for Primary 1 and 2 students, changes to the Primary School Leaving Examinations grade banding, and work readiness initiatives in post-secondary institutions."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00147,2020-03-06-T-007,147,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"Prior to this, most of MENDAKI's programmes and initiatives often focus on academic excellence and this has resulted in an increase in post-secondary passes, scholarship holders and white collar workers in our community. Now, with a shift towards providing education with multiple pathways to success that is not solely based on academic excellence, as well as collaborations with the industries to ensure work readiness and lifelong learning, MENDAKI's programmes, initiatives and approach must also transform so as to remain relevant."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00148,2020-03-06-T-007,148,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"In light of these changes to our education system and landscape as well as schools, what are MENDAKI's plans and progress in reviewing its education programs so as to be in line with these changes that were made to our education system and schools, to ensure that relevant and useful support is given to our community?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00149,2020-03-06-T-007,149,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"I would also like to ask the Minister for an update on whether MENDAKI has plans to venture into the pre-school sector as well, and whether Mendaki will implement initiatives or programs for this sector, in light of the rapid changes to the pre-school sector in recent years."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00150,2020-03-06-T-007,150,,Minister Masagos.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00151,2020-03-06-T-007,151,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Chairman, last year, during my Hari Raya speech, I said that our Malay/Muslim community is a Community of Success, or in Malay, Masyarakat Gemilang."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00152,2020-03-06-T-007,152,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"While we are part of the Malay diaspora in the region, there are three things that make our community unique – character, competence and citizenry, or what I call the 3Cs. The first ""C"", character, is about the outlook of the community and the values that it cherishes. The second ""C"", competence, is self-explanatory. We cannot be successful if we are liabilities. The third and final ""C"" is citizenry, a sense of responsibility towards nation-building and society. We cannot be satisfied merely with being equal in rights, we must also be equal in substance as citizens. Singapore is our home and we have a duty to it."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00153,2020-03-06-T-007,153,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Chairman, in the midst of our fight against COVID-19, I want to start by talking about citizenry. In a number of dialogues with the community, we received feedback that the community is happy with the support that the Government is extending to citizens in response to COVID-19. I am happier to see that the community is contributing where it can in the fight against the virus, not just happily receiving help."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00154,2020-03-06-T-007,154,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For example, Masjid Assyakirin teamed up with Bo Tien Temple, representatives of the Baha'i faith, the Calvary Bible-Presbyterian Church and Jurong Christian Church to prepare lunch boxes and notes of appreciation for healthcare workers in Jurong Polyclinic. In support of their initiative, Al Ayza Restaurant sponsored half the food and helped with delivery. Other Muslim-owned restaurants, such as Kinamaya, Rumah Makan Minang, Hajjah Maimunah Restaurant and Positano Risto, also stepped up. They teamed up with the riders of Dadah Itu Haram, who delivered the food to frontline healthcare workers in Singapore General Hospital."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00155,2020-03-06-T-007,155,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the past week, MUIS raised money in the mosques to contribute to the Courage Fund. Mendaki, too, organised a walk to raise funds. MESRA Youths made and distributed 1,000 ribbon flowers to our frontliners to tell them – we remember you."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00156,2020-03-06-T-007,156,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Many Malay/Muslims have been at the frontline in the healthcare sector, home team and even the passenger transport sector. I am proud they are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow Singaporeans in this fight. During this crisis, we see that citizenry is genuinely demonstrated."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00157,2020-03-06-T-007,157,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Standing bravely at the frontline and stepping forward to help, exemplify character, the second ""C"" and one of the three qualities that our community wants to be known for. As Muslims, character is closely intertwined with our religion, culture and therefore our identity. There are many minority Muslim communities around the world that struggle with the practice of Islam in secular jurisdictions, multicultural societies and against contemporary challenges. In Singapore, we are fortunate to have a strong fraternity of asatizah, who are also fellow Singaporeans and their guidance has made all the difference for our community."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00158,2020-03-06-T-007,158,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our asatizah bear significant responsibility in guiding the community on how to thrive in our multicultural society, live in harmony with others and navigate contemporary and future challenges. This is why we formed the Committee on Future Asatizah (COFA) last year, to better understand what our community would like to see in our asatizah, and in turn, how we can better support the asatizah fraternity."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00159,2020-03-06-T-007,159,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"After extensive engagements, COFA found that the community would like to our asatizah to guide them on issues of the modern world and to see them connecting with other communities to build a cohesive society and contribute to Singapore. My colleague, Senior Minister of State Maliki, will elaborate further on what we intend to do with COFA's recommendations."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00160,2020-03-06-T-007,160,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I agree with Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin Amin, who spoke about the importance of being able to address Muslims who live in our multicultural society. And as Mr Irshad said, there is diversity not just in our society, but also within our community. We can look into grooming more religious leaders who can engage in various languages."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00161,2020-03-06-T-007,161,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MUIS will also work with our asatizah to develop a body of knowledge and practice to guide Muslim life in multicultural societies. Singapore is not alone in this challenge. There are other minority Muslim communities around the world that share our belief that Muslims can thrive in plural societies. We want to learn from these communities, we want to learn from each other and this is why MUIS will organise an International Conference on Communities of Success later this year."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00162,2020-03-06-T-007,162,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We must also re-think the role of asatizah. Over the past two years, the work of M3 has shown us that asatizah are well-placed to provide spiritual guidance and support in various facets of Muslim life, beyond the mosque and the madrasah. They can provide pastoral care to the incarcerated, the sick and the aged. They can be spiritual guides to couples, whether they are trying to build a new family or overcoming trials and tribulations to preserve the home."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00163,2020-03-06-T-007,163,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Faisal Manap asked how the Syariah Court has handled the divorce cases that has come before it. In my view, the more pertinent issue is to work with the community upstream in strengthening families and preventing divorces. Through M3 flagship programmes like Bersamamu and FITRAH, our asatizah volunteers have helped close to 3,000 soon-to-wed couples as well as 40 families where at least one parent is incarcerated."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00164,2020-03-06-T-007,164,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"There are many ways an ustaz or ustazah can contribute. The Muslim community needs religious curriculum developers for our madrasahs, specialists to administer religious programmes in MUIS, ROMM and our mosques and jurists to support our Syariah Court and Fatwa Committee. These institutions need able asatizah."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00165,2020-03-06-T-007,165,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Importantly, we need asatizah who do not shy away from grappling with contemporary issues. As a Muslim Singaporean, I feel proud that our asatizah have risen to the occasion. For example, when NEWater was introduced, our asatizah sought to understand the water technology used and were quick to recognise that the end-product was clean and that means, also Halal."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00166,2020-03-06-T-007,166,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Such clear-minded, progressive thinking is even more important in exceptional times, like now. To minimise the risk of transmitting COVID-19, our asatizah gave guidance on bringing our own mats when we pray in the mosque and refraining from shaking hands for now. Singapore is probably the only place in the world where Muslim religious leaders give practical, medically-sound advice with such speed."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00167,2020-03-06-T-007,167,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"If we can train and enable more asatizah to support our community in these ways, our community will be better for it. The job of an ustaz is not easy. To perform his job well, an ustaz must not only be well-versed in Islamic knowledge, but also be au fait with psychology, sociology, social work, comparative law, science and technology and more."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00168,2020-03-06-T-007,168,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As several of our Members of Parliaments pointed out, we must support our asatizah in this journey. We are therefore making an investment not only in asatizah training but also to transform the formal religious sector. To facilitate this transformation, MUIS has developed the Asatizah Workforce Development Plan (AWDP), on which Senior Minister of State Maliki will elaborate later."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00169,2020-03-06-T-007,169,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Chairman, how effective our asatizah are in nurturing the character of our community therefore hinges on their competence. But for our community to succeed, we must also encourage every Muslim to aspire towards excellence and contribute to the community and Singapore. Inasmuch as the camaraderie amongst our healthcare workers and home-team members matters, it is also their competence that earned them the trust of Singaporeans in the fight against COVID-19."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00170,2020-03-06-T-007,170,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As a community, we have come a long way. In 1980, only 16% of Malay/Muslim students achieved five GCE ""O"" level passes. We marshalled community resources to form MENDAKI, which then worked with MOE as a partner to develop a support system for Malay/Muslim students. By the end of the decade, we doubled the proportion of Malay/Muslim students who achieved five GCE ""O"" Level Passes. Today, this proportion is four times that in 1980. Last year, our students outperformed their OECD peers in Mathematics and have made substantial improvements in reading."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00171,2020-03-06-T-007,171,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Today, nine in 10 of Malay/Muslim students in a P1 cohort make it to University, Polytechnic, ITE or other post-Secondary education institutes. As we move forward, we must try to make sure that all our students are able to acquire at least a Nitec – this is the ""red-line"" that MENDAKI must ensure no one falls below. Concurrently, we must grow the numbers of our youth who can graduate with a University degree. During my Hari Raya speech, I called this our ""blue line"" and MENDAKI must help as many as possible across it."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00172,2020-03-06-T-007,172,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The truth is, addressing dropouts and failure rates are already problems of yesterday. We need to prepare our young for a tomorrow that will be challenging and volatile. In today's economy, ITE, Polytechnic and University qualifications are merely hygiene factors. MENDAKI's efforts are only as good as it keeps pace with the changing educational, social and economic landscape."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00173,2020-03-06-T-007,173,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thus, we have started a comprehensive review of MENDAKI's policies and programmes, to ensure that MENDAKI can be an effective partner to MOE and our educational institutes. Beyond that, there must be an equal emphasis on lifelong learning in our community, much like in the past, when we emphasised the importance of educating our children well."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00174,2020-03-06-T-007,174,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We cannot just be focused on tax-rebate vouchers to manage today's cost of living. Our community must also take advantage of other forms of support like the SkillsFuture Credit, to acquire new competencies and qualifications for better-paying jobs, especially when their current skills run the risk of being irrelevant in the near future."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00175,2020-03-06-T-007,175,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The same applies to Malay/Muslim SMEs and funding support for digitalisation and venturing overseas for them to grow. Minister of State Zaqy will speak on the shifts MENDAKI will be making and how we are encouraging lifelong learning. Mr Chairman, allow me to conclude in Malay."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00176,2020-03-06-T-007,176,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Our community can do more to contribute in various areas and sectors. Many initiatives have been rolled out by our volunteers at M³@Towns with the close cooperation of MUIS, MENDAKI and MESRA. In line with this measure, a series of conversations called CiptaSama@M³, was formed to hear the views of the Malay/Muslim community on national issues that are of greatest concern to them and to co-create solutions that can be implemented so that we can prosper together as a nation. We have started the conversation with the leaders and volunteers of the M³@Towns and we look forward to engaging members of the community from all walks of lives in the coming months."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00177,2020-03-06-T-007,177,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In building a Community of Success, we must continue to uphold the three key values of the community – Character, Competence and Citizenry. As our asatizah shape the community’s character and identity, we must be committed in our investment to enhance our asatizah’s competencies."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00178,2020-03-06-T-007,178,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will also invest in the future of our children and youth by providing educational support to develop a future generation that is competent and capable in contributing back to society. And we are determined to work together with the Malay/Muslim community, not just to build a Community of Success, but also to build a prosperous future together for Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00179,2020-03-06-T-007,179,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Chairman, our asatizah anchor our community to values and traditions in a rapidly evolving world. Increasingly, they are expected to dispense religious guidance on matters not limited to faith and rituals, but also on finance and estate matters, science, medicine and family."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00180,2020-03-06-T-007,180,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Socio-religious issues are becoming more complex. Bio-scientific developments pose new ethical questions. Demographic shifts, such as an ageing population, evolving concepts of gender roles and challenges brought forth with the Internet of Things, require clearer religious guidance."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00181,2020-03-06-T-007,181,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"In March 2019, we formed the Committee on Future Asatizah (COFA) and I led the engagements on the vision for future asatizah. COFA members included representatives from the asatizah fraternity, Malay/Muslim community leaders, professionals and academics from different fields. The diversity reflects the expanded role expected of future asatizah. We held 16 engagements sessions over nine months, involving over 1,900 stakeholders. These engagement platforms include focus group discussions, round tables, online surveys, street surveys and interviews. COFA concluded its deliberations with the following vision for future asatizah"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00182,2020-03-06-T-007,182,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(a) As religious leaders in a multi-cultural and diverse society, our asatizah must proactively engage on issues of the modern world and connect with other communities to build a cohesive Singapore society."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00183,2020-03-06-T-007,183,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(b) As professionals, our asatizah are advocates of lifelong learning, acquiring new knowledge and skills in guiding Singapore Muslims to respond to contemporary challenges."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00184,2020-03-06-T-007,184,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(c) As role models, our asatizah are rooted to Islamic traditions, resilient, adaptable, compassionate, driven and committed to the betterment of Singapore society."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00185,2020-03-06-T-007,185,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"COFA proposed to realise the vision through three strategic thrusts  first, we will professionalise the asatizah sector; second, we will strengthen key religious institutions; and third, we will do more to nurture inspiring asatizah."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00186,2020-03-06-T-007,186,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"First, on professionalising the asatizah sector. Today, a significant proportion of jobs in the religious sector are unstructured and, as Mr Zainal Sapari highlighted, this results in limited opportunities to progress. To transform and professionalise the sector, I am glad to share that MUIS is developing an Asatizah Workforce Development Plan (AWDP) to enhance the attractiveness of the religious sector and the skills and competencies of our asatizah."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00187,2020-03-06-T-007,187,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"This year, asatizah can look forward to the first initiative under AWDP, which is the Career and Competency Framework (CCF). This framework articulates the different roles and pathways within the formal religious sector and provides information on the respective skillsets needed. With this framework, asatizah can better plan their careers and proactively learn about skills and competencies required for the various career pathways."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00188,2020-03-06-T-007,188,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"In the next three years, MUIS will develop more initiatives under the AWDP. This includes salary guidelines, a religious talent programme to identify and develop future religious leaders and more opportunities for skills upgrading. The religious talent programme, like the Muis scholarship that Mr Irshad mentioned, will be open to deserving applicants on the basis of merit, regardless of race."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00189,2020-03-06-T-007,189,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"For asatizah who are interested to upgrade themselves on emerging issues, Muis will organise relevant courses on digitalisation and the use of social media. Lifelong learning is crucial and critical for all Singaporeans who want to stay relevant, and our asatizah are no exception. The top-up to their Skills Future Credit announced in Budget 2020 will be an additional boost for them to explore new frontiers of skills and opportunities."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00190,2020-03-06-T-007,190,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The second strategic thrust is strengthening institutions. As we nurture a stronger, more adaptable asatizah workforce, it is also important to strengthen religious institutions. I agree with Mdm Rahayu Mahzam that madrasahs play an important role in developing future asatizah. MUIS has been working closely with our madrasahs to support the development of teachers, improve programmes and curriculum and enhance the facilities of madrasahs. For example, Madrasah Al-Arabiah has a new campus. The campus is equipped with better lab facilities and resources for students, so that our young asatizah can build a strong foundation in both religious and secular subjects."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00191,2020-03-06-T-007,191,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM) and Syariah Court also play key roles in the lives of Singaporean Muslims. While overseeing the registration and solemnisation of marriage and managing divorces will remain their core roles, these institutions can play a bigger part in shaping community life. For example, to further enhance Bersamamu, ROMM has been working closely with MSF to train Kadis and Naib Kadis to better engage and support soon-to-wed couples. Thus far, Bersamamu has benefited close to 3,000 couples since its launch in July 2019."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00192,2020-03-06-T-007,192,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The third strategic thrust is to nurture inspiring asatizah. COFA saw potential for asatizah to contribute to adjacent sectors, such as social work, and to provide Singaporean Muslims with advice on how to navigate contemporary developments in the use of technology and finance. To help our asatizah step up to this role, the Postgraduate Certificate in Islam in Contemporary Societies (PCICS) will also expose them to social sciences, develop counselling, social work and other vocational skills to prepare them for an exciting and promising future. In addition to partnerships with renowned Islamic institutions like Al-Azhar University and the University of Jordan and our local publicly-funded Universities like NUS and SUSS, PCICS will include a practicum component to equip students with on-the-job training, exposure and experiential learning for their future roles in the workforce."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00193,2020-03-06-T-007,193,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Chairman, allow me to continue in Malay, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00194,2020-03-06-T-007,194,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Our asatizah shape the character of our community. This is an important responsibility. The role of an asatizah has evolved from only functioning as religious teachers to religious leaders who contribute their expertise in the religious and non-religious sectors. Our long-term vision is to develop our future cohorts of asatizah as religious thought leaders who are highly regarded locally and internationally.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00195,2020-03-06-T-007,195,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"(In English)  Mr Chairman, our young asatizah can be great assets to the community, beyond the mosque and the madrasah. We must continue to invest in their development. In turn, I hope that our young aspiring asatizah will rise to the occasion, be the confident guides that the community needs to navigate future challenges and contribute to the vision of a Muslim community of success and help us build a strong and cohesive Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00196,2020-03-06-T-007,196,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Chairman, let me touch on our efforts to strengthen our community’s competencies through MENDAKI. There are three drivers in today’s education landscape to provide the impetus for transforming MENDAKI."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00197,2020-03-06-T-007,197,Zaqy Mohamad,"First, good pre-school education is critical to the development of our children. Every child should have access to this, regardless of background."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00198,2020-03-06-T-007,198,Zaqy Mohamad,"Second, as Dr Intan Mokhtar has highlighted, our education approach in schools is changing and MOE is catering for greater flexibility in education for students with different abilities and interests."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00199,2020-03-06-T-007,199,Zaqy Mohamad,"Third, in a fast-changing world, lifelong learning is a must."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00200,2020-03-06-T-007,200,Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, in response to these changes, MENDAKI will enhance its mission to provide end-to-end educational support for our Malay/Muslim community. As Minister Masagos has mentioned, the community has shown significant progress in school dropout and failure rates. We can now focus on new challenges to take the community forward."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00201,2020-03-06-T-007,201,Zaqy Mohamad,Completing school today is not enough. We want our children to succeed in school and be equipped to achieve successful careers.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00202,2020-03-06-T-007,202,Zaqy Mohamad,"Dr Intan and Mr Saktiandi asked about our plans to support the pre-school sector. For our young children, we want to equip them with a strong foundation so that they can achieve in life. While initiatives, such as the Preschool Outreach Programme, have paid off, there are vulnerable families in our community who need extra support. Thus, MENDAKI and MUIS have set up the MENDAKI MUIS Preschool Grant (MMPG) which builds on existing Government initiatives to provide additional financial support for our low-income parents."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00203,2020-03-06-T-007,203,Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, with MMPG established in January this year, beneficiaries can see a quadrupling of their CDA savings. For example, if you put just $1 a day in your child’s CDA account, you will have $30 in a month. MMPG will double that amount to $60 and the Government’s CDA co-matching initiative will double the $60 to $120 a month. The money can then be used to pay for your child’s education and medical needs. So, contribute $1 and you get another $3 to support your child."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00204,2020-03-06-T-007,204,Zaqy Mohamad,"On the academic front, MENDAKI also started moving to pre-school last year with KelasMateMatika(KMM)@CC with the support of our M3 partners for Malay pre-schoolers. This programme reinforces basic numeracy skills and help parents to be more involved in their children’s development. Last year, more than 1,200 children and parents benefited from KMM."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00205,2020-03-06-T-007,205,Zaqy Mohamad,Over 90% of parents who attended KMM said that they now recognise the importance of pre-school education and are confident on how to develop their children’s numeracy skills. MENDAKI is planning to scale up KMM to benefit more families this year.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00206,2020-03-06-T-007,206,Zaqy Mohamad,"As our children progress into schools, MENDAKI Tuition Scheme (MTS) and MOE's UPLIFT programme step in to help those who need extra coaching and motivation to attend school more regularly. This year, so far, more than 7,500 students have enrolled in our 85 MTS centres. By next year, we intend to introduce 15 more centres to make it 100."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00207,2020-03-06-T-007,207,Zaqy Mohamad,"The academic performance of our MTS students has been encouraging. In 2018, 60% of MTS students who took Standard Mathematics achieved at least one grade performance in their PSLE result, compared to their year-end result the previous year."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00208,2020-03-06-T-007,208,Zaqy Mohamad,"However, like Dr Intan said, we recognise the need to improve MTS, given our evolving education landscape. This is why MENDAKI will review the MTS in five areas  (a) governance and leadership; (b) curriculum; (c) pedagogy; (d) professional development of our tutors; as well as (e) outreach."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00209,2020-03-06-T-007,209,Zaqy Mohamad,"Beyond educational support, I agree with Mr Amrin Amin that it is also important to provide emotional support and career guidance for our youths. With the support of other M3 agencies, MENDAKI has set up a Youth Mentoring Office (YMO) to grow a culture of mentoring in the community. We now have over 700 volunteer mentors and 200 of them are already on the ground to support our work with the community."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00210,2020-03-06-T-007,210,Zaqy Mohamad,"A key aspect of the Budget this year was about supporting Singaporeans in lifelong learning. The ability to upskill, adapt to industry shifts and be ready for new opportunities is key to staying relevant. Mr Saktiandi asked how MENDAKI will be supporting the community in this area."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00211,2020-03-06-T-007,211,Zaqy Mohamad,"We want to encourage our adults to take up various initiatives to support their learning, such as the SkillsFuture Credit top-up announced in Budget 2020. This is especially useful for our mature workers who are looking to improve their career prospects."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00212,2020-03-06-T-007,212,Zaqy Mohamad,"MENDAKI SENSE will continue to guide jobseekers and workers on how to make full use of these opportunities provided by the Government so that they can access desired jobs. MENDAKI SENSE has also helped over 2,000 Malay jobseekers who come to its doors to find employment through their programmes in the last five years and we will continue to strengthen its efforts."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00213,2020-03-06-T-007,213,Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, this year, Bulan Raikan Ilmu will continue to champion Lifelong Learning. Our first Raikan Ilmu month reached out to about 30,000 participants and we hope to further our outreach to 40,000 this year."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00214,2020-03-06-T-007,214,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Chairman, allow me to conclude in Malay."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00215,2020-03-06-T-007,215,Zaqy Mohamad,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] We are committed to providing end-to-end support, at every stage of life, for our community. MENDAKI is enhancing their initiatives in response to the changing education and employment landscape."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00216,2020-03-06-T-007,216,Zaqy Mohamad,"This starts from efforts that encourage the learning and development of young children, to supporting the aspirations of youths, and building a culture of lifelong learning for adults. In turn, we hope that the community recognises the importance of enhancing our educational standards and embracing the spirit of lifelong learning."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00217,2020-03-06-T-007,217,Zaqy Mohamad,"Come, let us double our efforts to become a highly competent community and continue to contribute to the success of Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00218,2020-03-06-T-007,218,,"Clarifications, if any. Mr Saktiandi Supaat."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00219,2020-03-06-T-007,219,Saktiandi Supaat,"Chairman, I have two clarifications. Can I ask the questions in Malay?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00220,2020-03-06-T-007,220,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I would like to ask the Minister or Minister of State whether they can provide more information about the MUIS-MENDAKI Preschool Grant (MMPG). I welcome the support that will be given to Singaporeans. How will it benefit low-income Malay/Muslims families? More importantly, how can they apply for the grant? Can details be given, if available?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00221,2020-03-06-T-007,221,Saktiandi Supaat,"Second, what will the Youth Mentoring Office (YMO), that Minister of State mentioned earlier, do for Malay/Muslim youths in Singapore?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00222,2020-03-06-T-007,222,Zaqy Mohamad,(
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00223,2020-03-06-T-007,223,Zaqy Mohamad,"As for the second question – YMO was set up by MENDAKI, with the support of M3, to grow a strong culture of mentoring within our community. Its objective is to provide career guidance which is a key aspect of this mentoring project. It provides useful guidance for our youths especially those who want to pursue a career in new areas like AI, cybersecurity and others. Although there are good career prospects in these areas, they may not know any role models who can help them to explore these pathways. So, we hope that, with this Youth Mentoring Office programme, we can help them to find jobs and careers in new areas."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00224,2020-03-06-T-007,224,,Dr Intan.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00225,2020-03-06-T-007,225,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"Chairman, in Malay, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00226,2020-03-06-T-007,226,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Minister or Minister of State Zaqy, what are the plans for MENDAKI's Tuition Scheme to ensure that our children are ready for a more dynamic environment and also to seize opportunities to excel in various areas apart from academic excellence?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00227,2020-03-06-T-007,227,Zaqy Mohamad,(
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00228,2020-03-06-T-007,228,Zaqy Mohamad,"Second, we will also update the MTS curriculum and introduce the Science subject to Primary 3 students instead of Primary 4 currently."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00229,2020-03-06-T-007,229,Zaqy Mohamad,"Third, MENDAKI will also make pedagogical changes to further improve our children’s experience at the MTS."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00230,2020-03-06-T-007,230,Zaqy Mohamad,"For Primary 1 to 3 students, MENDAKI will explore various learning techniques, including experiential learning or modular learning outside the classroom. Hence, learning should not only be conducted in the classroom but also outside the classroom. This will transform our children’s learning experience."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00231,2020-03-06-T-007,231,Zaqy Mohamad,"For Secondary school students, MENDAKI will introduce Subject-Based Banding. Therefore, we will be aligned with MOE by transforming the way we provide support, which will be tailored to our children's abilities."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00232,2020-03-06-T-007,232,Zaqy Mohamad,"To help students who require more guidance, MENDAKI will upgrade its intensive guidance programmes that it piloted last year. The results of this pilot programme has been encouraging so far. MENDAKI will also look into the professional development of its 830 MTS tutors and also explore ways to empower parents so that they can be more involved in giving motivation and support to their children."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00233,2020-03-06-T-007,233,Zaqy Mohamad,"Lastly, MTS will further enhance its outreach strategy to engage students who need more support and this includes strengthening MENDAKI's involvement in schools with a percentage of Malay/Muslim students who are not performing."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00234,2020-03-06-T-007,234,Zaqy Mohamad,"MENDAKI will collaborate with MOE in the UPLIFT programme so that more of our students who need academic support will receive a more comprehensive assistance. By 2021, MENDAKI hopes to work with 15 more schools so that we can increase the number of MTS centres to 100."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00235,2020-03-06-T-007,235,,Mr Zainal Sapari.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00236,2020-03-06-T-007,236,Zainal Sapari,"Chairman, in Malay."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00237,2020-03-06-T-007,237,Zainal Sapari,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] So far, there has been no cases of COVID-19 that came from the mosques in Singapore, even though many Muslims of different nationalities visit the mosque daily to perform congregational prayers. Can the Minister share what steps have been taken by MUIS and the mosques to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection among mosque congregants so that everyone can pray safely and peacefully?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00238,2020-03-06-T-007,238,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Chairman, in Malay."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00239,2020-03-06-T-007,239,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Thank you, Mr Zainal, for the question on COVID-19, especially in relation to our community. Obviously, when we congregate, for example, in mosques or during festivities, infections can occur. At the mosques, for instance, we will shake hands with each other. Sometimes, we hug each other. In the past, our ladies used the praying veils provided by the mosques. Or our foreheads will touch the mosque’s carpeted floor during prayers."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00240,2020-03-06-T-007,240,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MUIS and the Mufti have given guidance so that we can momentarily change our normal practice. For instance, please bring our own prayer mats to use during prayers because COVID-19 can be spread when someone coughs on the same carpeted floor that come into contact with our foreheads during prayers."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00241,2020-03-06-T-007,241,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We can also cut down on handshakes. If we want to shake hands, make sure that we have washed our hands first with soap, and after shaking hands, wash them again. But I think if we are often seen washing our hands every time we shake hands, we will perhaps be seen as being disrespectful. So, my suggestion is to greet each other this way (Minister places his hand on his chest) while we deal with this COVID-19 situation."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00242,2020-03-06-T-007,242,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But in time to come, as I said earlier, we must also further improve our level of hygiene, personally and for the individual, so that we take care of our health as well as our loved ones’ health. This is how we manage the COVID-19 issue for the long-term."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00243,2020-03-06-T-007,243,,Any more clarifications? Next cut. Mr Darryl David.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00244,2020-03-06-T-007,244,Darryl David,"Mr Chairman, I have three cuts, may I take them together?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00245,2020-03-06-T-007,245,,"Yes, please. Take your three cuts together."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00246,2020-03-06-T-007,246,Darryl David,"Mr Chairman, our children are our country's future. The environment that our children are living in and growing up with is very different from ours, as will be case from generation to generation."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00247,2020-03-06-T-007,247,Darryl David,"But the world today is economically more uncertain and is more polarised and fragmented with opposing camps holding deep, uncompromising views. Disruptions, dis-intermediation and shifting of economic powers globally have threatened the existing world order and has triggered the competition for hegemony among global nations."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00248,2020-03-06-T-007,248,Darryl David,"Our children and youth have a stake in Singapore's future as influencers for change. As the Government, we must ensure that we provide opportunities for our children and youth to grow and develop holistically. How is MCCY supporting equal opportunities and holistic development for our children and youths?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00249,2020-03-06-T-007,249,Darryl David,"Arts and sports, for instance, are crucial ways to nurture the young. And studies have shown that participation in arts and sports can bring about positive cognitive, behavioural and social outcomes. How will MCCY ensure that all children and youth, regardless of their background and ability, have access to arts and sports opportunities?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00250,2020-03-06-T-007,250,Darryl David,"As our youths enter the workforce, we must also ensure that they are equipped with the skills and knowledge to thrive, especially when the future of work has yet to be defined. How can MCCY work with the other relevant Ministries to ensure that we prepare our youth adequately for future workforce challenges?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00251,2020-03-06-T-007,251,Darryl David,"Second cut, please. In 2015, the Singapore Botanic Gardens was successfully inscribed as Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site and in 2019, we submitted the nomination documents to have ""Hawker Culture in Singapore  Community Dining and Culinary Practices in a Multicultural Urban Context"" on the UNESCO's Representative List."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00252,2020-03-06-T-007,252,Darryl David,"Mr Chairman, culture is a way of life. It is the social glue that binds different communities together. It creates shared beliefs among people and a common identity that helps define the character of the nation. And in many ways, the Botanic Gardens and our hawker food are part of our cultural and national identity. We grew up with hawker food and everyone has our own favourite hawker stalls and, of course, we would always remember strolling through the Botanic Gardens with our loved ones. Some of us here in the House might even remember strolling through the Botanic Gardens and then going to the hawker centre across the road for some excellent murtabak, dessert and drinks."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00253,2020-03-06-T-007,253,Darryl David,"Yet, culture is not only defined by UNESCO titles, neither can culture be created by attaching labels to empty physical spaces. Culture exists only when people attach special meaning and importance to places or to practices, and only when places and practices hold personal memories to people. So, the places where we live, work and play hold many memories about our traditions and way of life, which make us uniquely Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00254,2020-03-06-T-007,254,Darryl David,"Mr Chairman, Singapore's cultural heritage belongs to us all. Singapore is a multi-ethnic and multi-racial society. The different communities living and working in Singapore are all part of our cultural fabric and the different communities need to define for themselves what is culturally important to them, while also celebrating the aspects of other communities. That is what makes Singapore special. As the Government, we need to empower our community stakeholders to celebrate their heritage, promote their heritage in everyday spaces, and more importantly, facilitate its transmission to the next generation."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00255,2020-03-06-T-007,255,Darryl David,"Can MCCY share how it intends to continue to engage the community to sustain interest in, and deepen appreciation for Singapore's cultural heritage?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00256,2020-03-06-T-007,256,Darryl David,"My final cut, Mr Chairman. The 2019 SEA Games was a mixed-bag of results for Team Singapore. While we had a number of hits, such as winning our first-ever gold in softball and making a clean gold medal sweep in underwater hockey, we also had a number of misses. For the first time in 50 years, we did not win a gold for water-polo and did not do as well as we thought we would in women's table tennis doubles."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00257,2020-03-06-T-007,257,Darryl David,"With less than five months to go before the Tokyo Olympics, can MCCY provide an update on how Team Singapore athletes, especially the up and coming ones, are faring regionally and internationally?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00258,2020-03-06-T-007,258,Darryl David,"Mr Chairman, the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 and the high rates of infection in Japan have also thrown a bit of a spanner in the works. There is the possibility of COVID-19 being declared as a global pandemic and there is thus the possibility of the Tokyo Olympics being significantly affected by this as well."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00259,2020-03-06-T-007,259,Darryl David,How is MCCY supporting Team Singapore's preparation in the lead up to the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics? And how does MCCY plan to support Team Singapore athletes if they were to compete in a host-country where the rate of COVID-19 infection is high?
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00260,2020-03-06-T-007,260,Alex Yam,"Last year, the Ministry and the National Youth Council (NYC) launched the SG Youth Action Plan, an ambitious effort to envision the future of Singapore in 2025 and provide a platform for Singapore's youths to shape their vision for the country, develop plans for youth, community organisations, businesses and the Government to realise this vision together."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00261,2020-03-06-T-007,261,Alex Yam,"With the kick-off in May 2019, can the Ministry provide a progress update on the discussions so far? What are the aspirations and ideas from our youth, resulting from this engagement and what can youths look forward to in 2020 and beyond?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00262,2020-03-06-T-007,262,Alex Yam,The transformation of the Somerset Belt designated as an area with a strong youth focus as part of the longer term plans for Orchard Road is also a key project under the SG Youth Action Plan. What has been the progress of discussions and how will the slowdown in the economy impact its development?
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00263,2020-03-06-T-007,263,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Chairman, at Budget 2016, the Government introduced Our Singapore Fund to encourage and support active citizens that are taking the initiative to solve ground problems, strengthen community spirit and contribute to nation-building."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00264,2020-03-06-T-007,264,Saktiandi Supaat,"It is gratifying to note that in the recent years, more Singaporeans, particularly youths, have been coming together to form ground-up initiatives ranging from upcycling to urban farming to evolving traditional arts and so on."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00265,2020-03-06-T-007,265,Saktiandi Supaat,"What is the status of the Fund? How many benefited from it? Will MCCY continue to support these ground-up initiatives through Our Singapore Fund? Besides enabling ground-up initiatives, how is MCCY supporting the Government’s efforts to partner Singaporeans in shaping our future Singapore together?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00266,2020-03-06-T-007,266,Saktiandi Supaat,"Volunteers play an important role alongside social service professionals to shore up the social safety networks and reduce the number of cases of people falling through the cracks. But, of course, volunteer work can be a lot more than helping the needy. Volunteers are also needed to run community gardens, do befriending, look out for the interests of the environment and wildlife, and so on. In short, they are crucial towards building up the resilience of a nation through encouraging cohesion and compassion."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00267,2020-03-06-T-007,267,Saktiandi Supaat,"During COVID-19, we saw how volunteers are playing crucial roles in facilitating mask distribution efforts, including that in Toa Payoh, and ensuring attendees of community events partake in hygiene measures as well."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00268,2020-03-06-T-007,268,Saktiandi Supaat,"Last year, MCCY rolled out SG Cares Volunteer Centres in seven towns to grow and coordinate volunteer supply, facilitate partnerships between community partners and build capabilities in these towns. Can the Ministry provide an update on these Volunteer Centres, and whether there are plans to roll out more Centres to more towns?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00269,2020-03-06-T-007,269,,"Mr Henry Kwek, take your two cuts, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00270,2020-03-06-T-007,270,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Sir, my first cut. Singapore’s caring and kindness, along with progress in our society’s civic, culture, and sports arena, are fuelled by the passion of our country’s volunteers. MCCY has done an excellent job to identify, nurture, and empower them. We need to look no further than Team Nile, our Museum Volunteers. MCCY also rolled out an excellent cloud-base volunteer portal, Volunteer.sg, that is a game-changer on how VWOs engage volunteers. I am deeply appreciative that MCCY has included Kebun Baru as a pilot within PA."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00271,2020-03-06-T-007,271,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Last year, MCCY rolled out Volunteer Centres in seven towns to grow and coordinate volunteer supply, facilitate partnerships between community partners and build capabilities in these towns. Can the Ministry provide an update on these Volunteer Centres, and whether there are plans to roll out the Centres to more towns?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00272,2020-03-06-T-007,272,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"My second cut. Most arts and culture institutions rely on a combination of ticket sales, grants, donations and endowment income. For those with NAC grants, the Government usually ties the grants to public attendances and projects that benefit Singapore, and rightfully so."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00273,2020-03-06-T-007,273,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"In view of the current circumstances regarding COVID-19, donations from some parts of the business community may be down and there can be reduced demand for large scale public performances."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00274,2020-03-06-T-007,274,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Some institutions without deep reserves or large endowment could face significant challenges.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00275,2020-03-06-T-007,275,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Can MCCY share how MCCY and NAC can better support these institutions in this difficult times? For example, can NAC provide additional support or convert existing grant by getting these institutions to invest in capability development, so that they can emerge stronger from the crisis?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00276,2020-03-06-T-007,276,Anthea Ong,"Sir, I declare my interest as founder of A Good Space, a community of citizen change makers and Hush, a social enterprise. In light of the $250 million top-up and the spirit of Singapore Together, would the Ministry consider the following."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00277,2020-03-06-T-007,277,Anthea Ong,"One, increasing the maximum funding in Our Singapore Fund and other funds to minimise the need to apply for multiple grants by ground-ups who are made up of citizen volunteers."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00278,2020-03-06-T-007,278,Anthea Ong,"Two, revising the framework in disbursing grants such that projects which are longer-term in nature or design, for example research, or projects which are seeking to be more sustainable, can receive longer term funding required in line with the time required for community development."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00279,2020-03-06-T-007,279,Anthea Ong,"And three, removing the cap on the amount or percentage of budget that can be spent on paying project owners, since they are often the ones putting in the most time and effort into the project, and for manpower needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00280,2020-03-06-T-007,280,Walter Theseira,"Mr Chairman, since 2009, the annual Pink Dot SG has attracted tens of thousands of Singaporeans to attend in support of the LGBTQ+ community. However, many Singaporeans have also expressed concerns about Pink Dot SG and some have organised counter-events such as Wear White."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00281,2020-03-06-T-007,281,Walter Theseira,"A 2019 IPS study found that there have been ""steep drops"" in opposition towards LGBTQ+ issues. Unfortunately, divisions along this fault line may nonetheless deepen, given the role other social divides, such as religion and age, play in shaping attitudes towards LGBTQ+ issues. If these divisions were left unchecked, it increases the potential for acts of violence and discrimination to be committed against vulnerable groups, including hate speech and online harassment."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00282,2020-03-06-T-007,282,Walter Theseira,"The Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles or IRCCs have served an important role in strengthening social cohesion through dialogues, workshops and other programmes, amongst various religious and racial groups. In light of the friction concerning LGBTQ+ issues, one way to foster social harmony would be to include vulnerable and marginalised groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities and migrant workers and other groups, to be a mainstay in initiatives similar to IRCCs."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00283,2020-03-06-T-007,283,Walter Theseira,"The purpose of such initiatives is not to convert anyone to any particular viewpoint on these issues, but to mitigate polarisation by strengthening social cohesion and fostering understanding and respect across differences."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00284,2020-03-06-T-007,284,Walter Theseira,"Given the contributions of IRCCs in promoting social harmony, could the Ministry convene similar community engagement initiatives that aim to bridge gaps between religious groups, the LGBTQ+ community and other stakeholders, with the aim of fostering mutual understanding?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00285,2020-03-06-T-007,285,,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu, you can take the three cuts together."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00286,2020-03-06-T-007,286,Yip Pin Xiu,"Mr Chairman, I declare my interest as a current athlete. The Disability Sports Master Plan, otherwise known as the DSMP, started its implementation in 2016. It was formed after the Vision 2030 exercise to redefine the role of sport in Singapore. One of the four Strategic Themes in Vision 2030 is ‘Sport without Boundaries’ where sports should be inclusive, with opportunities for people of all abilities to participate. DSMP was born to address gaps in the existing ecosystem to provide support for disability sports."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00287,2020-03-06-T-007,287,Yip Pin Xiu,"For the past three years, DSMP has been able to react and address some of these gaps. I am highly appreciative of the planning and investment. Perhaps it is timely that we now do a stocktake, and review what had worked, and what are new opportunities that may not have been available when DSMP was first implemented."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00288,2020-03-06-T-007,288,Yip Pin Xiu,"After research done in 2015, the DSMP had identified the barriers to participation and had three broad recommendations then; which was to expand access and opportunities for sports participation by PWDs, develop organisational and professional capabilities in disability sports, and build public awareness of disability sports and strengthen affinity with Team Singapore athletes."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00289,2020-03-06-T-007,289,Yip Pin Xiu,"So far, the DSMP team has come up with three disability sports programs which is the Play-Ability, Yes! I Can and Intro a Sport, There are plans to make sports complex more accessible. Currently there are seven inclusive gyms and pool wheelchairs have been put in place at five Active SG pools where there are ramps into the pools. Para Sports Coaching courses have been organised and there has been outreach and engagements, opportunities for volunteers. I would like to know if measurable outcomes were set in relation to the intended broad outcomes of the DSMP."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00290,2020-03-06-T-007,290,Yip Pin Xiu,"From an initiative started out to fill gaps, we should now look at the whole landscape and think of how to build bridges of opportunities with other sectors that work closely with PWDs, to maximise the potentials of the DSMP, with strategic execution. I firmly believe that this plan has the ability to determine the speed of success for Sports Without Boundaries in Singapore in the long run. Is a second version of the DSMP in the works, to review the landscape, and build bridges of opportunities, and support more aspects of disability sports? While programmes and infrastructure are improving, we should also leverage existing investments to promote access and build affinity for inclusion."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00291,2020-03-06-T-007,291,Yip Pin Xiu,"Firstly, while PE teachers have undergone training in inclusive PE, have we evaluated whether they are now confident in carrying out inclusive PE? How many students with disabilities are still not participating in PE? My peers and I have gone through the exact same experience during our school days. I have been told to sit out and look after school bags while the rest of my classmates were in PE class. We were looked at differently, as if PE was something that did not matter to us, yet somehow essential for able-body students to gain different benefits, like teamwork and social networking."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00292,2020-03-06-T-007,292,Yip Pin Xiu,"Secondly, if we look at engagements in schools, CCAs form another channel where we can layer on our investments to promote inclusion through sport. Schools can be supported to convert existing CCAs to welcome suitable students with disabilities, while specialised CCAs on para sports can provide a setting for students with and without disabilities to increase interaction and develop inclusive partnerships. If the children of today are exposed to this I believe that there is a higher chance they will grow up thinking that being inclusive is normal. The students will learn that it is possible to adapt, to include the people around them. and people with disabilities are not that different from them. The landscape will change not only for our youth with disabilities but will also lay a strong foundation in our young for a caring and inclusive society."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00293,2020-03-06-T-007,293,Yip Pin Xiu,"As a model, the DSMP should also encourage inclusive partnerships at a higher order, such as having Special Education Schools included in the School Sports Council."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00294,2020-03-06-T-007,294,Yip Pin Xiu,"Third, in a study highlighted by the DSMP, most VWOs, now called social service agencies, overlook the benefits that sports and physical activity can bring to PWDs and their overall well-being, due to the sources of their funding. An example is a recent Community Chest Charity Support Fund call, where it was informed that ""agencies that support programmes that contribute to the psycho-socio well-being of target clients"" would be eligible for funding, but such programmes would exclude ""sports"". It confused me that sports were not considered to contribute to psycho-socio well-being, where in fact an annex in the DSMP was dedicated to this. Are we able to review programmes and capability funding to social service agencies to promote sports, and reduce “oversight” of such benefits?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00295,2020-03-06-T-007,295,Yip Pin Xiu,"Fourth, with transportation being highlighted as a critical factor preventing sports participation, can we explore expanding the current transport subsidy schemes and assistive technology schemes to support PWD in pursuing Quality of Life activities, such as sports? While most employers are benefiting from grant schemes to redesign jobs and work environments to employ PWDs, soft skills are equally important to PWDs for employability."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00296,2020-03-06-T-007,296,Yip Pin Xiu,"Finally, the DSMP currently focuses mainly on outreach, and not on future development. However, if one of the aim is to build awareness and strengthen affinity with Team Singapore athletes, is there a possibility for DSMP to look at the entire spectrum of disability sports, from outreach to development to performance, and work with the current existing stakeholders in the respective areas to maximise efficiency of the resources?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00297,2020-03-06-T-007,297,Yip Pin Xiu,"In the last COS I raised the topic on Integrating National Sports Systems. To date, while there have been national sport systems that have voiced their interest in inclusion, concrete steps are still missing to support this progression in a systemic manner. We can have a challenge fund under Sport Singapore to encourage NSAs towards integration."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00298,2020-03-06-T-007,298,Yip Pin Xiu,"The Disability Sports Master Plan plays a big role in increasing participation and making Singapore a more accessible, inclusive and caring community. I am very eager to be a part of this ecosystem while we move towards our vision of Sports without Boundaries. The next phase of the DSMP can help to build bridges with various ministries and partner social service agencies to enable Singaporeans where they can have a better quality of life and lead an active and healthy life through sports."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00299,2020-03-06-T-007,299,Yip Pin Xiu,"Sir, I will now take my second cut on Mental Health Support for Athletes. As an athlete, I have seen many of my peers face pressures from their sport, academics, work, and different aspects from their life. These pressures can sometimes affect their mental well-being."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00300,2020-03-06-T-007,300,Yip Pin Xiu,Athletes retiring and transitioning out of sports can also find it difficult mentally and emotionally as most athletes have been doing this sport their whole life and it is their identity.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00301,2020-03-06-T-007,301,Yip Pin Xiu,"Currently, the support for sports psychology is excellent. However, the support is for athletes to perform at a highest level and they may not be trained to help athletes with their mental well-being or any mental health issues. The programme, Mind Matters, was created in 2017 to develop the mental health framework but the reach in this programme has been very limited with only five full sessions being conducted to 55 participants."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00302,2020-03-06-T-007,302,Yip Pin Xiu,"Would the Ministry consider providing mental health support as a strategic priority, and clarify what measures are in place for current and retiring athletes in this regard?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00303,2020-03-06-T-007,303,Yip Pin Xiu,"Sir, onto my third cut for our One Team Singapore Fund. The One Team Singapore Fund serves as a multiplier to help sporting organisations level up their high performance. Most National Sports Associations (NSAs) are small outfits and work very hard to source for funding. One way is to market the NSA or its athletes to secure sponsorships, where it then becomes a win-win situation for both the NSA and the sponsor."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00304,2020-03-06-T-007,304,Yip Pin Xiu,"While such sponsorships may be geared towards high performance, the One Team Singapore funding mechanism only allows donations to be matched and not sponsorships. This regulation appears to penalise the NSA for their efforts, rather than the sponsor. If the concern is sponsors receiving ""double"" benefit through ""doubled"" recognition for the matched funds, can this be mitigated by imposing a condition on the matched funds, rather than rejecting such matching altogether? If this Fund can apply to sponsorships as well, it can encourage corporates to play a bigger part in supporting local sports."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00305,2020-03-06-T-007,305,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, in August 2019, it was reported in the media that Vice President of Football Association of Singapore (FAS), Mr Edwin Tong mentioned that, I quote, ""FIFA World Cup 2034 will be a realistic goal for Singapore."""
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00306,2020-03-06-T-007,306,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Following this good news, I had failed a Parliamentary Question in September 2019 on the matter. I asked MCCY what are the Football Association of Singapore (FAS)'s plans in working towards achieving this goal for Singapore's Football National Team to qualify for FIFA World Cup in 2034."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00307,2020-03-06-T-007,307,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, the Ministry replied as follows, I quote, ""The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth welcomes our Team Singapore athletes and sports association to strive for excellence and support them in realising their goal. We look forward to hearing from the FAS on their plan to achieving their stated goal and how the football fraternity, community and the Government can support them in their efforts."""
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00308,2020-03-06-T-007,308,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, I have been looking forward and waited since September 2019 for updates from the Football Association of Singapore or MCCY. This time around I do hope to hear some positive sharing from the Minister on the matter."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00309,2020-03-06-T-007,309,Lee Bee Wah,"Sir, in the midst of COVID-19 affecting Singapore and the rest of the world, the subjects of ""national resilience"", ""community bonding"" and ""national pride"" in how Singapore manages the epidemic is popping up. Coincidentally, true sporting nations typically display such positive attributes. In fact, I recall that the Committee of Sporting Singapore report in 2001, championed by Mr Goh Chok Tong, articulated these three desired outcomes of a Sporting Singapore, the other two being ""vibrant society and economy"" and ""international friendship""."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00310,2020-03-06-T-007,310,Lee Bee Wah,"Minister Grace Fu was quoted by Straits Times on 16 January 2020 that  ""There’s so much more that we can do before we can really call ourselves a sporting country”."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00311,2020-03-06-T-007,311,Lee Bee Wah,"But we have made progress, and I cite the example raised by Senior Minister of State Sim Ann in Parliament on 5 November 2019 that more people with disabilities (PWD) are participating in sport, with the Government exploring how a related master plan can make more progress."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00312,2020-03-06-T-007,312,Lee Bee Wah,"Rewinding back the clock  in 2010, Singapore was awarded  the Gold for Sports City Award at the 2010 International Sports Events Management Awards, and Runners-up for the 2010 Ultimate Sports City at the Sports Accord Convention. The international sporting community took notice of this little red dot’s sporting achievements during the 2001 to 2010 period."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00313,2020-03-06-T-007,313,Lee Bee Wah,"GDP contribution from the sports industry grew from $300 million in 2000 to $1 billion in 2008, including the hosting of the 2005 International Olympic Committee Session, 2008 inaugural F1 Singapore Grand Prix, 2009 inaugural Asian Youth Games, and 2010 inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG)."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00314,2020-03-06-T-007,314,Lee Bee Wah,"The job creation objective was catalysed by the startup of Singapore Sports School in 2004, the launch of UK Loughborough University’s sports science degree in partnership with NTU, the emphasis of sports health leisure by Republic Polytechnic, ITE, and other private institutions."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00315,2020-03-06-T-007,315,Lee Bee Wah,"Working under MOU partnerships, the EDB, the previous Media Development Authority and Singapore Sports Council successfully courted international companies to relocate to Singapore and thereby created new jobs, for example, ASICS, Decathlon."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00316,2020-03-06-T-007,316,Lee Bee Wah,"In 2008, the former MCYS Minister, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, announced a target for the Singapore sports industry  $2 billion annual contribution to Singapore’s GDP and the creation of 20,000 jobs by 2015. Sir, the sporting fraternity seeks an update on the GDP contribution and jobs created."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00317,2020-03-06-T-007,317,Lee Bee Wah,"Next, Singapore Sports Hub. For this national iconic project, much has been said about the Public Private Partnership model; however, the sporting fraternity has yet to see positive changes that will convince Singaporeans that we have the right private sector partner running this national project."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00318,2020-03-06-T-007,318,Lee Bee Wah,"Instead, we have witnessed a continuous exodus of staff last year and this year, including the majority C-suite of SportsHub  CEO, CFO, COO, Chief Commercial Officer, and General Counsel. From public reports, there has also been critical changes to the shareholders and key partners  for example, the 83% majority shareholder Infra Red Capital Partners has been acquired by Sun Life. Is this a material change? Will it further impact negatively the desired outcomes of the project."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00319,2020-03-06-T-007,319,Lee Bee Wah,"Sir, it would be timely for Minister to provide us with an update on the situation at Singapore Sports Hub, given that we are approaching the end of six years of full operations."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00320,2020-03-06-T-007,320,Lee Bee Wah,"Please also update how we will keep our sporting calendar vibrant, given the non-performance of the contractual promise by SportsHub Private Limited to host 90 sporting event days per year at National Stadium. Are we getting value for money for this national project."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00321,2020-03-06-T-007,321,Lee Bee Wah,"On this subject, I would like to appeal to MCCY once again. Tampines has Our Tampines Hub; Bedok has Heartbeat @ Bedok; Sembawang has Sembawang Integrated Hub."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00322,2020-03-06-T-007,322,Lee Bee Wah,"What does Yishun have? A rundown swimming complex opened in 1988 and an old sports stadium opened in 1992. The remaking of our sports facilities is to remain relevant and affordable, and to meet demands of the community. I am sure that the population of Yishun town has grown, and Yishunites deserve more and better sporting facilities."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00323,2020-03-06-T-007,323,,"Mr Terence Ho, you can take your two cuts together."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00324,2020-03-06-T-007,324,Terence Ho Wee San,"Chairman, arts giving. Amid the evolving of the COVID-19 outbreak, the arts community brings people together, spreads love and positivity. In my previous speeches, I mentioned that I believe that a more targeted and well-defined Culture Matching Fund (CMF) policy can help small, medium arts groups in Singapore enjoy the benefits."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00325,2020-03-06-T-007,325,Terence Ho Wee San,"To battle the economy downturn, I propose to review and reconsider the CMF."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00326,2020-03-06-T-007,326,Terence Ho Wee San,"One, can the Government consider launching a Relief and Recovery Measures to Arts Group by providing 1 2 matching grant instead of 1 1? This is a period for all arts groups; with the sudden cancellations and postponement of shows, arts groups are predicted to experience a deficit within the period."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00327,2020-03-06-T-007,327,Terence Ho Wee San,"Two, will the Government also consider providing more for the project and production grant, such as the Tote Board Arts Fund so as to allow the arts groups to work on recovery plans to bring back audiences and call back artistes for future performances? More help is definitely needed to bring back audiences and assure them that the shows will go on. The COVID-19 outbreak has an impact on the worldwide economy and it takes time for the outbreak to settle down. I believe that there is a need to path a recovery route for all arts groups and is vital and to make the arts vibrant and accessible to the public again."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00328,2020-03-06-T-007,328,Terence Ho Wee San,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] During this trying period, operations of arts groups have been seriously affected. The sustainability of arts and cultural groups require strong Government support, and also sponsorship and donations from corporates, foundations and individuals who recognise the importance of arts and culture."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00329,2020-03-06-T-007,329,Terence Ho Wee San,"In my previous speeches, I suggested that the Government exercises greater flexibility and adopt a more targeted approach in the administration of the Cultural Matching Fund (CMF)."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00330,2020-03-06-T-007,330,Terence Ho Wee San,"For example, aside from providing matching grants according to the amount of funds raised, the Government could perhaps consider providing matching grants according to performances and ticket sales."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00331,2020-03-06-T-007,331,Terence Ho Wee San,"To help arts groups tide over this difficult period, I hope the Government can review the disbursement of CMF by"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00332,2020-03-06-T-007,332,Terence Ho Wee San,"First, the Government can consider launching a relief package to help arts groups overcome the current difficulties by increasing the ratio of CMF from 1 1 to 1 2. This will help to increase funding for cultural and arts groups, who can then use the funds to tide over this period."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00333,2020-03-06-T-007,333,Terence Ho Wee San,"Second, the Government can consider increasing project and production grants for arts groups, so that they can come up with exciting programmes to attract audiences. Bringing back audiences to performances cannot be done overnight. However, I believe that if arts groups unite together and go all-out to attract audiences, the crowd will come back, and the entire arts scene will be rejuvenated."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00334,2020-03-06-T-007,334,Terence Ho Wee San,"How to canvas for donations and sponsorships beyond Government funding is the greatest challenge faced by most arts groups. We hope to nurture more fans of the arts, including those who appreciate the arts and those who are willing to sponsor arts activities."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00335,2020-03-06-T-007,335,Terence Ho Wee San,"This is the hope of many arts groups. I also hope that arts groups can attract new audiences, who will eventually become advocates for the arts, and that all arts performances will enjoy such good ticket sales that only standing room will be left."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00336,2020-03-06-T-007,336,Terence Ho Wee San,"(In English)  My second cut. Arts groups now and in the future will require a significant amount of space to express their creativity and store their props and sets. The arts space will help artistes and arts groups to grow and we need to keep up the growth of the arts group. With limited land space in Singapore, it is increasingly difficult to increase the gross floor area (GFA) of the arts community. Do we have a short, mid and long-term plan to cater to the growing needs and create space synergy for the arts?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00337,2020-03-06-T-007,337,Terence Ho Wee San,"Earlier on in September 2019, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng announced that arts freelancers will have an arts resource website, and will also have dedicated working spaces. In my previous speeches, I proposed that the Government can consider a central shared warehouse for the arts community, where props and sets can be stored, shared or reused. This is one of the ways we can do our part to save the Earth from climate change, reducing wastage and disposal issues."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00338,2020-03-06-T-007,338,Terence Ho Wee San,"In addition to that, perhaps the Government can consider including shopping malls and even unused national monument space, to cater for arts use. For instance, Wild Rice is housed within Funan and Singapore Dance Theatre is housed within Bugis+. We can integrate arts and culture within malls, to further increase the audiences’ reach."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00339,2020-03-06-T-007,339,Terence Ho Wee San,"Furthermore, as the world continues to face challenges during this outbreak, the local arts community is doing their part to rally Singaporeans. For example, the Theatre arts groups came together, to promote and share about each other’s’ upcoming productions. These are heartwarming gestures."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00340,2020-03-06-T-007,340,Terence Ho Wee San,"To battle the virus together, I propose the following."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00341,2020-03-06-T-007,341,Terence Ho Wee San,"One, can the National Arts Council help provide rental rebates, for arts group housed at Goodman Arts Centre and Stamford Arts Centre, to name a few. This will help to tide the arts groups through this difficult period of low attendance and cancellation of their shows."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00342,2020-03-06-T-007,342,Terence Ho Wee San,"Two, can there be introduction of shared services among the arts groups, in terms of Professional Services such as legal advice, audit and accounting services? This can help reduce the expenditure of the arts groups."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00343,2020-03-06-T-007,343,Terence Ho Wee San,"The synergy of arts space can integrate, interest and ignite the collaboration among arts groups and utilise resources to the fullest. The arts bring diverse communities together. Amidst the challenging periods again, I am certain that the local arts community will continue to do their part to rally Singaporeans."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00344,2020-03-06-T-007,344,Terence Ho Wee San,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] As arts groups grow, they will need more space for practice, rehearsals, and storing props and stage sets. With limited land space in Singapore, there are not many places that can be used for arts groups. I hope we could do the following"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00345,2020-03-06-T-007,345,Terence Ho Wee San,"First, Government Ministries can engage in inter-Ministerial discussions on how to increase space allocated for culture and arts."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00346,2020-03-06-T-007,346,Terence Ho Wee San,"Second, during the current COVID-19 outbreak, I hope that we can consider granting rental rebates to arts groups, so that they can focus on rehearsals as usual, and not lose the drive to perform due to loss of income because of cancellation of performances. My wish is that the dance will continue, the music will not stop playing, and we can live life as per normal."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00347,2020-03-06-T-007,347,Joan Pereira,"Sir, culture and the arts help build a sense of community, bringing people together by providing a common experience and shared worldview. They also provide opportunities for learning, communication and entertainment. Therefore, it is important to ensure that culture and the arts are accessible to individuals from all walks of life. Every segment of our society, including the less privileged, should have access to a wide range of quality arts performances."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00348,2020-03-06-T-007,348,Joan Pereira,"I would like to commend MCCY for doing much to bring the arts to the less privileged. One example is the WeCare Arts Fund, a year-round funding scheme that supports artists and Social Service Agencies in developing participatory workshops for beneficiaries."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00349,2020-03-06-T-007,349,Joan Pereira,"In Singapore, free, non-ticketed arts events are widespread and easily accessible. In fact, non-ticketed arts attendance has been climbing over the years, reaching an all-time high in 2018."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00350,2020-03-06-T-007,350,Joan Pereira,"Last December, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra gave a free performance in an open area at my market/hawker centre. My residents, especially the seniors, were delighted to have a wonderful concert at their doorstep. They spent a memorable evening singing along with the evergreen hits and nostalgic tunes. It was a most heartwarming sight and I really want to thank our hon Nominated Member Mr Terence Ho and Singapore Chinese Orchestra (SCO) for making this happen. Our seniors are really looking forward to the next one, which is coming up soon."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00351,2020-03-06-T-007,351,Joan Pereira,Quality arts performances can be expensive to produce and affordability would be an obstacle for the less privileged. They may require interlocutors to provide context to the performances and may need to attend such events with friends and family to feel comfortable and to enjoy the performance. How would MCCY address these issues?
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00352,2020-03-06-T-007,352,Yee Chia Hsing,"Chairman, I would like to echo Ms Joan Pereira's call for arts to be accessible to all, regardless of socio-economic status. Besides looking at the issue from the perspective of consumers of arts and culture, is MCCY also looking at the issue from the perspective of the providers of arts and culture? Do our artists have the physical space as well as the platform to practice as well as showcase their craft. This is important to ensure that we have a diverse and vibrant arts scene."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00353,2020-03-06-T-007,353,Yee Chia Hsing,"Back in 2017, I asked the same question during COS and the Ministry indicated that it has opened up Gillman Barracks for artists to showcase their craft. However, anecdotally, the awareness of Gillman Barracks is not high and the tenants there are not doing well as a result. Are there plans to rejuvenate Gillman Barracks and also open up other locations for our local artists?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00354,2020-03-06-T-007,354,Lee Yi Shyan,"Sir, as a First World economy, we strive to be a First World people – charitable and gracious, considerate and compassionate. Apart from pursuing economic goals, we should also have room for the intangibles of life  to understand our history, appreciate our heritage, celebrate our diversity and participate in artistic expressions of various forms."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00355,2020-03-06-T-007,355,Lee Yi Shyan,"Thanks to years of consistent investments, we can be proud of having world-class venues in performing theatre, museum and art gallery. Singaporeans have ready access to world-class concerts, performances and exhibitions. We have a vibrant arts scene."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00356,2020-03-06-T-007,356,Lee Yi Shyan,"Arts and culture, however, should not be confined to the premises of museums and concert halls. Instead, they should flourish in the daily lives of our people. Visitors to Italian cities such as Florence would see amazing sculptures and magnificent architecture at piazzas, along streets and on their buildings."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00357,2020-03-06-T-007,357,Lee Yi Shyan,"In my constituency, we work hard to bring arts and culture into the community. Since its opening two years ago, Heartbeat has held more than 250 workshops on arts and crafts, painting, sculpturing, calligraphy. Our choir, orchestra and interests groups put up pubic performances. We are grateful to PA, NHB and NAC for their support and partnership."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00358,2020-03-06-T-007,358,Lee Yi Shyan,"Sir, may I ask for your permission to display a picture on the LCD screens."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00359,2020-03-06-T-007,359,,"Yes, please. ["
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00360,2020-03-06-T-007,360,Lee Yi Shyan,"When Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong opened the Heartbeat@Bedok on 4 February 2018, we unveiled a locally-installed art work named “Pulses”. Singapore is no Florence but we could still envision our version of renaissance."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00361,2020-03-06-T-007,361,Lee Yi Shyan,"Given this context, would the Minister enlighten us how MCCY views arts and culture development in the community? Would MCCY support more ground-up initiatives on visual arts including installation of art works at public places, with programme akin to URA's ""The Art Incentive Scheme""?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00362,2020-03-06-T-007,362,,Minister Grace Fu.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00363,2020-03-06-T-007,363,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Twenty-twenty marks the beginning of a new decade. For MCCY, we ended the last decade on a strong note across our domains, where Singaporeans came together to celebrate our heritage, our unity and our sporting achievements."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00364,2020-03-06-T-007,364,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We commemorated our Bicentennial, recalling our history and how together we built a nation. Our religious leaders came together to affirm their Commitment to Safeguard Religious Harmony at the inaugural International Conference on Cohesive Societies. Our country rallied behind Team Singapore athletes at the SEA Games, who brought home 53 gold medals, 46 silver medals and 68 bronze medals."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00365,2020-03-06-T-007,365,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We have become a more caring nation through voluntary acts of spontaneous and everyday kindness. There have been many accounts of how Singaporeans have looked out for each other in recent weeks during the COVID-19 outbreak. Many of us desire to do more for the community, from donating to volunteering."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00366,2020-03-06-T-007,366,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As a people, we have become more confident about our identity, what we can offer and showcase to the world. With strong public support, we submitted our nomination to inscribe Hawker Culture in Singapore on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. We look forward to the outcome in December 2020."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00367,2020-03-06-T-007,367,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Making Singapore our home together is the heart of MCCY's work. We believe in collectively shaping the society we want to be – a caring people, a cohesive society and a confident nation. We work closely with partners to support the Singapore Cares movement. We encourage our citizens to step forward to serve, through Team Nila and Youth Corps Singapore. We have expanded opportunities for Singaporeans to engage in honest dialogue and understand each other better, through programmes such as BRIDGE. We partnered stakeholders to support the expression of national pride through Our SG Arts Plan and Our SG Heritage Plan. We empower our citizens through Our Singapore Fund, Our Harmony Fund and the National Youth Fund, to start ground-up projects that can inspire others and strengthen our identity as one people."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00368,2020-03-06-T-007,368,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"With the Singapore Together movement, MCCY will do more to partner Singaporeans. In a world where people are increasingly tribal, divided and disconnected from each other, we will ensure Singapore’s social fabric remains strong, by working together to offer opportunities, community and inclusion to every member of society. We will enhance access to opportunities, foster a more caring and gracious community, and build an inclusive city of possibilities."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00369,2020-03-06-T-007,369,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"For a society to be united, it must work for everyone, not just a few. There must be equal conditions for all to thrive. I am glad Dr Lim Wee Kiak raised this. We will enhance access to opportunities in the sports, arts and youth sectors for all Singaporeans at each stage of their lives."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00370,2020-03-06-T-007,370,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Darryl David asked how MCCY will provide such opportunities for all children and youths. In the early pre-school years, a child's main way of learning and developing is through play."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00371,2020-03-06-T-007,371,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Under our Children and Youth Sport Framework, we will provide more in- and out-of-school play opportunities for our children to support their physical and intellectual growth. In 2017, SportSG initiated the Nurture Kids programme to complement ECDA's development framework for our young children. Last year, we partnered 125 pre-schools and introduced fundamental movement skills such as jumping, throwing and balancing in a safe and fun way to more than 5,000 children. This year, we will double efforts, and make this available to 250 pre-schools. We will also partner MOE to ensure all pre-school teachers graduating from the National Institute of Early Childhood have the skills to help our children develop their fundamental motor skills."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00372,2020-03-06-T-007,372,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Complementing these initiatives, an ""Active Parents"" movement will be launched this year, to encourage and equip parents to play an active role in our children’s sporting journey."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00373,2020-03-06-T-007,373,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"At our Primary and Secondary schools, we will continue partnering MOE to provide our students with opportunities for a well-rounded education through sports and culture. In 2020, we will expand the School Sports Partnership and introduce ""Active Play"". Primary schools can tie up with SportSG to conduct different sports, so students can pick up these sports conveniently – during recess, school sports days or at nearby sports centres. These non-competitive arenas can encourage students to try more sports and bring them enjoyment while fostering confidence, teamwork and cohesion."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00374,2020-03-06-T-007,374,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We are also exploring more offerings under the Strategic Partnership CCA pilot formed last year between MOE, the National Arts Council (NAC) and SportSG. This allows students to pursue their interests, even if these are not offered as CCAs in their schools. They will be able to represent their schools in national competitions and platforms. Athletics and Ethnic Dance are currently offered under this programme. This year, where there is demand, SportSG is ready to open up more locations to support Athletics training. On its part, NAC will work with LASALLE College of the Arts to provide Ethnic Dance experiences for interested students."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00375,2020-03-06-T-007,375,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We will nurture creativity and expand horizons of our children by celebrating our history and igniting their love for our heritage. The Singapore Philatelic Museum will be revamped as a dedicated children’s museum where children can learn about a wide range of themes, including the heritage and culture of Singapore and the region, by playing with interactive and immersive exhibits. For instance, there will be a permanent exhibition on ""Singapore, Our Home"", where children can learn how early pioneers lived and worked, and role-play as hawkers, coolies and merchants. The museum will re-open in 2021 and add to the current offerings for children, such as the Children’s Biennale at National Gallery Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00376,2020-03-06-T-007,376,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Our museums will also provide our students with shared experiences of learning together and appreciating Singapore's history. In 2020, the National Heritage Board will introduce Museum-based Learning (MBL) as part of MOE's Learning Journeys for students."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00377,2020-03-06-T-007,377,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"All Primary 6 and Secondary 2 cohorts will visit the Asian Civilisations Museum and National Museum of Singapore respectively. Students will travel through the museums in small groups, interact with museum educators and complete hands-on activities with their friends."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00378,2020-03-06-T-007,378,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"For instance, at the National Museum, students can learn the struggles of the Japanese occupation by choosing artefacts they are interested in and having conversations around those artefacts. One such artefact is Elizabeth Choy's dress, which she wore while held captive."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00379,2020-03-06-T-007,379,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Through this experience of exploring our history as a cohort, we hope our students will form shared memories together, and learn important values such as self-determination and helping one another during difficult times. These initiatives will make learning more meaningful and come alive for students, as they go through their Character and Citizenship Education syllabus and subjects such as Social Studies in Primary school and History in Secondary school."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00380,2020-03-06-T-007,380,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In an age where Asia's economy is growing in significance, our youths need to understand regional markets to thrive in the future economy. Our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) already provide youths with opportunities to build their economic, social and cultural awareness of the region. Youth Corps Singapore piloted the enhanced Youth Expedition Projects (YEP+) in 2018 to provide youths with deeper understanding of the region. The YEP+ comprises not only of community service, but also visits to multinational corporations and start-ups."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00381,2020-03-06-T-007,381,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Our participants have made their marks in Indonesia, Laos, Vietnam and China. Currently, the YEP+ provides about 5,000 opportunities for regional exposure."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00382,2020-03-06-T-007,382,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In 2020, we will increase opportunities for youths to engage the region. The National Youth Council (NYC) will partner IHLs to expand short-term immersion opportunities to ASEAN, China and India for ITE, Polytechnic and University students, through the new Asia-Ready Exposure Programme (AEP). The AEP will curate industry-focused experiences in the region for our youths to be more aware of the economic opportunities in these countries."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00383,2020-03-06-T-007,383,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"By 2022, NYC's regional exposure programmes, including the AEP, will support up to 10,000 youths each year. This is double the current number of youths benefiting from NYC's programmes. This will contribute to the ""70-and-70"" target for students, announced by the Finance Minister in his Budget Speech and enhance the Asia-readiness of our future workforce."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00384,2020-03-06-T-007,384,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Not forgetting those who are less youthful, we will ensure everyone has opportunities to lead full and active lives. By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be at or above the age of 65, and we will have 900,000 seniors. Sports and physical activity allow our seniors to sustain their health and mobility longer and continue to be engaged in the community."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00385,2020-03-06-T-007,385,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"From this year, we will make public gyms and swimming pools free for all Singaporeans aged 65 years and above. We will review the age criterion from time to time, in keeping with the trends and life expectancy of Singaporeans. SportSG will also partner the Agency for Integrated Care to bring programmes for seniors to their doorsteps, at Senior Citizens' Corners and Senior Activity Centres."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00386,2020-03-06-T-007,386,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I have touched on new initiatives for Singaporeans at each stage of life. Equally important, we must ensure that access to the things that make a full life – the beauty of the arts, the rigour of sports, the knowledge of our heritage, the support of our community – is open to all, regardless of background."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00387,2020-03-06-T-007,387,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We will continue to increase access to sports facilities around the island, under our Sports Facilities Master Plan. This year, we will break ground for the new Punggol Regional Sport Centre. We will bring new Sport-in-Precinct facilities to Sengkang South, Pasir Ris East and Dover, achieving our target of initiating 20 Sport-in-Precinct projects by 2020. We will rejuvenate another five ActiveSG facilities, from swimming complexes in Ang Mo Kio, to, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah may like to know, sport centres in Yishun."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00388,2020-03-06-T-007,388,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In partnership with MOE, over 90% of suitable Government Primary and Secondary schools' sports halls and fields have been converted for public use under the Dual Use Scheme. We will work with MOE to convert all remaining suitable facilities by this time next year. These initiatives will help realise our aspiration of having sports and recreational facilities within a 10-minute walk from our homes."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00389,2020-03-06-T-007,389,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked about broadening access to the arts. Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Terence Ho made similar suggestions in this House. We will ensure that all Singaporeans have access to quality arts productions. This year, we will enhance the WeCare Arts Fund by launching the WeCare Arts Experiences, in partnership with the five Community Development Councils (CDCs). This will enable less privileged families to attend ticketed presentations for free at our cultural institutions such as the Esplanade, SSO and NHB museums, through a subsidy of up to $40 for a ticket."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00390,2020-03-06-T-007,390,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"By 2022, the National Arts Council and CDCs aim to reach up to 20,000 beneficiaries and volunteers under the scheme. As Mr Terence Ho noted, everyone has a part to play in enhancing access to the arts and we encourage volunteers to step up and work with Social Service Agencies to see how they too can contribute their time. Mr Chairman, I would like to speak in Malay."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00391,2020-03-06-T-007,391,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] We will enhance access to opportunities for all. For our preschool children, we will help train the teachers to stimulate their physical and intellectual growth through. For our school-going children, we will provide a more holistic learning journey, by expanding avenues for them to try new sports. We will also provide more opportunities in building shared experiences through learning our national history together. For post-secondary youths, we will increase opportunities for them to gain cultural literacy and a deeper understanding of the region."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00392,2020-03-06-T-007,392,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We will ensure our seniors can lead full and active lives. We will ensure that everyone has convenient access to sports facilities. We will also ensure that our lower income families will be able to enjoy quality arts productions, so we can all flourish as a society together."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00393,2020-03-06-T-007,393,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"However, such opportunities alone do not make a good home. We must enable and help one another to succeed. Every Singaporean counts, we will only by progressing together. As a people, we need to recognise and act on our mutual obligations to our fellow citizens."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00394,2020-03-06-T-007,394,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"(In English)  Beyond providing opportunities for all, we wish to build a strong community spirit where we care and help one another. There is more each of us can do to give and to lift the less fortunate and more vulnerable among us. Senior Minister of State will provide more details on these initiatives."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00395,2020-03-06-T-007,395,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We will deepen our commitment to one another as one people and to Singapore. In 2020, MCCY will partner Singapore citizens to create content on what makes us Singaporean and this content will be used to update our Singapore Citizenship Journey. Through this process, Singaporeans will articulate and affirm who we are as a people, while co-creating content to enrich new citizens' understanding of Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00396,2020-03-06-T-007,396,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"After an open call in January, we will convene a Citizens Workgroup comprising of interested persons from diverse fields and organisations. Over the next few months, they will discuss what unites us as Singaporeans and research topics close to our hearts. This would include our values and obligations as Singaporeans, social norms and our culture and national history. Their recommendations will be published by end-2020."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00397,2020-03-06-T-007,397,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"When we affirm our common fate, support one another and work and progress together side by side, we live a democracy of deeds. A clear manifestation of this has been the crafting of the SG Youth Action Plan, where more than 70,000 youths proactively shared their ideas and views on Singapore in 2025. Senior Minister of State will share more on this."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00398,2020-03-06-T-007,398,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Anthea Ong and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how we will support ground up efforts better. Finance Minister has shared in his Budget Speech that the Government is prepared to invest up to $175 million from now to 2025 to engage active citizenry and develop partnerships.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00399,2020-03-06-T-007,399,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To support more projects, we will put $20 million of these funds into Our Singapore Fund and extend it to SG60 in 2025. Government will co-invest the balance in partners across all domains to support projects that address shared priorities. This enhanced support will help partners develop capacity and capabilities to sustain impactful initiatives. More immediately, Senior Parliamentary Secretary will also speak on our measures to support the arts and sports communities in view of the ongoing COVID-19 situation."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00400,2020-03-06-T-007,400,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To grow an inclusive society that embraces diversity, we will expand pathways to success that celebrate our diverse talents, skills and cultures. This year, we will provide more support to our athletes and artists, so they can excel and succeed and make Singapore a place of opportunities. We will support promising athletes representing Singapore who are not covered by our High Performance Sports system. We will work with individuals and groups to preserve our heritage in innovative ways and keep it alive so we can transmit it to future generations. Senior Parliamentary Secretary will share more details."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00401,2020-03-06-T-007,401,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Even as we celebrate what makes us different, we need to emphasise and protect what we share in common. A major reason for Singapore's success is that we stay open to the world while remaining cohesive as a nation. We combine unity with diversity, harmony with difference. We can do this because our communities hold our differences not in opposition to each other, but in a relationship of mutual respect. Diversity ensures we have the range and breadth of ideas, perspectives and resources to thrive globally. Because we come from different lands and cultures, the possibilities of what we can make together are so much richer. We see a common good and are committed to building something better. We rely on one another for security, stability and prosperity."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00402,2020-03-06-T-007,402,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked how we will foster mutual understanding on LGBTQ. In many of our discussions with citizens, the issue of sexual orientation has often been raised. It is grounded on personal values and beliefs and consensus is not always possible. However, we agree with Assoc Prof Walter Theseira, that we do not shy away from discussing it and it is important that we have platforms where we can engage on our differences on the basis of mutual respect."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00403,2020-03-06-T-007,403,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"For instance, at the Youth Conversations and SG Youth Action Plan engagements, youths had a safe space to express views, on their aspirations, concerns, fears and disappointments. Participants voiced their opinions, including on LGBTQ issues, while others listened with civility and respect."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00404,2020-03-06-T-007,404,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Through such platforms, we listen to those different from us and seek to understand them on their terms, even with our disagreements; we expand the common space to engage one another and work together on the things that we want in common. When we drop the mindset of ""us versus them"" and see ourselves as a collective ""we"", Singaporeans with different points of view can sit together and work on issues important to our shared future, such as jobs and economy, the environment, the vulnerable and the disadvantaged."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00405,2020-03-06-T-007,405,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We will continue to support partners and agencies to build capacity and capabilities within the community for more inclusive civil discourse. We will support platforms that bring together people who hold different perspectives. And we will partner ground-up efforts to promote social harmony. In Mandarin, Sir."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00406,2020-03-06-T-007,406,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Apart from the recent COVID-19 situation, racism, religionism, and protectionism are also on the rise globally. People are increasingly tribal, divided and disconnected from each other. As such, we will ensure Singapore's social fabric stays strong, by working together to offer opportunities, community and inclusion to every member of society. Bearing in mind our vision, we will build a home that provides opportunities for all, by enhancing access to these opportunities and allowing people to develop their full potentials."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00407,2020-03-06-T-007,407,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We will also foster a more caring and gracious community, where we do not forget to help and enable one another to succeed. We will build an inclusive city that celebrates our diverse talents and cultures. Finally, with the Singapore Together Movement, MCCY will do more to partner Singaporeans to build a caring, cohesive and confident Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00408,2020-03-06-T-007,408,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"(In English)  To conclude, Sir, we in MCCY often ask ourselves if we are making progress towards our vision of a caring people, cohesive society and confident nation for Singapore. We are aware that the strength of our society is not measured by, say, the number of art events we hold, or the amount of grants made. The answer lies in our responses when we face a major crisis as a nation. COVID-19 is the moment that allows us to search for the answer. To get through the crisis, we must unite around our values of multi-racialism, openness and self-determination. We must not let fear and anxiety come between us. That it is a worldwide crisis gives us a good basis of comparison with others."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00409,2020-03-06-T-007,409,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Sir, I would put to this House that Singapore and Singaporeans have come up well as a caring people, cohesive society and a confident nation."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00410,2020-03-06-T-007,410,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Singapore has united as one, and acted and applied our minds to help one another. Many have stepped up to show what it means to be Singaporean. Those working at the frontline of our defence are standing tall and stoically in their positions despite shouldering risks to themselves and their families. Some, like the pilots and crew of Scoot and the MFA officers who flew into Wuhan to retrieve Singaporeans there, showed courage, sense of duty and self-sacrifice, and made the nation proud. Some contributed time and resources to those in need, going deep into the community to reach out to seniors and the vulnerable in their homes. As the situation developed, more of us have come forward to help, in whatever way we can to anyone, regardless of race, language or religion."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00411,2020-03-06-T-007,411,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"This is a testament to the strength of our society and our progress as one people. And I think years of developing that support on the ground whether it is through PA, whether it is through Team Nila, our Youth Corp Singapore, have shown us we have the strength, a very strong and firm layer of volunteers that is out there that will support us, the Government, in reaching out to the ground and helping the ground. While other countries see their citizens standing in line in the cold for hours for two pieces of masks per person, we have distributed four masks per household within days, without queues. And I think this is the day we have been practising so hard, that we are preparing so hard for. And I think Singapore has really come well."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00412,2020-03-06-T-007,412,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"And through our actions, we demonstrate that we are in this together, with trust and confidence in the Government and in one another. Together, we are working out solutions to new problems. We will emerge a stronger nation. This is the Singapore Spirit and the heart of our nation. [Applause.]"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00413,2020-03-06-T-007,413,Sim Ann,"Mr Chairman, Singapore Together is our commitment to partner Singaporeans to build a ""democracy of deeds"", as Deputy Prime Minister Heng shared last year."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00414,2020-03-06-T-007,414,Sim Ann,"The past weeks have shown how much we have grown as a democracy of deeds, with many rising to the occasion and having contributed to the common good amidst our ongoing fight against COVID-19."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00415,2020-03-06-T-007,415,Sim Ann,"Last month, Team Singapore bowlers packed and distributed masks and hand sanitisers to seniors in Clementi. Others showed appreciation for our unsung heroes. Ms Lim Sio Yen and Mr Ernest Koh Jun Ming set up video booths at various malls inviting people to record messages of support for those working in sectors such as healthcare, transport and security. We are heartened by such initiatives, and want to inspire more. This is why we introduced SG United, a one-stop portal to volunteer, donate, start and share community-led initiatives in response to COVID-19."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00416,2020-03-06-T-007,416,Sim Ann,"We believe that many who have made the first step of giving will continue to do so, inspiring others along the way. Over time, our society will grow as a community of open hearts and helping hands. This matters because no one – not the Government, the private sector, or people sector – has a monopoly on good ideas. We can only find the best solutions to build a better future we all share, through partnership."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00417,2020-03-06-T-007,417,Sim Ann,Let me start with our youths.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00418,2020-03-06-T-007,418,Sim Ann,"In 2019, youths such as Greta Thunberg, made global headlines. In Hong Kong, Chile, Lebanon, Sudan, young people were at the forefront of civic protests and calls for change. Policy-makers and thinkers pondered how youths are different and what that means for the future."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00419,2020-03-06-T-007,419,Sim Ann,"In Singapore and at MCCY, we began the process of engaging youths in 2018, with the Youth Conversations, a safe space for youths to talk about their aspirations and concerns. Like their elders, youths care deeply about their families and have the drive to succeed. There are also topics where they have a different outlook. If we do not listen to or work closely with our youths, these differences will lead to miscommunication, frustration, and divergence. Youths are also keen to move from conversation to action. These insights spurred us to refine our engagement approach to emphasise scale and more tangible impact. Our new approach has three key aspects."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00420,2020-03-06-T-007,420,Sim Ann,"First, we supported youths in envisioning and actualising their ideas. Last May, we launched a national platform for youths to articulate and achieve their vision for Singapore in 2025  the SG Youth Action Plan. Mr Yam asked for a progress update on the SG Youth Action Plan, and what youths can look forward to this year. Since SG Youth Action Plan’s launch, we reached out to over 400,000 youths, and engaged close to 70,000 of them through digital engagement, public roadshows and focus group discussions. This is our most ambitious youth engagement exercise yet."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00421,2020-03-06-T-007,421,Sim Ann,A diverse panel of youth leaders compiled thousands of youth voices into a draft vision of what youths hope to see in our near future. And here is what it says
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00422,2020-03-06-T-007,422,Sim Ann,"""Before we change the world, we must first change ourselves. We may not always get it right, but with hard work, compassion and determination, we will foster an inclusive, sustainable and progressive Singapore. We will create a home where Singaporeans care for one another, and have a fair shot at their dreams. Twenty-twenty five, we are coming for you!"""
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00423,2020-03-06-T-007,423,Sim Ann,"The draft youth vision conveys youth priorities, and provides us with a positive sense of what Singapore’s future will look like when the youths of today become the movers and shakers of tomorrow. We invite youths to help us refine this vision further."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00424,2020-03-06-T-007,424,Sim Ann,"We have already begun empowering youths with information, resources, and networks to turn their ideas into reality. This is the purpose of the Youth Action Challenge or YAC. The inaugural YAC saw 250 youth participants in 57 teams consult industry experts and policymakers to prototype ideas on the themes of environment, society and jobs. I witnessed some of these teams’ pitches in January, and was impressed by their passion. Allow me to share two examples"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00425,2020-03-06-T-007,425,Sim Ann,"Team Movement of Inclusivity is keen to help frontline staff in public spaces better assist persons with hidden disabilities. Another team, Team ASEAN Business Youth Association, wants our youths to become more ASEAN-savvy. So, they built a prototype platform offering regional networking opportunities for youths."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00426,2020-03-06-T-007,426,Sim Ann,"While the top teams will present their proposals at the YAC Summit next month for up to $50,000 of funding, NYC will help all 57 teams to implement their ideas. There will also be further editions of the YAC for youths to drive change on new themes that they care about."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00427,2020-03-06-T-007,427,Sim Ann,"The SG Youth Action Plan will also focus on championing youth concerns. The Panel partnered the Youth Alliance on Mental Health to call for more whole-of-society action in reducing stigma, strengthening peer support, and tackling workplace discrimination. Following such feedback, TAFEP has taken steps to advise employers against asking job applicants about their mental health history when there is no relevance. The recently announced Youth Mental Well-being Network will build on the work of the SG Youth Action Plan to co-create solutions with our youths and different segments of society."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00428,2020-03-06-T-007,428,Sim Ann,I am excited by the progress made and I look forward to more areas in which our youths will make a difference.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00429,2020-03-06-T-007,429,Sim Ann,"The second aspect of our new approach is to create more opportunities for youths to re-shape Singapore’s spaces. Youths have helped to co-create the Somerset Belt Masterplan, which Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey will share more about later this month, including how youths can enliven the Belt through their own initiatives."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00430,2020-03-06-T-007,430,Sim Ann,"Youths can also look forward to co-creating and co-owning the youth hub within Kallang Alive!, a sporting and lifestyle destination from our sports blueprint, Vision 2030. Our youths are energetic, and have an edgier take on sports and the arts. The youth hub will be a space for such dynamism. Details of engagements with youths will be shared later this year."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00431,2020-03-06-T-007,431,Sim Ann,The third way we are approaching youth engagement differently is through NYC. NYC will be a conduit for youth voices by expanding its digital engagement channels so more diverse segments of youths can provide candid feedback. It will also build its capabilities to support public agencies in identifying emerging youth needs. We are also experimenting with ways for youth leaders to directly engage agencies on specific policy issues where they have relevant expertise.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00432,2020-03-06-T-007,432,Sim Ann,"NYC will also be an incubator of youth action. Youths will receive greater support, through NYC’s curated leadership development and business exposure opportunities. Mr Chairman, in Mandarin."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00433,2020-03-06-T-007,433,Sim Ann,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The year 2019 was shaken by the youth. Youth made global headlines, as they were at the forefront of protests and calls for change in cities around the world. Is this an indication that the next generation is better than the previous one, or, are they causing trouble for the world?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00434,2020-03-06-T-007,434,Sim Ann,"This led many policy makers and thinkers to ponder how youths are different from their elders and what that means for the future. Here in Singapore, we began that process in 2018 with the Youth Conversations, where we provide youth a safe space to share with us their aspirations and diverse viewpoints. The Youth Conversations showed us that there are areas where youths bring to the table a different outlook. We should work together with them to cultivate this as a strength and move from conversation to action."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00435,2020-03-06-T-007,435,Sim Ann,"That is why we embarked on a new approach of engaging our youths for greater scale and a tangible impact. In May 2019, we launched ""SG Youth Action Plan"" for youth to articulate their vision for Singapore in 2025 and to take action to achieve that vision."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00436,2020-03-06-T-007,436,Sim Ann,"We reached out to over 400,000 youths and engaged 70,000 more closely, compiling thousands of youth voices into a clear statement on what young people hope to see in Singapore in the near future  a society that embodies the values of inclusiveness, fairness, care, sustainability and progress."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00437,2020-03-06-T-007,437,Sim Ann,"To support youth to realise the vision, we started the Youth Action Challenge which empowers them with the information, resources and networks to co-create projects on issues they care about. The youth teams have come up with 57 exciting proposals on the themes of environment, societal issues, and jobs and future of work, and I look forward to seeing the top 12 teams pitch their proposals at the YAC Summit in April."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00438,2020-03-06-T-007,438,Sim Ann,"We will continue to expand opportunities for youth to take actions and be heard in sustained manner, so that they can play an active part in building our home."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00439,2020-03-06-T-007,439,Sim Ann,"(In English)  Back to English, Mr Chairman. Volunteerism is an important means of realising our youths' vision of a caring and inclusive society. Everyone has a part to play, not just youths, but seniors, corporates and Government. Let me update on our efforts under each sector."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00440,2020-03-06-T-007,440,Sim Ann,I will start with youth volunteerism.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00441,2020-03-06-T-007,441,Sim Ann,"Last year, YCS launched Programme X – X standing for multiplier – to equip youths to start impactful community projects and lead their peers in turn. Over 400 youths from ITEs, Polytechnics and Universities have taken part in Programme X."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00442,2020-03-06-T-007,442,Sim Ann,"Sky Tai, a student from ITE College West, was one of them. Following the programme, he designed and ran eight weekly arts sessions for seniors at SASCO Home in Hong San together with his teammates. Programme X enabled him to hone his leadership capabilities and deepened his resolve to serve the community. YCS is also working with our SG Cares Volunteer Centres to promote youth volunteerism and grow youth volunteer networks in the neighbourhoods."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00443,2020-03-06-T-007,443,Sim Ann,"Seniors also wish to remain socially active and engaged in their retirement years. To reach out to more pre-retirees at their workplaces, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with RSVP Singapore last year. With the MOU, RSVP aims to reach out to 30,000 seniors in its first year and match them to suitable volunteering opportunities."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00444,2020-03-06-T-007,444,Sim Ann,A new Team Nila Silver Champions Scheme will also provide seniors with regular volunteering opportunities at Active SG Sports Centres. This includes training alongside Team Nila youths to serve as ActiveSG ambassadors to promote sport and exercise together. Seniors will also receive training through SportSG and WSQ courses.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00445,2020-03-06-T-007,445,Sim Ann,"On the corporate volunteerism front, NVPC and ComChest formed a closer partnership last year to help corporates access resources more easily and find better matches to volunteering opportunities. Over 30 corporates have been referred to our SG Cares Volunteer Centres to link up with community organisations for volunteering opportunities."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00446,2020-03-06-T-007,446,Sim Ann,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Henry Kwek asked for an update on our SG Cares Volunteer Centres. Last year, four were established in Kreta Ayer, Toa Payoh, Boon Lay and Woodlands. This year, eight others will be appointed at Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Choa Chu Kang, Clementi, Geylang, Jalan Besar, Tampines and Yishun. Our aim is to establish an SG Cares Volunteer Centre in each town."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00447,2020-03-06-T-007,447,Sim Ann,"As ""community brokers"", our SG Cares Volunteer Centres form partnerships with organisations, such as schools, to channel their volunteers to community organisations in a mutually beneficial way. They also assist community partners with volunteer management, through efforts such as holding joint volunteer training sessions for community partners that may not have the capacity or the know-how to do so."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00448,2020-03-06-T-007,448,Sim Ann,"We have been working closely with several SSAs, such as Loving Heart Multi-Service Centre and Filos Community Services to helm our SG Cares Volunteer Centres in Jurong East and Bedok respectively. Over the past two years, these SSAs forged over a hundred partnerships with corporates, schools and other SSAs. We commend their hard work and invite more community-based organisations to partner us."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00449,2020-03-06-T-007,449,Sim Ann,Care is also manifested by ensuring that spaces are inclusive and providing opportunities for all to enjoy pursuits such as sports. Ms Yip asked about updates to our Disability Sports Master Plan (DSMP). She shared suggestions to expand play opportunities for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and build partnerships to promote inclusivity in sport.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00450,2020-03-06-T-007,450,Sim Ann,"The three key thrusts of the DSMP remain relevant and we are making progress on its recommendations. We currently have eight inclusive and senior-friendly gyms with equipment suitable for use by all, including PWDs. SportSG plans to retrofit three more gyms each year over the next three years. By 2026, all ActiveSG gyms in Singapore will be inclusive and senior-friendly."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00451,2020-03-06-T-007,451,Sim Ann,"We will continue to work with community partners on inclusive programmes. We are expanding events, such as Play Inclusive, an inclusive sports competition, to offer more opportunities for persons of different abilities and special needs to train and compete in sports together. We are also supporting Goalball Singapore to bring sighted and low-vision students to play sports together."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00452,2020-03-06-T-007,452,Sim Ann,"A Communities of Care grant has been introduced to support ideas to uplift the vulnerable and under-served through sport. We are disbursing $600,000 to support 18 community projects and 31 SportCares bursary recipients this year. SSAs are welcome to apply. SportSG also offers guidance to staff of SSAs to introduce inclusive sport activities."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00453,2020-03-06-T-007,453,Sim Ann,We are developing two frameworks to guide Special Education schools and SSAs on cultivating a lifelong enjoyment of physical activities for their students and clients. The adaptive swim framework focuses on teaching basic swimming and water safety competencies and the Fitness 1-2-3 framework focuses on imparting strength and conditioning knowledge.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00454,2020-03-06-T-007,454,Sim Ann,"The DSMP also provides opportunities to participate in High Performance Sports, as Ms Yip suggested. Individuals with potential from ActiveSG and community sports programmes are referred to the Singapore Disability Sport Council and the National Disability Sports Associations for further development and training. The Singapore Sport Institute (SSI) also provides facilities, funding and specialist support for para athletes preparing for major games."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00455,2020-03-06-T-007,455,Sim Ann,I thank Ms Yip for her suggestions to build on the momentum of the DSMP. We will follow up with her on her ideas.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00456,2020-03-06-T-007,456,Sim Ann,"We also want to support our charities and encourage giving through this time when we are all fighting COVID-19 as one. Donations to Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) will continue to be matched via the Bicentennial Community Fund until December 2020, from March 2020 previously."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00457,2020-03-06-T-007,457,Sim Ann,"This year, we are also introducing sector-specific digital solutions for smaller charities to operate more efficiently and more securely. These solutions aim to reduce administrative burdens, improve productivity and provide higher protection against cyber threats. Charities will also receive a digitalisation toolkit to expand their digital knowledge and capabilities."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00458,2020-03-06-T-007,458,Sim Ann,"We are also simplifying the process of searching for charities' information on our charity portal to help donors make informed giving choices. Each charity's profile page, starting with those that are IPCs, will feature information about how well the IPC is governed, for example, its level of regulatory compliance. We will be engaging charities and the public on what information should be shared, and how it can be presented in a useful way later this year."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00459,2020-03-06-T-007,459,Sim Ann,"The giving culture is strong in Singapore, and we want to sustain it and grow it further by encouraging those interested to give through a new national legacy giving initiative, developed in partnership with CFS."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00460,2020-03-06-T-007,460,Sim Ann,"Legacy giving refers to a planned, future gift that designates a portion of a person's assets as a donation to charity. Examples of such assets include cash and insurance policies. Our goal is to foster a giving mindset, where planned gifts to charity become more common and more frequent."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00461,2020-03-06-T-007,461,Sim Ann,"This is not just about bestowing financial assets. Legacy giving also imparts values such as kindness, compassion and generosity, which are far more lasting than assets alone. Acts of care and contribution go a long way, especially in these challenging times."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00462,2020-03-06-T-007,462,Sim Ann,"Mr Chairman, MCCY will continue to pursue partnerships to uplift those in need and nurture an active citizenry. Together, we can build a democracy of deeds as our legacy to future generations."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00463,2020-03-06-T-007,463,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Chairman, the arts, heritage and sports play an important role in making Singapore a vibrant and liveable city. They bring people together, inspire them and root us as Singaporeans."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00464,2020-03-06-T-007,464,Baey Yam Keng,"Earlier, Minister and Senior Minister of State spoke about our efforts to build a home that provides opportunities for all. This is exemplified through the celebration of different pathways to success for our artists and athletes and the nurturing of a vibrant arts and culture ecosystem."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00465,2020-03-06-T-007,465,Baey Yam Keng,"The partnership among the Government, arts patrons and arts community forms the basis of a sustainable arts scene. Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Terence Ho asked how MCCY will support the arts community during COVID-19. We want cultural performances to continue during this time as the arts inspire us and lift our spirits, as long as necessary precautions are in place. This is what MCCY agencies and institutions, including NAC, NHB and PA will commit to, where possible. We also want to encourage arts and culture practitioners to take this opportunity to develop their capabilities and better position themselves for the future. MCCY will therefore set aside around $1.6 million to support the arts and culture sector and to prepare the sector for the post-disease recovery."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00466,2020-03-06-T-007,466,Baey Yam Keng,"MCCY will provide a new 30% subsidy for venue rental and associated costs at our national cultural institutions. including the Esplanade, Arts House Limited venues, and the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre. This subsidy will be for arts and culture activities, including productions and workshops taking place from 7 March, tomorrow, to 30 June."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00467,2020-03-06-T-007,467,Baey Yam Keng,"In addition, NAC will provide a one-time, enhanced capability development grant for individuals and arts organisations, to promote upskilling and organisational capability development. The grant will be open for application from 16 March and will subsidise local courses and programmes."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00468,2020-03-06-T-007,468,Baey Yam Keng,"These two initiatives are part of the Support and Stabilisation Package announced by Deputy Prime Minister in Budget 2020. Arts groups and practitioners, including those who already enjoy subsidised rentals under NAC's arts housing scheme, can benefit from both these initiatives. The package also the new self-employed persons' (SEPs) training support scheme recently unveiled by MOM. Under this, all SEPs will be paid an hourly $7.50 training allowance when attending eligible programmes. NAC will continue working with SkillsFuture Singapore on a curated list of arts and culture courses for arts freelancers. This will complement existing initiatives, like the Arts Resource Hub, which is working with partners to provide shared services in areas like legal and financial matters."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00469,2020-03-06-T-007,469,Baey Yam Keng,"We encourage all eligible arts and culture professionals to tap on the available measures, including subscribing to the Arts Resource Hub, which is free, and prepare themselves for the post-COVID-19 upturn. As Mr Ho suggested, we encourage arts practitioners to support one another during this time."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00470,2020-03-06-T-007,470,Baey Yam Keng,"SportSG is also engaging stakeholders, especially coaches and fitness instructors to use this time to retool and upskill through various courses offered by CoachSG and partner institutions, supported by SkillsFuture Singapore and SkillsFuture Credits. Sports coaches registered with the National Registry of Coaches (NROC) can apply for financial assistance under the Coach Development Grant to attend courses and programmes to upgrade themselves. MOM's SEP training support scheme will also benefit these sports freelancers."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00471,2020-03-06-T-007,471,Baey Yam Keng,"We will also ensure that our arts spaces are effectively used. Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked for an update on the Gillman Barracks Art Cluster. Gillman Barracks provides Singaporeans and tourists access to high quality arts programmes through educational art and history tours, performances, as well as talks and workshops by long-term tenant galleries. This includes the current edition of the Singapore Biennale, which had tours led by seniors and concerts by students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Two successful editions of SEA Focus in 2019 and 2020 also enhanced Gillman Barracks' standing as a locus of Southeast Asian Art."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00472,2020-03-06-T-007,472,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Terence Ho asked if we will provide more shared spaces and resources to bring people together via arts activities. To facilitate networking and to optimise available spaces, arts practitioners will have access to our arts centres. In January, we opened two physical spaces under the Arts Resource Hub at Goodman Arts Centre and Stamford Arts Centre. Plans are underway to have a third physical hub at Waterloo Street by early 2021 that will offer incubation and presentation spaces for arts freelancers."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00473,2020-03-06-T-007,473,Baey Yam Keng,"These plans complement schemes like the Community and Sports Facilities Scheme to provide artists with greater access to spaces. I encourage more arts groups to consider how they can pool their resources. Those with existing facilities, for instance, could share them with others."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00474,2020-03-06-T-007,474,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Chairman, technology will also be used to strengthen our arts eco-system. NAC is collaborating with NLB to develop a National Online Repository of Singapore Arts to facilitate access to information on Singapore arts and deepen the expertise of arts researchers."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00475,2020-03-06-T-007,475,Baey Yam Keng,"This will complement other digital platforms, such as the Cultural Concierge and Offstage, which seek to widen the public's engagement with the arts."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00476,2020-03-06-T-007,476,Baey Yam Keng,Sports also plays a crucial role in strengthening our community bonds.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00477,2020-03-06-T-007,477,Baey Yam Keng,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about our plans for a sporting Singapore. As part of Vision 2030, SportSG is partnering stakeholders to develop a strong sporting culture and grow our standing as a major sporting hub through local and international events, such as the Singapore Rugby 7s, FINA World Cup and the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00478,2020-03-06-T-007,478,Baey Yam Keng,"The GDP contribution of the sports industry has grown steadily, reaching $1.7 billion in 2018. This figure excludes growth areas like sports broadcast, infrastructure projects, sports events and conferences, as well as e-sports, which SportSG, Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Tourism Board and local and international businesses have been seen working together to develop the e-sports scene."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00479,2020-03-06-T-007,479,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Chairman, the Singapore Sports Hub hosted 212 events last year. The precinct has seen increased footfall, with regular activities such as quarterly Community Play Days and a variety of programmes. Like many Singaporeans, we want to see it succeed as the integrated sports and lifestyle destination that we envisioned. Regarding the acquisition of majority stakeholder InfraRed Capital Partners by Sun Life, we recently sought clarification from Sports Hub Private Limited (SHPL) and we have obtained their assurance that this will not have any direct impact on the Sports Hub operations."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00480,2020-03-06-T-007,480,Baey Yam Keng,"We have made our views and expectations known and SHPL agrees that Sports Hub should be a place that all Singaporeans can be proud of. SportSG is in regular communication with their top management and closely monitors performance to ensure that agreed standards for availability of facilities and performance are met. For example, SHPL is required to meet a minimum number of sporting event days at the National Stadium and Singapore Indoor Stadium each year. Where they have not met the standards, they have been held accountable and financial penalties have been imposed. We will continue to monitor and hold SHPL accountable to meet all their contractual obligations to deliver a first class and vibrant sports entertainment and lifestyle hub for all Singaporeans."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00481,2020-03-06-T-007,481,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Darryl David asked how our athletes have fared internationally, how we are supporting our younger elite athletes and athletes who are competing in locations with a high rate of COVID-19 infections. Twenty-nineteen was a busy year for our athletes. I attended the 30th Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines where we fielded 659 athletes and achieved more than 50 gold medals."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00482,2020-03-06-T-007,482,Baey Yam Keng,"On the international stage, shuttler Loh Kean Yew beat two-time Olympics champion Lin Dan to win the Thailand Masters last year, and he defeated the world number two shuttler at the Badminton Asia Team Championships in February. Bowler Cherie Tan made history by becoming the first Singaporean to be named the World Bowling Athlete of the Year by World Bowling last year."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00483,2020-03-06-T-007,483,Baey Yam Keng,"In para sports, swimmer Yip Pin Xiu clinched two medals at the 2019 World Para Swimming Championships while archer Nur Syahidah Alim became the first Singaporean to be named Para Women World Archery Athlete of the Year for 2019."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00484,2020-03-06-T-007,484,Baey Yam Keng,"Looking ahead, we now have more than 10 athletes across six sports who have qualified for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics; and nine para-athletes who have qualified for the Paralympics."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00485,2020-03-06-T-007,485,Baey Yam Keng,"These athletes are supported through the spexScholarship programme or dedicated campaign funding for the games, as well as annual Government funding through the National Sports Associations. Specialised sport science and sport medicine support is also provided to help them achieve their best."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00486,2020-03-06-T-007,486,Baey Yam Keng,"For athletes going overseas, SportSG, together with the Singapore National Olympic Council and the Singapore National Paralympic Council, have developed detailed contingency plans to ensure the safety of our athletes and officials. The contingency plans for Tokyo 2020 are being developed and will include measures and precautions for athletes and officials with regard to COVID-19."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00487,2020-03-06-T-007,487,Baey Yam Keng,"We will also enhance our sporting infrastructure to support our youth athletes. The National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI) satellite facility will move to a bigger facility at the former Police Coast Guard Headquarters, next to the Kallang Basin in April. This will allow NYSI to scale up sport science support for more youth athletes. The new premises will be close to Singapore Sports Institute (SSI) and the Sports Hub where many athletes train, thus providing opportunities for interaction between the junior and senior athletes."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00488,2020-03-06-T-007,488,Baey Yam Keng,Ms Yip Pin Xiu shared that she has seen many athletes face mental pressures from their sport and their daily lives. This also applies to retiring athletes.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00489,2020-03-06-T-007,489,Baey Yam Keng,"To ensure the mental well-being of athletes, the SSI sports psychology team has been equipping our athletes with skills to adjust to life post-competition and a post-sport career. They offer counselling services and a mental health literacy programme, Mind Matters, that helps athletes and coaches identify and understand mental well-being issues as well as when and how to seek help. We note Ms Yip Pin Xiu's comment on the programme's limited reach. SSI is working to expand the reach of this programme to benefit more athletes as well as partners under the spexBusiness network to offer professional development support and opportunities for retiring athletes."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00490,2020-03-06-T-007,490,Baey Yam Keng,"Our athletes can also look out for one another. I encourage our retired athletes and veterans to take the lead to build circles of support, lend a listening ear, offer advice and help one another."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00491,2020-03-06-T-007,491,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked about our plans for the Singapore national football team qualifying for World Cup 2034. The Government does not interfere with the management of our National Sports Associations, including the Football Association of Singapore (FAS). We were briefed by FAS on the plans for Goal 2034 and have given FAS feedback. We look forward to hearing back from them on their plans and how we can best support them."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00492,2020-03-06-T-007,492,Baey Yam Keng,"Supporting our athletes and artists is a shared endeavour. We have funds to encourage private and corporate philanthropy for the arts and sports, reinforcing the Singapore Together movement. Mr Terence Ho and Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked about the Cultural Matching Fund (CMF) and One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF) respectively."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00493,2020-03-06-T-007,493,Baey Yam Keng,"Since it was set up in 2013, the Cultural Matching Fund has benefited over 100 arts and heritage charities through one-for-one matching to over $215 million of private donations."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00494,2020-03-06-T-007,494,Baey Yam Keng,"We recognise that smaller arts groups may need more help as they lack strong fundraising capabilities. We will help these groups with the new Sustain The ARTs Fund, or stART Fund for short. This fund will bring together donations from corporations and individuals, which will be matched by CMF where eligible, to support small arts groups in developing robust governance structures and attaining charity and eventually Institutions of a Public Character (IPC) status as well as programming. Over the coming three years till 2022, NAC plans to build the stART Fund to $10 million, which aims to support about 100 arts groups. All eligible donations will receive prevailing tax deductions. Interested donors can reach out to NAC."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00495,2020-03-06-T-007,495,Baey Yam Keng,"In the sports arena, the One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF) complements the Government's investment in the high performance sports system by allowing individuals and corporates to make cash donations. The Government has set aside $50 million to match cash donations to encourage more to step forward. We wish to clarify that similar to other Government matching funds, the OTSF does not provide matching for commercial arrangements like sponsorships as the fund aims to encourage philanthropy to sport."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00496,2020-03-06-T-007,496,Baey Yam Keng,"But we are mindful that there are athletes outside the high performance sports system such as our indoor skydivers, national dodgeball and tchoukball squads who have done well in internationally. We want to support their aspirations. So, with support from Temasek Foundation, $100,000 will be set aside annually for a Temasek Foundation Inspire Fund for Athletes that will provide campaign funding for such athletes. More details will be announced in the coming months."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00497,2020-03-06-T-007,497,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Chairman, I have spoken about how we are supporting our artists and athletes. Our efforts cannot stop here."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00498,2020-03-06-T-007,498,Baey Yam Keng,"We agree with Mr Lee Yi Shyan that arts and culture should be accessible to Singaporeans. Since 2012, we have established 21 arts and culture nodes across the island to provide quality arts programmes in our neighbourhoods. Through programmes such as PAssion Arts, Arts in Your Neighbourhood and Artseen, we have co-designed community arts programming with the community and other partners. We have also brought arts and culture outside the confines of concert halls and museums and into public spaces during events such as the Istana open house. Through NAC's Silver Arts Programme, we have arts programmes designed for seniors."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00499,2020-03-06-T-007,499,Baey Yam Keng,"To provide youths with opportunities to showcase their creative talent and energy, NAC has partnered *SCAPE to roll out the BUSKING@*SCAPE programme. Under this programme, Singaporeans between 15 to 35 years old are not required to go through auditions or be endorsed under NAC's Busking Scheme. Instead, they can register for time slots to busk at the prominent *SCAPE front-of-house which faces Orchard Cineleisure. The scheme was piloted from October last year. To date, more than 60 young buskers have showcased their talents."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00500,2020-03-06-T-007,500,Baey Yam Keng,"To provide buskers with greater access to spaces, NAC will gradually introduce the concept of busking zones at Singapore River and Ang Mo Kio from April this year. Each zone comprises a cluster of busking locations, allowing buskers the flexibility to move between them. This offers a more varied busking experience for audiences and ensures equitable access to popular busking spots."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00501,2020-03-06-T-007,501,Baey Yam Keng,"NAC will continue to engage venue partners and the busking community to review busking locations, manage busking activities and co-develop suitable programmes. I hope my fellow members will also offer your constituencies for buskers to perform."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00502,2020-03-06-T-007,502,Baey Yam Keng,"NAC will also develop a digital scheduling tool for buskers to pre-book their performance slots. With this, members of the public and venue partners can look forward to more vibrant spaces and a diverse busking calendar."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00503,2020-03-06-T-007,503,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Darryl David asked about community engagement efforts to safeguard our cultural heritage. We will do this in partnership with the community, through public education and outreach, research and documentation. This year, there are two highlights – the Stewards of Singapore's Intangible Cultural Heritage Award and the outcome of the UNESCO Hawker Culture in Singapore nomination in December."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00504,2020-03-06-T-007,504,Baey Yam Keng,"The safeguarding, promotion and transmission of our intangible cultural heritage (ICH) will not be possible without the contributions of our ICH practitioners. These individuals will be honoured at the inaugural Stewards of Singapore's Intangible Cultural Heritage Award ceremony held in conjunction with Singapore Heritage Festival this year."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00505,2020-03-06-T-007,505,Baey Yam Keng,"Over the past year, we were heartened by the strong support from the community for our UNESCO Hawker Culture in Singapore nomination. We will continue to strengthen community support through platforms such as the Singapore Heritage Festival, community events and travelling exhibitions to schools to celebrate our hawker culture. We are lucky to have hawkers who continue to work tirelessly to serve Singaporeans amid this COVID-19 period."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00506,2020-03-06-T-007,506,Baey Yam Keng,"Beyond shared stories, traditions and practices that are passed on from generation to generation, our heritage is also embodied in historical buildings and neighbourhood icons. We will partner local shop owners within Singapore's historic precincts to co-create Street Corner Heritage Galleries and highlight heritage right in our neighbourhoods."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00507,2020-03-06-T-007,507,Baey Yam Keng,"NHB museums, heritage institutions and community galleries will partner local shop owners to create ""mini museums"" within their shops to showcase their history and heritage, trades and products through information panels, displays of historical documents, photographs and artefacts. The Street Corner Heritage Galleries may also develop programmes, such as tours and workshops, and participate in events such as Singapore Heritage Festival and the respective Culture Festivals of the heritage institutions."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00508,2020-03-06-T-007,508,Baey Yam Keng,"Balestier will be the first precinct, with five Street Corner Heritage Galleries opening to the public from tomorrow. Loong Fatt Tau Sar Piah along Balestier Road will host one such gallery. With a history dating back to 1948, visitors to the family-run business can watch the stallholders mould the dough, stuff with mung bean filling and bake using traditional gas-fired ovens. We have prepared some tau sar piah for tea later."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00509,2020-03-06-T-007,509,Baey Yam Keng,"By 2022, there will be Street Corner Heritage Galleries in four other historic precincts – Kampong Gelam, Kreta Ayer, Little India and Geylang Serai. These places will serve as reminders of our living heritage and anchor our memories as we move into the future together. Mr Chairman, I will continue in Mandarin, please."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00510,2020-03-06-T-007,510,Baey Yam Keng,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Singapore's rich history and diverse heritage belongs to every Singaporean. To sustain a culturally vibrant Singapore, it is important that we safeguard and promote our nation's rich and diverse intangible cultural heritage, as this defines our identity as Singaporeans and it is a duty we must fulfil. Beyond our shared stories and knowledge, our heritage is also embodied in our neighbourhood icons. In order to bring our heritage to neighbourhoods where we live and play, museums, heritage institutions and community galleries operated by NHB will partner local shop owners to co-create Street Corner Heritage Galleries. These local shops will function as ""mini museums"" to showcase their history and heritage, trades and products through displays of historical documents, photographs and artefacts. We hope to encourage people to appreciate the heritage embodied in their daily lives through the lens of our heartlands."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00511,2020-03-06-T-007,511,Baey Yam Keng,"While our efforts to preserve and promote our intangible cultural heritage are ongoing, we have also diligently planned for the future by working on the succession of our heritage. There are risks threatening our local cultural heritage, traditional skills and craft, such as a lack of awareness or lack of interest in learning and passing them down. Through the inaugural Stewards of Singapore's Intangible Cultural Heritage Award which will be held this year, we hope to acknowledge the recipients' contributions and encourage them to continue safeguarding and transmitting intangible cultural heritage in their respective fields to the next generation. Over the past year, we have been heartened to see strong support from the community for our UNESCO Hawker Culture in Singapore nomination. In the coming year, we will continue to build community support through different platforms to celebrate our Hawker Culture. We will continue to safeguard and promote our intangible cultural heritage through different channels and plans, ensuring that more Singaporeans may come to understand and appreciate it."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00512,2020-03-06-T-007,512,Baey Yam Keng,"(In English)  Mr Chairman, at MCCY, we are committed to providing opportunities for all, growing a democracy of deeds and nurturing a vibrant home. Our work covers a wide range of areas – arts, heritage, youth, sports, community relations and the strengthening of a giving culture. At its heart, our efforts seek to make Singapore a caring, cohesive and confident nation."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00513,2020-03-06-T-007,513,Baey Yam Keng,There is much we can achieve by working hand-in-hand and by encouraging individuals and groups to come together for the common good. Let us continue to celebrate our collective achievements and build a shared future together.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00514,2020-03-06-T-007,514,,Clarifications. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00515,2020-03-06-T-007,515,Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Sir. I have five supplementary questions. I am very happy that this time Yishun is being mentioned by Minister. 我们终于榜上有名."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00516,2020-03-06-T-007,516,,Yishun is always mentioned all the time. [
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00517,2020-03-06-T-007,517,Lee Bee Wah,"My question is  what is budget for this Yishun Sports Complex project. I hope if it is not as gorgeous as One Tampines Hub, at least it is something comparable to our neighbour, Sembawang Integrated Hub."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00518,2020-03-06-T-007,518,Lee Bee Wah,"Question number two, a master plan to grow the sports industry was developed during 2005 to 2010 thereby resulting in positive outcomes. It was developed with EDB, STB and so on. I would like to ask what is the progress of this master plan to build upon the past success, activate from a huge investment of the sports hub and capitalise on the new opportunities that exist in our shores."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00519,2020-03-06-T-007,519,Lee Bee Wah,"And the third question, with the substantial monthly unitary payment paid by Government to Sports Hub Private Limited versus Sports Hub's contractual performance and ability to meet the expectation of Singaporeans, do you believe that this national icon is value-for-money so far? Please explain your rationale."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00520,2020-03-06-T-007,520,Lee Bee Wah,"Question four, according to existing and potential hirers —"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00521,2020-03-06-T-007,521,,Is that a clarification or a question?
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00522,2020-03-06-T-007,522,Lee Bee Wah,"Yes, the clarification is that there is a lack of event in the Sports Hub calendar that attribute to the high rental cost and high variable cost, according to the industry feedback. Has Sports Singapore spoken to this group of stakeholders – that means those who wanted to rent the place – and conduct a benchmarking to assess whether the pricing charged by Sports Hub, is it fair or not?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00523,2020-03-06-T-007,523,Lee Bee Wah,"And last question, what is the role of ActiveSG? Is it to generate and encourage mass participation at the grassroots level? If so, then why is ActiveSG stepping into the arena of elite sports? Example of this include football where ActiveSG is running elite programmes and also in tennis, where ActiveSG is running at elite academy with Voyager from Australia. These programmes undermine the role of the respective NSAs. So, why is ActiveSG involved in this?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00524,2020-03-06-T-007,524,Baey Yam Keng,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about the sports industry. SportSG Vision 2030 seeks to inspire Singaporeans to live better through sports and as part of the eco-system there is indeed the industry's contribution to economy, as a culture of sports in Singapore. So, there are various platforms and initiatives including ActiveSG as the national movement of sports to engage our people and rally the nation, facilitate the master plan."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00525,2020-03-06-T-007,525,Baey Yam Keng,"But you must also take note that the sports industry is also an evolving landscape. There are many new interesting developments in sports, like we mentioned e-sports. We have recently set up the National E-sports Association. That is also in response to the interest among young people, interest among the corporates, local and international businesses. So, we will continue to monitor the emerging trends in sports."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00526,2020-03-06-T-007,526,Baey Yam Keng,"So, for example, sports development in Asia, its growing interest with China's growth as a global sports power, in the manufacture of sporting goods and the foray of Chinese companies into sports enterprises. So, we are looking into such opportunities for Singapore arising from these trends into developing an eco-system that can support sports business development and how we can further leverage on SportSG infrastructure and assets to nurture a market place for ideas and innovations with stakeholders."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00527,2020-03-06-T-007,527,Baey Yam Keng,"At Sports Hub, there is a commercial contract that we have with SHPL. So, as mentioned, there are deliverables, there are penalties that are part of the contract. So, they have been taken to task over areas where they have not met the KPIs and we are in continuous discussion with them, monitoring their performance and having their assurance that they are committed to building a sports hub, as what we envisaged."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00528,2020-03-06-T-007,528,Baey Yam Keng,I would like to see that Sports Hub will have value-for-money for Singapore. It is our national sports icon and we hope that Singaporeans would also participate in activities at the Sports Hub to help build a strong sporting culture for Singapore.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00529,2020-03-06-T-007,529,Baey Yam Keng,ActiveSG's role is to promote the sporting culture. Member asked about the academies in football and tennis. These are academies' initiatives and programmes that SportSG initiated to bring sports to more people but working closely with the respective National Sports Associations.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00530,2020-03-06-T-007,530,Baey Yam Keng,"I do not think it is a fair statement to say that when you have renowned or very established coaches involved in the academy, it means that it is just elite sports and, therefore, it is at the expense of high performance sports training and development. I do not think mass or public sports should be denied good coaches, people who have the ability to bring the sports to a higher level and also to cultivate interest among especially young people."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00531,2020-03-06-T-007,531,,Dr Lim Wee Kiak.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00532,2020-03-06-T-007,532,Lim Wee Kiak,"I have two clarifications. One for Minister is regarding our submission of the hawker culture to UNESCO for this December. We are all eagerly waiting for the results. Can I ask the Minister what are our chances of getting this as well as what can we do now, as Singapore together, to increase our chances?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00533,2020-03-06-T-007,533,Lim Wee Kiak,"The second clarification is on the ActiveSG Credits – whether MCCY will be considering topping of the ActiveSG Credit. Because some of my residents have used up their credit and they are looking forward to the Sembawang Integrated Sports Hub which is now called Bukit Canberra, just mentioned by Er Lee Bee Wah just now. They are hoping that they can use their credit there."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00534,2020-03-06-T-007,534,Lim Wee Kiak,"I am very happy to hear that those above 65 now will have free admission to the gyms as well as the swimming pool. But why 65? Can MCCY bring it lower, to 50? Because exercising early, from the doctor's point of view, is important for health."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00535,2020-03-06-T-007,535,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The question on hawker culture, the process now is in the hands of UNESCO. To be very frank, they will go through their internal assessment. There is nothing we can do as a country to influence or affect the process. But I think there is a lot that Singaporeans can do to continue to support hawkers and hawker culture in Singapore. Many of them deserve our support, whether it is by patronising them or showcasing them or just giving them the kind of exposure that they so deserve. When there is good food, I am sure we will tell each other about it. So, continue to support and give them good business."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00536,2020-03-06-T-007,536,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I think we are also trying to, in a way, make our hawker centres a lot cleaner, particularly in this period of time. That is also an important part of hawker culture – it is not just the food but also the place. How do we have a new standard of public eating spaces in our hawker centres? So, it is also something that Singaporeans should think about."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00537,2020-03-06-T-007,537,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The second question about Active SG Credit, we had hoped the free admission will have addressed the Member's request. But I think why 65 – we thought that is a good age, timing with how we see our lives, getting into retirement age and having more time on your hands. It is really a good time to get into an active lifestyle and we hope that ActiveSG gym and swimming pool will be part of the lives of those 65 and above."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00538,2020-03-06-T-007,538,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In general, I think we are looking at ways to encourage Singaporeans to adopt an active lifestyle. When they are young, we are doing as much as we can in the schools, starting this time round, as you can see, our efforts will go into the pre-school sector, getting the teachers involved, getting the programme instituted at the pre-school level, and also getting the parents at the pre-schools involved as well."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00539,2020-03-06-T-007,539,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, it is really to try to work along the wide range of ages to access sport opportunities, with customised and appropriate measures for each age range."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00540,2020-03-06-T-007,540,,"Yes, Mr Alex Yam."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00541,2020-03-06-T-007,541,Alex Yam,"Chairman, I have four supplementary questions."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00542,2020-03-06-T-007,542,Alex Yam,The first one on the Orchard Youth Belt which I believe Senior Minister of State Sim Ann said that Senior Parliamentary Secretary would mention. I am not so sure I caught that part of the answer. Will there be delays because of the current economic situation and what are the broad plans forward?
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00543,2020-03-06-T-007,543,Alex Yam,"In relation to sports, again to the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, yesterday there was quite a stark commentary on the state of sports in The New Paper, written by Leonard Thomas. I echo some of his concerns. I would like to ask what are the plans that SportSG and the Ministry have to increase attendance at sports events, especially for competitive sports, and to raise the support level overall, especially for our traditional sports?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00544,2020-03-06-T-007,544,Alex Yam,"I also heard the Senior Parliamentary Secretary say earlier that Ministry and the SportSG does not interfere in the running of the NSAs. Leonard also mentioned in his article that, and I quote, ""I can't help but feel some undercurrent of distrust between NSAs and SportSG."" So, I would like to ask what is the type of oversight that SportSG has over the NSAs, especially over drafting of their constitutions, rules and regulations on elections and renewal of their management committees."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00545,2020-03-06-T-007,545,Baey Yam Keng,"On the Somerset Belt, last year we went through a long process, engaging many youths on developing a master plan for the Somerset Belt as a place where youths can gather, realise their aspirations. We have completed the work. We were planning to announce it a few weeks ago. But because of the COVID-19 situation, we thought that it may not be a good thing to have that kind of announcement. So, we are planning for some time later this month."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00546,2020-03-06-T-007,546,Baey Yam Keng,"Following that, we will also be doing some pilots for the type of programming, activities that would rejuvenate the Somerset Belt; programmes that are relevant and interesting for young people throughout the year. So, it is an evolving plan and we look forward to more youth engagement and participation to help us further develop and realise the master plan."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00547,2020-03-06-T-007,547,Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Yam also asked about how we could increase the interest of the public in competitive sport events, especially with the attendance numbers. I think that is where we would first like to develop a strong sporting and interest in sports, as a whole, as a nation."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00548,2020-03-06-T-007,548,Baey Yam Keng,"For specific events, we will then have to work closely with the event organiser or the respective NSAs on how to make their sports spectator experience a meaningful and interesting one."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00549,2020-03-06-T-007,549,Baey Yam Keng,"SportSG has worked at the national-level events, to institute a certain format of the venue atmosphere in terms of how athletes are introduced as they enter the courts or the match venue, in terms of the results announcement, and medal presentation – these have all helped to make it look more professional and also sustain the interest among public."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00550,2020-03-06-T-007,550,Baey Yam Keng,"We also work with the schools because a lot of the students do enjoy the sporting competitions at the school level. So, we hope that we will continue to be able to work on this to make it such that going to sports, cheering for athletes would become a way of life for many of our Singaporeans."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00551,2020-03-06-T-007,551,Baey Yam Keng,"As to the relationship between Sport SG and NSAs in areas where Sport SG provides funding for the NSAs to roll out their respective programmes, I think that is where we have the biggest interest because we are using public money, taxpayers' money for sport NSAs."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00552,2020-03-06-T-007,552,Baey Yam Keng,"Therefore, things like governance where it is not reflected in the constitution or where there is a lack of rules and regulations or by-laws that does not assure the Government of a structure to make ensure proper accountability, that is where Sports SG will take a keen interest and even direct certain changes in the NSAs."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00553,2020-03-06-T-007,553,Baey Yam Keng,"As to the other programmes, we would leave it to the NSAs to set the targets, to roll out the programmes as long as it is beneficial for the sports scene. In areas where public money is concerned, we would definitely take a much closer look."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00554,2020-03-06-T-007,554,,Ms Anthea Ong.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00555,2020-03-06-T-007,555,Anthea Ong,"Thank you, Chairman. Could I ask the Minister to elaborate her response to my cut on OSF. On behalf of the many ground-ups, the many community builders, they would like to know if the Ministry would be keen to review OSF in the three areas that I mentioned earlier."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00556,2020-03-06-T-007,556,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I would like to thank Ms Anthea Ong for their suggestions. Like we do here, we always listen to suggestions from Members carefully, and I am sure we will go back and take in these suggestions as we review the scheme."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00557,2020-03-06-T-007,557,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Having said that, OSF is a fund that will encourage as many ground-up projects and groups as much as possible. So, the structure is set low, with low hurdles so that it is easy to get but the amount generally is kept low – for a purpose because we want to encourage as many as possible to access the funds."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00558,2020-03-06-T-007,558,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"If we were to have it for multiple years of a much larger sum of funds, then obviously I think the Member would appreciate that with the importance of being a custodian of Government funds, we would then impose more rules."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00559,2020-03-06-T-007,559,Grace Fu Hai Yien,MCCY is also in the process of harmonising the rules of the grants. We are bringing several grants under the Government – not just MCCY but over several Ministries – under one umbrella. That is really to address some of these issues that the Member and Mr Irshad have raised earlier on about having to go to multiple agencies.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00560,2020-03-06-T-007,560,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I would also like to explain that while OSF is the place to go to for Singaporeans if they want to start a ground-up or a new project, we are really not the domain experts for many of these projects. Very often if the project is going to take a longer life, if we are going to invest more time and effort into expanding or deepening the project, then it is inevitable that we have to rope in our sister agencies or Ministries to take a look on the efficacy of the project."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00561,2020-03-06-T-007,561,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, I would like to urge Members to bear with us when you see bureaucracy. We want to keep it as simple as possible. But if the project requires more funding over a longer period of time, I think it is only reasonable to expect more questions and more KPIs."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00562,2020-03-06-T-007,562,,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00563,2020-03-06-T-007,563,Sitoh Yih Pin,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, I need to declare my interest as the immediate past President of the Singapore Wushu, Dragon and Lion Dance Federation. But my question is not on that. My question specifically is on football. ["
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00564,2020-03-06-T-007,564,Sitoh Yih Pin,"I hear the Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned about FAS' Goal 2034 and he mentioned that Government does not interfere in NSAs and you appeared to say that the ball is in FAS' court. I think Goal 2034 – as a football fan myself and like many Singaporeans here – I find it awesome and most inspiring and I think many Singaporeans do look forward to the even to the old days where we can go back to the Kallang Stadium for the Kallang Roar. So, may I ask what is MCCY's position on Goal 2034? Whether you are supporting it and if so, how are you supporting it?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00565,2020-03-06-T-007,565,Baey Yam Keng,"Goal 2034 is a goal set by FAS. It is not a goal set by the Government. So, the role of the Government is to support NSAs where possible. We have asked FAS for a briefing on how they aim to achieve the goal. We are in a discussion and we have given some inputs that they may want to look at their mid-term and long-term development plans for youths in order to achieve Goal 2034."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00566,2020-03-06-T-007,566,Baey Yam Keng,I understand that FAS has taken the feedback and they are in the midst of talking to other stakeholders to further refine this vision. We look forward to FAS sharing plans on how it would achieve or aim to achieve Goal 2034.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00567,2020-03-06-T-007,567,,Ms Yip Pin Xiu.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00568,2020-03-06-T-007,568,Yip Pin Xiu,"Thank you. I have three clarifications. The first one is with regard to the cut on mental health for athletes. Is it possible to consider having a trained clinical psychologist in the picture because some issues need a bit more than counselling or just general programme. And sometimes athletes need these professionals to also understand high-performance sports. So, it might be a bit harder for them to go outside and seek help."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00569,2020-03-06-T-007,569,Yip Pin Xiu,"Next, on the One Team Singapore funding, I understand that the Ministry wants to encourage philanthropy towards sports. However, is it also possible if a programme can be developed for corporates to see the value and potential in sports so that they can possibly allow sports in Singapore to thrive and be a bit more sustainable."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00570,2020-03-06-T-007,570,Yip Pin Xiu,"And lastly, referring back to my cut, is it possible for Sports Singapore to set up a challenge fund for NSA integrations for those NSAs that have already raised interest?"
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00571,2020-03-06-T-007,571,Baey Yam Keng,"I thank Ms Yip for her suggestions. On how we can better improve the mental well-being support for athletes or retired athletes, she suggested having a clinical psychologist to be part of the team to provide such services. Let us discuss with the team to see how we can further enhance the expertise so that our athletes can benefit from that kind of services. I thank her for that."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00572,2020-03-06-T-007,572,Baey Yam Keng,"As for how we can help NSAs to develop fund-raising capabilities, beyond sponsorships, I think that is a key area of expertise that we would also like to see in our NSAs. Not only NSAs, our arts groups as well to have the ability to look for and retain their sponsors, their donors and how to promote philanthropy for their sector as a whole. So, our funds, CMF or OTSF is just a catalyst to encourage that and we would look at how we can provide more support to enable our NSAs to develop that kind of capability. The Member had one more."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00573,2020-03-06-T-007,573,Yip Pin Xiu,NSA integration.
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00574,2020-03-06-T-007,574,Baey Yam Keng,"Integration. Yes, integration between the main sports and the para sports. I think the challenge fund is something we could look into to promote integration. Ultimately, it is up to the respective associations, whether they want to work together, and I know that sometimes they also take guidance from their International Federations. But we would pay more attention to this."
2020-03-06-T-007-S-00575,2020-03-06-T-007,575,,"Dr Lim Wee Kiat, would you like to withdraw your amendment?"

2020-03-06-T-009-S-00613,2020-03-06-T-009,613,Indranee Rajah,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2020-03-06-T-009-S-00614,2020-03-06-T-009,614,Indranee Rajah,[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed. (proc text)]
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00615,2020-03-06-T-010,615,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, it has been an eventful start of the year, with Singapore battling the COVID-19 outbreak. It is through such difficult times that we prove our mettle as a nation and as a people."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00616,2020-03-06-T-010,616,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Government's response to the crisis has been swift. Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced a $4 billion package to cushion the near-term uncertainties caused by COVID-19. Various Ministries have detailed how they are introducing measures to mitigate the impact to their respective sectors. It has been a defining element in the Budget 2020 debate. The fact that this Government has sufficient financial resources, accumulated through financial prudence, was not lost on the Members. Neither was the call for all segments of the society to play an active part as Team Singapore in riding out the challenge."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00617,2020-03-06-T-010,617,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Indeed, many stakeholders came together to deliver help. For instance, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) acted quickly to form the Tourism Recovery Action Task Force, comprising tourism leaders from the private and public sectors to map out recovery strategies. MOM, MOT, MTI, NTUC and MCCY will roll out measures to help self-employed persons of multiple sectors, including allowance for training."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00618,2020-03-06-T-010,618,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The COVID-19 outbreak may have generated fear and anxiety among Singaporeans but it has also shown our community at its best. We have heard about the numerous ground-up, spontaneous acts of care. Mr Liang Eng Hwa shared how larger businesses are stepping up to help smaller ones tide through this crisis, while the SG Cares Volunteer Centres brought community groups and resourceful corporations along to reach out to vulnerable groups. These efforts exemplify the strong community spirit in Singapore today."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00619,2020-03-06-T-010,619,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Dr Koh Poh Koon and Mr Teo Ser Luck rightly pointed out that in times of crisis, come opportunity. Some Members, such as Prof Yaacob Ibrahim, have called for Singapore to take stock and reflect on how we can be better versions of ourselves as a response to the challenge. Many of our industries and businesses appreciate the need to transform so they are better prepared to deal with the next disruption. Members like Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked that we also build up Singapore's civic spirit, psychological defence and social cohesion so that we emerge from this crisis stronger as a nation."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00620,2020-03-06-T-010,620,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Even as we are occupied with the challenges of the present, we have our eyes firmly on the long-term issues. Many Members spoke passionately on ensuring Singapore's competitiveness and relevance in a fast-changing world. Mr Lim Swee Say reminded us that our common goal is to generate sufficient resources to improve the lives of all our people. This is evidenced by the large number of questions received by MOE and MOM on education and training for Singaporeans, pipping even MOH despite the current public health situation."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00621,2020-03-06-T-010,621,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Singapore's current and future challenges will be increasingly complex and unexpected. If we harness the diverse strengths of Singaporeans and work together as one, just as we are doing with COVID-19, we can turn our challenges into opportunities, our problems into possibilities. We can build a future Singapore that we and those after us can be proud of. This is the essence of Singapore Together. The debates in the past few days have presented us with long-term challenges – how to age well, how to uplift the disadvantaged, how to build a climate resilient nation and so on. To tackle them, we must partner to build our Singapore together."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00622,2020-03-06-T-010,622,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, I am heartened to hear the theme of partnerships come through strongly in our debates. The momentum is clear. Singaporeans can and want to play a bigger role in shaping Singapore. Government agencies will be opening up many more opportunities for Singaporeans from all walks of life and all segments of the society. We will co-create and co-deliver initiatives to make Singapore a resilient nation, a city of possibilities, a society with opportunities for all and a caring and cohesive community. Let me review each of them."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00623,2020-03-06-T-010,623,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"First, a resilient nation in the face of global disruptions. Members agree that it is critical we remain nimble. Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Ong Teng Koon spoke about the opportunities and challenges caused by the rise of the digital economy. To this end, MCI shared how its community partners are helping Singaporeans and our SMEs build digital skills. Mr Dennis Tan and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah highlighted the dangers of climate change. As part of its response, MEWR is catalysing citizen-led initiatives to address our sustainability challenges through its two Citizens' Workgroups. And might I say, the youths are also very passionate about this aspect."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00624,2020-03-06-T-010,624,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Second, a city of possibilities. Singapore should continue to be an attractive place to live, work and play. Mr Douglas Foo and Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar highlighted more can be done to ensure Singaporeans' continued employability and relevance for the future. Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Zainal Sapari spoke passionately on harnessing the resources of our mid-career workers – those in their 40s and 50s. To give Singaporeans a good head start and realise their full potential through their careers, MOE and MOM are working with industry leaders, private training providers and professionals to scale up their respective SkillsFuture programmes and Mid-Career Support Package."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00625,2020-03-06-T-010,625,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Responding to Mr Arasu Duraisamy's and Mr Saktiandi Supaat's queries on the future of our cityscape, MND spoke about plans to partner Singaporeans to re-design, redevelop and rejuvenate Singapore. In the digital realm, Mr Vikram Nair and Ms Tin Pei Ling painted a vision of a Smart Nation with citizens at its centre and PMO shared how Singaporeans can be involved in the entire process of building our Smart Nation, from conceptualising to deploying digital products and services."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00626,2020-03-06-T-010,626,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Third, a society with opportunities for all. Members like Mr Ang Wei Neng, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, Miss Cheryl Chan and Ms Rahayu Mahzam agree that we want to create a society with more opportunities for all, whether for children and youths in disadvantaged families, persons with special needs, or working mothers who shoulder a disproportionate amount of care-taking responsibilities. As Ms Denise Phua put it, our social challenges need to be tackled together, and the community's role is crucial in ensuring no one falls through the cracks. MOE and MSF shared how they are working with corporates, individuals and community stakeholders to co-create and deliver services that will strengthen our social support for disadvantaged groups through the UPLIFT programme, and allow all Singaporeans to participate fully as contributing members of society."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00627,2020-03-06-T-010,627,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Fourth, a caring and cohesive community. In light of growing polarisation around the world, we need to show regard and respect for one another regardless of our differences and build a cohesive community with a shared identity. The Government will work with Singaporeans on this journey. Ms Anthea Ong's and Mr Murali Pillai's calls to focus on mental health were answered by MSF, which is working with interested Singaporeans in the Youth Mental Well-being Action Group. My Ministry also agrees with Mr Pritam Singh that more can be done for the integration of new citizens, and we will be partnering citizens to co-create content for the Singapore Citizenship Journey, so that new citizens share the same understanding of what it means to be Singaporean."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00628,2020-03-06-T-010,628,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, I wish to conclude the debate by thanking all Members for their active participation over the past weeks. On behalf of the House, I would also like to thank you, Mr Speaker, and your deputies for your able stewardship of the debate proceedings. I also thank the Parliament Secretariat and staff for their dedicated assistance and responses to our requests and queries, particularly those who took our temperatures and kept our premises clean, and the interpreters who were with us every step of this debate. Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. [Applause.]"
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00629,2020-03-06-T-010,629,Speaker,"A year ago, we had an extensive conversation about cows, and a particular sacred cow, to be precise. We debated till the cows came home, we milked the issue to death and we slayed the creature good and proper. You would have thought that, that was done."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00630,2020-03-06-T-010,630,Speaker,"But, guess what? I do not know if you have noticed but the cow is back again this year."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00631,2020-03-06-T-010,631,Speaker,"This time, it sneaked into the MEWR's Committee of Supply (COS) in the guise of a ""fake cow"". Minister Masagos Zulkifli brought it in. We learnt from him – Minister Masagos Zulkifli, not the cow – about how critical it is to have food sustainability amidst climate change and why novel foods may play a big part in this effort."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00632,2020-03-06-T-010,632,Speaker,"Last year's cow was called ""PSLE Streaming"". This time, it is called ""Impossible Meat"" – and we even sampled it in the form of satay and gyoza, which was really quite delicious. But did we stop at cows? No. We had the whole Mandai Zoo, River Safari and Jurong Bird Park here as well. MEWR introduced us to cell-cultured shrimps from the local start-up, Shiok Meats. We learnt about barramundis from Barramundi Asia, Singapore's first and only deep sea fish farm. But could all these be our future source of protein?"
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00633,2020-03-06-T-010,633,Speaker,"MEWR then talked about mosquitoes with names like Aedes mosquitoes and Wolbachia as we are reminded to stay vigilant in our war against dengue. Then, came the cats, and the pet birds and dogs during MND's Committee of Supply (COS)."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00634,2020-03-06-T-010,634,Speaker,"And then, MOT came on board as well, addressed the concerns about the Raffles Banded Langurs – not just any monkeys but Langurs named Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael. So, in an indirect way, turtles of the Ninja genus were also dragged into the conversation as well."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00635,2020-03-06-T-010,635,Speaker,"All these creatures were raised not for any trivial reasons. Some revolved around our survival in a time of possible food disruption. Some were about disease management and its sometimes fatal impact on our people. Some were discussed in terms of our common space with pets and how we treat animals in our society. And some were discussed in the context of how we must try to be sensitive to our environment and nature, amidst development. Langurs may not mean very much to many Singaporeans – perhaps it should – but it means a great deal to Dr Andie Ang and her team who are working closely with LTA on the local habitat concerned."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00636,2020-03-06-T-010,636,Speaker,"All these are just small slivers of a bigger whole. So very much goes on without many of us realising it. I think an opportunity to debate and discuss this in Parliament reminds us of how much goes on out there, every day. Nothing is too trivial not to be addressed. My Deputy Speakers and I had the privilege of enduring all your speeches in the last few weeks. I make no apologies for the use of that term. Why? Because it can be substantive and heavy; and it represents an even larger body of work that exists out there in the Ministries and agencies as they seek to make life better for all of us."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00637,2020-03-06-T-010,637,Speaker,"People often ask me to view this video clip or other from other parliaments. Some are the fighting ones which are very exciting. You can go and watch it but do not get ideas. Others are most eloquent, humorous, sharply satirical – impressive. But I then ask myself, after watching then, ""So, therefore... and what is next? So, what then do we do?"""
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00638,2020-03-06-T-010,638,Speaker,"Words can flow like honey, music to the ears but they must be real. They set in motion the journey from words to deeds. For that to happen, we need processes, specific initiatives, mechanisms, effective delivery for good to take place. It is really quite some distance to travel from ideas and rhetoric to reality."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00639,2020-03-06-T-010,639,Speaker,"Today, we are often seized by form and style. But how to get things done way less exciting, much less glamorous."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00640,2020-03-06-T-010,640,Speaker,"So, it is challenging to sit through all these, but it is the least we can do to honour the effort and hard work put in by so many."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00641,2020-03-06-T-010,641,Speaker,The Budget is the blueprint from which we build our future.
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00642,2020-03-06-T-010,642,Speaker,"To be honest, many do not actually watch the clips of every speaker here, read their speeches and the responses but we are definitely very quick to comment! So, do give it a shot because they can be quite educational and give us a sense of how we intend to address the concerns that are out there. They also show us how we can realise our vision of the kind of Singapore we want to build together."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00643,2020-03-06-T-010,643,Speaker,"It is true, perhaps we could do with a little more flair, a little more panache but never, never give up the way we do business here in Singapore – solid, down-to-earth ideas, plans and execution. And not just creating beautiful castles in the air."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00644,2020-03-06-T-010,644,Speaker,"For obvious reasons, COVID-19 situation featured significantly. Let me use it to illustrate some themes that are relevant to what we need to think about during our annual Budgets."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00645,2020-03-06-T-010,645,Speaker,"We read of some Singaporeans shunning our nurses. Rather than cheering them on and honouring them as many have done, these Singaporeans are concerned about themselves. Why is there a rush for masks or groceries or toilet paper? Individuals are anxious for their own well-being. That is logical."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00646,2020-03-06-T-010,646,Speaker,But these actions impact society's common good.
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00647,2020-03-06-T-010,647,Speaker,"In many countries and we read of this today, this is severely affecting the frontline healthcare workers who face problems being properly equipped. Ultimately, our individual actions affect society and it comes back round. The tragedy of the commons is happening right before our eyes."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00648,2020-03-06-T-010,648,Speaker,"Can we, in Singapore, rise above ourselves and be different from others? As Leader said, can we be better versions of ourselves?"
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00649,2020-03-06-T-010,649,Speaker,"In our annual Budget as well, do we not also grapple with the individual and society? As I had shared in previous years' summations, this is what we need to trade off  me versus we, today versus tomorrow. We cannot always have the cake and eat it because that is real life. If we, as a people, are prepared to think about the collective and the future, we can sit down, we can discuss business and talk about what to do. But if it is just about me and myself, today and now, then, honestly there would not be much of a Singapore or future to aspire towards."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00650,2020-03-06-T-010,650,Speaker,"From the COVID-19 situation, we also realise how inter-connected we are, both within Singapore and also with the world. We are part of a common humanity and we cannot turn our backs on that. You can see how easy it is to infect each other. You can see how easy it is to blame each other. But are we also not sometimes guilty here in Singapore as we blame others as well? But do we not also realise that in other people's eyes, we are ""the others""? Sadly, we read recently of one of our young Singaporeans being beaten up by YOBS in England simply because he is Asian, because he is Chinese. Simply put, the racists."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00651,2020-03-06-T-010,651,Speaker,"We see these tensions amidst globalisation. There is the good that comes with globalisation but there are also disamenities and we know that. Some politicians use it to stir a visceral anger that comes from the nationalism that is within all of us. Sometimes, it will be about race and religion. We see it in our discourse here in Singapore sometimes. We need to remain plugged in so that Singaporeans can benefit. We maximise the positive outcomes while mitigating the negatives."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00652,2020-03-06-T-010,652,Speaker,"Our present abilities to manage COVID-19 are totally reflective of lifelong learning. Because of SARS, we resolved to make sure that the 33 who lost their lives did not do so in vain. We learnt – we learnt from others, we practised, we learned again – during H1N1. And all these allowed us to put up a good solid response today. And our team is still learning and adjusting, even as we speak, and the real payoffs are in the lives saved. And this did not happen by chance."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00653,2020-03-06-T-010,653,Speaker,"And we did not just learn, we spent and invested for the future. We stockpiled masks, we kept replenishing and refreshing our stock. We have also been doing so for food for the longest time. When we spend for the future, in any Budgets, we have less to spend on the present. No average person is seized by these long-term issues that may or may not happen and we all know the common complaint that Singaporeans may have  why do you not care for me today? I have problems today."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00654,2020-03-06-T-010,654,Speaker,"But you see, the truth is we do. Suddenly, yesterday's tomorrow just became our today."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00655,2020-03-06-T-010,655,Speaker,"That is why we are able to do what we do during this crisis. With our prudence and savings, we are able to fund and deal with this event that just dropped on our laps. We did the same in all the major crises that came by our way in the past. The economic impact will affect more people detrimentally than those who may be infected. That is why the economy is important. That is why we pay attention to the economy, we budget for the present, but we continue to budget for future uncertainties as well. Imagine if we were short-termed in outlook? I think many countries are guilty of that. Imagine if we were short term. Imagine if we decided to spend more, save less. It is far easier to be popular than to be prepared."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00656,2020-03-06-T-010,656,Speaker,"But I am grateful to this Parliament, to all of us here, both Government and Opposition, for supporting these moves. When you look past all the political bluster, there is actually strong unity in approach, not only for this Budget, but for the Budgets past. Parliament is able to do this only because the people of Singapore are prepared to support it. Yet, I know every one of us will still grumble about why we did not get more of this or did not get more of that. But our people's support allows Parliament to have the courage to take the more difficult but yet perhaps the more correct path."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00657,2020-03-06-T-010,657,Speaker,"This support will not exist and does not exist if there is no sense of unity and no sense of togetherness, which is why the idea of Singapore Together is really, really, so precious. It is not just a slogan, something that we just mouth off in Parliament. They are actually things that we can do. SG Cares, for example, helps us to reach out, volunteer, connect with others. It allows us to practise our empathy and compassion and to bring out the innate good that is in all of us. Our community efforts on the ground bring neighbours together to forge bonds that can bind. Our emphasis on family seeks to help strengthen family bonds because that is where it all starts. Even our NS journey allows many to come together despite the differences in backgrounds. We all can do our part."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00658,2020-03-06-T-010,658,Speaker,"It now leaves me to thank all Singaporeans – everyone here, those at the frontline, all those behind the scenes – who made this all possible."
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00659,2020-03-06-T-010,659,Speaker,Passing Budget 2020 is only the first step.
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00660,2020-03-06-T-010,660,Speaker,Let us go forth and translate these words into deeds.
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00661,2020-03-06-T-010,661,Speaker,Because this is what our Democracy is all about.
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00662,2020-03-06-T-010,662,Speaker,Because this is Singapore and because we are Singapore.
2020-03-06-T-010-S-00663,2020-03-06-T-010,663,Speaker,Thank you. [Applause.]
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00664,2020-03-06-T-011,664,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for National Development, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time""."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00665,2020-03-06-T-011,665,Zaqy Mohamad,"Singapore has developed rapidly over the last 55 years. And we need to ensure that our building infrastructure remains well-maintained and safe. This is particularly important for older buildings. Today, about 70% of our building stock is more than 20 years old. In addition, our buildings, both old and new, will need to be made more accessible to meet the needs of an ageing population, as well as persons with disabilities (PWDs)."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00666,2020-03-06-T-011,666,Zaqy Mohamad,"It is in this context that we are proposing amendments to the Building Control Act, to strengthen the building control regulatory framework and to improve accessibility of our built environment."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00667,2020-03-06-T-011,667,Zaqy Mohamad,"Currently, the Building Control Act sets out the duties of relevant parties, such as owners, developers, builders and professionals at the design and construction stages of a building. For example, at the design stage, the developer is required to submit building and structural plans to BCA for approval. At the construction stage, a Qualified Person is required to supervise the works to ensure that buildings are constructed according to the approved plans."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00668,2020-03-06-T-011,668,Zaqy Mohamad,"But after a building is completed, there are also requirements to maintain the building so that it is safe to use. These requirements pertaining to maintenance are currently in the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA). It gives the Commissioner of Buildings the power to compel owners to carry out repairs to a building that is not properly maintained. It also gives the Minister the powers to enact regulations pertaining to the operation and maintenance of lifts and escalators (L&E)."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00669,2020-03-06-T-011,669,Zaqy Mohamad,"One of the key aims of this Bill is to consolidate the design, construction and maintenance requirements over a building's life-cycle under the Building Control Act, by porting over the relevant provisions from the BMSMA, at clauses 21, 45 and 48. The BMSMA will be renamed the Building (Strata Management) Act to better reflect its revised scope. This consolidation will facilitate BCA's oversight over the various building-related processes. It will also allow us to strengthen the building control regulatory framework to improve safety and accessibility in a holistic manner."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00670,2020-03-06-T-011,670,Zaqy Mohamad,"Besides this consolidation, the Bill contains amendments to the Building Control Act which broadly covers the following three areas."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00671,2020-03-06-T-011,671,Zaqy Mohamad,"First, it will strengthen regulatory control over the lift and escalator industry, allowing us to mandate a Progressive Wage Model for this sector. Second, it will provide for a building facade inspection regime. And last, but not least, it will accelerate accessibility upgrading in existing buildings."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00672,2020-03-06-T-011,672,Zaqy Mohamad,"So, let me go through these areas in turn."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00673,2020-03-06-T-011,673,Zaqy Mohamad,"First, on L&E. There are about 70,000 lifts and 7,000 escalators in Singapore today. We need to ensure that they are designed, installed and maintained properly, so that they are safe to use. This is important as we rely on them in our everyday lives, to get home, to get to work, or simply to get to town."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00674,2020-03-06-T-011,674,Zaqy Mohamad,"Currently, the regulatory regime focuses on L&E maintenance and operation. So, for example, BCA mandates their maintenance frequency and outcomes, requires annual inspection and testing of the L&E, as well as for owners to apply for a permit to operate annually."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00675,2020-03-06-T-011,675,Zaqy Mohamad,"Upstream, BCA requires professional engineers to certify that the design and installation of L&E are done according to industry codes and standards."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00676,2020-03-06-T-011,676,Zaqy Mohamad,"We propose to strengthen BCA's upstream regulatory oversight for L&E, to reduce the likelihood of deficiencies in design or installation which may give rise to downstream safety incidents. Broadly, we will do this by extending the existing design and construction regime for buildings to L&E installations as well. This approach is consistent, given that L&E are integral parts of our buildings."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00677,2020-03-06-T-011,677,Zaqy Mohamad,"First, clauses 2 and 3 will empower BCA to require L&E professionals to submit design plans for L&E works to BCA for approval just as they would for building works."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00678,2020-03-06-T-011,678,Zaqy Mohamad,L&E professionals will then need to ensure that the L&E are installed according to the approved plans. Penalties for L&E offences will be aligned with those for existing building offences of a similar nature.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00679,2020-03-06-T-011,679,Zaqy Mohamad,"Second, the Minister will have powers to enact regulations to prescribe the key requirements of L&E design and installation, as well as the corresponding duties of stakeholders. For example, we intend to require L&E professionals to ensure that the lift model and its key safety components are certified by independent certification bodies, as part of the new plan submission process."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00680,2020-03-06-T-011,680,Zaqy Mohamad,"At the same time, we will also enhance BCA's ability to improve safety for both new and existing L&E installations. We will do this in several ways."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00681,2020-03-06-T-011,681,Zaqy Mohamad,"First, under clause 21, relevant parties, such as L&E owners and contractors, will be required to notify BCA of any safety-related defects they may become aware of. For instance, contractors may come across manufacturing defects during the maintenance of a particular lift. They will need to inform BCA so that BCA can get the L&E owners to rectify the defects in this lift and to check other similar lifts to make sure that such defects are not systemic."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00682,2020-03-06-T-011,682,Zaqy Mohamad,"Clause 20 will allow the Commissioner of Building Control to issue orders to L&E owners to prevent safety incidents from occurring. For instance, when a check has revealed that there is an imminent safety risk arising from poor design or installation, the Commissioner of Building Control can issue an order to the owner to stop operating the lift or escalator until the risk has been mitigated or removed. This will supplement existing powers to require L&E owners to address maintenance-related issues."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00683,2020-03-06-T-011,683,Zaqy Mohamad,"Third, clause 16 will allow the Minister to mandate the retrofitting of existing L&Es, for example, if certain models of L&E or their components are prone to incidents that affect public safety."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00684,2020-03-06-T-011,684,Zaqy Mohamad,"The Bill also increases the range of levers available against errant L&E contractors. Currently, the Commissioner of Building Control can censure or suspend the contractor, revoke the contractor's registration, impose composition sums or prosecute them."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00685,2020-03-06-T-011,685,Zaqy Mohamad,"This range of measures is not adequate. For instance, suspending or revoking the registration of a contractor may have unintended safety implications if L&E owners are not able to find an alternative contractor to maintain their L&E. On the other hand, simply censuring or imposing financial penalties may not be sufficient to resolve the underlying concerns for public safety. An errant contractor could continue to also take on more L&E jobs without carrying out internal improvements to meet the required standards."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00686,2020-03-06-T-011,686,Zaqy Mohamad,"Thus, clause 36 introduces a registration scheme for L&E contractors and sets out additional regulatory sanctions."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00687,2020-03-06-T-011,687,Zaqy Mohamad,"Under the new section 29R, BCA will also be able to disallow an errant L&E contractor from taking on new L&E jobs for a specified period, or cap the number of new L&E jobs that can be taken for a specified period, or mandate that employees are retrained to specified standards. Basically, it goes beyond just the machinery but also the standard of employees that may need to maintain our L&Es."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00688,2020-03-06-T-011,688,Zaqy Mohamad,"Clause 36 also introduces a new section 29Q, which is needed for the L&E industry to be able to attract and retain competent technicians and engineers to ensure that our L&Es are safe."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00689,2020-03-06-T-011,689,Zaqy Mohamad,"The L&E industry faces the challenges today of an ageing workforce and they also have difficulty in attracting new entrants, especially younger technicians. In January 2017, an L&E Sectoral Tripartite Committee (STC) was formed to look into the sector's manpower challenges. This committee, co-chaired by NTUC and BCA, comprised representatives from Government agencies, industry associations and unions, as well as service buyers and providers."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00690,2020-03-06-T-011,690,Zaqy Mohamad,"One of its key recommendations was to introduce a progressive wage model (PWM) for the lift industry. The PWM seeks to increase basic wages across the board for local lift technicians, particularly at the lower levels. The recommended wages are pegged against comparable technician jobs in other sectors. The PWM also creates clear career progression paths and ensures that wages are commensurate with the job responsibilities and competencies."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00691,2020-03-06-T-011,691,Zaqy Mohamad,"The Government accepted the STC's recommendation in September 2018 and announced that we would work towards mandating PWM adoption for lift maintenance firms. From May 2019, Government Procuring Entities have taken the lead by only awarding lift maintenance tenders to firms that have adopted the PWM. BCA has been working with industry stakeholders to implement the PWM and the associated training and certification framework."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00692,2020-03-06-T-011,692,Zaqy Mohamad,The results have been encouraging and lift firms representing 95% of the market share have committed to adopt the PWM. I thank the industry for their support for PWM and their efforts to uplift the pay and wages of our lift technicians. We encourage the remaining firms to adopt the PWM early as well.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00693,2020-03-06-T-011,693,Zaqy Mohamad,"Under the new section 29Q, BCA is conferred powers to mandate PWM adoption as a registration requirement for L&E firms. We aim to mandate PWM for the lift industry by 2022."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00694,2020-03-06-T-011,694,Zaqy Mohamad,"Going beyond the lift industry, MOM has recently announced the Tripartite Cluster for Lift and Escalator Industry, which will look into a PWM for escalator maintenance technicians. We expect the Tripartite Cluster to provide its recommendations by the end of the year."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00695,2020-03-06-T-011,695,Zaqy Mohamad,"Besides reviewing the regulatory framework for lifts for people, we also reviewed the regulatory framework for Mechanised Car Parking Systems (MCPS). These are automated car lifting systems that transport a car, without its driver, to and from a parking area. BCA does not regulate the operation and maintenance of MCPS today. However, BCA has found that these systems could potentially pose a danger to users. For example, some MCPS do not have measures to prevent unauthorised access into the transfer areas, which pose a safety concern should users get trapped in the parking area."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00696,2020-03-06-T-011,696,Zaqy Mohamad,"Thus, clause 45 amends section 49 to enable the Minister to enact regulations for MCPS to enhance user safety. Our current intent is to regulate only areas where users directly interface with the equipment, such as the car transfer area, and the operating panel for parking and retrieval."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00697,2020-03-06-T-011,697,Zaqy Mohamad,"Let me move on to the second area of the Bill – how we will improve the safety of our building facades. Currently, owners and persons responsible have a duty to ensure that building exteriors are kept in good and serviceable repair and that exterior features are securely fixed. In this regard, general maintenance works are already carried out regularly on building facades. These works can include simple rectifications, general cleaning as well as painting of external walls."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00698,2020-03-06-T-011,698,Zaqy Mohamad,"However, there is a need for us to further improve the facade maintenance standards. Over the last three years, BCA received reports of almost 30 incidents involving falling facade elements each year. Most of these were related to the wear and tear of the facade materials or connections. Thus, we will put in place a more structured approach towards the inspection and maintenance of building facades. This will help guide owners in meeting their existing duty regarding facade maintenance."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00699,2020-03-06-T-011,699,Zaqy Mohamad,"Clauses 23, 24 and 25 amend the present Part V of the Building Control Act to introduce a new Periodic Facade Inspection regime that will require owners to engage professionals to check their building facades regularly. This will help to detect signs of facade deterioration early and facilitate timely repairs to reduce the likelihood of facade failure. The regime will apply to buildings that are more than 13 metres high – or roughly four storeys – once they are over 20 years old."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00700,2020-03-06-T-011,700,Zaqy Mohamad,"Inspections must be conducted by trained personnel every seven years. This takes into consideration the expected lifespan of some facade materials. It is also aligned with the typical length of Repair and Redecoration cycles for HDB estates and condominium developments, to save costs and reduce inconvenience to residents."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00701,2020-03-06-T-011,701,Zaqy Mohamad,"BCA will introduce inspection guidelines and strengthen R&D efforts to look into more effective and productive ways to carry out facade inspections. In addition to the new facade inspection regime, the Bill will also introduce requirements for the relevant parties to report safety-related defects as well as incidents relating to facades. This is similar to our approach with the L&Es."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00702,2020-03-06-T-011,702,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, I will touch upon the third key area of the Bill, which is to enhance the accessibility of our built environment. We first introduced accessibility requirements for new buildings in 1990, with a Code on Barrier-free Accessibility in Buildings. In consultation with representatives from social service agencies, trade associations and chambers as well as Government agencies, the Code has undergone several revisions over the years to ensure that the provisions address the evolving needs of Singaporeans, taking reference from international standards."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00703,2020-03-06-T-011,703,Zaqy Mohamad,"Besides new buildings, the Code also applies to existing buildings that undergo addition and alteration (A&A) works. However, the current requirements only apply at the specific locations in the building where the A&A works are undertaken. For example, if A&A works are carried out to renovate the washrooms on the upper floor of a building, we can require that the washrooms of that floor be made accessible."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00704,2020-03-06-T-011,704,Zaqy Mohamad,"However, we cannot require the building owner to provide an accessible route connecting the building entrance on the ground floor to the lifts if no A&A works are carried out there. Thus, for many buildings built before 1990, such basic accessibility upgrading is only carried out on a voluntary basis. We are amending this to make sure that we can provide a more holistic treatment."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00705,2020-03-06-T-011,705,Zaqy Mohamad,"With your permission, Mr Speaker, may I ask the Clerks to distribute an information sheet showing pictures of these buildings?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00706,2020-03-06-T-011,706,Speaker,Yes. [
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00707,2020-03-06-T-011,707,Zaqy Mohamad,"As can be seen from the sheet, Tong Building, IOB Building and Bukit Merah Community Centre are among some examples of buildings that provide basic accessibility features on their own accord. These features refer to an accessible building entrance, an accessible route at the entrance level and at least one toilet in the building with lift access if the accessible toilet is on another floor."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00708,2020-03-06-T-011,708,Zaqy Mohamad,"We should do more to ensure that our existing buildings are made accessible to all, whenever A&A works are undertaken. Today, almost all of our public sector buildings and infrastructure that are frequented by the general public have achieved at least basic accessibility."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00709,2020-03-06-T-011,709,Zaqy Mohamad,"To accelerate accessibility upgrading in our existing buildings, especially the private ones, clause 17 introduces a new section 22DA that empowers the Commissioner of Building Control to require the owner of a building without basic accessibility features to provide these features when the owner or someone else undertaking A&A works to that building that requires plan submissions to BCA is given approval for those A&A works, regardless of where those A&A works are carried out in the building."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00710,2020-03-06-T-011,710,Zaqy Mohamad,"The new section 22DA will apply only to commercial and institutional buildings with a gross floor area (GFA) of more than 500 sqm. Examples include offices, hotels, schools and shopping centres. We will exclude smaller buildings, such as shop houses, from these requirements because there is space constraints."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00711,2020-03-06-T-011,711,Zaqy Mohamad,"The Bill will also make other changes to improve and clarify the Builder licensing scheme and to facilitate BCA's operations. Licensed builders need to have an ""approved person"" who is responsible for the management of the business. To ensure proper accountability, clauses 31 and 32 amend sections 29F and 29G to stipulate that only a Director or a Board member can be an ""approved person"". These amendments will also allow more types of businesses to apply for a Builder's licence, including sole proprietors and partnerships comprising corporations."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00712,2020-03-06-T-011,712,Zaqy Mohamad,"This will provide greater flexibility for the industry. For example, smaller firms will be able to form partnerships to take on projects beyond their individual capacity. I hope Er Dr Lee Bee Wah is happy that more local firms can participate in bigger projects, too."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00713,2020-03-06-T-011,713,Zaqy Mohamad,Clause 34 amends section 29J to widen the range of regulatory sanctions that the Commissioner of Building Control can impose on builders. This includes restricting the builder from taking on any new project or any new project above a certain value. The rationale for this change is similar to what I had earlier described – to enhance the measures to regulate L&E contractors.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00714,2020-03-06-T-011,714,Zaqy Mohamad,A few clauses will improve the clarity of the legislation to facilitate the administration of the Act. Clause 8 amends section 11 to make it it clear that builders need to notify the Commissioner of Building Control of the appointment or termination of a specialist builder within 14 days and that builders are accountable for the works that they subcontract out.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00715,2020-03-06-T-011,715,Zaqy Mohamad,"Clause 27 amends section 29A to make clear that builders need not be licensed if they are always carrying on their business as sub-contractors. Clause 20 will require owners in non-strata titled buildings to jointly appoint a Qualified Person (QP) for the purpose of complying with BCA's orders, if such orders are served on multiple owners. This will avoid a situation where each owner engages its own QP, which may result in different recommendations and delays in complying with BCA's orders."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00716,2020-03-06-T-011,716,Zaqy Mohamad,"BCA has consulted industry stakeholders, including building owners, contractors and professionals, on the key changes through more than 10 engagement sessions over the last four years. The industry stakeholders were supportive of the changes. BCA will continue to work closely with the industry to implement the changes proposed in this Bill, which will enhance safety and accessibility in our built environment. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00717,2020-03-06-T-011,717,Zaqy Mohamad,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00718,2020-03-06-T-011,718,Lee Bee Wah,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. The amendments are certainly welcome, especially in light of episodes of lifts breaking down in 2018."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00719,2020-03-06-T-011,719,Lee Bee Wah,"I support the amendments for proper registration and training of lift technicians. We know individual lift companies may have their own in-house training, but how adequate are these training sessions? There is also a lack of career path for the technicians. Hence, you do not attract jobseekers and there would be job-hopping, maybe leading to staff who are not adequately trained."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00720,2020-03-06-T-011,720,Lee Bee Wah,"Next, how do we regulate that the technical crew are not pressured to do jobs in a hurried manner or jobs they are not trained to do, because they have to meet a quota of servicing X number of lifts in a day?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00721,2020-03-06-T-011,721,Lee Bee Wah,"Based on my observation in Nee Soon South, definitely, there is a lot of room for improvement in the quality of lift maintenance and quality of service by lift companies. Sometimes, they even shut down the lift without putting up proper signage and proper notice to the residents. Sometimes, soon after the lift is back to order, back to working condition, then it breaks down again. It just shows that the checking was not thorough enough and that caused a lot of inconvenience to the residents. Also, I believe there is a great shortage of technicians and engineers. That is why they hurriedly finish the work and then put it back into service again."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00722,2020-03-06-T-011,722,Lee Bee Wah,"Can the Minister share with this House how many lift technicians do we have in the industry currently? The Minister of State mentioned that there are 70,000 lifts in Singapore. But how many technicians are there? What is the target number and the schedule of rolling out? What is the duration of the course? How many qualified trainers do we have to conduct courses on lift maintenance? Are we also training more lift engineers, too?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00723,2020-03-06-T-011,723,Lee Bee Wah,"Secondly, are we expecting an increasing number of carparks using mechanised parking system? These are very specialised systems and they need to be properly installed and maintained. Otherwise, any freak accidents can be catastrophic."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00724,2020-03-06-T-011,724,Lee Bee Wah,"Again, how many competent people are there to conduct the training? And how long does it take to get someone trained?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00725,2020-03-06-T-011,725,Lee Bee Wah,"Would Minister look into how the frequency of maintenance for lifts and mechanised carparks is determined? I think one important consideration is the frequency of the usage, rather than just a standard timeframe maintenance schedule."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00726,2020-03-06-T-011,726,Lee Bee Wah,Next is the maintenance of building façades. Many building owners may want fanciful facades to make their structures stand out. But this is where aesthetics may be achieved at the expense of practicality of maintenance. We have our share of awnings and claddings on façades falling off. What is the protocol for the maintenance of these structures? How are the workers trained for such roles?
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00727,2020-03-06-T-011,727,Lee Bee Wah,"Mr Speaker, these are burning issues which we must address in the public interest as we are quite a densely built up city state. In Chinese, please."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00728,2020-03-06-T-011,728,Lee Bee Wah,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In 2018, there were several lift breakdown incidents. Therefore, I support the Government to strengthen the regulation of this industry. From what I have observed, lift maintenance is hard work and there are few career progress opportunities. This could have resulted in the situation whereby people are not interested in positions in this industry. This is going to affect the quality of maintenance, and subsequently public safety."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00729,2020-03-06-T-011,729,Lee Bee Wah,"Furthermore, we do not know what the quality of training is like in the various companies. Hence, to establish a training and registration system for the technicians can ensure public safety better."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00730,2020-03-06-T-011,730,Lee Bee Wah,"Every now and then, we have episodes of claddings and awnings on facades falling off. May I know, for the workers installing and inspecting these facades, what kind of training they have undergone?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00731,2020-03-06-T-011,731,Sylvia Lim,"Mr Speaker, I appreciate the rationale of this Bill to enhance public safety and accessibility of buildings. As an urban and densely built-up society, public safety of building structures and fixed installations are critical. That said, these measures will entail costs, which will be a concern to those responsible, including Town Councils. Member Mr Fasal Manap, who chairs the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council, will elaborate further in his speech."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00732,2020-03-06-T-011,732,Sylvia Lim,I wish to seek clarifications on two particular aspects of the Bill.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00733,2020-03-06-T-011,733,Sylvia Lim,"The first clarification is on the maintenance of exterior features of buildings. This Bill simplifies the definition of “exterior feature” to mean any permanent feature of a building that is installed on, forms part of or projects outwards from the roof or exterior of the building, and such other features that may be prescribed in the regulations. This is an improvement from the existing definition which contains a laundry list of features."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00734,2020-03-06-T-011,734,Sylvia Lim,"I note that the Bill changes the definition of the person responsible to maintain these features. Under the existing Act, it is stated that for HDB blocks, the person responsible to maintain exterior features is either the HDB or the Town Council, depending on who the Minister designates for that feature. By this Bill, clause 2(q) will amend the law to remove HDB as a person responsible for the exterior feature, and place the responsibility on the Town Council or a contractor engaged by the Town Council who has charge and control of the management and maintenance of common property."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00735,2020-03-06-T-011,735,Sylvia Lim,I have two questions relating to this.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00736,2020-03-06-T-011,736,Sylvia Lim,"First, what is the rationale of removing HDB from the definition as a person responsible for the exterior feature? Does this amendment change the responsibility of HDB towards problematic features? An exterior feature could have been unsafe from the point of construction; alternatively, it could become unsafe over time due to wear and tear or lack of maintenance, in which case, Town Councils will have to bear some responsibility. During the MND COS, I note that Minister had clarified that if an HDB block had a falling façade that could be attributed to a construction fault, HDB should pay the cost of rectification. This is eminently reasonable. In fact, the proposed section 25H makes clear that if a person responsible for an exterior feature can show that the defect was caused by materials or work supplied, the person responsible has a defence to a charge of failing to maintain the feature. What is the implication of removing HDB from the definition of “person responsible” for maintaining an exterior feature?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00737,2020-03-06-T-011,737,Sylvia Lim,"The second question relates to the inclusion of the Town Council’s contractor as a “person responsible”, if that contractor has charge and control of the management and maintenance of the common property. Does this phrase mean a Town Council’s Managing Agent, where a Town Council has outsourced its operations to an MA? The same section makes it clear that for private property, such as condominiums, managing agents are persons responsible together with the owners. Could Ministry explain why, for HDB estates, the phrase “managing agent” is not used?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00738,2020-03-06-T-011,738,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, clarity on who is responsible is necessary, as persons responsible have onerous duties under the Bill. These duties include the need to comply with BCA’s Notices to Maintain under the new section 25E, at their cost. They also have duties to report safety incidents under the new section 25B, and failure to perform these duties carries heavy responsibilities."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00739,2020-03-06-T-011,739,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, my next clarification relates to clause 20 on building inspections and remedial works. Clause 20 provides for situations where the Commissioner of Building Control requires an owner to inspect and take remedial actions in respect of a potentially dangerous building, exterior feature or fixed installation, or a building product that carries a safety risk. The Bill will remove the need for such inspections and works to be overseen by qualified persons and simply require them to be done by appropriate persons. This will expand the class of persons who do such work beyond architects and professional engineers. What is the thinking behind apparently relaxing this requirement as we are dealing here with potentially dangerous structures and safety concerns? Will the Ministry provide guidance as to the alternative qualifications that such an appropriate person should have?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00740,2020-03-06-T-011,740,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I stand in support of the Bill. Professionals from the lift industry have shared with me that lift maintenance is known as a ""3D"" industry – it is dark, dirty and dangerous. I would like to express my appreciation for the lift technicians who work tirelessly in dark, warm lift shafts to ensure that we can enjoy smooth and safe lift rides in our vertical city."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00741,2020-03-06-T-011,741,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I have three clarifications on the Bill relating to  (a) facilities for persons with disabilities (PWDs); (b) the progressive wage model (PWM) framework; and (c) working conditions for lift technicians.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00742,2020-03-06-T-011,742,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,The new section 22DA allows the Commissioner of Building Control to require building owners to erect features to facilitate the access to and use of a building by PWDs. I have two concerns here.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00743,2020-03-06-T-011,743,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"First, buildings that are used solely for residential purposes or as a factory are excluded from this section 22DA. Can the Minister share the rationale for excluding residential and factory buildings which are premises that PWDs will need to access? If residential and factory buildings are excluded from section 22DA, can the Minister share how it intends to ensure that building owners of residential and factory buildings will install features for access by PWDs?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00744,2020-03-06-T-011,744,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Second, the Commissioner can only require building owners to include features for PWDs if it receives an application from the building owner for approval of plans for the alternation, addition or repair of a relevant building. This will mean that the progress of ensuring that our buildings are PWD-friendly is dependent on the building owners deciding to undertake building works. Can the Minister share whether it has a target for ensuring that most, if not all, buildings in Singapore are PWD-friendly? What plans does the Ministry have to encourage building owners to include PWD-friendly facilities?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00745,2020-03-06-T-011,745,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Next, the amendments will legislate the PWM for the lift industry. I applaud the efforts to raise the wages of lift maintenance personnel who have to do a very difficult but an essential one. However, the PWM will only apply to Singaporeans and PRs. The reality is that lift companies have a large number of foreigners because of a severe shortage of lift technicians, given the difficult working conditions."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00746,2020-03-06-T-011,746,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Lift technicians who are foreigners are doing jobs that are equally as difficult and equally as dangerous as the jobs Singaporeans and PRs are doing. This is not just an issue of fairness, but one of safety and incentives. Do we want lift technicians who have to ensure the safety of lifts that we all take multiple times a day to feel disgruntled and that their colleague doing the exact same job is paid much higher than he or she is?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00747,2020-03-06-T-011,747,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In October 2018, during the debate on the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill, I spoke about the need to ensure that the PWM will apply to cleaners who are hired directly by an F&B establishment and for foreign cleaners. I highlighted that PWM is about increasing productivity and standards and if we leave out our foreign cleaners from the PWM, bear in mind again that foreign cleaners likely form a bulk of the cleaning sector. This similarly applies to the lift technicians industry."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00748,2020-03-06-T-011,748,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,MEWR has encouraged employers to incorporate the principles of progressive wages into the wage structure of their foreign cleaners. Will MND take similar steps to encourage the incorporation of PWM principles into the contracts for foreign lift technicians? Or will the Ministry also consider eventually extending the PWM to cover foreign lift technicians?
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00749,2020-03-06-T-011,749,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Just in January this year, Minister Chan Chun Sing said “The real competition is Team Singapore, comprising Singaporeans, PRs and foreign workers here, competing with the rest of the world to give our fellow Singaporeans the best chance possible to win, not just in Singapore but across the entire globe."""
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00750,2020-03-06-T-011,750,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,How can we say that we are Team Singapore if we discriminate against certain team members? How will a team work together well if we do not reward the same effort and merit with the same pay?
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00751,2020-03-06-T-011,751,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Lastly, the Lift and Escalator Sectoral Tripartite Committee has recommended reviewing the Singapore Standard SS 550, the Code of Practice for lifts, to specify higher lighting levels within the lift shaft to facilitate maintenance work. The Ministry has accepted the recommendations in late 2018. I understand that BCA is also studying the feasibility of improving ventilation within the lift shaft and motor room to create a cooler work environment for the maintenance personnel. Can the Minister share its progress in implementing these recommendations to improve working conditions for lift technicians? Can the Minister also share details on how it intends to implement these other recommendations? Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00752,2020-03-06-T-011,752,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, my speech will touch on the matters presented in this Bill, which has effect on Town Council estates' maintenance, in particular, the issue of cost."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00753,2020-03-06-T-011,753,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, two of the main objectives of this Amendment Bill are  (a) enhance safety of lifts, escalator and mechanised carpark system and (b) introduce a mandatory facade inspection regime for buildings more than 20 years old. I welcome these amendments as safety is paramount and should not be taken lightly."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00754,2020-03-06-T-011,754,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"In recent years, we have heard and seen news on a number of cases that pertains to dislodgement of fixtures from HDB blocks' facade or exterior wall such as sunshades, decoratives and even bricks."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00755,2020-03-06-T-011,755,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Fortunately, no injury or fatality was reported. However, this is not the case for lift malfunction-related incidents that occurred in HDB blocks. In the last few years, there has been reports of residents or members of the public who are visiting, sustaining mild to serious injuries. I do hope with the tightening of legislation and measures as proposed in this Amendment Bill, it will provide a safer and more conducive living environment."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00756,2020-03-06-T-011,756,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, I support this Amendment Bill. Nonetheless, as the Chair of Aljunied-Hougang Town Council, I do have concerns on the cost issue. Consequently, the adoption and the implementation of the new measures and regimes indicated in this Bill will be the additional expenditure. For example, as mentioned in this Bill, there will be a requirement to conduct the facade inspection regime for buildings which are older than 20 years and, thereafter, conducting a seven years' cyclical inspection."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00757,2020-03-06-T-011,757,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"A town like Aljunied-Hougang is home to many HDB blocks which are 20 years and above, approximately more than 80%. We have encountered dislodgement of facade, fixtures, and one of these incidents was cited by my colleague Mr Pritam Singh two days ago during MND's Committee of Supply's debate."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00758,2020-03-06-T-011,758,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"In view of this inevitable additional expenses, I would like to seek clarification from the Ministry whether the Town Councils will have to solely bear the additional expenses or will HDB, as the landlord, co-share the payment, which is similar to their current practice for facade repair expenses? Additionally, will the Ministry consider additional funding for Town Councils?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00759,2020-03-06-T-011,759,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Another point I want to raise is on availability of trained personnel or an appropriate person as mentioned in clause 20 on building inspections and other building works. This issue was touched on earlier by my colleague Ms Sylvia Lim. I would just like to seek the Ministtry's views on whether there will be any possibility of shortage of this appropriate person due to the enhanced measurements and regime introduced in this Bill, as there will be a higher demand for such individuals?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00760,2020-03-06-T-011,760,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"In short, will there be an issue of imbalanced supply and demand situation, in particular, for the mandatory regime of facade inspection? If this shortage is likely to happen, what will be the Ministry's plan to address this issue?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00761,2020-03-06-T-011,761,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, I look forward to the Ministry's clarification on these two matters that I have raised."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00762,2020-03-06-T-011,762,Zainal Sapari,"Mr Speaker, I would like to declare my interest in the Building Control (Amendment) Bill. I am currently the Chairman of the Tripartite Cluster for Lift & Escalator Industry but I would like to state that the expressed views in my speech are my own and not a representation of the committee’s view."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00763,2020-03-06-T-011,763,Zainal Sapari,"As shared by the Minister of State, Mr Zaqy Mohamad, based on a study conducted by BCA, there are around 2,400 technicians of which 42%, or slightly over 1,000 are residents. This workforce maintains more than 70,000 lifts and 7,000 escalators every day. Maintenance personnel make up most of the sector’s workforce and are essential in providing day-to-day servicing to ensure lifts are well-maintained for safe and reliable use."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00764,2020-03-06-T-011,764,Zainal Sapari,"In 2017, the Lift and Escalator Sectoral Tripartite Committee chaired by my fellow Labour Member of Parliament, Mr Melvin Yong, was formed comprising representatives from the Government, trade unions, industry associations and firms, and service buyers."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00765,2020-03-06-T-011,765,Zainal Sapari,"A set of recommendations was made by the Committee and accepted by the Government on 19 September 2018 to provide better jobs to attract Singapore residents to join the industry, upskill the workforce to deliver better quality maintenance services, ensure commensurate wages to build up a core workforce to anchor the industry and push for the wider adoption of technology to reduce manpower reliance."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00766,2020-03-06-T-011,766,Zainal Sapari,"The Committee has now been tasked to review the escalator industry and renamed the Tripartite Cluster for Lift and Escalator, which I am chairing, together with a co-chair from Singapore National Employers’ Federation, Mr Tony Khoo, CEO of EM Services."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00767,2020-03-06-T-011,767,Zainal Sapari,"One of the recommendations put up by the first Tripartite Committee was the Progressive Wage Model to uplift the wages of the workers in the lift industry that commensurate with their skills, productivity and career progression. We need to attract young Singaporean to make them feel excited about the industry and their potential long-term career progression."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00768,2020-03-06-T-011,768,Zainal Sapari,"Hence, I welcome the new section 29Q that gives the authority to the Commissioner of Building Control to specify the minimum amount of basic wage and bonus payable to the workers in the lift industry after considering the recommendations of the Tripartite Committee."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00769,2020-03-06-T-011,769,Zainal Sapari,"The Tripartite Committee recommended that by 1 July 2022, all lift and escalator companies will pay the local technicians the salaries recommended by the Tripartite Committee."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00770,2020-03-06-T-011,770,Zainal Sapari,"Based on my experience implementing PWM in the other sectors, engagement with Service Providers and Service Buyers are critical before the start of the full implementation to ensure the stakeholders will factor in possible cost implications in the contract pricing. I would like to know whether BCA has any plans to engage the industry stakeholders on the implementation of the PWM to nudge them to anticipate and make the necessary preparation."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00771,2020-03-06-T-011,771,Zainal Sapari,"Currently, there are approximately 95 lift firms. Of these 95, the top 12 firms or close to 13% of them command 86% of the market share. Similarly, for the escalator industry, there are 31 firms, with the top 11 firms maintaining 95% of the escalators in Singapore. This industry seems to have an oligopoly market structure with a few firms dominating the market."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00772,2020-03-06-T-011,772,Zainal Sapari,"This state of oligopoly arises because the major players can exert proprietary rights over their spare parts and are not required to disclose the technical specifications of the lift systems. Hence, many of the lift technicians can only service lifts made by their companies. Such practices hinder market competition to the disadvantage of lift owners and discourage job mobility amongst the lift technicians as they do not have the knowledge and skills to service different types of lifts."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00773,2020-03-06-T-011,773,Zainal Sapari,Building owners often are compelled to award their maintenance contracts to the OEM lift firms for fear that other non-OEM companies would not be able to secure spare parts or have the experienced technicians to do troubleshooting and repair.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00774,2020-03-06-T-011,774,Zainal Sapari,"In the European Union countries, the lift industry is encouraged to adopt an open and non-proprietary lift system which will serve to level the playing field and promote greater market competition. This would also allow the lift and escalator technicians to be cross-trained in different types of lifts and escalators. Moving forward, I would like to know whether BCA will consider open and non-proprietary system in our lift and escalator industry and make the necessary legislative amendments to make this possible."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00775,2020-03-06-T-011,775,Zainal Sapari,"The Lift and Escalator industry, as shared by my fellow Member of Parliament is often perceived as having the 4 Ds – Difficult, Dirty, Dark and Dangerous. Hence, the Lift and Escalator Sectoral Tripartite Committee also formed a working committee and one of the committee’s terms of reference was to propose and develop solutions to improve key aspects of working conditions to enhance attractiveness of the job to new entrants."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00776,2020-03-06-T-011,776,Zainal Sapari,"The working committee made several recommendations to improve the thermal comfort, illuminance level, and safety and ease of maintenance at working places on the lift."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00777,2020-03-06-T-011,777,Zainal Sapari,"Based on the new amendment to this Bill under clause 20, section 24, will it give the authority to Commissioner of Building Control to compel lift owners to retrofit their existing lifts? As the cost of retrofitting new lifts to improve the work environment for the lift technicians can be very expensive, will there be funding support for such work to be carried out? The cost of retrofitting on existing buildings can be substantial, especially for Town Council managing HDB estates. Hence, it would certainly help if all new HDB estates could take this into consideration at the planning and design stage, and the Government to provide funding support for existing lifts."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00778,2020-03-06-T-011,778,Zainal Sapari,"Given the current profile of the current lift and escalator technicians, half of the resident workforce is likely to retire in the next 10 years. With the number of lifts and escalators increasing steadily, besides building up a pool of well-trained and skilled workers, we must rely on technology to improve our lift maintenance work processes and increase productivity."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00779,2020-03-06-T-011,779,Zainal Sapari,"For example, the Building and Construction Authority currently mandates that a lift owner shall subject the lift to monthly maintenance by an approved lift contractor to ensure safe operation of the lifts. With different usage pattern and number of lift landings in a single lift shaft, it may be more efficient to use intensity of usage, that is, mileage travelled as a gauge instead. This is similar to how cars should be sent for servicing after certain distance travelled. Such mileage can be easily tracked using existing technology."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00780,2020-03-06-T-011,780,Zainal Sapari,"In addition, the use of technology can go a long way in enhancing the safety and welfare of our lift and escalator technicians. Productive and innovative technology can reduce the maintenance work needed. For example, remote monitoring can collect data from lifts and notify technicians of faults or irregularities while remote diagnostics can improve the trouble-shooting process and pre-empt breakdowns before they happen."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00781,2020-03-06-T-011,781,Zainal Sapari,"Hence, under this Act, would the Commissioner of Building Control be given the mandate to exercise flexibility to vary the standard operating procedures for lift maintenance given the advancement in technology? Mr Speaker, in Malay, please."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00782,2020-03-06-T-011,782,Zainal Sapari,(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I welcome the amendments in the Building Control Bill that gives the authority to the Commissioner of Building Control to specify the minimum amount of basic wage and bonus payable to the workers in the lift and escalator industry after considering the recommendations by the Progressive Wage Model recommendations by the Tripartite committee for this industry.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00783,2020-03-06-T-011,783,Zainal Sapari,"This will mandate lift and escalator companies to pay the local technicians the salaries that was agreed with the tripartite committee. This is an important step to attract workers, especially the younger ones, to this essential industry. The Progressive Wage Model will ensure that their salaries commensurate with the competencies, responsibilities and productivity of the lift and escalator workers."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00784,2020-03-06-T-011,784,Zainal Sapari,"(In English)  In conclusion, while there is much to be done, I am heartened that the Government recognises the importance of the work of our lift and escalator technicians. Every worker matters and every job counts. I look forward to working with the industry stakeholders to create a better and safe environment not only for our workers but the public as users as well. I support the amendments to the Bill."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00785,2020-03-06-T-011,785,Joan Pereira,"Sir, this is a timely Bill and I fully support the amendments which cover quite a range of important areas, from enhancing lift and escalator (L&E) safety to ensuring more frequent façade inspections, from mandating a Progressive Wage Model for the L&E sector to regulating mechanised car parking systems."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00786,2020-03-06-T-011,786,Joan Pereira,"I would like to focus on the amendments for L&E today. I welcome the introduction of the requirement for elevator maintenance workers to possess minimum qualifications or certification before they can be allowed to perform works without supervision. Besides ensuring that they have acquired competency so that the overall maintenance standards are raised, this new rule will help to enhance safety for the workers as well."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00787,2020-03-06-T-011,787,Joan Pereira,"However, accidents can still occur. Could the Ministry share statistics on incidents resulting in injury?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00788,2020-03-06-T-011,788,Joan Pereira,I hope the Ministry could consider providing incentives to encourage L&E maintenance companies to tap upon technology to boost work safety for their staff at the elevator and escalator sites.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00789,2020-03-06-T-011,789,Joan Pereira,May I also take this opportunity to appeal for legislation to mandate higher insurance coverage for these workers?
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00790,2020-03-06-T-011,790,Joan Pereira,"In the area of lift breakdowns, what are the numbers in the following categories  public housing, non-public housing, commercial, industrial and institutional? How can we further improve the reliability of L&E?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00791,2020-03-06-T-011,791,Joan Pereira,"I would like to ask the Minister if it is possible that we make greater use of technology to monitor the performances of our lifts and escalators, and minimise the need for human monitoring? This could help to reduce downtime and minimise inconvenience. Productivity could be increased too. Sir, in Mandarin."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00792,2020-03-06-T-011,792,Joan Pereira,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In the area of lift breakdowns, what are the numbers in the following categories  public housing, non-public housing, commercial, industrial and institutional? How can we further improve the reliability of lifts and escalators (L&E)?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00793,2020-03-06-T-011,793,Joan Pereira,"Finally, I would like to ask the Minister if it is possible that we make greater use of technology to monitor the performances of our lifts and escalators, and minimise the need for human monitoring? This could help to reduce the downtime and minimise inconvenience. Productivity could be increased too."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00794,2020-03-06-T-011,794,Gan Thiam Poh,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to share my views on the amendments affecting lifts in this Bill."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00795,2020-03-06-T-011,795,Gan Thiam Poh,"As a densely built-up city state with more and more buildings rising above 20 storeys, it is very important that all the lifts installed are of good quality and are well maintained to ensure safety and reliability for all passengers. With a rapidly ageing society, lifts serve an increasingly essential role too, even in shorter buildings and facilities."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00796,2020-03-06-T-011,796,Gan Thiam Poh,"In recent years, we have had a number of malfunctioning lift incidents, which had caused inconvenience and injuries. It is timely that we overhaul the relevant legislation and review the entire eco-system."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00797,2020-03-06-T-011,797,Gan Thiam Poh,"HDB is the largest builder and enjoys the benefit of economies of scale. I would like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that HDB is fully leveraging upon this to secure the best deal. Presently, different projects are handled by different contractors, so I am concerned that this advantage may not have been fully exploited."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00798,2020-03-06-T-011,798,Gan Thiam Poh,"Next, how could we ensure the adequacy of lift parts to meet the mandatory lift maintenance regime as prescribed here since the replacement of existing lifts can only be done after 28 years? Should there be a need to have a central national storage for all the parts from the different lift manufacturers that have tendered successfully to install lifts for our flats and which have also undertaken to provide the parts for long-term maintenance?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00799,2020-03-06-T-011,799,Gan Thiam Poh,"The use of technology can assist to provide checks on the maintenance of lifts. How would the Ministry encourage the use of technology to monitor the performance of lifts round-the-clock independently, particularly to ensure lift safety? Has the current approach been adequate in preventing lift breakdowns? Do we have a national benchmark for lift performance similar to what LTA has done for MRT trains?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00800,2020-03-06-T-011,800,Gan Thiam Poh,"I fully support the amendment to empower the Minister to order existing lifts to be retrofitted with safety-related features. Many older lifts were installed without these features, which are specified in the latest standards. Such lifts could either be upgraded or replaced."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00801,2020-03-06-T-011,801,Gan Thiam Poh,"Last but not least, the most crucial element here is manpower, and I strongly support the various proposals to boost our pool of lift specialists and deepen their expertise."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00802,2020-03-06-T-011,802,Gan Thiam Poh,"It is important that we have a strong Singaporean core of locally trained lift specialists, with attractive incentives for them to remain in this sector and to make career progress. Introducing the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) to attract more Singaporeans to join this sector is a good start. Workers will be able to look forward to a clear progression pathway which correlates the new certification requirements with wage increments for each role."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00803,2020-03-06-T-011,803,Gan Thiam Poh,We need to increase the pool of Qualified Persons (QP) to meet inspection and maintenance enforcement requirements. I also fully support the proposal to introduce a new branch of specialist professional engineers in lift and escalator engineering.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00804,2020-03-06-T-011,804,Gan Thiam Poh,"With that, I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00805,2020-03-06-T-011,805,Deputy Speaker,Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00806,2020-03-06-T-011,806,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Members for their comments and their support of the Bill. Let me address the issues raised."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00807,2020-03-06-T-011,807,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Louis Ng asked why residential buildings and factories were not included under clause 17, which requires for existing buildings without basic accessibility features to provide these when undergoing addition and alteration works."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00808,2020-03-06-T-011,808,Zaqy Mohamad,"As I mentioned earlier, all buildings built since 1990 have to comply with the Code on Accessibility, including the provision of basic accessibility features. So, buildings in the last 30 years are now compliant. The changes under clause 17 target older buildings built before 1990, which do not have basic accessibility features."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00809,2020-03-06-T-011,809,Zaqy Mohamad,"We are applying this requirement to commercial and institutional building types as these are more frequently accessed by members of the public. This is a calibrated approach as we are mindful of the physical challenges in existing buildings as well as the cost impact to building owners. Owners of residential and factory buildings can tap on the Accessibility Fund to co-fund up to 80% of the cost for installing basic accessibility features. The fund is available, and I urge them to do so."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00810,2020-03-06-T-011,810,Zaqy Mohamad,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about maintenance of facades. As mentioned earlier, we will put in place a new Periodic Facade Inspection (PFI) regime. The regime provides a more structured approach towards the inspection and maintenance of facades so that owners can better meet their existing duty and enhance public safety."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00811,2020-03-06-T-011,811,Zaqy Mohamad,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap also asked about the regulation and training of personnel involved in facade inspections. Owners will need to appoint a competent person (CP) to carry out facade inspections. The CP must be either a professional engineer (PE) or registered architect, and can be assisted by facade inspectors (FIs) in carrying out inspections. So, they do not have to do it all on their own, but there are roles such as FIs that they can use. The FI must be a resident engineer, a resident technical officer, or any other person who possesses the relevant qualifications and experience."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00812,2020-03-06-T-011,812,Zaqy Mohamad,"CPs and FIs must undergo a compulsory facade inspection course. Since 2017, more than 200 individuals have successfully completed the course. BCA will also introduce inspection guidelines in due course to guide CPs and FIs in performing their duties."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00813,2020-03-06-T-011,813,Zaqy Mohamad,These efforts will ensure that we will have a pool of qualified and competent personnel to support the new inspection regime.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00814,2020-03-06-T-011,814,Zaqy Mohamad,"For these courses, they can also tap on SkillsFuture subsidies available. For those below 40 years old, they can get up to 50% subsidies. For older workers above 40, Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, they can get up to 90% subsidies too. To some extent, I think, if you look at the entire picture, we are trying to beef up our core capabilities."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00815,2020-03-06-T-011,815,Zaqy Mohamad,Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about the terms used in defining the persons responsible for maintaining building facades and about the responsibility for facade maintenance in HDB blocks.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00816,2020-03-06-T-011,816,Zaqy Mohamad,"Let me clarify that the Bill does not change this responsibility. The definition being amended relates to exterior features. The maintenance of exterior features is part of any common property in HDB blocks that is currently covered under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, or BMSMA in short."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00817,2020-03-06-T-011,817,Zaqy Mohamad,"Today, the person responsible for such maintenance is defined in the BMSMA as the Town Council (TC) and not HDB. So, we are porting this across. In addition, the BMSMA's definition of ""person responsible"" includes the Town Council's contractor and the condominium's managing agents (MAs) as long as they have charge and control over common property."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00818,2020-03-06-T-011,818,Zaqy Mohamad,"What we have done – it looks a bit complicated – but we are basically porting over the clauses in the existing BMSMA into the current Building Control Act. In the BMSMA, it was the Town Council mentioned – no HDB. But in the current Act, you do have HDB and Town Council. That is for retrofitting orders by the Minister. That will still be retained under clause 13, in which the Minister can still designate retrofitting works to HDB and Town Councils. So, there are no changes."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00819,2020-03-06-T-011,819,Zaqy Mohamad,"Just to clarify again, maintenance of exterior features and facades is under the Town Council and its contractors, for coverage of retrofitting, it is HDB and Town Councils. So, there is no change effectively on the total outcome."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00820,2020-03-06-T-011,820,Zaqy Mohamad,"Also, to clarify on the co-payment by HDB should you have facade repair issues, that comes under an existing HDB co-payment scheme. I think the Member also knows that if it is found to be a facade repair issue, HDB co-funds 50%. If found to be a design fault or construction issue, it will be 100% covered by HDB. So, the scheme is in place and not so much part of the Act."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00821,2020-03-06-T-011,821,Zaqy Mohamad,"So, we have not changed the position when transferring the BMSMA provisions on maintenance of exterior features over to the Building Control Act."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00822,2020-03-06-T-011,822,Zaqy Mohamad,Ms Sylvia Lim also asked why clause 20 of the Bill amends the Act to no longer mandate that inspections ordered under section 24(1) be performed by an architect or professional engineer. She asked if this would have an impact on public safety.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00823,2020-03-06-T-011,823,Zaqy Mohamad,"We expect most of the inspections to still be done by architects and professional engineers. However, depending on the specific situation, specialists with the necessary skills and competencies, such as in building materials and components, may be better equipped to carry out such inspections. So, it depends on the type of issue involved."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00824,2020-03-06-T-011,824,Zaqy Mohamad,"The amendment allows for such specialists who may not be architects and PEs to be appointed to do inspections. Overall, there should be no impact on public safety. In fact, it should be better because now, you are allowing others with specialised engineering skills."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00825,2020-03-06-T-011,825,Zaqy Mohamad,"Ms Lim and Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap noted that the PFI regime entails cost. The schedule for the PFI has been set at seven years, to be tied in with the repairs and redecoration (R&R) schedule that TCs, MAs and Management Corporation Strata Titles (MCSTs) conduct, to save costs. Therefore, you can also leverage on the gondolas that you set up, other things that you typically do in terms of painting of the building, for example, and you can leverage on some of these things to reduce cost."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00826,2020-03-06-T-011,826,Zaqy Mohamad,"BCA will also work with owners responsible for many buildings to spread out the inspections in the initial phase to minimise any spikes in costs. BCA is working on other measures to help manage costs. These include building up the pool of CPs and FIs, and exploring, as some Members have also suggested, how technology can help to carry out inspections in a more effective and productive manner."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00827,2020-03-06-T-011,827,Zaqy Mohamad,"In terms of whether there will be co-sharing of costs or additional funding provided to Town Councils for the new facade inspections, as building facades are part of common property and under the purview of TCs, TCs are responsible for conducting regular inspections to ensure that the facades are in good condition. As I mentioned, the schedule of the PFI has been set at seven years, which can be tied in with the R&R schedule to save costs. BCA will also work with owners, including TCs to spread out inspections in the initial phase to minimise any spikes in costs."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00828,2020-03-06-T-011,828,Zaqy Mohamad,"BCA is also working on other measures. For example, BCA launched a grant call with HDB for the development of a drone inspection system to carry out automated facade inspections. This reduces manpower cost in terms of getting gondolas up and all the other necessary infrastructure."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00829,2020-03-06-T-011,829,Zaqy Mohamad,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the number of lifts in Singapore and their reliability. There are 70,000 lifts in Singapore and the number of safety incidents arising from technical faults has been less than 30 per year over the last three years. We will continue to monitor this carefully as we take the safety of all our users very seriously."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00830,2020-03-06-T-011,830,Zaqy Mohamad,"At the same time, the number of lifts in Singapore is expected to grow. We recognise Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap's concern that there should be enough skilled manpower to keep our lifts safe and in working condition. That is why we have been working with the industry to build up capabilities and capacities at all levels."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00831,2020-03-06-T-011,831,Zaqy Mohamad,"The Professional Engineers Board (PEB) introduced the specialist professional engineer (SPE) in lift and escalator engineering in 2017. Today, there are about 90 SPEs whose primary duties include supervising the installation of lifts and carrying out routine inspections. Their scope of work will increase with the new requirements under the Bill to also include the certification of new installations."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00832,2020-03-06-T-011,832,Zaqy Mohamad,"To ensure that there continues to be enough competent personnel to inspect our lifts, BCA is working together with the Association of Consulting Engineers Singapore (ACES) and The Institution of Engineers, Singapore (IES) to train lift and escalator inspectors (LEIs)."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00833,2020-03-06-T-011,833,Zaqy Mohamad,Graduates and diploma holders in the mechanical or electrical engineering disciplines who have relevant experience will be able to apply for registration as LEIs. They will need to complete an LEI training course and pass an examination. These efforts will grow the pool of L&E professionals to meet increasing demand.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00834,2020-03-06-T-011,834,Zaqy Mohamad,"As for lift maintenance technicians, BCA and ITE have introduced courses for the various competency levels in the PWM to provide them with common engineering knowledge and skills on servicing lifts and their key components. Technicians will therefore be required to obtain the specialist level competency – so they must obtain this – before they are allowed to service lifts independently, once this regulation comes into effect. To date, almost 400 of the 2,100 lift technicians in Singapore have received the certificate of competency (CoC)."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00835,2020-03-06-T-011,835,Zaqy Mohamad,I urge employers to start training up all the technicians. We are now giving a grace period before we put in the regulations. But this is the time as we have put in more support now with SkillsFuture and we need to help train and beef up our capabilities.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00836,2020-03-06-T-011,836,Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank Mr Zainal Sapari and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for their support of the PWM for the lift industry. The PWM provides a common competency and wage framework for all lift firms. This will benefit more than 1,000 local lift technicians and ensure that their remuneration is commensurate with their job responsibilities and competencies. For example, a lift technician with the specialist level of competency will be able to earn a basic wage of at least $2,250, while a master specialist could earn $4,000 or more a month. BCA and ITE are also working with the industry to develop more courses to help lift technicians advance along their PWM career progression pathways. This will ensure consistency in training standards and facilitate job mobility, both of which were highlighted by Mr Zainal Sapari and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00837,2020-03-06-T-011,837,Zaqy Mohamad,"As mentioned by Mr Zainal, we have, indeed, been engaging our stakeholders actively to encourage the early adoption of PWM. On the supply side, 40 lift firms, representing 95% of the market, have already committed to adopt the PWM. On the demand side, all Government procuring entities now award tenders only to lift firms that have adopted the PWM. BCA has been in discussions with Town Councils, trade associations and chambers (TACs) and other major service buyers, who have also been supporting the PWM. We encourage service buyers to come on board early, to smoothen the transition to a mandatory one by 2022."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00838,2020-03-06-T-011,838,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Louis Ng asked about extending the PWM to foreigners in the lift industry. The intent of the PWM is to build a strong local core for the lift industry and not to discriminate against foreigners. So, Mr Ng will be happy to know that several lift firms that have committed to implementing the PWM have also indicated that they provide their foreign lift technicians with comparable remuneration packages. BCA will require all lift technicians, including the foreigners, to be certified for the various competency levels in the PWM, and we will encourage lift companies to also incorporate other PWM principles for their foreign lift technicians as well. So, as they improve their skill-sets, competencies and productivity, their wages will also go up. So, it has to be commensurate with the skillsets and skill pathways."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00839,2020-03-06-T-011,839,Zaqy Mohamad,"Beyond the PWM, we also agree with Mr Zainal and Mr Ng on the need to improve the working conditions in the lift sector. BCA is working with the industry for new lifts to be designed with better working conditions for lift technicians as part of the work of the Tripartite Cluster for the Lift and Escalator Industry, which Mr Zainal chairs. So, Mr Zainal, it is in your hands. For example, I understand that the Committee is looking at measures relating to improving minimum illumination levels and mechanical ventilation in the lift shaft so that lift technicians can work in a cooler, brightly lit environment. And for existing lifts, we encourage lift owners to proactively incorporate these improvements as part of their planned upgrading or modernisation works. Yes, the Tripartite Cluster can do its part and, certainly, we look forward to Mr Zainal's recommendations."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00840,2020-03-06-T-011,840,Zaqy Mohamad,"On Mr Zainal's specific point, I would like to clarify that clause 20 of the Bill allows the Commissioner of Building Control to issue orders in respect of lifts to prevent safety incidents and not to improve working conditions."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00841,2020-03-06-T-011,841,Zaqy Mohamad,"So, as we raise wages and improve the working environment, we will also improve the safety and productivity of the L&E industry through the use of technology, as suggested by many Members who have spoken today. One way is to use remote monitoring and diagnostics (RM&D), which enable lift contractors to not only monitor lift operations in real time remotely, but also to troubleshoot and diagnose faults with greater accuracy."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00842,2020-03-06-T-011,842,Zaqy Mohamad,"Such systems are being used in some other countries in Europe and BCA is exploring with the industry how this can be applied in our local context. For example, BCA is working to develop a common standard for these systems that will facilitate more pervasive deployment of such technologies."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00843,2020-03-06-T-011,843,Zaqy Mohamad,"If successfully deployed in Singapore, RM&D technology could enable us to shift to a use-based or predictive maintenance regime, as suggested by Mr Zainal and Er Dr Lee. Today, it is very rigid in terms of monthly inspections. But that is because we do not have ways in which we can measure how often the lift is used and how far it travels. So, I think, with technology, we are able to do it better and, therefore, we can assess how soon or how often your lifts need to be maintained much more accurately."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00844,2020-03-06-T-011,844,Zaqy Mohamad,"RM&D can also change the way lift technicians work in the future. A technician will be able to monitor all the lifts under his charge from a remote location and in real time. So, when a fault occurs, the system will provide the technician with the necessary information to diagnose the fault and to attend to it immediately. This will reduce the amount of time that the lift technician is required to spend doing maintenance work on site, which not only makes his job safer but also enables him to maintain a larger number of lifts, thus raising his productivity. I think all these fit into the whole PWM narrative in which you want to see greater productivity, you want to see greater skill-sets and improved working conditions. Therefore, I think you can see the rationale of why we are localising this set of jobs and taking it to the future. We want more Singaporeans to come on board."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00845,2020-03-06-T-011,845,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about how we can ensure the adequacy of lift parts in order to meet the maintenance requirements under the Act, for example, by setting up a national storage for such parts. We agree that it is important for lift faults to be rectified in a timely manner. However, having a centralised storage of the various lift parts from different manufacturers and across different models is neither practical nor cost-effective. It is going to be difficult. Instead, owners can take a preventive approach towards maintenance by planning ahead and scheduling replacement of lift components early, before they cause any issues. The RM&D systems I spoke about earlier have the potential to help owners to do better."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00846,2020-03-06-T-011,846,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Zainal Sapari also raised concerns about major players exerting proprietary rights over their spare parts and asked if we could adopt the EU's practice of encouraging open and non-proprietary lift systems. We understand that EU prohibits companies from restricting the sale of spare parts to other companies and we have similar laws in Singapore that can deal with refusals to supply essential parts. So, I think it would not be practical to legislate that lift systems must be open and non-proprietary because doing so would severely limit the selection of lifts available to Singapore, given the lift designs of many of our international lift are actually quite proprietary. Just like cars, it is very hard to interchange your parts between a Honda, Kia and Volkswagen, for example. So, you have to also be mindful that there are very few of such models around."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00847,2020-03-06-T-011,847,Zaqy Mohamad,"On Mechanised Car Parking Systems (MCPS), we agree with Er Dr Lee that they should be properly installed and maintained. There are about 260 MCPS today in Singapore, and 10 or less MCPS were installed annually in recent years. So, the numbers are not huge. But BCA will work out the details of the MCPS regulatory regime and consult the industry further on the requirements for contractors and technicians."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00848,2020-03-06-T-011,848,Zaqy Mohamad,"On Mr Gan's question on HDB's procurement of lifts, while it is not relevant to the Bill, we should ask MOF on how you procure lifts in bulk. But I would like to assure the Member that HDB does enjoy the economies of scale in its lift procurement. Each tender covers about 300 lifts, which is large by industry standards."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00849,2020-03-06-T-011,849,Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, I thank Members for their support of these amendments, which seek to reinforce our Building Control Act by strengthening the building regulatory control framework and to improve the building accessibility in our built environment. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00850,2020-03-06-T-011,850,Deputy Speaker,"Yes, Er Lee Bee Wah. No five clarifications, please."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00851,2020-03-06-T-011,851,Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Sir, only one. Nee Soon Town Council has been using drones to do facade inspection. But, lately, there was this restriction imposed. The drones can only be used during the weekend. So, I was wondering can MND work out with CAAS to address their concern so that we can be more productive?"
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00852,2020-03-06-T-011,852,Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, I thank the Member for her question. Certainly, we can look at this. It is in our interest, in fact, to leverage more on technology and leverage more things like drones, for example, so that we minimise the cost to Town Councils to have to put up gondolas each time. Let us work this out. And certainly, as we expand the regulations to more Town Councils and across the board, I think this is where we can certainly do better."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00853,2020-03-06-T-011,853,Deputy Speaker,Ms Joan Pereira.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00854,2020-03-06-T-011,854,Joan Pereira,I thank the Minister of State. I think I asked about higher insurance coverage for the workers. Can the Minister of State please explain?
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00855,2020-03-06-T-011,855,Zaqy Mohamad,"That is actually an MOM question but never mind. If they are injured, they can claim under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA). Under the WICA, you can actually claim. So, whether they have insurance or not, it is claimable."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00856,2020-03-06-T-011,856,Deputy Speaker,Mr Zainal Sapari.
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00857,2020-03-06-T-011,857,Zainal Sapari,"Mr Deputy Speaker, before I ask my question, I would like to tender my apologies to Mr Louis Ng for referring to him as a fellow Labour Member of Parliament, but he is most welcomed to join us."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00858,2020-03-06-T-011,858,Zainal Sapari,"My question is, given the fact that we have 70,000 lifts and we are trying to improve the working conditions, I think the initial estimate for retrofitting existing lifts can actually be very expensive. I was wondering whether MND has plans to subsidise the cost of retrofitting these lifts to make sure that we can actually create an environment conducive for the L&E technicians to work in."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00859,2020-03-06-T-011,859,Zaqy Mohamad,"I understand that is being worked on by your Cluster Committee. So, we will wait for your recommendations."
2020-03-06-T-011-S-00860,2020-03-06-T-011,860,Deputy Speaker,Alright. Are there any more clarifications? That is a very good taichi.

2020-03-06-T-012-S-00866,2020-03-06-T-012,866,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00867,2020-03-06-T-012,867,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Public Utilities Act was last amended in February 2018. Since then, the work of PUB has continued to evolve."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00868,2020-03-06-T-012,868,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"First, as I had announced during my COS speech a few days ago, PUB will be given an expanded mandate to defend our coasts against rising sea levels."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00869,2020-03-06-T-012,869,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second, as PUB continues to diversify Singapore’s water sources, the number of desalination and NEWater plants has increased. There will be 10 such plants by the end of the year, up from seven in February 2018."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00870,2020-03-06-T-012,870,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Third, PUB continues to leverage technology to improve service quality. As announced in January this year, PUB will roll out some 300,000 smart water meters in homes and commercial and industrial buildings by 2023."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00871,2020-03-06-T-012,871,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Lastly, to complement PUB's efforts in ensuring the security of our water supply, we will also need building owners and managers to do their part to keep our water supply system secure, by protecting their water tanks against unauthorised access."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00872,2020-03-06-T-012,872,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Against the backdrop of these developments, it is necessary to update the Public Utilities Act in four key areas to ensure that it remains effective and relevant. Let me go through each group of amendments in turn."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00873,2020-03-06-T-012,873,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The first group of amendments will expressly confer new coastal protection functions on PUB and legislate the new Coastal and Flood Protection Fund.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00874,2020-03-06-T-012,874,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB is currently the national authority for drainage and inland flood protection. Given the synergy in tackling inland flooding and coastal inundation risks together in a holistic manner, the Government has tasked PUB to be the national Coastal Protection Agency. PUB will work with agencies and other stakeholders to enhance our coastline defences and coordinate policies to facilitate decisions on land use, development and activities to safeguard Singapore against rising sea levels."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00875,2020-03-06-T-012,875,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To provide for the substantial capital outlay and implement coastal and flood protection in a fiscally sustainable manner, Deputy Prime Minister announced in his Budget speech that a Coastal and Flood Protection Fund will be set up within PUB, with an initial injection of $5 billion from the Government's FY2020 Budget."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00876,2020-03-06-T-012,876,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will use this fund prudently to implement coastal protection measures, which could include sea walls, tidal gates and pumping stations. These are all being studied, and may need to be deployed together to prevent flooding. The Fund will also be used to help PUB expand Singapore’s drainage infrastructure to cope with more intense rainfall arising from climate change."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00877,2020-03-06-T-012,877,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Coastal and Flood Protection Fund signals the Government’s resolve in tackling long-term existential challenges such as climate change. Prime Minister mentioned at the National Day Rally last year that climate change adaptation might cost $100 billion or more over the next 100 years. Given the significant outlay, we will need a combination of funding methods to finance our adaptation measures."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00878,2020-03-06-T-012,878,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Coastal and Flood Protection Fund will be just one source of funding. We will study this closely and assess what other appropriate funding sources should be used. These sources may include budgets of Ministries, borrowing and tapping on Past Reserves where land reclamation is involved."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00879,2020-03-06-T-012,879,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Climate change defence is existential for Singapore. The Prime Minister also said in his National Day Rally speech, that everything else must bend at the knees to safeguard the existence of our island nation. Planning and investing long-term for coastal defences and national flood protection will be critical to ensure that Singapore has adequate resources to meet this challenge."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00880,2020-03-06-T-012,880,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The second group of amendments will provide for legislative safeguards over our water infrastructure, especially water supply plants. As the House is aware, we have been diversifying our water sources by building up four national taps over the decades. The intent is to safeguard our water security."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00881,2020-03-06-T-012,881,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As we build up our desalination and NEWater capacity, PUB has partnered the private sector to design, build, own and operate our DBOO, some of our desalination and NEWater plants. This DBOO model allows PUB to tap on the expertise and resources of the private sector to deliver water solutions most cost-effectively."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00882,2020-03-06-T-012,882,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"By the end of this year, PUB will have six out of 10 desalination and NEWater plants under the DBOO model. The remaining four plants are owned and operated by PUB."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00883,2020-03-06-T-012,883,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For the DBOO plants, PUB has put in place robust contractual safeguards to ensure water security. For example, concession companies that own and operate DBOO plants are obliged to seek PUB’s approval when there is a change in control. Under the contractual terms, PUB can terminate the contracts and buy over the plants, or in some cases, step in to operate the plants, should the need arise. We have successfully executed some of these contractual remedies in the past to ensure our water security."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00884,2020-03-06-T-012,884,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Water security is critical to Singapore’s national security. While we have already strong contractual safeguards, given that water security is an existential issue to Singapore, we need to always look for ways to strengthen safeguards over our water infrastructure. We have reviewed the regulatory regimes of other critical infrastructure, such as electricity and telecommunications, and concluded that it would be prudent to adopt similar legislative safeguards that are already in place in these sectors."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00885,2020-03-06-T-012,885,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Taking reference from these other legislation, the Bill will strengthen PUB's oversight of the concession companies. These concession companies, as well as any underlying trusts or business trusts that may be set up to hold the plant assets, will be designated by PUB and be subject to additional oversight mechanisms under the Bill."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00886,2020-03-06-T-012,886,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Broadly, under clause 8, all designated parties will be subject to three types of oversight controls."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00887,2020-03-06-T-012,887,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"First, a person who becomes a substantial controller or indirect controller of the designated parties that own and operate the DBOO plants will need to notify or seek approval from PUB. This is to ensure that control of DBOO plants rests with individuals or groups whose interests are aligned with the long-term interests of Singapore’s water security and the public interest. For example, we may need to ensure that there is sufficient diversity in the ownership and operation of DBOO plants in Singapore. This will reduce the risk to Singapore’s water security from having mega conglomerates monopolising our critical infrastructure but then unexpectedly collapsing. Given the strategic role that DBOO plants play in Singapore’s water security, PUB must maintain oversight of controllers who directly or indirectly control substantial equity interest and/or voting power in these designated parties."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00888,2020-03-06-T-012,888,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second, these designated parties cannot be dissolved, terminated or wound up voluntarily without PUB’s consent. The dissolution, termination or winding up of these designated parties will adversely affect our water security. If there are court proceedings for the dissolution, termination or winding up of these designated parties, PUB will be a party to such proceedings, and the court must consider representations made by PUB in such proceedings.This ensures that the court does not make any decision without having considered water security considerations. In addition, the creditors of these designated parties cannot enforce security over the property of such parties, or enforce any court order against such parties, without giving prior notice to PUB."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00889,2020-03-06-T-012,889,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Third, the Minister will be empowered to issue Special Administration Orders (SAOs). An SAO is an order of the Minister directing the takeover of control of the affairs, business and property of a designated party by another person, so as to ensure the continued operations of the DBOO plant for the public interest."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00890,2020-03-06-T-012,890,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, Sir, we are mindful that while such powers are similarly found in the other legislation I referenced earlier, concession companies may have some concerns over these powers. I would like to assure Members that these levers will not be exercised lightly and the Bill has limited their use to exceptional circumstances, such as when Singapore’s water security is under threat. As far as possible, PUB will continue to rely on existing contractual safeguards where appropriate, which have served PUB well thus far. But as I mentioned earlier, when it comes to water security, we take no chances."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00891,2020-03-06-T-012,891,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The third group of amendments relate to smart water meters. Clauses 2, 5, 6, 7 and 11 will update the Public Utilities Act to extend existing powers of PUB in relation to water meter installation, maintenance and enforcement to cover smart water meters."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00892,2020-03-06-T-012,892,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"These powers will support PUB’s Smart Water Meter Programme, the first phase of which involves the deployment of some 300,000 meters, starting from next year, in new and existing residential, commercial and industrial premises. This will allow PUB to leverage digital technologies to encourage behavioural change towards water conservation, optimise water demand management, and achieve greater operational efficiencies."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00893,2020-03-06-T-012,893,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The updated provisions would empower PUB to  first, install smart water meters, including ancillary equipment; second, enter premises at reasonable hours or at such other time as may be agreed with the owner or occupier of the premise to carry out inspection or works on smart water meters; third, direct the owner to remove any object that hinders or obstructs access to a smart water meter; and fourth, take action against any person who interferes, interrupts or obstructs with the operation of a smart water meter supplied by PUB. In addition, the amendments specify the circumstances under which a person would be presumed to have tampered with a smart water meter and thus committed an offence."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00894,2020-03-06-T-012,894,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The last group of amendments relate to water tank security. While PUB had made great efforts to protect its water infrastructure and ensure that potable water supplied to consumers is safe and fit for drinking, building owners and managing agents also have a part to play in ensuring our water remains safe for drinking. For example, they need to take the necessary steps to prevent unauthorised access to the water tanks in their buildings, as these intrusions may disrupt or contaminate the water supply to consumers."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00895,2020-03-06-T-012,895,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Currently, a lapse in water tank security, such as failing to lock the water tank access door, is already an offence under the Public Utilities (Water Supply) Regulations. The offence carries a maximum penalty of $10,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both. PUB can offer to compound the offence by collecting a sum not exceeding $3,000."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00896,2020-03-06-T-012,896,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Clause 10 introduces a new section 45A to provide increased deterrence and enhance the security of water tanks by raising the maximum penalty amount for such offences to a fine of $50,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both. This is in line with the maximum penalty amount for causing contamination to the water supply by PUB, or interfering with or disrupting PUB’s water supply. In addition, the maximum composition sum for such offences will also be increased from $3,000 to $10,000."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00897,2020-03-06-T-012,897,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The increased penalties will serve to remind building owners and management teams to take water tank security seriously. The vast majority of the building owners and management teams are diligent in ensuring water tank security and need not be concerned by the change.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00898,2020-03-06-T-012,898,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, in summary, PUB’s work continues to evolve. As PUB takes on a new role to defend our coasts, it also continues to diversify our water sources, digitalise its operations, and enhance water security. The proposed amendments to the Public Utilities Act that I have elaborated on in my speech are necessary to ensure that the Public Utilities Act remains effective and relevant. Ultimately, these proposed amendments will allow PUB to continue to fulfil its mission of safeguarding our water security, and ensuring a safe and reliable supply of water for all. Sir, I beg to move."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00899,2020-03-06-T-012,899,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00900,2020-03-06-T-012,900,Lee Bee Wah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, climate change and global warming have caused sea levels around the world to rise. Singapore, being a small island nation surrounded by water, is vulnerable to rising sea levels. So, we must seriously take action to protect our country and our future generations as climate change is not a distant problem. It is right on our shores."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00901,2020-03-06-T-012,901,Lee Bee Wah,"The establishment of the Coast and Flood Protection Fund is a concrete step in the right direction. It demonstrates the Government's commitment to make good judgement and give priority to Singapore’s long-term interests. I know it is tempting for some political leaders to kick the can down the road, leaving it to the next government to handle. But not this Government in Singapore."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00902,2020-03-06-T-012,902,Lee Bee Wah,"Even amidst other challenges for budget, we must not be distracted from this crucial challenge."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00903,2020-03-06-T-012,903,Lee Bee Wah,"Substantial funding is necessary to implement the coastal protection and drainage measures. During the National Day Rally last year, our Prime Minister mentioned that coastal defences may cost $100 billion or more over 100 years. What are the Government’s plans to ensure that there will be sufficient money in the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund?"
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00904,2020-03-06-T-012,904,Lee Bee Wah,"As I believe existing infrastructure will have to be enhanced, or even new infrastructure may have to be built as part of the protection measures, I hope we will tap on local resources and companies for these works? So, besides shoring up our coastal defences, we can also shore up our job creation for Singaporeans, and the local knowledge around such projects."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00905,2020-03-06-T-012,905,Lee Bee Wah,Water security is also a critical issue. The low rainfall in Singapore and droughts affecting our neighbours such as Malaysia from whom we get our water supply give rise to grave concerns.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00906,2020-03-06-T-012,906,Lee Bee Wah,There are different scenarios that can be played out  (a) reduce the supply of water to us; or (b) see the price of water going up.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00907,2020-03-06-T-012,907,Lee Bee Wah,"The PUB has been doing a good job over the years to improve our self-sufficiency on water. By this year, PUB will have three desalination plants, and three NEWater plants under the Design-Build-Own-Operate (DBOO) model. This means that a private organisation builds, owns and operates some of the facilities or structure of the plants, but there is some degree of support from the Government. Together, these plants make up a significant part of our water supply. It is important for us to strengthen oversight of these DBOO plants."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00908,2020-03-06-T-012,908,Lee Bee Wah,"I note that the amendments to the Bill will now allow PUB to be informed of, or to give approval to companies or persons gaining significant control of these critical water infrastructure. I support this as water is our critical national resource. We have to ensure that these DBOO plants are in good hands and operate reliably to meet our nation's water needs."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00909,2020-03-06-T-012,909,Lee Bee Wah,"However, given that PUB has been partnering with the private sector under the DBOO model for over 10 years, with majority of the partnerships being successful, some may wonder was the decision triggered by the situation with Hyflux? Definitely, this is a good move. Perhaps MCCY should also introduce this over our Sports Hub."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00910,2020-03-06-T-012,910,Lee Bee Wah,"The Bill also introduces powers for the Minister to issue Special Administration Orders under certain circumstances. This will allow the Government to take steps to ensure that Singapore’s water security is not compromised, such as by ensuring that the DBOO plants continue to operate regardless of circumstances. Nonetheless, the concession companies of these DBOO plants may be concerned about whether these powers will affect their rights and interests under their existing agreements with PUB. Can the Minister clarify when Special Administration Orders will be invoked, versus the existing contractual safeguards?"
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00911,2020-03-06-T-012,911,Lee Bee Wah,"Even as our Government and Public services work tirelessly to develop our self-sufficiency and grow our water supply, we must not rest on our laurels, and we certainly cannot be complacent. I would like to take this opportunity to remind everybody that water security is not the sole responsibility of the Government. Every one of us residing in Singapore, from commercial entities and organisations to individuals, must play our part to use water responsibly. Let us reduce, reuse and recycle water and do our part to mitigate the impact of climate change. Sir, in Chinese, please."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00912,2020-03-06-T-012,912,Lee Bee Wah,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The Government has a long-term vision and plan to build more barrages along our coastlines. May I ask if we could deploy more local companies to build these barrages? This will not only help our local companies, but also ensure that we have enough relevant knowledge that will be useful in time of crises."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00913,2020-03-06-T-012,913,Lee Bee Wah,"The Government also seeks to be empowered to issue Special Administration Orders to the water supply companies. This will further ensure our water security. However, it may also bring some uncertainties to relevant companies. Can the Minister clarify under what circumstances these powers will be invoked? I would like to take this opportunity to remind members of the public that protection of water resources is not just the responsibility of the Government. Everyone has a duty to save water to ensure that we have enough water resources."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00914,2020-03-06-T-012,914,Gan Thiam Poh,"Deputy Speaker, Sir, I applaud the decision to set up the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. In the face of climate change, we have not a moment to lose. Our very survival depends on future-ready infrastructure and measures to kick start sustainable solutions. Very fortunately, Singapore has had some money set aside for contingencies like this. I really thank our predecessors from the bottom of my heart. Their hard work and thrift have made it possible for us to commence on ambitious projects like this."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00915,2020-03-06-T-012,915,Gan Thiam Poh,"We have started with $5 billion for this Fund. The battle against rising sea levels will be a long-drawn-out and expensive one. Prime Minister Lee had estimated that coastal defence might cost us $100 billion or more over 100 years. How is the Government going to ensure that we will have enough money in the long haul to sustain this Fund? In addition, the Fund must be ring-fenced and protected from the vagaries of domestic politics and economic cycles. Would the Minister share what measures will be in place to ensure strict oversight and prudent utilisation of the Fund?"
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00916,2020-03-06-T-012,916,Gan Thiam Poh,"I expect that seawalls, land reclamation and planting of mangroves would be considered for different parts of our coast.  Would the Minister tell us what are some examples of the types of coastal protection and drainage infrastructure which will be financed by the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund?"
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00917,2020-03-06-T-012,917,Gan Thiam Poh,"Due to our geographical constraints, we will have to cooperate with our immediate neighbouring countries for some of these coastal works for the benefit of all people. I would like to know where would be the areas we will need to consult with neighbours before proceeding with the appropriate constructions."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00918,2020-03-06-T-012,918,Gan Thiam Poh,"Next, I welcome the relevant amendments and continual investments by both public and private sectors in our domestic water treatment capability. These will enhance our water security. However, the question remains on the feasibility of the Design-Build-Own-Operate (DBOO) model. Would the Ministry consider other models?"
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00919,2020-03-06-T-012,919,Gan Thiam Poh,"In addition, will the Ministry be able to keep the facilities financially independent and operational while the operator is struggling to keep the company going, falling short of triggering the invocation of Special Administration Orders by the Minister or seeking redress by the high court? Is the list of events of default sufficiently comprehensive? Have they been reviewed to ensure that they are not overly rigid or restrictive in order for the Minister to invoke the orders when necessary? With that, I conclude my support for the Bill."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00920,2020-03-06-T-012,920,Deputy Speaker,Minister Masagos.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00921,2020-03-06-T-012,921,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Members for the support and comments on the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill. I just want to make one comment that Er Dr Lee Bee Wah mentioned about self-sufficiency. I think we have to be careful about this word. We are not self-sufficient, but we should say we are resilient. We are resilient against weather, we are resilient against possibly climate change just to put a point across. Thank you."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00922,2020-03-06-T-012,922,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Let me run through the queries and concerns raised topically. I will begin by addressing coastal and flood protection issues first.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00923,2020-03-06-T-012,923,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked for about the Government's plans to ensure that there are sufficient funds in the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. Climate change and rising sea levels will not only affect our current generation but future generations and beyond. Coastal protection requires hefty upfront investments. But once built, they benefit many generations of Singaporeans. This is a complex and significant, long-haul effort and we need to distribute the share of funding more equitably across current and future generations."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00924,2020-03-06-T-012,924,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The $5 billion injection from this term of Government represents our generation’s contribution towards safeguarding Singapore’s continued survival. Setting up the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund now provides us with a longer runway to build up the Fund, and allows the Government to save up across successive terms. The Government will top up the Fund whenever our fiscal situation allows."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00925,2020-03-06-T-012,925,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Given the significant outlay required, the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund will not be the only source of funding. We have to use a combination of funding tools – the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, borrowing, budget from the Government-of-the-day, as well as past reserves for measures such as land reclamation. PUB is working with agencies to refine our modelling and develop more detailed plans on the type of protection measures required and the costs. This will allow the Government to better assess the funding required and financing options."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00926,2020-03-06-T-012,926,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked what measures will be in place to ensure strict oversight and prudent utilisation of the Fund.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00927,2020-03-06-T-012,927,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"First, it will be ring-fence through this legislative amendments to fund expenditures relating to coastal and drainage flood protection measures."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00928,2020-03-06-T-012,928,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second, PUB will have oversight over the management and withdrawal of the Fund. PUB will publish the Fund utilisation annually in a separate section in its financial statements."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00929,2020-03-06-T-012,929,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Third like any other large scale and complex development projects the Government undertakes coastal protection and drainage measures will continue to be subject to MOF's evaluation and prevailing approval processes.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00930,2020-03-06-T-012,930,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Finally, the Government will also employ a competitive tendering processes to ensure that the cost of the coastal protection and drainage measures implemented are value for money."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00931,2020-03-06-T-012,931,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked for some examples of the uses of the Fund. Ensuring our flood resilience will require careful planning and seamless integration of protection measures in our infrastructure. First, to prevent sea waters from flowing inland, we will need to construct structures such as sea walls, revetments, dykes, tide gates or barrages to serve as coastal defences and physical barriers. We will study the feasibility of all these options for our coastline. Where feasible, we could even integrate nature-based solutions, such as the planting of mangroves to break wave energy. While structures such as tidal gates and barrages stop sea water from flowing inland, they would likewise prevent storm water from flowing out into the sea, especially when intense rainstorms coincide with high tides. As such, we will need to install outlet pumps at some of our waterways to pump floodwaters into the sea. Finally, our vast network of inland drains must also be expanded and upgraded to cater to more intense and frequent rainfall."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00932,2020-03-06-T-012,932,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah rightly pointed out the extent of infrastructure works required to protect our coastline. She asked if we will tap on local resources and companies in this journey. Coastal protection is a new area in Singapore and capabilities will need to be built up. We will indeed have to tap on the best engineering capabilities available. Where they are not available in Singapore, we will have to bring them in, even as we grow our own talent and capabilities. The Government and industry will have to work hand in hand. We are confident that over time, we will grow a strong and vibrant local industry, just like what we did with our water sector. We hope that our local firms will proactively build up their capabilities in coastal protection, hydraulic modelling, and flood risk forecasting just to name a few areas, and to tap on these opportunities when available."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00933,2020-03-06-T-012,933,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I will next address the questions on safeguards over PUB's DBOO plants. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the feasibility of the DBOO model and whether other operating models for water plants have been considered. Besides the DBOO models, PUB also employs other models. For example, PUB employs the design and build model where it partners the private sector to design and build the plants while PUB owns and operates the plants."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00934,2020-03-06-T-012,934,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As explained in my opening speech. the DBOO model has been useful in allowing us to tap on private sector innovations and cost efficiencies to deliver water services more effectively. By combining design, build, own and operate functions in the same DBOO contract, it gives the private sector a strong incentive to ensure that the project design takes into consideration operational and other life-cycle costs."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00935,2020-03-06-T-012,935,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The DBOO model also strengthens the capacity of the private sector, just like Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has asked just now. When companies undertake DBOO projects, we hope they develop a track record that allows them to grow in our region and compete on the world stage."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00936,2020-03-06-T-012,936,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about PUB's ability to maintain oversight over concession companies which are struggling. As I had explained in this House in April 2019, even though PUB does not interfere with business decisions made by the concession companies, PUB monitors the performance of the plants under the DBOO models to ensure that the concession companies can meet the contractual obligations to PUB. Concession companies are required to submit financial reports to PUB on a regular basis. Where there are issues, PUB will require the concession companies to rectify them, failing which, PUB may exercise its right to terminate the DBOO contracts and take control of the plants. These contractual oversight will continue and, with the new legislative mechanism, will have greater assurance and oversight over our DBOO plants."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00937,2020-03-06-T-012,937,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah rightly pointed out that PUB has been partnering with the private sector under DBOO model for over 10 years. The majority of these partnerships have been successful. Given this, why the decision to introduce legislative levers over DBOO plants now? Allow me to explain."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00938,2020-03-06-T-012,938,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As part of our regular review of the safeguards over DBOO plants, we observe that, unlike other critical infrastructure, the Government did not have legislative safeguards for critical water infrastructure under the Public Utilities Act. We concluded that it would be prudent to put in place similar safeguards, especially as more DBOO plants are being completed."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00939,2020-03-06-T-012,939,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah also asked if the legislative levers over DBOO plants are triggered by the Hyflux situation. The review to enhance our oversight over DBOO plants started way before the Hyflux situation emerged. That said, the Hyflux situation was a reminder that we need to exercise proper oversight over our DBOO plants which are a key part of our water supply infrastructure and have effective levers to intervene when necessary in order to ensure Singapore's water security. As mentioned in my opening speech, PUB has in place robust contractual safeguards which allowed us to successfully execute the contractual remedies for the Tuaspring Desalination Plant."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00940,2020-03-06-T-012,940,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"With the additional legislative safeguards introduced under this Bill, we will further strengthen our oversight over critical water infrastructure and enhance our levers, in case it is necessary to intervene."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00941,2020-03-06-T-012,941,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Gan Thiam Poh also asked for elaboration on when and how Special Administration Orders will be invoked versus the existing contractual safeguards.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00942,2020-03-06-T-012,942,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB's interest is in safeguarding Singapore's water security. The grounds under which the Minister can impose Special Administration Orders are  first, the designated party is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts; second, the occurrence of a public emergency; third, the Minister considers it in the interest of the security and reliability of the supply of water in Singapore; and fourth, the Minister considers it in the public interest. These are similar to those found in a Special Administration Order regime of other essential services."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00943,2020-03-06-T-012,943,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,I would like to assure the House that the power to issue a Special Administration Order would not be exercised lightly. Such Orders are meant to ensure Singapore's water security and would be used only under exceptional circumstances. PUB will continue to rely on existing contractual remedies under the Water Purchase Agreements as far as possible.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00944,2020-03-06-T-012,944,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said in my opening speech, PUB's role continues to evolve. This Bill is an important step forward as PUB builds up its coastal and flood protection role, strengthens its oversight over water concession companies, implements smart water meters and enhances the security of our water tanks. Sir, with that, I beg to move."
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00945,2020-03-06-T-012,945,Speaker,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00946,2020-03-06-T-012,946,Lee Bee Wah,"Mr Speaker, I have one question to clarify with the Minister. Will PUB be employing more engineers so as to build up our in-house technical capability or would we be farming out the consultancy work?"
2020-03-06-T-012-S-00947,2020-03-06-T-012,947,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I think of all the agencies that I have seen, PUB is one that has always maintained strong lines of engineers. As old ones retire, new ones have learnt from them and they continue to give us the water security that we are comfortable with. With these new functions that we have taken up, we will certainly build the capabilities in-house, but we will not ignore cooperating with any other parties that can value-add to our functions."

2020-03-06-T-013-S-00953,2020-03-06-T-013,953,,Adjourned accordingly at 4.08 pm.
2020-03-06-T-014-S-00954,2020-03-06-T-014,954,Anthea Ong,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether data from the new diesel-hybrid and electric buses that have gradually been deployed since 2018 have been collated and compared, in terms of operational efficiency, reduction in tailpipe and carbon emissions, and rider feedback; and (b) which indicators will support the proportion of each vehicle type in our cleaner bus fleet by 2040."
2020-03-06-T-014-S-00955,2020-03-06-T-014,955,Khaw Boon Wan,"We are committed to having all public buses run on cleaner energy by 2040. Since March 2019, LTA has deployed 50 hybrid buses across the island. They have been well received by commuters for being quieter and providing smoother and more comfortable rides. The data collected shows that each hybrid bus can reduce tailpipe CO2"
2020-03-06-T-014-S-00956,2020-03-06-T-014,956,Khaw Boon Wan,"In addition, 60 fully electric buses will be progressively deployed this year. LTA will similarly assess these buses and calibrate our ramp-up of cleaner energy buses accordingly."
2020-03-06-T-015-S-00957,2020-03-06-T-015,957,Anthea Ong,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the measures to ensure that the public healthcare sector has sufficient psychologists; (b) what efforts are there to ensure that patients with psychiatric illnesses receive both medication and psychotherapy support as much as possible; and (c) in each of the last three years, what is the total number of patients who received support from psychologists at (i) inpatient wards in hospitals (ii) outpatient clinics in hospitals and (iii) polyclinics respectively."
2020-03-06-T-015-S-00958,2020-03-06-T-015,958,Gan Kim Yong,The Ministry of Health (MOH) works with the public healthcare institutions to attract and retain psychologists and clinical psychologists to meet the needs of persons with mental health conditions. We offer the Healthcare Graduate Studies Award (HGSA) to fresh graduates or mid-career professionals from non-healthcare backgrounds to pursue postgraduate studies in Clinical Psychology.
2020-03-06-T-015-S-00959,2020-03-06-T-015,959,Gan Kim Yong,"At the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), the provision of care to patients is holistic, comprising both medical and psychological support. The overall care plan is crafted after the patient's psychiatric condition and his psycho-social needs are assessed by the attending doctor. Based on the assessment, the patient may be prescribed medications and provided with psychotherapy support. Persons who require mental health support in the community can also tap on mental health services provided at polyclinics. The number of patients who were attended to by psychologist at polyclinics and hospitals was approximately 20,200 in 2016, 21,600 in 2017 and 22,300 in 2018.2"
2020-03-06-T-015-S-00960,2020-03-06-T-015,960,Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, community intervention teams have been established to support GP partners and community service providers with allied health services such as psycho-social therapeutic intervention, counselling and psycho-education."
2020-03-06-T-015-S-00961,2020-03-06-T-015,961,Gan Kim Yong,"MOH will continue to work with public hospitals and service providers in the community, including schools, social service agencies and family service centres, to provide holistic and timely support for persons with mental healthcare needs."
2020-03-06-T-016-S-00962,2020-03-06-T-016,962,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development in each year over the past 10 years, how many veterinarians have received (i) written warnings (ii) composition fines and (iii) suspension or revocation of their veterinary licences as a result of their failure to advise their clients about non-surgical alternatives to declawing cats and debarking dogs or to ensure that all reasonable efforts have been made to manage cat scratching or dog barking problems prior to performing any surgery."
2020-03-06-T-016-S-00963,2020-03-06-T-016,963,Lawrence Wong,"Over the past 10 years, NParks has not received reports of nor come across such behaviours by veterinarians."
2020-03-06-T-017-S-00964,2020-03-06-T-017,964,Anthea Ong,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) with respect to Singapore's 2020 air quality targets, how did we perform in 2019 for PM2.5, sulphur dioxide, ozone and nitrogen dioxide emissions; and (b) whether the Government will consider building and publishing emissions inventories for all pollutant types for better identification of the different sources of air pollutants and air quality management."
2020-03-06-T-017-S-00965,2020-03-06-T-017,965,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) benchmark Singapore's air quality against the World Health Organisation (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines (AQG). Singapore has adopted as its 2020 air quality targets the WHO AQG for particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone, and the WHO AQG's Interim Targets for PM2.5 and sulphur dioxide (SO2)."
2020-03-06-T-017-S-00966,2020-03-06-T-017,966,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Comparing Singapore's 2019 performance with the 2020 air quality targets, we met the 2020 target for NO2 and CO. For SO2, while the annual target (annual mean) was met in 2019, the maximum 24-hour mean level exceeded the limit in one day of the year (recorded at 57 µg/m3). We did not meet the 2020 targets for particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and ozone in 2019. A summary of Singapore's 2019 air quality performance in 2019 against the Singapore target by 2020 and the long term targets is shown in the table below."
2020-03-06-T-017-S-00967,2020-03-06-T-017,967,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We have implemented a suite of measures to reduce the emission of pollutants. We are tightening industrial emission standards for new and existing plants from 2015 to 2023. We have also introduced measures to manage emissions from vehicles. These include stricter standards for fuel quality and tighter emissions standards for new vehicles, as well as incentive schemes to turn over older, more pollutive vehicles and encourage the purchase of new and cleaner vehicles. We will continue to review these measures."
2020-03-06-T-017-S-00968,2020-03-06-T-017,968,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,NEA conducts emissions inventory and source apportionment modelling studies to identify key sources of air pollutants in Singapore and develop air quality management strategies. These internal studies help us fine-tune and improve our air quality management strategies.
2020-03-06-T-018-S-00969,2020-03-06-T-018,969,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will study the possibility of introducing a minimum staff-to-child ratio at places of safety to ensure children residing there receive the necessary care and support.
2020-03-06-T-018-S-00970,2020-03-06-T-018,970,Desmond Lee,Children in need of care or protection may be referred by MSF or ordered by the Youth Court to reside in licensed Homes that are gazetted as places of safety under the Children and Young Persons Act.
2020-03-06-T-018-S-00971,2020-03-06-T-018,971,Desmond Lee,"MSF imposes standards of care on these licensed homes, and regularly reviews the standards to ensure that the needs of children and young persons are adequately met. The current standards stipulate a minimum ratio of one care staff to every 10 children (""care ratio""), during the hours that children are scheduled to be awake. At night, when the care needs of the children are lower, the minimum care ratio is one care staff to every 20 children."
