2020-03-26-T-001,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Education (a) what percentage of (i) Primary schools (ii) Secondary schools and (iii) post-secondary educational institutions currently have at least one lactation room; and (b) whether the Ministry can make it compulsory for all schools and educational institutions to have at least one lactation room.,1,1,2020-03-26-T-001-S-00001
2020-03-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"Mr Speaker, Sir, MOE is committed to providing a conducive workplace for nursing mothers. This includes providing schools with lactation facilities, which has become a standard building specification for MOE.",1,2,2020-03-26-T-001-S-00002
2020-03-26-T-001,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. Can I just check whether these are specifically lactation rooms? So, it is only for the mothers to use and not just a spare room where the mothers can go in to express the milk. Secondly, can I also just check whether there is a fridge in all of these rooms so that they can store their milk after that?",1,3,2020-03-26-T-001-S-00003
2020-03-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Member Mr Louis Ng for his care and concern for mothers. As a mother of two kids, and I have breastfed my two kids for slightly over a year, I can understand what it takes to persevere in the breastfeeding journey. For example, the breastfeeding cycle and also the schedule, from expressing and then storing the milk – and the Member asked about the fridge – transporting the precious milk and also all the gadgets that are involved, especially for mothers who need to express milk in their office, workplace and in this case, in the school.",1,4,2020-03-26-T-001-S-00004
2020-03-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For the two questions that the Member has, I want to assure him that MOE has made it a priority to equip our teachers who are mothers and who are breastfeeding with the facility and the support that they need.",2,5,2020-03-26-T-001-S-00005
2020-03-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Let me be clear. Since 2010, the requirement for a lactation room was added to the building specification for Primary schools as part of the PERI upgrading. This is a standard building specification  lactation room in the school. Subsequently, the same building specification for Secondary schools and also Junior Colleges were similarly updated with the same requirement. So, yes. These are lactation rooms, not meant to be multi-purpose for other reasons.",3,6,2020-03-26-T-001-S-00006
2020-03-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Schools that were built or upgraded before 2010 will also be provided with a lactation room as part of their on-going or scheduled PERI upgrading for Primary schools; likewise, for the Secondary schools and the Junior Colleges, when the institutions next undergo rebuilding or major upgrading. For the lactation rooms, we will provide the necessary facilities and also the fridges; if not in the lactation room, then maybe in the Staff Lounge. We would then have to work with the teachers who are mothers and are breastfeeding to make sure that they will label the bottles accordingly.",4,7,2020-03-26-T-001-S-00007
2020-03-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The other thing I wish to reassure the Member is, I gave the numbers for Primary schools and Secondary schools. What is very heartening is that to-date, all our IHLs have lactation facilities. In fact, some of the bigger campuses have more than one lactation room. I want to assure the Member that MOE will certainly continue to work with the existing schools to ensure that all schools will have lactation rooms at the nearest feasible date. The target for us, really, is for every school to have lactation facilities within the next three years.",5,8,2020-03-26-T-001-S-00008
2020-03-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,I also want to assure the Member that we in MOE appreciate the sacrifices that mothers make for their children and we will wholeheartedly support their breastfeeding journey.,6,9,2020-03-26-T-001-S-00009
2020-03-26-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there are any regulations that prohibit mothers from breastfeeding their children in public.,1,10,2020-03-26-T-002-S-00010
2020-03-26-T-002,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Mr Speaker, there is no law that strictly prohibits mothers to breastfeed their children in public in Singapore.",1,11,2020-03-26-T-002-S-00011
2020-03-26-T-002,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Indecent exposure and appearing nude in public are criminal offences. Mothers who are genuinely breastfeeding their children, in public are generally unlikely to fall under these categories. It is not possible to be more specific than that. To determine if any offences might be made out, Police would need to ascertain the specific facts of each case and the circumstances.",2,12,2020-03-26-T-002-S-00012
2020-03-26-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply but I am a bit confused. She said they are generally not going to be prosecuted, if I am right to say that. So, could I just ask specifically, whether a mother who is breastfeeding her baby in the public without a cover – would that be liable to prosecution?",1,13,2020-03-26-T-002-S-00013
2020-03-26-T-002,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,Breastfeeding in public places is not against the law. The Police will not intervene unless there are law and order concerns.,1,14,2020-03-26-T-002-S-00014
2020-03-26-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Transport whether mothers are allowed to breastfeed their children onboard public trains and buses.,1,15,2020-03-26-T-003-S-00015
2020-03-26-T-003,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Speaker, Sir, breastfeeding is not prohibited on our public buses and trains. For those who prefer privacy while breastfeeding, we provide nursing rooms at key transport nodes and will continue to build more.",1,16,2020-03-26-T-003-S-00016
2020-03-26-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.,1,17,2020-03-26-T-003-S-00017
2020-03-26-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir, and this is the last question on breastfeeding. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for saying that it is not prohibited on our trains and buses. But as I shared with him, the SMRT website still says this today to an FAQ, ""Can I breastfeed or feed my children?"" And the reply is, ""For the comfort of other passengers, it is best to feed your children before entering our stations."" So, if it is not prohibited, then, could we not send the message to say that it is best not to do it?",1,18,2020-03-26-T-003-S-00018
2020-03-26-T-003,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, as in my reply, there is no prohibition. Mothers are allowed to breastfeed their babies and children on buses and trains. We will advise the PTOs to be clearer in their websites or FAQs so that mothers are not deterred from doing so.",1,19,2020-03-26-T-003-S-00019
2020-03-26-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,One last supplementary question. Can I also just confirm that they are allowed to breastfeed their babies without a cover on?,1,20,2020-03-26-T-003-S-00020
2020-03-26-T-003,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Sir, there is no regulation for mothers to be covered up while nursing their babies on trains and buses.",1,21,2020-03-26-T-003-S-00021

Let me elaborate on the three key legislative changes contained in the Bill.",2,25,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00025
2020-03-26-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"The first change relates to the transfer of awards between companies.

Clause 4 of this Bill introduces a new Part IV to the Act for the transfer of the Pioneer Industry award, Pioneer Service award and Development and Expansion award between companies. Under this framework, such award granted to the transferee will be treated as a continuation of the award granted to the transferor.",4,27,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00027

2020-03-26-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"However, we are entering a new era of increasing volatility and disruption. We are in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic as we speak but I fear the climate crisis will unleash chaos and food supply disruptions that dwarf what we have seen. Yet there exists enormous growth opportunities for technologies that the world needs to exit the climate crisis and enter a world of peace and stability.",2,36,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00036
2020-03-26-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),Is the EEIA able to attract the kind of investments and innovation that will allow Singapore to demonstrate climate leadership and ride on the low-carbon wave? There are two parts to this question that I hope the Minister can address.,3,37,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00037
2020-03-26-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"EEIA provides tax relief for pioneering economic activities as well as a wide range of capital investments. My first point, Mr Speaker, relates to whether the EEIA extends incentives to high-carbon activities so that the tax relief may end up as a subsidy to the fossil fuel industry.",4,38,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00038
2020-03-26-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean recently announced Singapore's goal of achieving net zero emissions ""as soon as viable in the second half of the century"". Senior Minister Teo himself admitted that this goal is ""very challenging"". Yet even this goal falls short of the target of net zero by 2050 that IPCC estimates would limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avert the worst impacts of climate change.",5,39,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00039
2020-03-26-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"To have even the slightest hope of meeting this target, we have to stop incentivising investments that will lock in decades of high carbon emissions.",6,40,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00040
2020-03-26-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally last year announced we would probably need $100 billion to protect ourselves against rising sea levels. This year’s Budget has already allocated $5 billion to the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. It would be unthinkable if we gave out tax relief to the same activities that will force us to spend more on coastal and flood protection. I would imagine this would give Deputy Prime Minister Heng a bit of a headache trying to balance the Budget.,7,41,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00041
2020-03-26-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Could the Minister clarify whether the qualifying criteria for tax relief under the EEIA considers the long-term impacts on Singapore? In particular, is there consideration for whether the activity would lead to an increase in carbon emissions?",8,42,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00042
2020-03-26-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"EDB has published its assessment criteria for pioneer certificate incentives under the EEIA, which includes employment created and spin-off to the economy. For high-carbon sectors, even such economic benefits are not assured. In 2015, when oil prices fell below US$50 per barrel, the oil and gas sector cut an estimated 15,000 jobs. With oil prices bottoming out again this year, ExxonMobil has said it will make significant cuts to spending.",9,43,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00043
2020-03-26-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"As climate action accelerates across the world, demand for fossil fuel products may reduce sharply. For example, with countries around the world, including Singapore, moving towards full electrification of their land transport system, demand for diesel and petrol is expected to drop. Researchers from Columbia University forecasted that passenger vehicle oil demand would decline beyond 2025. For the lowest low-carbon scenario in their 2019 study, oil demand in this sector would decline from about 25 million barrels per day today to 10 million barrels per day in 2040.",10,44,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00044

My second point, Mr Speaker, therefore relates to incentives for innovations and investments that are aligned with a carbon-neutral economy. Section 67 of the EEIA currently lists activities eligible for investment allowances. These include reducing consumption of water and improving energy efficiency. Unfortunately, this leaves out a wide range of capital expenditure investments that contribute to Singapore's long-term sustainability, such as renewable energy, active mobility, as well as waste reduction.",13,47,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00047
2020-03-26-T-004,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"While there are grants available for some of these activities, such as the 3R fund for waste recycling and reduction, this should not preclude the option to use investment allowances as an additional incentive.",14,48,2020-03-26-T-004-S-00048

2020-03-26-T-005,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Earlier, I had already explained the reasons for the amendment, which is to broaden the purposes of the GST Voucher Fund, in order to enable the Assurance Package to be implemented to cushion the impact of the GST rate increase. I also emphasised that we will continue to provide more support to lower income Singaporeans through the existing permanent GST Voucher scheme. So, the policy intent of ensuring that lower income Singaporeans get more support remains unchanged and Assoc Prof Walter Theseira can be assured that we are not moving away from this.",3,129,2020-03-26-T-005-S-00129
2020-03-26-T-005,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In his Budget 2020 Statement, Deputy Prime Minister Heng, in fact, reiterated our public commitment for this permanent GST Voucher scheme. He said that it would fully offset the GST for the lower half of retiree households. It would significantly offset the GST for the upper half of retiree households and it would offset about half of the GST for lower income households with no elderly persons. So, that is our commitment. When the GST rate is increased, we will enhance the permanent GST Voucher scheme to continue to meet this commitment. And as part of the review to work out the likely enhancements, we will carefully study the impact of the increased GST and the GST Voucher on Singaporeans, as Assoc Prof Theseira has suggested.",4,130,2020-03-26-T-005-S-00130
2020-03-26-T-005,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In Budget 2020, we also made clear the Government's commitment to cushion the increase for Singaporeans as we transition to the higher GST rate. As our fiscal resources are limited, we will have to put Singaporeans first when we think about how to allocate these resources. We will have to prioritise support for our citizens. This reflects the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship and also acknowledges our citizens' commitment to Singapore.",5,131,2020-03-26-T-005-S-00131
2020-03-26-T-005,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ms Anthea Ong shared her concern for migrant workers who reside in Singapore. I understand her concerns. These are workers here for employment. Like all foreign work pass holders, they will have to pay the increased GST rate from the onset, compared to Singaporeans, who will effectively see a delay in the GST increase for at least five years after offsets.",6,132,2020-03-26-T-005-S-00132
2020-03-26-T-005,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We do appreciate the contributions of migrant workers to our economy. Many of them seek employment here to give their families back home a better life. While they have to pay GST, they also benefit from job opportunities here. Rather than extend GST Vouchers to this group, we will have to look at other ways where we can address more directly the concerns and needs that migrant workers have, bearing in mind that there are also many organisations out there that play an important role in looking out for the well-being of migrant workers and ensuring that they are treated fairly and have good working conditions. So, these organisations continue to do good work and the Government will see how we can continue to work with these organisations to look out for the well-being of our migrant workers.",7,133,2020-03-26-T-005-S-00133
2020-03-26-T-005,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ms Joan Pereira asked whether we could consider exempting GST for a list of vital healthcare items and assistive devices used by the elderly. I will address this briefly as it does not really directly relate to the Bill. We have a broad-based GST system with minimal exemptions and we have chosen this approach so as to keep the GST rate relatively low while we provide targeted assistance to the lower income and the elderly through subsidies and grants. In fact, Assoc Prof Theseira has helped to explain why we think this is a better approach and meets the objective of helping those who need help.",8,134,2020-03-26-T-005-S-00134
2020-03-26-T-005,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Today, we already absorb GST for all subsidised patients for medical services and medications in polyclinics, public hospitals or intermediate and long-term care and we will continue to do so with the GST increase.Seniors currently receive more benefits under the GST Voucher scheme through annual MediSave top-ups. Seniors also receive significant support for their healthcare costs through other subsidies. Seniors who need assistive devices and home care consumables can tap on the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund and the Home Caregiving Grant which Ms Pereira has also highlighted. Additional help, such as through ComCare and MediFund, would be made available to those who require further financial assistance. Of course, seniors can also approach the agency for integrated care, for advice on the available support.",9,135,2020-03-26-T-005-S-00135

2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"""Mr Speaker. Hon Members. This is my first message to Parliament as custodian of the Government's past reserves. Shortly after this message, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat will be announcing the Government's proposed measures under the second assistance package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The package, which is before this House for debate, is a substantial one. The Government has tabled a Supplementary Supply Bill to support the package, which is likely to result in a draw on past reserves, and I have given my in-principle support for the draw.",2,154,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00154
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Since we established the reserves protection framework in 1991, we have had to draw on past reserves just once, during the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, when we used them to fund part of the Resilience Package. Then-President S R Nathan approved a draw of $4.9 billion to fund two temporary and extraordinary measures. Apart from helping to avert an even sharper downturn and prevent a permanent damage to our economy, that draw was an instructive one on how we could operationalise the reserves protection framework. During that period, the Government also sought the President’s concurrence to use $150 billion of past reserves to back the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. The guarantee was not triggered, and there was no draw on past reserves.",3,155,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00155
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"But every situation is unique. Our current crisis is unparalleled in modern history. Governments around the world have had to think hard and make unprecedented moves over the past few weeks, such as locking down an entire country.",4,156,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00156
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Similarly, my in-principle support for the Government’s present proposal was given after careful deliberations, considering the grave circumstances and highly uncertain outlook. I have therefore agreed with the Prime Minister that I should send this message to Parliament to state my views on the Government’s proposed draw on its past reserves. In particular, I want to share my considerations on whether the proposed draw is necessary, whether the measures will be effective and whether the process by which the Government has engaged me was a reasonable one. However, let me be clear upfront  my message is not meant to influence the Parliamentary discussion that follows. I urge hon Members of this House to debate the package rigorously and help sharpen the proposed measures, because ultimately we are all trying our best for Singapore and Singaporeans.",5,157,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00157
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Under the Constitution, my custodial duty as the President is clear – I have the responsibility and discretion to withhold my assent to budgets and expenditures that are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves. The question is, are we now faced with such exceptional circumstances that I should allow the draw on past reserves?",6,158,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00158
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,We ended 2019 on a cautiously optimistic note. It seemed then that the global economy was finally poised for recovery following a year of subdued growth caused by US-China trade tensions.,7,159,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00159
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"The COVID-19 outbreak totally changed that outlook. By mid-February, the situation was already rather gloomy. MTI had already had to downgrade the GDP forecast by one full percentage-point at that time. When the Government came to brief me about Budget 2020, we discussed the option of drawing on past reserves if the situation worsens, but did not do it immediately as current reserves were still sufficient for the scale of the package envisaged then.",8,160,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00160
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"However, since then, we have had successive waves of bad news. Just when the COVID-19 situation in China seemed to be stabilising, a new wave of cases started in the rest of the world. Europe has become a new epicentre. Cases in the US are growing quickly too. WHO has declared the outbreak as a pandemic. The drastic measures taken by countries to protect borders and lock down societies have had serious repercussions. Already overdue for a market correction, share markets worldwide have fallen sharply. We are faced with a double whammy of a worldwide public health emergency and a deepening economic crisis. This downturn is likely to be deeper and last longer than SARS and the 2009 Global Financial Crisis.",9,161,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00161
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"This economic shock is totally different from an ordinary business cycle downturn. From talking to Singaporeans and unions, it is clear to me that companies and workers are suffering badly. For example, the hotel occupancy rate is only 20% currently. Many airlines, including SIA, have grounded almost all their planes due to massive flight cancellations. Many self-employed workers in the gig economy are not getting jobs. Production lines in factories are stalling due to supply chain disruptions, exacerbating their already tight cash-flow situation.",10,162,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00162

2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"With the unprecedented and rapidly worsening of the global situation, the Government has assessed that we need to implement a substantial second support package swiftly to stabilise our economy, keep as many workers as possible employed and help viable enterprises to survive. Deputy Prime Minister Heng will share the details of this second package later, but based on what he has briefed me, it is a substantial one – beyond the current reserves accumulated in this term of Government.",12,164,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00164
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Our reserves were built up over the years through prudent spending and were set aside precisely to cater for rainy days. The situation we are heading into looks more like a thunderstorm than a drizzle.,13,165,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00165
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"In this crisis, it is the Government’s responsibility to come up with relevant and impactful measures.

2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"To arrive at my in-principle decision, I reviewed the Government’s proposal with my Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA). We agreed that we need to help companies with their costs and cash-flow, to keep them afloat in the meantime. This is especially so for aviation, travel and tourism, and related industries, which are especially badly hit.",15,167,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00167

2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Already a month ago, I have discussed this possibility with the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Heng. Two weeks ago, the Prime Minister sounded me out on the need for the second assistance package, which the Government was proposing to fund from a combination of current and past reserves. Thereafter, the various agencies including MOF, AGD, MTI, MAS, MOH, MOT and MOM briefed me and the CPA, and comprehensively answered our queries.",18,170,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00170
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"After the briefing, the CPA deliberated on the proposal to draw on past reserves to support the package. The CPA unanimously recommended that I give my in-principle support given the circumstances, and noted that the proposed measures are temporary in nature. I have independently come to the same conclusion. I have therefore given my in-principle support for the Government’s proposal to draw on its past reserves.",19,171,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00171
2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"The due process following this is that the Supplementary Estimates and Supplementary Supply (FY2020) Bill should first pass through this Parliament.

2020-03-26-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Understandably, we are uncertain about what lies ahead of us. But we should not be fearful. We have done well as a nation. Internationally, our response to COVID-19 has been viewed as being systematic and effective. I am also glad that Singapore has banded together in fighting this disease. Singaporeans are responding calmly and responsibly. The Government has been open and transparent. And the community has stepped up to help those who may be more vulnerable. In these worst of times, I am heartened to see the best of Singaporeans.",23,175,2020-03-26-T-009-S-00175

2020-03-26-T-012,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Out of every 10 residents, let us say eight are citizens, two are PRs. That is lower than the real proportion but it makes the math a bit easier. So, there are four citizens for each PR. That means average earnings of citizens counts for four times as much as the average earnings of a PR when you compute the average earnings of residents overall.",21,415,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00415
2020-03-26-T-012,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"There is a $0.50 difference between citizen and resident earnings. You multiply that by four times, you get $2. That is actually the difference between PR and resident earnings.",22,416,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00416

I estimate the PR employment rate rose from about 70% to 74% over the last decade, compared to a rise from about 60% to 63% for citizens.

2020-03-26-T-012,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Are PR jobs stable? The answer is no, not relative to citizens. The estimated retrenchment rate for PRs is actually much higher than that for citizens. On average, a citizen is just above half as likely as a PR to be retrenched. The citizen retrenchment estimate would go up if you assume that 10% of citizens are self-employed, but not by so much as to cover this gap.",29,423,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00423

My estimates suggest PRs are more skilled, earn more, but also face more economic risks than citizens as they are much more likely to be retrenched. There is little surprising about the first few points I made because PRs are often granted based on economic criteria. If our selection of PRs is good, it is logical that they are going to do better on average in the labour market than citizens do.",30,424,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00424

2020-03-26-T-012,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, I have described a very incomplete picture of the relative labour market outcomes of PRs and citizens. Most economists would argue the net effect of immigration is positive for the Singapore economy. The problem is that the net effect may hide substantial redistribution to the incomes and wealth of many Singaporeans. Some Singaporeans will have skills that are complemented by immigration and will have better job opportunities and wages, but others may see their job prospects harmed by competition for jobs that immigrants are also highly skilled in. Many Singaporeans also own assets ranging from property to stakes in businesses. These too benefit from immigration, so it affects wealth and not just the labour market.",32,426,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00426

Respondents also felt strongly that immigrants were not doing enough to integrate. Close to 40% of respondents felt that immigration issues, if mismanaged, could lead to communal anger; a decreased sense of national identity; and a fall in trust in Government. There was, moreover, broad support for increased Government intervention to address immigration issues.",34,428,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00428
2020-03-26-T-012,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"What might a successful Government intervention look like? I believe we must confront the facts. There are distributional consequences of immigration and despite our best efforts at calibrating immigration flows and manpower policy, some Singaporeans will be better off and some worse off. We need research that documents how immigrants have contributed to our economy, as well as how immigrants have affected employment prospects and outcomes of locals. We need to understand who among our immigrants decides to put down roots in Singapore and who does not stay, and how they assimilate over time. And we need to be prepared to grant targeted help to locals whom we discover are adversely affected by immigration, because the net positives of immigration for the country do not mean anything if your own livelihood is affected.",35,429,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00429

2020-03-26-T-012,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"We should not be surprised, then, if the immigrants we attract with this mindset likewise think of Singapore as a means and not as an end. We must build an alternative narrative that stresses building a common future together, not preserving a comfortable past.",38,432,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00432
2020-03-26-T-012,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, Singapore is and will continue to be an immigrant nation. But to retain our vibrancy and relevance we must move forward as a country that treats immigrants as potential contributors and partners in developing the Singapore of tomorrow. We need an immigration policy that allows the Singapore – and Singaporeans – of tomorrow to be a better version of who we are today. With a fact- and research-based approach to immigration policy, education and engagement of Singaporeans and an outstretched hand to immigrants who want to join us in this journey, I believe we can build on today's Singapore for a better tomorrow.",39,433,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00433

2020-03-26-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"This is essential to keep our society strong and our economy vibrant, both of which are important foundations to improve the lives of Singaporeans.

2020-03-26-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Our immigration policy does not serve just economic objectives.

2020-03-26-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Applicants who can make good economic contributions are certainly welcome, but that is not the sole criterion we consider. Many of our new Permanent Residents (PR) and citizens have family ties with Singaporeans. Most have lived here for many years, formed friendships with locals and are active in the community. From an integration standpoint, these ties are very valuable and we cannot put a number to it easily, we cannot quantify it through any simple metric.",6,440,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00440
2020-03-26-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Assoc Prof Theseira pointed out that PRs generally have higher incomes and qualifications than existing citizens.

2020-03-26-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"As I pointed out earlier, we prioritise those with the ability to integrate well into our society and who have expressed their longer term commitment to Singapore. Secondly, are we better off if the opposite were true, that PRs generally have lower incomes and qualifications? Keep in mind that we draw new citizens from the pool of PRs. If that were so, Assoc Prof Theseira, or anyone else, might well ask, quite legitimately, why we are taking in Permanent Residents, or residents who are not as well qualified as Singaporeans or were not doing as well as Singaporeans.",8,442,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00442

2020-03-26-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"While we do take in a calibrated number of PRs and new citizens, we are first and foremost focused on improving citizens’ lives. There is a very broad spectrum of things we do to uplift our people and that includes raising educational attainment and growing incomes. Our people have shown consistently that when given the opportunities, they are willing to make the effort and they do well. If while we improve our own educational attainments and incomes, we also manage to attract people with good qualifications and incomes to join our Singapore family as PRs and eventually citizens, is that not a good outcome? Rationally, one would think so but, of course, you can disagree.",11,445,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00445

If we come across good research that can help us in policy-thinking, we would certainly look into them deeply and welcome useful suggestions. Today, Singapore is in a good position. Every year, the number of applications for PR and citizenship far exceed the number of places that we grant. We can afford to remain selective as long as Singapore continues to be an attractive and welcoming place for immigrants.",12,446,2020-03-26-T-012-S-00446

2020-03-26-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Not all MRT stations and bus interchanges need to be provided with nursing rooms as many of them are adjacent to major developments with nursing rooms, such as shopping centres and libraries.

These include maintaining and cleaning their stalls regularly, and having proper infrastructure in place to safely prepare, handle and sell food. Hawkers and their assistants who handle food must also pass the Basic Food Hygiene Course, which equips them with relevant food safety and hygiene knowledge, including proper food handling and good personal hygiene practices. SFA conducts regular inspections to ensure that the regulations are adhered to.",1,457,2020-03-26-T-014-S-00457
2020-03-26-T-014,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The National Environment Agency (NEA) also encourages best practices for the cleaning of hawker centres, such as the use of two separate cloths for table cleaning, as well as sanitising and soaking of cleaning cloths in household bleach at the correct concentration according to manufacturer's instructions. Following the SARS episode in 2003, NEA has also instituted quarterly ""spring cleaning"" for all hawker centres, where hawkers are required to clean up their stalls and the centre is closed for thorough cleaning, such as high pressure jet-wash of the whole centre and cleaning of hard-to-reach surfaces.",2,458,2020-03-26-T-014-S-00458

Last month, the national SG Clean campaign was launched to rally all Singaporeans to keep Singapore clean. As part of the campaign, NEA and SFA introduced sanitation and hygiene checklists for hawker centres and stalls which highlight key practices to safeguard hygiene and reduce contamination risks. Practices include regular cleaning of premises, especially frequent touch points or heavily soiled areas, and sanitisation of food preparation surfaces, utensils and cooking equipment. Hawker centres and stalls that adhere to the checklists will be awarded the ""SG Clean"" quality mark. To date, 19 hawker centres and one in five hawker stalls have been certified ""SG Clean"". We will audit all hawker centres and stalls for the ""SG Clean"" quality mark standards by this year.",3,459,2020-03-26-T-014-S-00459

For preschools with older children (for example kindergartens) and preschools with more working mothers, the need for a lactation room within the centre itself may be less pressing. For others, we encourage preschools to consider setting up a lactation room or making space arrangements for breastfeeding, as and when the need arises.",1,469,2020-03-26-T-015-S-00469
