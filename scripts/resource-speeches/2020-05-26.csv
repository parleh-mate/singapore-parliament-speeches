2020-05-26-T-001,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Ministry will consider downloading direct funding to arts companies to weather the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to grant applications for projects.",1,2,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00002
2020-05-26-T-001,Terence Ho Wee San,Mr Terence Ho Wee San,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Ministry can provide a breakdown on how the Solidarity Budget of $55 million is to be used in the relief and recovery measures for artiste and arts groups.",1,3,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00003

2020-05-26-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Thank you. The arts and culture community, like many other sectors, has been significantly affected by COVID-19. The Government has introduced support measures under the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budgets to protect livelihoods, help businesses overcome immediate challenges and strengthen economic and social resilience during this period, including the extended circuit breaker. Artists and arts groups can tap on these broad-based measures such as the Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), SEP Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) and COVID-19 Support Grant. They can also defer income tax payments and mortgage instalments, as well as seek rental relief for commercial or industrial property leases.",1,6,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00006
2020-05-26-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Besides the above generic schemes under the three Budgets, NAC has committed to sustained levels of funding to arts organisations under the Major Company and Seed Grant schemes. To plan ahead for the post-COVID-19 recovery, NAC’s regular project grants, including those for art creation and research, continue to be available. Our practitioners have also given us feedback that they want to undertake meaningful work, rather than receive direct hand-outs.",2,7,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00007
2020-05-26-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"The $55 million Arts and Culture Resilience Package (ACRP) announced by Minister Grace Fu on 7 April 2020 will provide additional support to the arts and culture community. ACRP plays a complementary role by supporting our cultural practitioners to develop resilience and position our sector well for the future. The ACRP seeks to protect the arts and culture ecosystem and will provide support and opportunities for our cultural organisations and practitioners until the end of the year, while encouraging the development of longer term capabilities that will help the community emerge stronger after COVID-19. For example, the Capability Development Scheme for the Arts (CDSA) supports training programmes until 31 December 2020.",3,8,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00008
2020-05-26-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"A key component of the ACRP is the Digitalisation Fund. It supports digital commissions and new works to be showcased at our major festivals such as Silver Arts, Singapore Writers Festival and Singapore Art Week. To date, eight commissions with key partners such as Lianhe Zaobao, Hear65 and VIDDSEE have been lined up in the coming months under the #SGCultureAnywhere campaign.",4,9,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00009
2020-05-26-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Projects have also benefited from the Digital Presentation Grant for the Arts, such as the Jazz Association Singapore’s well-received online concert in celebration of UNESCO International Jazz Day on 30 April 2020, which attracted almost 100,000 viewers locally and abroad. Since applications opened on 14 April 2020, 62 projects have been supported. Overall, the Digitalisation Fund aims to generate over 1,000 opportunities for cultural and related practitioners, including in the post-Circuit Breaker period. The allocation for each area of support under the ACRP will depend on the evolving national situation, as well as the needs and demands of the arts and culture community.",5,10,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00010
2020-05-26-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Another component of the ACRP is the CDSA, which enables our cultural practitioners to access a wide range of subsidised courses, including online programmes, as well as providing income to those who are trainers themselves. Since the CDSA opened on 16 March 2020, 163 training programmes have been supported. I am heartened that many of our experienced artists and cultural practitioners, such as Maestro Yeh Tsung, Chong Tze Chien and Checkpoint Theatre, have stepped forward to share their experience through virtual masterclasses and online training.",6,11,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00011
2020-05-26-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Speaker, the arts and culture can uplift our spirits in these difficult times, provide comfort, and sustain our emotional and physical well-being. The warm response from viewers to online content of past shows by groups such as Pangdemonium and Nine Years Theatre, as well as programmes for children by The Storytelling Centre and Artground, is testament to the power and value of the arts. I urge larger and more established groups with deeper capabilities to help the smaller ones and individual practitioners, and ask that corporations, foundations and members of the public continue supporting the arts.",7,12,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00012

I believe the buskers have been quite heavily affected. They have been unable to perform for the past two months and likely, will be unable to perform for the next few months as well.",1,14,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00014
2020-05-26-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Indeed, the buskers form part of the arts community that NAC and MCCY have been reaching out to. We are aware that buskers are also affected because they are not able to perform in open spaces now. Recently, as part of our youth outreach initiative through *SCAPE, they have provided an online platform for buskers to perform and reach online viewers. We have gotten response that through the online platform, they have been able to perform to a wider community; and hopefully, this will also become their fans and supporters in the post-COVID-19 period. We continue to look out for the needs of the various members of the arts community, including the buskers, and see how we can help them better.",1,15,2020-05-26-T-001-S-00015
2020-05-26-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Minister for Health (a) in respect of a woman who is older than 40 years old, why is she required to have attempted assisted reproduction or intra-uterine insemination (IUI) procedures before age 40 to be eligible for Government co-funded Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) procedures; and (b) whether this requirement can be removed as women are marrying later.",1,16,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00016
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Health),"The Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) co-funding scheme was introduced to support couples who face difficulty in conceiving naturally. In January 2020, the scheme was enhanced to allow couples who have attempted assisted reproduction (AR) or Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI) procedures before 40 years old to tap on up to two of the six co-funded ART cycles for AR procedures at age 40 or later.",1,17,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00017
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Health),"The age criterion of 40 years old is set based on current clinical evidence which shows that the chance of conception for a woman who undergoes ART treatment decreases with age, with significantly lower success rate after 40. The ART co-funding is therefore directed towards those who attempted their first assisted reproduction procedure before age 40. Couples are encouraged to start their families early. Those with difficulty conceiving should also consider fertility or ART treatment early.",2,18,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00018

2020-05-26-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. I have a few supplementary questions. First, for those who marry late, for example, if they marry at age 40, it is impossible to meet the requirement to carry out IUI before age 40. Will this be considered? The second question is, residents tell me that they are normally encouraged to do IUI first, and then IVF, as IUI is less invasive but the success rate is much lower. I would like to ask what is the success rate for IUI and IVF respectively. The third question is, can the Ministry encourage people to go straight for IVF for those age 35 and above, so as not to waste time and money? I was told the process to make appointment could take a few months to a year. There is one more question, can Ministry remove the requirement of having to go through at least two rounds of IUI before going for IVF? Give couples an option to go for IVF directly and this can save the women time and inconvenience.",1,21,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00021
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for her four supplementary questions. I will take the question about the requirement for couples to go through either IUI or AR before age 40, before they are eligible for co-funding for AR procedure in our public AR centres at age 40 or above. First, let me say that we recognise that more couples are getting married later and they do have parenthood aspirations. But unfortunately, even though there have been improvements in technology as well as better understanding of treatment needs, embryo culture and so on, the empirical evidence still shows that the success rate is very much linked to when the procedures are performed on the women.",1,22,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00022
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The Member asked about success rates. For IVF, for instance, our latest data, 2018 data, show that the success rate of live births arising from IVF drops from around 23% for women age 30 to 34 years, to around 6% for women age 40 to 44 years; in fact, even further down to 0.6% for women age 45 and older. So, when we put the age criterion of 40 years, as I have said, we recognise that people are getting married later, and we do not want to put too low a cut-off age. The experts also feel that age 40 is reasonable, given the empirical evidence before them. Therefore, this age criterion, together with the requirement that couples need to have already tried AR or IUI before age 40 to qualify for this co-funding, really, the intent is to balance the need to support and encourage couples to receive AR procedures early for higher chance of success and at the same time, also, to support the needs of older couples who want to try for a child. It is a balanced approach, taking into account the scientific data and the social trends as well as the developments to date.",2,23,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00023
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We will continue to monitor the clinical evidence and where appropriate, we will update the eligibility criteria.",3,24,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00024
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to the IUI co-funding, we only introduced this in January 2020. It was done to enhance our support for couples who have difficulties conceiving naturally. IUI, as the Member has rightly pointed out, is a less invasive procedure. So, depending on the assessment of the doctors, they will be advised whether they can go through IUI with co-funding up to three cycles before going to IVF, which is up to six cycles.",4,25,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00025
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I do not have the success rates for IUI here, but I can give the information to the Member later.",5,26,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00026
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"There was also a question of couples marrying beyond age 40 and then, they are not eligible. They are not eligible for the Government co-funding scheme. But they still can use MediSave. So, for couples who want to go through ACP including ART and IVF, they can withdraw from MediSave up to a lifetime limit of $15,000. That does not have any age cap nor limit to the number of cycles. It is only for the Government co-funding that they will not be eligible for. The reason is because we need also to be mindful of the effectiveness of such financial support extended through Government co-funding. This has to be based objectively on the empirical evidence before us.",6,27,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00027

2020-05-26-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Sir. I agree with the Senior Minister of State that we need to be very careful with the funding. But I have one question, my second question earlier, for those who are aged 35 and above, instead of asking them to go through IUI, can we let them have an option to go for IVF? Many of them say that the success rate for IUI is very low and it is a waste of their time as their biological clock is not with them. Maybe the Ministry can consider letting them choose, give them an option to go for IVF straightaway.",1,29,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00029
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have said, my understanding is whether to go IUI before going to IVF really depends on the doctors' assessment. I will have to stand corrected, but I do not think there is a policy that couples definitely have to go through IUI before IVF. But as the Member has also pointed out and also according to my understanding, IUI is less invasive, so it may be something that doctors advise them to try before going through AR procedures. As I have also said, even for AR, for women younger than age 30, where the success rate is highest, it is actually about 24%.",1,30,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00030

2020-05-26-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. I agree with the Senior Minister of State that our policies should be based on science. But science also tells us that stress faced is a key factor in determining whether an IVF is successful. I think a lot of the couples are very stressed because of the finances involved in an IVF cycle. If MOH can then provide the subsidies, reduce the stress, then, maybe we will have a higher percentage of success for IVF cycles for those age 40 and above.",1,32,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00032
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for his questions. The fact is that we introduced the Government co-funding scheme for ART procedures in 2008. This was in order to reduce the out-of-pocket payment for couples who want to go through ART procedures at our public AR centres, in addition to being able to use their MediSave for these procedures. We have, in fact, been enhancing this co-funding scheme since then – in 2013, 2018 and just in January this year – in order to support couples in their parenthood aspirations, including couples who may marry later and still wish to try for a child.",1,33,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00033
2020-05-26-T-002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have said, such policies have to be objectively determined based on the empirical evidence. What we are doing now is to try and strike a balance between encouraging couples to marry and fulfil their parenthood aspirations early and if they have difficulty conceiving naturally, to receive IUI or ART treatment early, versus the need to also support couples who may marry later and wish to have a child.",2,34,2020-05-26-T-002-S-00034

2020-05-26-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The first question is, is the Government aware that there are residents who have contracted to sell their existing homes in the expectation of moving to their new homes by a certain timeline before the circuit breaker measures were announced? Some of these residents would, therefore, be impacted in the sense that if their new homes are not ready for them to move in by the designated time to leave their current homes, they would have to find alternative accommodation. That is the first question.",2,44,2020-05-26-T-004-S-00044
2020-05-26-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question is, I am glad the Minister has said that the authorities would be prepared to exercise flexibility in granting shorter term rentals. Would he be able to also assure Singaporeans that URA and HDB would aim to give timely replies to such applications, for example, say within a week, because time is of the essence in such cases?",3,45,2020-05-26-T-004-S-00045
2020-05-26-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, Sir, on the issue of the cessation and soon-to-be phased resumption of construction works, I believe that BCA in May issued some guidelines about the phased resumption of construction including renovation works. According to the phases announced, works by individual households are placed in tier D, which I think is a tier that is termed ""can be delayed"". It is indicated that such works may only resume in August. Based on Minister's statements in press conferences, I would like him to confirm that even if the works are in a phase that BCA is not prioritising, if the contractors can show that they are able to comply with BCA's safety requirements, that BCA would consider such applications even if they are in the subsequent tiers for earlier resumption or commencement.",4,46,2020-05-26-T-004-S-00046
2020-05-26-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, let me address the questions raised by Ms Lim one by one. On the first point, we are certainly aware that there are homeowners who are impacted by the circuit breaker, having made certain transactions with the hope of moving to their new flats and now finding that renovation works have been suspended because of the circuit breaker. That is why we have a series of different measures to help these families and homeowners. One, at the start of the circuit breaker, for very minor renovation works, we gave some exemption for some of these works to be completed as much as possible, so that the homes can be made safe and people can move in quickly. It was in the first few days of the circuit breaker that we provided for such an exemption.",1,47,2020-05-26-T-004-S-00047
2020-05-26-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But still, there are quite a number who could not complete the renovation works during that few days and then, these had to be suspended. For these cases, we have worked on a different set of measures. For example, number one is working to see if the transaction timelines can be pushed back; number two, checking to see if the homeowners who are impacted can move with relatives and friends; number three, working with serviced apartment operators, some of whom have agreed to offer subsidised rates for impacted homeowners and these can be offered to the homeowners who need temporary accommodations; number four, we looked at the worst case and for those who are really urgent and have difficulties, we offered interim rental flats.",2,48,2020-05-26-T-004-S-00048
2020-05-26-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, there is a range of different measures that we are doing to help these people who are impacted. We will certainly remind the agencies to be prompt and responsive to some of these appeals when they show up. We will continue to do whatever we can to assist them.",3,49,2020-05-26-T-004-S-00049
2020-05-26-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the third question on when the renovation works can resume, we are doing it in two steps. For the works that had already started but suspended because of the circuit breaker, we are actually going to allow that in Phase One. So, even in Phase One, so long as the firms are able to put in place the relevant safeguards and assure that the workers are safe, then for these renovation works for projects that had started earlier but were suspended because of the circuit breaker, we will accord some priority and let them resume first.",4,50,2020-05-26-T-004-S-00050
2020-05-26-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For new projects, we will defer or suggest to the homeowners and contractors who are embarking on new renovation projects, that these be pushed back later. So, settle the existing, on-going ones first. But as Ms Lim said, we have indeed made the commitment that if there are any contractors who will come forward and say, ""I have the workers. They are safe. I have the measures in place and I would like to be prioritised ahead in Phase One"", we will be prepared to consider such cases as well.",5,51,2020-05-26-T-004-S-00051
2020-05-26-T-005,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether there are indications that the major oil companies in Singapore behave like an oligopoly; (b) what is the realistic selling price of the popular Octane 95 petrol when the crude oil price is zero or less; and (c) whether the Ministry will mandate oil companies to publish their lowest petrol and diesel prices after their best discounts.,1,52,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00052
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, the Member’s query speaks of important, deep questions, which can be described as follows  why did some crude oil prices go to zero or less, and what does it mean for retail petrol prices? When is an oligopoly market structure harmful to consumers? And how do we help consumers find the best fuel prices, regardless of crude oil price or market structure?",1,53,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00053
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Sir, firstly, on crude oil prices. Brent Crude is the most commonly used benchmark in the world. Brent Crude fell from US$28 per barrel at the start of 20 April to a low of US$16 a barrel on 22 April, the lowest price in over two decades. The United States generally relies on a different benchmark, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude, which fell from US$18 to minus US$38 per barrel on 20 April.",2,54,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00054
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Observers have cited the much reduced demand for oil because of the COVID-19 situation as a key factor in explaining the trends for both cases. At the same time, supply has far exceeded demand. So, inventory was filling up, and in a number of markets there was lack of storage space. Some analysts have noted that WTI Crude oil faced an acute shortage of storage space and thus traders were paying money in order to offload expiring contracts that carry a commitment to receive WTI Crude this month; hence, the negative trading prices for WTI Crude.",3,55,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00055

While a drop in oil prices generally results in a drop in retail petrol price, this may not always happen, because of many other factors which affect retail petrol price. I seek your indulgence as I explain why.",4,56,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00056
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Sir, crude oil is made of many different types of hydrocarbon molecules. The refining process separates the hydrocarbons in crude oil into different products such as retail petrol, jet fuels, bunker fuels, asphalt and naphtha. The proportions are more or less fixed. So, if there is a change in demand for one of the refined products, it can affect the supply and demand situation for the others.",5,57,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00057
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"The COVID-19 situation is a real-world example. The demand for jet fuel has dramatically fallen because of travel restrictions around the world. Hence, refineries will need to store the excess jet fuel supply, reduce the price of jet fuel to move the supply, or reduce the production of jet fuel altogether.",6,58,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00058
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Storing excess supply is only viable and sustainable if the refinery has enough storage space, with the assumption that this excess supply could eventually be sold. Reducing the price of jet fuel may not move the supply much, if jet planes are not flying – as we have seen with the fall in demand due to travel restrictions from COVID-19. And if the demand for jet fuel continues to be low, the refinery may decide to reduce the production of jet fuel by refining less crude oil. This will reduce the production of other refined products, including retail petrol. And this would exert upward pressure on their prices despite no change to the underlying demand. This effect could be more pronounced and persist in the medium to longer term if more refineries across the world shut down temporarily or for good, due to a mixture of the impact of COVID-19 and persistent low demand.",7,59,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00059
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Another potential outcome of low demand and full inventory is that refineries will likely need more time to sell their products before they can bring in a new supply of crude. If the refineries are still processing crude oil purchased before the plunge in prices, there may be a longer lag time before lower crude oil input prices can pass through to end products.",8,60,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00060
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Hence, it is not certain that every plunge in crude oil prices would necessarily lead to a decrease in refined petrol cost.",9,61,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00061
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Furthermore, in addition to the refined petrol cost, the price that consumers pay for petrol also depends on the petrol companies' operating costs, land costs, duties and taxes, and discounts and rebates. The detailed study published by then-Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) in 2017 found that refined petrol costs accounted for less than one-third of the listed retail petrol price.",10,62,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00062
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Sir, secondly, when does an oligopoly market structure become harmful for consumers? Oligopoly is a market structure where there are only a few providers in the market. Partly due to Singapore's relatively small market, an oligopolistic-type structure can be found in several sectors, including supermarkets and cinemas. Harm can arise if there is anti-competitive behaviour among the firms, for example, collusion to mark-up prices. The 2017 study found that the major petrol retailers do regularly monitor and respond to each other's prices and promotions, but also found that prices do not always move in tandem among the petrol retailers. Furthermore, there was no observable pricing pattern, such as a clear price leader, either for price increases or price decreases. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) is monitoring closely and will take enforcement action should evidence of anti-competitive activity surface.",11,63,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00063

I had previously mentioned that well-informed consumers are a key deterrent against unreasonable pricing decisions. I highlighted the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE)'s work on Fuel Kaki. The Fuel Kaki Price Estimator empowers individual consumers to compare not just the retail pump prices, but also the effective price of petrol across retailers, based on the various discounts and rebates specifically applicable to them. Fuel Kaki also allows individual consumers to explore what effective price would be paid, if they used different combinations of discounts and rebates across different retailers. This customised information is more meaningful to consumers than providing fuel prices based on the best discounts, which the retailers may not apply to every individual.",12,64,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00064

2020-05-26-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, if I may ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary a question. I think the consumers are frustrated, because everytime there is a drop in crude prices, there seems to be a lack in the fall in pump prices. Whereas, the minute there is increase in crude oil prices, pump prices rise quite quickly. While the CASE is happy to work with CCCS to provide fuel prices in Fuel Kaki, I am just wondering whether MTI would be able to ask the fuel companies, in the interest of price transparency, to consider asking the fuel companies to provide or publish a breakdown of their costs components. That means the base costs of crude oil, the taxes, the land costs, their labour costs and so on.",1,66,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00066
2020-05-26-T-005,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"This will be similar to what One Motoring or LTA publishes insofar as the price of cars are concerned. One Motoring publishes the Open Market Value (OMV), the Additional Registration Fee (ARF), the taxes as well as the base costs of cars. For consumers, I think it will help if they are able to understand what are the crude oil prices, what is the fuel component of it, so that when a fuel companies increase their prices, then they would know how much more the fuel companies are charging for the the fuel component of the costs.",2,67,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00067
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. If I can address his first point, which is whether petrol companies pass through more of the price change and at a faster rate when the crude oil prices go up, as compared to a decrease. And the answer is that, if you look at the empirical evidence, it does not suggest listed retail petrol prices adjust downwards more slowly or by a smaller amounts compared to upward price adjustments.",1,68,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00068
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"The 2017 report by then-CCS found that between January 2010 and December 2016, for every 10 cents change in Mean of Platts (MOPS) price, the listed retail petrol price changed by an average of seven cents.",2,69,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00069
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"This finding applied to both increases and decreases in price. On average, adjustments in listed retail petrol price, took place over eight days for MOPS' price increases and six days for MOPS' price decreases.",3,70,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00070
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"The Member also asked about the components of listed petrol prices. In 2015, MOPS made up less than one-third of total listed petrol price and the non fuel components such as operating costs, taxes, duties, land costs, discounts and rebates made up the remaining amount. Some of the information that the Member is interested in may well be commercially sensitive, but we are prepared to work with CASE, with our agencies and with the companies to see whether there are ways to put more of this information out there.",4,71,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00071

2020-05-26-T-005,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The fact that we have many questions over the last few months about fuel price, means that a lot of Members of the Parliament and also members of the public are not convinced that oil companies are behaving fairly.

2020-05-26-T-005,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I like what Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat said about the food delivery companies at the last sitting. Senior Minister of State Chee said that it may not be wise to cap the commission fees of the food delivery companies and the better way is to inject competition. Thus, MTI is encouraging the restaurants and food outlets to engage the delivery companies under the Food Delivery Booster Package. In that way, the end customers can get food from the food outlets directly without going through the food delivery companies.",3,75,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00075
2020-05-26-T-005,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"So, in the same way, I would ask a supplementary question. Will MTI consider injecting competition to the local petroleum market? And there are two options, one is to remove the three-quarter tank rule, so that Singapore motorists can go to Johor Bahru to pump petrol when COVID-19 is over. However, Singapore Government will lose the petrol tax if the Singapore cars go over to Johor Bahru to buy petrol. The second option is to allow white pump operators to sell fuel to the general public instead of selling the fuel to their own the fleet of vehicles only. This is similar to the practice amongst the telcos where some of the players are buying bulk from the existing telcos, repackage these and sell broadband connection at a lower price to the end customers.",4,76,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00076

2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"On the question about the three-quarter tank rule, the three-quarter tank rule is part of a suite of policy measures to encourage less car usage and reduce carbon emissions.

2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"There was also a question that the Member raised, about what some have called ""white pump fuel dispensing"". The idea, essentially, is, if you have a company that maintains a stock of fuel on site – some of these companies may do so because of a vehicle fleet – whether this stock can be sold onwards to consumers. At the moment, companies maintaining such fuel stocks for their own vehicles are not allowed to retail to the public. We are prepared to look at his suggestion and to consider it. But any consideration has to be done very carefully because there would have to be factors such as implications for land use and land allocation as well as ensuring safety for this.",3,80,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00080
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"The other issue that the Member alludes to is  how do we improve transparency in a way that the consumer, on a day-to-day basis, has that information easily.

2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"We can very much understand the interest in the listed pump prices. That, to date, has formed a lot of the discussion and discourse among members of the public. When you talk to uncles and aunties, it is often the listed pump prices that are at the top of the mind. But the listed prices can be different from the effective prices, which are what individual consumers pay after discounts and rebates.",2,84,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00084
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"The 2017 study by the then-CCS had found that there was a lack of ready access to, and awareness of, retail petrol prices by consumers. This prevented consumers from having the necessary information readily available to make the best petrol purchase decision. Following that study, MTI and CCCS worked with CASE to develop the Fuel Kaki website to help improve transparency for petrol prices.",3,85,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00085
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"The Fuel Kaki website does not just collate the listed pump prices. That is what you see at the top of the handout. But it also has a Price Estimator within. And as individual consumers, you can find out which petrol retailer offers the lowest effective price based on your individual eligibility for discounts and rebates. So, if you look at the handouts, what you can see is that the retailer with the lowest listed price may not be the one with the lowest effective price. You would also see that although listed prices are the same for most retailers, effective prices do differ even without any promotions or discounts other than the loyalty programme. So, although the handout has quite a small font size, I thought I would bring your attention to Figure 2, which is the effective price that one can get based on the loyalty programme only. You can see the bars are not quite exactly the same length and not exactly the same value, and that is reflected in the handouts which we have distributed to Members.",4,86,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00086
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"Consumers can also tick multiple boxes on the Fuel Kaki website to search across multiple petrol retailers and across multiple discounts and rebate programmes to find the lowest effective price. So, if you are curious, you want to see what the other promotions, options, discounts and rebates are, you can search. I know of users who will tick all the boxes and then they click search and the website gives a whole list, much like what you see in Figures 3 and 4 of the handouts that you have. And this helps individual consumers also find out if a different retailer with different discounts and rebates can give a better lower effective price.",5,87,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00087
2020-05-26-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"Mr Speaker, actually, there is so much more to look at beyond the listed pump price; so much more to see when you look into the rebates and discounts when you look at the effective price. And Fuel Kaki puts that into the palm of your hand, on your smartphone, and you can search within a minute. That information can help you in so many ways. If you are a consumer, you can search for the lowest effective price; if you are an academic, it helps to have a single portal which you can look up, and I am sure there are many learned economists in this House and outside who would be interested. If you are a journalist or an analyst, it helps you, too.",6,88,2020-05-26-T-005-S-00088

As companies consider shifting production lines to the region, Singapore and Southeast Asian countries can facilitate these new investments by matching overseas interest to suppliers and global distributors. Our posture, therefore, must be to foster greater regional integration and global interdependence rather than to try and maximise domestic production which may not be the most efficient nor sustainable.",4,94,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00094

While some concern amidst this flux is understandable, we should not despair. Such shifts are not a zero-sum game.

2020-05-26-T-006,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The first is that the COVID-19 situation has clearly shown that long and complex supply chains are a weakness for many countries. The situation will likely evolve into shorter, fragmented and more automated supply chains, including goods that might not pass from China vis-a-vis Singapore to the US. So, how would the US-China tensions disrupt our supply chain and our viability as a trade hub going forward?",2,105,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00105
2020-05-26-T-006,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"With shorter and more regional supply chains, how would it affect us as a port? We clearly see that TEUs have dropped significantly over the COVID-19 period. Are we expected to rise to a level that will allow us to compete as a trade hub going forward?",3,106,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00106
2020-05-26-T-006,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Third, how would developments like COVID-19 fundamentally change our longer term investments, for example, in Tuas Mega Port?",4,107,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00107
2020-05-26-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me make a few points to respond to Mr Desmond Choo's questions. I will answer the questions in reverse order.",1,108,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00108
2020-05-26-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let us look at the volume of the port at this point in time. There are short-term and long-term forces. The short-term forces that see a drop in the port volume in the recent weeks can be attributed to the global fall in demand. So, this is overall. This has to do with the short-term forces because of the lockdowns and supply chain disruptions in various countries.",2,109,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00109
2020-05-26-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Desmond Choo also touched on the longer term issues which have to do with how the reconfiguration of the supply chains towards a more regional base would affect our port operations. From a longer term perspective – ceteris paribus or all else being equal – if the demand remains at the same level, a more regional supply chain network actually can work to Singapore's advantage because we are a trade hub and a trade port, as Mr Desmond Choo said. The connectivity within ASEAN, within this region, will provide greater impetus for our port operations when things stabilise, all else being equal. So, our investment in the Tuas port over the long term, we are optimistic that we will continue to play a significant role in the regional logistics chain and also as part of the global logistics chain.",3,110,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00110
2020-05-26-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I now come to the second point of Mr Desmond Choo's first question. Yes, indeed, technological changes have given many companies the opportunities to shorten and diversify their supply chain to make it much more resilient. But this does not mean that Singapore will be bypassed. In fact, as I have mentioned during my reply, I said that even if the US, Japan and some countries decide to relocate part of their supply chain out of China, it is not a zero-sum game.",4,111,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00111
2020-05-26-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"When the US, Japan and other countries relocate part of their supply chain out of China, it does not mean that they no longer trade with China or no longer deal with China. What it means is that they have diversified part of the operations away from China, but there will also be part of their operations that will still be in China.",5,112,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00112
2020-05-26-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second effect of this shift, is that the connectivity between China and Singapore, China and the Southeast Asian region, will also strengthen as a process. So, it is not a binary choice whereby it is China or not China, ASEAN or not ASEAN. In fact, the entire global supply chain network will become much more resilient because of the diversification.",6,113,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00113
2020-05-26-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The third aspect of this that we should remember is that even prior to this, China had been trying to diversify its own production based, seeking other low-cost production opportunities around the world. And this is why we have worked with the Chinese to explore third countries' market opportunities such as by building industrial parks in other countries. And we will continue to explore working with the Chinese companies as they continue to venture out.",7,114,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00114
2020-05-26-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, while the overall global supply chain network will shift towards a much more resilient one, I think it is not a zero-sum game and there are certainly opportunities for Singapore.",8,115,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00115
2020-05-26-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The last point I want to make is this. In the past, while people had just considered efficiency as the primary consideration for designing their supply chain, many more companies and many more countries are now beginning to appreciate the need to balance efficiency with resilience. When they look at resilience, they are looking at not just the lowest cost competitor, but they are also looking for places where they can put their operations, where their intellectual property (IP) can be protected, their talent can come together, and perform product design and services; they are looking at trusted hubs whereby their exports will not be restricted because of policy-induced choices.",9,116,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00116
2020-05-26-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"These are all opportunities that play to Singapore's strength as a trusted hub, as a safe harbour for talent and IP. So, as people diversify their supply chains and look for such trusted hub and safe harbours, I think there are many opportunities for Singapore to play to our strengths and to continue to strengthen our role in the global supply chain.",10,117,2020-05-26-T-006-S-00117
2020-05-26-T-007,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"asked the Prime Minister in light of rapidly decreasing interest rates, whether MAS will proactively monitor our banks' housing loan rates to ensure that the downward revisions are timely and fair, so as to ease the financial burden of existing borrowers who are impacted by the COVID-19 situation.",1,118,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00118
2020-05-26-T-007,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,asked the Prime Minister whether MAS will consider proactive measures that will help individuals/businesses to understand credit restructuring and credit counselling programmes since many will be facing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 situation.,1,119,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00119
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister):,"Mr Speaker, may I take both questions together, please?",1,120,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00120
2020-05-26-T-007,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Yes please.,1,121,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00121
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As part of the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been closely monitoring market developments and engaging the banks on a comprehensive range of relief measures for borrowers.",1,122,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00122
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,MAS does not intervene directly in housing loan pricing as interest rates are determined by the market. But MAS expects housing loan interest rates to be revised downwards in a fair manner where this is consistent with sustained trends in banks' cost of funding for such loans.,2,123,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00123
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"How interest rates on housing loans fluctuate also depends on the loan terms that borrowers had chosen. Currently, about a quarter of borrowers are on housing loans pegged to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) or Swap Offered Rate (SOR). These borrowers would already have seen interest rates for their loans come down over the past months, as falling interbank interest rates are passed on directly to these borrowers.",3,124,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00124
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Slightly over half of borrowers have housing loans pegged to board rates or linked to fixed deposit rates. These rates generally change more slowly than SIBOR or SOR. So, borrowers are less adversely affected when market interest rates rise quickly, but also will benefit less when market interest rates fall quickly.",4,125,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00125
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The remaining borrowers largely chose to be on fixed interest rates for the first two or three years of their loan. These loans do not adjust to changes in market interest rates, but provide certainty and stability.",5,126,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00126
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Notwithstanding these differences in interest structures, borrowers may refinance their housing loans to take advantage of lower interest rates. The current rates for new housing loans are between 1.4% and 1.8% for the first year, which are lower than the range of 1.8% to 2.3% last year. However, as a matter of practice, banks will charge a fee to borrowers wishing to refinance their housing loans when they are still within the lock-in period. If there are borrowers who have difficulty paying the fee, they can put up an appeal and I am sure the banks will consider on a case-by-case basis.",6,127,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00127
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MAS also facilitates the refinancing of property loans should borrowers choose to do so, by not subjecting them to the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR), mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) and loan-to-value (LTV) limits for owner-occupied residential properties. As a temporary debt relief measure, MAS has also waived the TDSR and MSR requirements for refinancing loans for investment residential and non-residential properties.",7,128,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00128
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Kwek also asked whether MAS will help individuals and businesses understand credit restructuring and credit counselling programmes.,8,129,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00129
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Our priority has been to prevent borrowers from encountering repayment difficulties. MAS has been working with the financial industry to help individual and SME borrowers with a wide range of credit relief measures, without these impacting the borrower's credit record. For example, individuals will be able to defer payments on their mortgage loans. Likewise, SME borrowers may opt to defer principal repayment on their secured loans.",9,130,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00130
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As at 10 May 2020, close to 90% of the 31,300 applications for mortgage loan payment deferment have been approved. Similarly, more than 90% of the 3,300 applications for SME secured loans deferment have been approved.",10,131,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00131
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MAS has also worked with financial institutions and industry associations to promote awareness of the relief measures, and to help borrowers understand the costs and benefits of each relief measure so that they can make informed decisions.",11,132,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00132
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"There will be borrowers who find the relief measures insufficient. They will have to approach their banks to explore possible solutions, including restructuring their debts. They may also approach the Credit Counselling Singapore, or CCS, for debt management advice and counselling. CCS has collaborated with banks to offer the customised debt management plan for such borrowers.",12,133,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00133
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"To help borrowers on the debt management plans and who are affected by COVID-19, CCS will also assist with restructuring their repayment plans. On an ongoing basis, MoneySense, Singapore's national financial education programme, actively educates the public on debt management options.",13,134,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00134
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MAS will continue to work closely with the financial industry to support individuals and businesses through this crisis, and to educate borrowers on the relief measures available to them.",14,135,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00135
2020-05-26-T-007,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"I thank the Minister for a comprehensive response. I am very encouraged to hear about the high percentage of loans that were deferred. Two clarifying questions. The first is, regarding the loan deferment, it will help right now, but in maybe six months' time, after the temporary relief Bill term ends, there will likely be a lot more defaults. And so one suggestion I have heard from my resident is, can we get more jobs from SGUnited to help out with Credit Counselling Singapore as a temporary measure to help deal with the additional workload, because the more people we can help to restructure the debts, the better it will be for everybody including the banks in the long run. That is one suggestion.",1,136,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00136
2020-05-26-T-007,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"The other suggestion is about the rates. My residents hope that MAS continues to exercise vigilance on the rates. They pointed out to me a particular observation. The observation is that while SIBOR rates have gone down, rightfully so, the credit spreads have gone up recently at a very short time period. That means the SIBOR plus the bank spread. That does not seem to gel with the default rates that does not seem to be increasing rapidly. So, they do hope MAS can look at that, as well as the board rates movement very carefully.",2,137,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00137
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On the first issue, I fully agree with Mr Henry Kwek. I think moving forward, the labour market is going to be quite soft, unemployment is likely to go up. If the private sector is not hiring enough, one area we look to is the Public Service including Credit Counselling Singapore, and I think if there are opportunities there, the Government should be prepared to put in money and we can see how to create more of such jobs, including in the Public Service, such as what the Member had suggested.",1,138,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00138
2020-05-26-T-007,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On SIBOR rates, I do have to look into the details. I do not see any particular reason, as the Member mentioned, that the credit spread has gone up. In fact, there have been many schemes. There have been schemes run by both ESG or MTI and MAS to make sure that the credit spread is controlled, with the Government putting in and taking 90% of the risk. But if the Member is referring to mortgage rates, that could have a different market mechanism. On the whole, from our observation, interest rates ought to be coming down and it really depends on the kind of loans that you have taken, whether it is a fixed rate, or whether it is a floating rate, and I think that will also affect. Whatever it is, when a bank decides to adjust interest rates, always give enough time for your customers to be able to refinance the loans and without penalties. And I think that is what MAS will always encourage all banks to do.",2,139,2020-05-26-T-007-S-00139

This will allow Members to raise questions or express their views on both Bills during the debate. We will still have the formal Second Reading of the Active Mobility Bill to ensure that procedural requirements are dealt with.",3,144,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00144

2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Yes. Thank you, Mr Speaker. First, I would like to thank our delivery riders, who have been instrumental in providing delivery services to Singaporeans during this COVID-19 circuit breaker period. It is not an easy job; they brave the elements and are on the move all day. I am grateful for their efforts in making our lives more convenient, amidst this trying time for all of us.",1,146,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00146
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Let me first address why we are tabling these Bills now. In many cities around the world, we have seen an uptake in active mobility modes of transport after the outbreak of COVID-19. We have observed a similar trend in Singapore, where travel demand for active mobility devices appears to have increased, even as ridership for public transport, taxis and private hire cars fell drastically. This has arisen because of the larger number of short trips between homes and neighbourhood centres. With the expansion of the cycling path network in the years ahead, we should also expect use of active mobility devices to pick up again. With more users, it is all the more critical for us to strengthen our regulations and enforcement even as we deal with other COVID-related challenges.",2,147,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00147
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The Small Motorised Vehicles (Safety) Bill, or the Small Motorised Vehicles Bill for short, sets out an import control regime to stem the inflow into Singapore of unsafe small motorised vehicles, which include PMDs and PABs. The Active Mobility Bill allows LTA to shorten the forfeiture process for such devices which pose significant safety risks, and expands the public path network to include certain open spaces, so that active mobility devices can be used safely in accordance to our regulations.",3,148,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00148
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,Let me now elaborate on the main provisions of the two Bills. Let me first start with the Small Motorised Vehicles Bill.,4,149,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00149
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Today, only active mobility devices that comply with device criteria on weight, width and speed are allowed to be used on public paths. This is to enhance public safety on paths. Motorised PMDs and PABs are also required to meet the relevant safety standards, which is the UL2272 standard for motorised PMDs and the European Standard EN15194 for PABs.",5,150,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00150
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Sir, devices which do not meet the relevant safety standards pose higher fire risks and accounted for all 115 fire incidents in 2019 involving PMDs and PABs.",6,151,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00151
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"We have introduced many measures to tackle the supply of non-compliant devices, including prohibiting the sale of non-UL2272 devices for use on public paths since July 2019 and mandating inspection of e-scooters from April 2020. LTA regularly enforces against retailers who display, advertise and sell non-compliant devices, and alter devices to make them non-compliant, as well as path users who ride such non-compliant devices on public paths.",7,152,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00152
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Despite our efforts, LTA continues to detect non-compliant devices being used on public paths, and fires involving non-compliant devices continue to occur. In 2019 alone, 972 users were detected riding non-compliant PMDs and PABs on public paths and public roads.",8,153,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00153
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Irresponsible retailers have compounded the problem. In 2019, 11 retailers were caught for displaying non-compliant PMDs and PABs and failing to display warning notices.",9,154,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00154
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"In view of these challenges, we need to go upstream to stem the inflow of non-compliant devices at the point of import.",10,155,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00155
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Clause 5 of the Small Motorised Vehicles Bill requires all importers to obtain import approval from LTA before they can bring small motorised vehicles into Singapore. For a start, we will implement this requirement for motorised PMDs and PABs. This will ensure that we have oversight of the inflow into Singapore of all such devices. LTA will assess import approval applications based on the safety of the devices to be imported. It will be an offence to import motorised PMDs and PABs without valid approval from LTA.",11,156,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00156
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"We recognise that there are legitimate reasons to import non-compliant devices, such as for research, re-export or commercial use exclusively on private land or land with restricted public access. For these specific cases, import approvals can still be granted after LTA has ascertained that these non-compliant devices will not be abused and eventually used on public paths where they could be a danger to other path users. Thus, clause 8 makes it an offence for importers to allow non-compliant devices they have imported to be used for purposes other than what had been allowed under the import approval or to fail to comply with a condition specified in the import approval. LTA will also affix tamper-proof tags on all non-compliant devices allowed to be imported, to facilitate downstream enforcement.",12,157,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00157
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"We will take decisive enforcement against the provision of false information and imports without import approvals. Similar to other import controls regimes, ICA officers appointed as officers of customs will work with LTA to carry out random inspections at the checkpoints. LTA is also empowered to conduct searches of premises or conveyances located within any premises, used for or in connection with the import of small motorised vehicles or the storage of such imported vehicles, in order to investigate an offence under the Bill. This could include premises suspected to contain motorised PMDs and PABs imported without valid import approval from LTA. Motorised PMDs and PABs found to be imported without valid import approval will be seized and forfeited and their importers will be taken to task.",13,158,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00158
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,Let me now move on to the Active Mobility Bill.,14,159,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00159
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Non-compliant devices pose fire risks even when not being used or charged. Since the Active Mobility Act (AMA) was passed by this House in 2017, LTA has seized PMDs, PABs and bicycles used in the commission of offences under the AMA or the Road Traffic Act (RTA) and stores these in holding yards pending the outcome of prosecution or the acceptance of a composition offer. Some are not UL2272 or EN15194 compliant and others could have been badly damaged or have leaking batteries after being involved in accidents. It would be dangerous for LTA to retain custody of such forfeited devices.",15,160,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00160
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"To mitigate safety hazards arising from the storage of such seized devices, this Bill amends the AMA and the RTA to allow LTA to immediately forfeit devices that LTA has assessed to be dangerous, prior to composition or conviction and to dispose of them after providing a 30-day notice period for objections to be submitted. There will be no changes to the forfeiture and disposal process for non-compliant devices that are not dangerous.",16,161,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00161
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"In addition to PMDs, PABs and bicycles, the process also extends to non-compliant mobility vehicles, or what we refer to as personal mobility aids.",17,162,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00162
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Lastly, to improve clarity of rules for all path users, the Active Mobility Bill expands the public path network by allowing path-connected open spaces to be declared as public paths. Path-connected open spaces are generally indistinguishable from the existing public path network. This includes spaces such as courtyards, plazas, squares and atriums that are accessible to the public. This amendment will allow our public path network to accommodate the largest range of possible users. It will also enable LTA to extend the public path user rules to reduce potential conflicts between the motorised and non-motorised users in these open spaces. The clarity will be useful to all path users.",18,163,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00163
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"We understand that some of these path-connected open spaces are used for community or municipal functions, such as grassroots events, night markets or community roadshows. We will facilitate events and activities by allowing open spaces to be closed temporarily.",19,164,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00164
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Lastly, clauses 29, 30 and 31 of the Small Motorised Vehicles Bill makes miscellaneous amendments to the Land Transport Authority of Singapore Act, Rapid Transit Systems Act and the Road Traffic Act to channel certain sums collected by LTA into the Consolidated Fund. This delinks LTA's regulatory and enforcement functions from the associated revenues from these actions and aligns LTA's financial practices with the whole-of-Government financial governance framework.",20,165,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00165
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"We remain committed in promoting active mobility as a viable and attractive mode of transport and lifestyle choice in Singapore. When used safely, with the appropriate regulations and infrastructure, active mobility devices can be an affordable, environmentally-friendly and convenient commuting option. This is why, even as we are heartened by the significant improvement in footpath safety since the use of e-scooters was banned on footpaths from November last year, we are pressing on to improve our cycling path infrastructure and to further strengthen our regulatory framework.",21,166,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00166
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, our active mobility regulatory framework must continue to evolve to keep pace with new technology and new trends. It is timely for us to put in place a regulatory framework to ensure that active mobility devices being brought into and used in Singapore are safe.

2020-05-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Since the Active Mobility Act (AMA) came into force in May 2018, much has been done to strengthen the safe usage of active mobility devices. Examples include the introduction of the UL2272 certification and the mandatory registration of active mobility devices. But despite these measures, the number of fires involving non-compliant devices continue to remain an issue. Therefore, the introduction of the Small Motorised Vehicles (Safety) Bill is timely as it serves to control the import and use of non-compliant devices, which are often a fire risk.",2,170,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00170

What will be the responsibilities of e-commerce platforms, such as Tao Bao, Qoo10, and Carousell? Will the onus on ensuring device compliance be imposed on e-commerce consumers?",4,172,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00172
2020-05-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"If onus is indeed placed on consumers, we should strive to raise awareness of compliant active mobility devices.

Having a ""white list"" of devices that meet the latest regulations would help consumers make better purchase decisions from both physical stores and online platforms.",5,173,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00173
2020-05-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"When it comes to purchasing from online platforms, Members of this House will know that there are instances when an online seller ships a wrong product to the buyer, either deliberately or by mistake. In an event where a buyer purchases a compliant model, but the online seller ships a non-compliant one to him, would the unknowing buyer be liable for an offence under section 5 of the Bill?",6,174,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00174
2020-05-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"As the Bill also covers the import of unassembled active mobility devices, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether the import of replacement parts, which are vital for servicing and repairs, will also be regulated. Remote as it may be, there is a possibility that some may create their own non-compliant active mobility device by piecing together various replacement parts. Already, we have seen instances of PMDs being ""souped up"" to provide more power, more speed, more battery life. Such modifications can be dangerous and I hope that LTA can take proactive steps to deter this.",7,175,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00175

I am glad that the Ministry had, in December 2019, accepted the recommendations made by the Active Mobility Advisory Panel, to make third-party liability insurance compulsory for those who use PMDs in the course of their work. However, in my view, this requirement should be extended to all PMD users, as there remains a sizeable number of PMD riders who use PMDs for non-work purposes. I understand that the cost of obtaining third-party liability insurance is not exorbitant, and more importantly, we need to ensure that victims would be adequately covered for any medical bills arising in the unfortunate event of a PMD-related accident.",9,177,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00177
2020-05-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Speaker, as we continue our enforcement and education efforts to inculcate a safe active mobility culture in Singapore, we need also to ensure that we stem the rise in the number of fires involving non-compliant devices, and to better protect victims should an accident happens. The proposed import restrictions are a timely measure that will further enhance the safety of our homes and our public paths. With that, I support both Bills.",10,178,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00178

2020-05-26-T-008,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),I have asked these questions earlier this year and I look forward to the Senior Minister of State's clarification today.,28,230,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00230
2020-05-26-T-008,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the questions and concerns I have, I support this Active Mobility (Amendment No. 2) Bill.",29,231,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00231

2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I am glad that we are moving upstream in addressing the hazards posed by active mobility devices by introducing an import controls regime. It is also sensible for us to address the fire risk posed by non-compliant active mobility devices held by LTA before any incidents occur.",1,233,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00233
2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have three clarifications to raise on the Active Mobility (Amendment No. 2) Bill.,2,234,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00234
2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point relates to the return of a non-compliant forfeited vehicle that has been deemed dangerous. The new section 53(1A) provides that a non-compliant vehicle forfeited by the LTA under the new section 51(3) may be returned to a person if LTA receives from the person a written objection showing good cause for its return and there is no reasonable cause to believe that the vehicle is linked to an offence. Even if such a vehicle were not linked to an offence, it seems extremely unsafe to return a vehicle that is too dangerous for LTA to retain to an individual.",3,235,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00235
2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister clarify under what circumstances such a vehicle may be returned to the individual? Will the safety of the vehicle be a pre-condition for such a return?,4,236,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00236
2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second point relates to the notice requirement before selling, destroying or disposing of a non-compliant vehicle that is dangerous to retain. The new section 53(3A) provides that LTA may sell, destroy or dispose of a non-compliant vehicle if it is dangerous for the LTA to retain custody or it increases the likelihood of an outbreak of fire at the holding yard. LTA may do so after giving one month's notice in the Gazette of its intention to do so.",5,237,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00237
2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I appreciate that the e-Gazette was made public earlier this year. However, the reality is that publication in the Gazette will not be a meaningful notification for the average individual.",6,238,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00238
2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The new section 53(3A) applies to vehicles that are moved to a holding yard under section 45 or section 46. Both sections require LTA to give notice of the move to the owner of the vehicle as soon as practicable, if the owner is known. This requirement does not seem to apply where LTA intends to exercise its powers under section 53(3A).",7,239,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00239
2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister clarify in a situation where the owner is known, whether LTA will be required to give notice to the owner of its intention to sell, destroy or dispose of potentially dangerous non-compliant vehicle under the new section 53(3A)?",8,240,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00240
2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My final point relates to the risks that continue to be posed by non-compliant vehicles held at the holding yards. Even under the expedited procedure introduced by the amendments, there is still a one-month notice period before the LTA can sell, destroy or dispose of a forfeited vehicle that is dangerous or that materially increases the likelihood of an outbreak of fire. Accidents can happen during this one-month period. The danger is compounded when you consider that there are other vehicles in the holding yards that are similarly dangerous or materially increase the likelihood of an outbreak of fire.",9,241,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00241
2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister share what safety measures are put in place to mitigate the risk of fire at the holding yards? Further, in the worst-case scenario that a fire breaks out, who is liable for the damage caused? For instance, in the event that the fire can be traced back to a single vehicle, would the owner of that vehicle be liable for the damage caused by the fire caused by their vehicle, notwithstanding that the vehicle is now in the custody of LTA?",10,242,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00242
2020-05-26-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of both Bills.",11,243,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00243
2020-05-26-T-008,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.,1,244,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00244
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, personal mobility devices were quickly adopted by many Singaporeans in the last few years because they were cheap and fast. They filled a transport need that our public transport system and existing private vehicles could not. But as we discovered, this came at a high cost to safety – from accidents on roads and foot paths to charging fires at home. It was a case of market forces running ahead of regulators since we had no laws to ensure that these imported personal mobility devices met safety standards.",1,245,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00245
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I support the intent behind the Bill, which will create a regulatory framework for licensing the import of small motorised vehicles that will promote safety and meet consumer needs.",2,246,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00246
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"However, new regulations will impose a cost on businesses and commuters. We need to minimise these costs while still ensuring that regulations serve the purpose of promoting public safety. In some respects, this Bill imposes more regulations on importers of small motorised vehicles than our existing laws on the import of motor vehicles do. For example, under existing law, any person in Singapore may import a motor vehicle, subject to import approval from Customs and vehicle registration from LTA. The concept of a licence to import motor vehicles simply does not exist under the Road Traffic Act. Our approach for motor vehicles is to regulate the vehicles rather than to regulate the importers.",3,247,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00247
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"This Bill, in contrast, will create a regulatory regime to license small motorised vehicle importers directly under section 5 of the Act. Import regulation will effectively restrict competition in the market for small motorised vehicles to approved importers and to approved mobility devices. Further, the Bill's powers also extend to import of components for small motorised vehicles, which also affects repair services and even individuals who may wish to import spare parts for their own repairs. Overall, the regulations imposed by this Bill could create barriers to entry, which would harm consumers. It will be critical for LTA to implement a robust framework that ensures competition will be maintained while maintaining safety standards for users and the community.",4,248,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00248
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),My concerns range over three areas  who is allowed to import; what small motorised vehicles can be imported; and whether regulations will be made under the Act to cover competition in the market.,5,249,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00249
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"First, I wish to ask how the framework for approving importers will be applied and whether it will facilitate entry and competition in the market for small motorised vehicles. I am concerned that consumers may face higher prices and fewer choices if prospective dealers are unable to gain approval or are discouraged by high licensing requirements. In particular, will consumers have a choice to directly import their small motorised vehicles from overseas suppliers? For example, will overseas sellers be licensed to sell direct to consumers in Singapore or can consumers be licensed to import for private use if the vehicle meets standards?",6,250,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00250
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Next, I wish to clarify the framework for approving small motorised vehicles for import. As Singapore is a small market, manufacturers may be reluctant to design small motorised vehicles to meet Singapore-specific requirements. Certification could also be costly.",7,251,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00251
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Will study whether international design standards for small motorised vehicles such as those in force in China are suitable for Singapore? If so, will certifications from the relevant international authorities be acceptable for import purposes? Or is the intention to develop local certification capability and how quickly and cost effectively can that be done?",8,252,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00252
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"A related concern is on the import of small motorised vehicle components. A broad reading of the Act suggests components could also be subject to import control because these vehicles can be easily assembled from parts. If enforced strictly, this would affect competition in the market for servicing and repairs, and prevent consumers from sourcing their own repair parts from overseas.",9,253,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00253
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Will LTA consider limiting import restrictions only to components which are integral to the small motorised vehicle or which are safety critical such as the motor, chassis and batteries?",10,254,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00254
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Finally, I wish to ask whether LTA will consider competitive behaviour when making licensing decisions under this Act. I am concerned that these regulations will reduce the number of firms in the market and hence, enhance market power over consumers.",11,255,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00255
2020-05-26-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"As we know, similar issues can arise in the motor vehicle market, which is dominated by a small number of firms who are the exclusive authorised dealers for the major car manufacturers. Within car brands, the only competition really comes from parallel importers. In the case of the car market, the barrier to entry, they are not just regulatory in nature, they arrive in the combination of the small domestic market, combine manufacturer's decisions to authorise dealers on an exclusive basis. Will LTA be able to regulate or to consider competitive conduct as a factor in licensing importers under this Bill? These concerns notwithstanding, I support the Bill.",12,256,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00256
2020-05-26-T-008,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Muralli Pillai.,1,257,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00257
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I support both Bills. I wish to seek clarification on two areas. First, the Authority's power of forfeiture of vehicles under both Bills; and second, the ambit of the definition of ""path-connected open spaces"" in the Active Mobility (Amendement No. 2) Bill or AMB, and plans under this Bill to harmonise the use of such spaces amongst pedestrians and vehicle users.",1,258,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00258
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"On the first issue, I wish to make two points. First, it is proposed to allow the Authority to order forfeiture of non-compliant vehicles if it is of the view there is a danger in storing them. Currently, the power of forfeiture is limited to situations where a person has been convicted or compounds an offence in relation to the Active Mobility Act (AMA), or the Road Traffic Act (RTA). Otherwise, the Court retains jurisdiction on the issue of forfeiture.",2,259,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00259
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In a situation where the Authority orders forfeiture of a non-compliant vehicle posing a hazard, there could be a perceived conflict of interest arising. This is because the Authority enforces the AMA and will also enforce the Small Motorised Vehicles Bill (SMVB) once it is enacted. The Authority prosecutes offenders under both bills. Then, the Authority exercises a power of forfeiture of this vehicle, that is subject matter of ongoing criminal proceedings.",3,260,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00260
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Let us take an example of a person who was brought to book and charged in Court by the Authority for importing and using a non-compliant PMD. His PMD has been seized and stored by the Authority. He denies the charges. Criminal proceedings have commenced. Before it concludes, Authority takes the view that the continued storage of the PMD is dangerous and wants to have it forfeited. Under the provision, it can do so at once, without reference to the accused or the Court. I wonder whether it would be better to vest with the Court the jurisdiction to deal with such matters instead?",4,261,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00261
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next, under clause 15(4) of SMVB and the proposed section 51(4) of the AMA, the Authority will be vested with the power to release to a third party who claims to be the owner of a non-compliant vehicle even though it was used in a commission of an offence under SMVB and AMA.",5,262,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00262
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"From a policy view point, may I please ask, what is the purpose of providing to the Authority the power to release a non-compliant vehicle used in a commission of an offence back into public circulation? I believe the hon Member, Mr Louis Ng, made a similar point. It is noteworthy that the Authority, in the same provision, may refer the matter to the Magistrate who must order a forfeiture if he finds that the non-compliant vehicle was used in the commission of an offence. In other words, the Magistrate has no discretion and it seems to me that we may be proposing to give the Authority a wider power than the Magistrate.",6,263,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00263
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"We need to bear in mind that the purpose behind the SMVB is to dry up the number of non-compliant vehicles in Singapore. The hon Senior Minister of State, Dr Lam had already highlighted the fire hazard as well as the big numbers of non-compliant vehicles that were forfeited just last year.",7,264,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00264
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Moving on to the second issue, I wish to first deal with the AMB provisions dealing with the extension of the public path system to include path connected open spaces. This makes eminent sense as it will harmonise enforcement against users who flout the rules on usage of pedestrian paths, footpaths and shared paths, thereby endangering other users; particularly pedestrians.",8,265,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00265
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I have two queries on this point. First, the ambit of ""path connected open spaces"". Under the Active Mobility (Footpaths) Order 2018, void decks and the frontage abutting any commercial premises are excluded as footpaths. Under the proposed Bill, is it still the intention exclude both areas? If so, may I please ask why?",9,266,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00266
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Void decks and frontage abutting commercial premises are sometimes connected to paths as well. We, in this House, are aware of incidents in the past involving people colliding with PMD users in void decks. This has led to 15 Town Councils to enact by-laws to ban use of PMDs at void decks. Would it not be better to harmonise the application of the laws dealing with PMD users under one Act?",10,267,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00267
2020-05-26-T-008,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next, and this is my final point, in bringing path connected open spaces under the AMA, how is it proposed that the areas are demarcated as pedestrian paths, footpaths or shared paths respectively. It seems to me better to provide clear demarcation of areas where use of vehicles are permitted. This will augment the harmonisation of usage of paths and areas amongst pedestrians and vehicle users.",11,268,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00268

2020-05-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We are all concerned about the safety of PMDs. Not only do they compromise the safety on shared paths, they also create fire risks when being charged.",3,272,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00272
2020-05-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The first line of defence is to stem the inflow of non-compliant PMDs into the country. Hence, banning the import of such devices is a concrete step. Last year, after a number of serious accidents involving PMDs occurred on footpaths, I asked for a temporary halt on PMD imports during a Parliamentary Question.",4,273,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00273
2020-05-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Requiring approvals from LTA is a necessary step. However, I will urge LTA to err on the safe side in the approval of the new devices as there will always be new and innovative devices that will be brought to the market; they may seem safe initially but develop unforeseen problems after some usage. We should not take chances on fire safety. Once the public has bought the devices and started using them, it would be very difficult to call back.",5,274,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00274
2020-05-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We also cannot rule out the possibility that some people might do illegal modifications on their devices, compromising the safety. Hence, can I ask the Minister if MOT sees the need to have a validity period for the approved devices, as the functionality and reliability of these devices may deteriorate over time? Is there a need for the devices to undergo inspection after some years of usage to ascertain their safety worthiness?",6,275,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00275
2020-05-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides being the approving authority for new devices, LTA can also regulate the number of devices allowed, given our limited pathways. Again, it is always better to be safe and conservative. One of the reasons why the public was concerned about PMDs last year was the sheer number and the high utilisation rate of these devices, increasing the likelihood of accidents.",7,276,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00276
2020-05-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),Can I also ask whether LTA will take the delivery companies to task if their delivery people use devices that are not approved?,8,277,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00277
2020-05-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),I support the immediate forfeiture of the devices assessed to be dangerous. This can also serve as another deterrence. I support these two amendment Bills.,9,278,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00278

2020-05-26-T-008,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),The proposal to put in upstream measures to prevent unauthorised import of non-compliant small motorised vehicles is absolutely necessary. These vehicles include personal mobility devices (PMDs) and power-assisted bicycles (PABs) which come in many configurations and specifications.,2,281,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00281
2020-05-26-T-008,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Very unfortunately, we have seen how, in the absence of import controls, how many of these devices had caused fires, resulting in injuries, loss of lives and property damage. In addition, some of these devices can attain maximum speeds way in excess of what is permitted and the speed differentials with other users on footpaths had led to accidents and serious injuries.",3,282,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00282
2020-05-26-T-008,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"With the legislative framework in place, enforcement will be key. Would the Ministry share how it will monitor individuals who purchase online and import devices which may not be compliant with our regulations? How will MOT work with our Customs to check on these imports?",4,283,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00283
2020-05-26-T-008,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Another challenge is how MOT will check on those who modify the PMDs and PABs themselves as well as workshops or retail shops that are involved in illegal modifications. I would also like to know how the Ministry can enforce these regulations when users do not send their devices for registration and checks. So far, how many cases of non-compliant devices have been picked up? Would the Ministry consider recruiting volunteers who can be trained and deployed to assist enforcement officers? How about providing incentives or rewards to those who have assisted and given the necessary information regarding offenders?",5,284,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00284
2020-05-26-T-008,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Next, on the Active Mobility Bill. I am glad that LTA has widened the enforcement area to include path-connected open spaces against the illegal PMD riders on these paths. We have greater clarity now that it is specifically stated that paved open spaces can only be accessed by pedestrians, personal mobility aid users, bicycles and non-motorised PMDs. So, it is clear that connectivity is ensured for these groups of users, with their safety enhanced by keeping motorised PMDs, which can travel at higher speeds, out of these paths. This will promote responsible and sustainable usage of the paths for all. At the same time, we are encouraging a healthy way of transportation and reducing our carbon footprint while promoting active lifestyles.",6,285,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00285
2020-05-26-T-008,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Once again, my concern is about enforcement. I welcome the move to let LTA will take over the enforcement of offences under the AMA from the Town Councils. I would like to ask if we could tap on greater use of technology to boost our enforcement capabilities. Last but not least, I seek clarification about the age of offenders that the law will apply to as quite a number of such offenders in the past have been teenagers.",7,286,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00286

Especially on the weekends, power-assisted bicycles (PABs) and motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs) cruising along the park connectors are a common sight. I expect that these small motorised vehicles will continue to be the favourable mode of transport in the current and post COVID-19 period, as people try to avoid taking public transport, while working some exercise and getting some fresh air into their new regimes. As Singaporeans turn to contactless delivery for their daily needs and wants, the number of trips taken and users of these vehicles will undoubtedly continue to rise.",1,288,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00288
2020-05-26-T-008,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"It is, hence, very timely to address the concerns brought about by non-compliant devices. Last year, the number of fires related to charging and explosions of PMDs and PABs also doubled, causing property destruction, injuring inhabitants and even killing one. In densely-populated Singapore, this has a spillover effect to the neighbouring houses. Many residents have very valid concerns about the situation and I am glad the Minister has plans to tackle it with the establishment of an import controls regime to prevent the import of non-compliant and unsafe devices.",2,289,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00289
2020-05-26-T-008,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),I wish to ask how enforcement will be implemented against online purchase of small motorised vehicles by individuals. These are questions that were raised by previous Members.,3,290,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00290
2020-05-26-T-008,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But I would like to ask whether spare parts, such as battery packs, wheel set-ups, attachments, amongst others, be covered under the new import controls regime? New innovations have made it possible to modify these vehicles. With some tools and online tutorials, one can even do it yourself at home. While a strict import controls regime will help to prevent innocent consumers from being misled into purchasing poor quality non-compliant products, there still remains individuals and businesses who have the capabilities to illegally modify a once-compliant product. Can the Minister share the challenges of apprehending such errant businesses and individuals and what is being done to mitigate them?",4,291,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00291
2020-05-26-T-008,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I believe heavier penalties and education would be a big part of the solution. I hope LTA will make a public list available for easy viewing that clearly defines what is illegal and dangerous and to update a list of approved vehicles and parts on a regular basis to stay abreast with the ever-changing technology and innovations. It is also prudent to provide a wide range of approved PMDs, including highly affordable models and for a range of uses, from leisure to those for heavier, prolonged use by delivery riders. That said, will the implementation of the new import regime incur resources and will this lead to increased import levies and so on? I am concerned that the extra cost will be passed on to consumers.",5,292,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00292
2020-05-26-T-008,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Lastly, on a positive note, I am pleased to observe that the circuit breaker has brought out the sporty side of Singaporeans. Despite social distancing measures, Singaporeans have found ways to keep fit alone, from following online fitness videos at home to working out, jogging and cycling near their homes. As flexible work-from-home arrangements persist after the circuit breaker, I believe Singaporeans will continue to persevere with these endeavours to keep fit.",6,293,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00293

Currently, most power-assisted bikes or bicylces on the list of Approved PABs are generally for city use. Can the Ministry look into other ranges, like electric mountain bikes, which is a new innovation – you can mountain bikes fitted with electric powered trains that can run mountain bikes on trails – to cater to sports enthusiasts? So, whether this covers this range of products in the future would be useful.",7,294,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00294

It is important to explain the different aspects clearly and carefully so that all users know how to share the usage of paths responsibly. The public education programme should be continuous so that every cohort of riders and pedestrians is taught and reminded of the necessary etiquette on pathways.

MOT and LTA have taken a calibrated approach in introducing device-related regulations.

As the number of non-compliant devices being used on public paths remains significant and, after receiving feedback from Members of Parliament, including Mr Dennis Tan, we embarked on an extensive study of implementing import controls, bearing in mind that it has to be done so in accordance with our FTA obligations.

There are currently more than 1,500 non-compliant devices held in LTA's holding yards. As Mr Louis Ng had rightly pointed out, many of these devices may be dangerous and pose significant fire risks. LTA has already put in place measures to mitigate these risks, including storing them in sheltered areas to avoid exposing them to harsh conditions, 24/7 monitoring of the holding yards, and installing fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems. Our proposal to shorten the forfeiture process for dangerous vehicles and things will enable LTA to better manage the risks from their prolonged storage. I would like to reassure Mr Dennis Tan that these vehicles are disposed of in a safe manner in LTA-appointed scrap-yards, where LTA will receive the residual value of the device, which is small. The batteries are also dismantled and sold off to battery recyclers appointed by NEA.",11,339,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00339

Mr Murali Pillai's concern on whether LTA is better placed to forfeit such vehicles or whether they should be left to the Courts to better safeguard individual property rights and due process, LTA will only seize and forfeit vehicles after LTA and relevant authorities have gathered supporting evidence and is reasonably certain that the vehicle was connected to the commission of an offence under the Active Mobility Act, Road Traffic Act or Small Motorised (Vehicles) Safety Bill. The prosecution for cases involving the devices will remain independent of the forfeiture.",12,340,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00340

2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"This recognises that there may be legitimate claims to the seized vehicles. For instance, an individual whose device was stolen might have a legitimate claim for the PMD to be returned to him since he may have obtained an import approval to bring in a non-compliant device for R&D purposes. While Members of Parliament have suggested that LTA should not return any non-compliant seized vehicles at all despite legitimate claims, this may unfairly undermine the property rights of vehicle owners. That said, vehicle owners should bear responsibility for assessing whether their devices are safe, and should safely dispose devices that may become dangerous.",14,342,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00342

Most path-connected open spaces will be demarcated as footpaths, similar to the approach taken for paths today. LTA will work with local stakeholders on this and steps will be taken to demarcate the different types of paths by markings or signboards if deemed necessary.",19,347,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00347
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"To answer Mr Murali Pillai's question, LTA and Town Councils had earlier evaluated that void decks and the frontage of commercial spaces (which are today excluded from the public path system) were not critical for active mobility connectivity and had safety concerns, such as numerous blind spots.

Town Councils could also consider whether erecting physical barriers around playgrounds would be appropriate for keeping children out of harm's way. We will also keep up our education efforts to remind users to slow down when nearing areas with potential blind spots or which may be crowded, such as bus stops or playgrounds.",21,349,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00349

2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Ultimately, as Mr Gan Thiam Poh has pointed out, the effectiveness of all our regulations boil down to enforcement. LTA has a comprehensive regime that enforces against non-compliant devices at multiple touchpoints, beyond registration and inspection. As I have mentioned earlier, in 2019 alone, LTA detected a total of 972 users riding non-compliant PMDs and PABs, and seized, forfeited and disposed of their devices.",23,351,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00351
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to assure Mr Dennis Tan that we are constantly improving our enforcement actions against illegal device usage. LTA has significantly grown its enforcement footprint to about 200 enforcement officers, allowing for more frequent patrols. LTA also works closely with enforcement officers across various agencies. To augment LTA's enforcement efforts, I agree with Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah that we should enlist the aid of technology and the wider community. And we have done so. LTA has launched an 18-month trial of mobile closed-circuit televisions at hotspots to better detect offences, such as speeding. The ""Report PMD/PAB Incident"" function on the MyTransport.SG app also allows eye witnesses to report instances of errant behaviour.",24,352,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00352
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As Mr Gan Thiam Poh has suggested, LTA has recruited Active Mobility Patrol volunteers to engage residents on active mobility rules and regulations. As of May 2020, we have over 1,000 AMP volunteers across 73 teams.",25,353,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00353

This limits the circulation of non-compliant devices and reduces the likelihood that consumers purchase them inadvertently.",26,354,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00354
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,LTA passed amendments earlier this year to significantly increase the penalties for retailer offences and will require all retailers to send in their e-scooters for inspections before sale. We also require e-scooters to undergo regular inspections to ensure device safety and deter against illegal modification. LTA also monitors feedback relating to illegal modification of devices closely and conducts regularly checks on workshops and retailers to ensure compliance.,27,355,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00355
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"To answer Mr Gan Thiam Poh’s question about young offenders, the provisions in these current Bills do not stipulate a minimum age, but our Courts retain discretion to consider the circumstances of the case, including the age of the individual and the laws on sentencing of young offenders, in deciding the actual punishment to be meted out. On the observation that young riders have been committing active mobility offences, we recently passed amendments to require riders to be at least 16 years old to ride an e-scooter without supervision. We are also targeting younger riders in schools with our education efforts, such as the Safe Riding Programme, and like Mr Dennis Tan suggested, enhancing public education efforts, including reaching out through Active Mobility Patrol volunteers. The Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) has joined us in emphasising the importance of public education and engagement by designating this as a focus for their current term.",28,356,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00356
2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Another area of focus for the AMAP this year is to study extending third-party liability insurance requirements to individual device users, as Mr Melvin Yong has spoken about. AMAP and LTA are already working with the insurance industry to study the risk pool, design and structure of individual insurance options. In the meantime, we strongly encourage individual active mobility device riders to purchase third-party liability insurance for their own protection against third-party claims.",29,357,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00357

2020-05-26-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Ensuring fire and device safety is the responsibility of every device user – it is necessary to protect riders themselves and their loved ones. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah had expressed concern over a recent fire incident in Yishun. Even as we tighten our regulatory regimes at different levels, let me take this opportunity to remind all device users to practise safe charging habits. Devices should not be left charging without monitoring, or overnight. Users should not modify the electrical systems of their devices and should only use original power adaptors and approved battery models for that vehicle type. LTA is working with SCDF to strengthen educational campaigns and outreach programmes.",34,362,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00362

Mr Liang also asked if we should set an effective life span for approved PMDs. I would like to share that there is currently no intention to do so as the regular periodic inspection regime will ensure that the devices remain compliant and safe for use. Even though the PMD population has right-sized following the November 2019 footpath prohibition, we are nonetheless pressing on with the provision of more active mobility infrastructure, extending the cycling path network to 1,320 km by 2030 as I had shared with this House in March 2020.",35,363,2020-05-26-T-008-S-00363

IMDA, NEA, JTC, HDB and Enterprise Singapore will provide a bonus of $300 per month over five months to encourage more stallholders in hawker centres, wet markets, coffee shops, and industrial canteens to use e-payments and avoid having to handle cash.

The Merchant Shipping (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act was passed last year, to implement the Salvage Convention. To-date, 72 countries have ratified the Salvage Convention. A key aspect of the Salvage Convention is the introduction of special compensation. These are compensation for claims arising from salvage operations.",2,610,2020-05-26-T-012-S-00610

This differs from traditional salvage claims dealt with under an earlier convention adopted in Brussels in 1910, where salvors are only awarded if the salvage of the vessel or its cargo was successful. This Bill expands the High Court's admiralty jurisdiction to cover special compensation claims that arise under the Salvage Convention, or by way of contract. Currently, the High Court's admiralty jurisdiction covers only traditional salvage claims.",3,611,2020-05-26-T-012-S-00611

Clause 2 provides that the High Court's admiralty jurisdiction includes any claim arising under the Salvage Convention. This includes Article 14 of the Salvage Convention, which provides for special compensation. It also provides that the High Court's admiralty jurisdiction covers contractual claims relating to salvage services. This includes contractual clauses that provide for special compensation, such as the Special Compensation Protection and Indemnity clause. Finally, it provides that the High Court's admiralty jurisdiction covers any other claim in the nature of salvage. This ensures that all salvage claims previously covered by admiralty jurisdiction continue to be covered.

However, this did not adequately recognise the skills and efforts of salvors who prevented or minimised environmental damage, providing little incentive for riskier salvage operations. An example is where a major pollution incident was avoided by towing a damaged tanker away from an environmentally sensitive area of where the ship or cargo could not be salvaged.",4,621,2020-05-26-T-012-S-00621
2020-05-26-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In light of this, the 1989 International Convention on Salvage introduced something called ""special compensation"". This provided some reward to salvors who prevented or minimised environmental damage even though they were unsuccessful in saving the ship or the cargo. While the Merchant Shipping (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2019 enacted the law that allowed such claims in Singapore, it is this Bill that will extend the Singapore High Court's admiralty jurisdiction to include such salvage claims. Therefore, this law is important and I support it because it will further incentivise and encourage ships at sea to help fellow ships in distress to reduce environmental damage within the seas and oceans. Reduction of environmental damage to the seas and oceans are key and we should support such a reduction. Hence, I am supportive of this Bill.",5,622,2020-05-26-T-012-S-00622

Would the Minister please clarify whether the statement that special compensation claims are placed on the same footing as traditional salvage claims is to be understood only in the context of High Court admiralty jurisdiction and not, for instance, the ranking of a maritime lien? Would the Minister please also elaborate how having a High Court jurisdiction over special compensation claims impacts salvors and incentivises them to protect the environment?

2020-05-26-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The answer is no.

2020-05-26-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Bill does not do so and let me explain this. My Ministry has studied this and consulted with maritime law experts.

2020-05-26-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Today, the common law grants traditional salvage claims a maritime lien because property has been saved, either the vessel itself or the cargo.

2020-05-26-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Ultimately, this incentivises salvors undertaking a rescue or salvage of a vessel even when the prospects of saving the vessel or the goods are remote or it is inherently risky because it allows compensation for these claims, thereby encouraging them to help either to salvage the remains or to move the vessel into another location which is less environmentally damaging.",13,656,2020-05-26-T-012-S-00656

2020-05-26-T-014,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"The first is to make Internet connection universal. Singapore's Wireless@SG programme already provides free Internet access across broad swathes of public space. With our Nationwide Broadband Network successfully in place, extending free home wi-fi to residential areas will not involve more than a concerted coordination with telcos outfitting every home with modems and wireless routers. Indeed, our transition towards 5G provides a strategic opportunity to ""reset"" our digital infrastructure networks for universal Internet access.",7,720,2020-05-26-T-014-S-00720
2020-05-26-T-014,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"The second tranche is ensuring access to computing devices. As those of us who own multiple devices well know, they are not all created equal and some devices are simply more effective for particular functions. As it stands, online learning platforms are optimised for computers or laptops, and not mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. We cannot expect our students from low-income households to simply get by or make do with mobile phones for online learning.",8,721,2020-05-26-T-014-S-00721
2020-05-26-T-014,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Universal provision of computing devices assumes need with less concern over deservingness. Thus, greater universalism could materialise in the form of automatic allocation, as is the case now with Baby Bonus, Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) and Silver Support. Possible channels include building computing provision as part of school registration, ComCare benefits, or WIS. Stepped levels of subsidies according to household income and size of household could also be introduced, similar to the subsidy ladders for childcare and Baby Bonuses. Technology companies should be mobilised to co-fund such provisions as part of their corporate social responsibility efforts.",9,722,2020-05-26-T-014-S-00722

2020-05-26-T-014,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),We must therefore introduce more intensive in-school digital literacy programmes to help these children make up for the lack of scaffolding at home.

2020-05-26-T-014,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"IMDA's Annual Infocomm Usage Survey in 2019 found that 89% of all households own computers; and among households with school-going children, 98% own computers. If we exclude tablets from the definition, we find that 61% of households with school-going children own computers. So, that drops significantly. Interestingly, within this group, it is noteworthy that more than 80% of HDB 1- to 3-room households with school-going children have access to computers. In other words, it is gratifying that the efforts are reaching this lower income group.",7,736,2020-05-26-T-014-S-00736

One key contributory factor has been the range of initiatives that have been launched in close collaboration between our public, private and people sectors. For example, since 2006, IMDA's NEU PC Plus programme, which Members have all referred to, has helped over 46,000 low-income households, with school-going children or persons with disabilities, for them to obtain computers and broadband access. And I want to assure Ms Ong that the computers in this scheme refers to computers as in PCs and desktops and not tablets.",11,740,2020-05-26-T-014-S-00740

And that is why we have, for example, initiatives like the Silver Infocomm Initiative (SII), which was launched as far back as in 2007. It provides a range of programmes for seniors at different levels of digital skills. These programmes are also provided in vernacular languages to meet the needs of our seniors.",13,742,2020-05-26-T-014-S-00742

And for persons with disabilities, the NEU PC Plus programme provides support for computer and broadband access. I can elaborate further but because of the time constraint, I just want to emphasise that the persons with disabilities remain an important part of our overall effort towards digital inclusion.",14,743,2020-05-26-T-014-S-00743

The situation, I believe and I beg to differ with the Member, is not as bleak as Nominated Member of Parliament Anthea Ong paints it out to be.

2020-05-26-T-016,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"To keep community transmission low, the Government has announced plans to resume economic activities in a cautious manner, in phases. Motor vehicle dealerships have not yet been allowed to re-open. COE bidding will only resume after the dealers are allowed to re-open.

These flash floods lasted between 10 to 30 minutes. PUB officers were on site to actively engage affected residents, provide sandbags and loan the portable Dam-Easy flood panels to prevent floodwaters from entering homes. These flood panels, which the Public Utilities Board (PUB) started loaning to residents and businesses in flood-prone areas since the start of the monsoon season in 2019, can be set up quickly during a flash flood. These flood panels were used by one of the residents during the 30 April 2020 rainstorm, who found them effective in preventing water from entering his home.",2,768,2020-05-26-T-017-S-00768

For example, PUB completed the upgrading of the Tampines Canal (from Hougang Avenue 1 to Hougang Avenue 7) in March 2019 at a project cost of $27 million to alleviate flooding along Tampines Road. The hydraulic analysis showed that the completed works had successfully reduced the flood area by 86%, including a large section of Tampines Road. As a result, the flash flood on 30 April 2020 was confined to a localised road depression at the junction of Tampines Road and Hougang Avenue 1.

There are on-going works to upgrade the remaining stretches of drains in the estate. When completed in 2021, flood protection for Sennett Estate will be further enhanced.",7,773,2020-05-26-T-017-S-00773
2020-05-26-T-017,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"While PUB will continue with efforts to improve drainage systems, it is not practical to expand our drains to meet every extreme rainfall event in land-scarce Singapore. Besides drainage improvements, PUB will put in place cost-effective measures to minimise flood risks and better manage flood events. For instance, PUB is in the midst of upgrading its rainfall forecasting radar technology, which will help improve prediction of locations where heavy rainfall might occur and enhance its response time to potential flash floods. Members of the public can also stay updated on weather and flash flood warnings by subscribing to NEA's or PUB's mobile apps and SMS alerts. In the event of a flash flood, members of the public are advised to take appropriate safety measures, such as to avoid driving and walking in flooded areas.",8,774,2020-05-26-T-017-S-00774
