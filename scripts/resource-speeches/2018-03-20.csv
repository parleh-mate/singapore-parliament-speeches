2018-03-20-T-001,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked	 the Minister for Health (a) what is the process for family members of patients who are under palliative care to access counselling services; (b) at what stage of the patient's end journey will counselling be provided for the family members; and (c) what is being done to create awareness of this service.,1,1,2018-03-20-T-001-S-00001
2018-03-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Health),"Palliative care providers have multidisciplinary care teams that support patients on palliative care services and their family members. These teams comprise staff with experience in counselling, such as medical social workers, counsellors, or pastoral care staff.",1,2,2018-03-20-T-001-S-00002
2018-03-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Health),"The care teams will keep in close touch with family members, assess their needs and provide the necessary support for the patient and the family. This includes support to help family members cope with care-giving and grief management, as well as bereavement care after the patient’s passing. Care teams may also link up families with other support organisations and resources.",2,3,2018-03-20-T-001-S-00003
2018-03-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Health),"MOH has been working with community partners to promote public awareness about palliative care and End-of-Life (EOL) conversations. For example, in conjunction with World Hospice and Palliative Care Day, Singapore Hospice Council held an inaugural community engagement event in October last year, to raise public awareness on the topic. We will continue to work with our community partners on such public outreach and education efforts.",3,4,2018-03-20-T-001-S-00004
2018-03-20-T-001,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. May I know what is the uptake rate for this service and will there be more publicity for such services because it really will help assure the family that there is care for them?,1,5,2018-03-20-T-001-S-00005
2018-03-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. Indeed, I think this is a very important issue, in particular, due to our ageing population. The uptake of counselling services is not specifically tracked because it is delivered as part of palliative care. Upon admission into palliative care services, the patients and the family members will be made aware of the counselling services available as part of the holistic assessment in recognition of the patients' and the families' needs. This would include their physical, psycho-social as well as their pastoral needs.",1,6,2018-03-20-T-001-S-00006
2018-03-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For instance, at St Joseph's Home, counselling actually begins at the point of referral of a patient and the family members into palliative care. The multi-disciplinary team, which comprises the consultants, the nurses, as well as social care staff, will engage the patient as well as the family members in conversations on advance care planning, end-of-life preferences, coping with grief and so on. Counselling usually happens as a natural conversation and is a work-in-progress in that sense. It is an on-going process, as part of palliative care.",2,7,2018-03-20-T-001-S-00007
2018-03-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In terms of promoting the awareness about end-of-life issues and palliative care services, MOH continues to work with Singapore Hospice Council (SHC) as well as various community partners and providers. For instance, we work with SHC on a community engagement programme. We have a three-year partnership with them from 2017 to 2019 on this community engagement programme to raise awareness among the public about palliative care services as well as end-of-life issues.",3,8,2018-03-20-T-001-S-00008
2018-03-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We will continue to do so and extend this outreach in terms of raising awareness and also, improving the quality of end-of-life care and extend this to psycho-social support. That will include supportive counselling of patients and their family members.",4,9,2018-03-20-T-001-S-00009
2018-03-20-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked	 the Minister for Health (a) how many senior citizens currently suffer from incontinence; (b) what is the average cost to treat this illness; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider providing more subsidies for incontinence treatment so as to enable more senior citizens to seek treatment early.,1,10,2018-03-20-T-002-S-00010
2018-03-20-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for raising this important question on behalf of her residents. We certainly share her view that for seniors suffering from incontinence, we would encourage them to seek treatment early. We do not have data on the total number of seniors suffering from incontinence, as patients could be seeing their doctors for other primary conditions such as urinary infection, prostate problems or post-stroke treatment, which include treatment for incontinence.",1,11,2018-03-20-T-002-S-00011
2018-03-20-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, over the past three years, around 2,900 seniors aged 65 years and above received subsidised treatment specifically for incontinence at polyclinics and Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) General Practitioners (GPs). This would be a subset of the total number of seniors seeking treatment for incontinence.",2,12,2018-03-20-T-002-S-00012
2018-03-20-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"Among this group of 2,900 seniors, those who received treatment at the polyclinics paid a median annual cost after subsidies of less than $10 in 2016. The cost and treatment required for each patient will depend on the nature and severity of his condition.",3,13,2018-03-20-T-002-S-00013
2018-03-20-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),Seniors receive subsidies of up to 75% when they visit polyclinics. Seniors who require further financial assistance after Government subsidies may seek help from the Medical Social Workers at our public healthcare institutions.,4,14,2018-03-20-T-002-S-00014
2018-03-20-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Sir, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive reply. I have one supplementary question. Besides treatment, I always think that preventive measures are better cure. I would like to thank HPB for organising many exercises nowadays in our housing estates. Perhaps, there can be more talks during these exercise sessions because incontinence will affect the quality of life, especially of our elderly residents. So, I would like to ask whether there will be more awareness programmes conducted by HPB so as to help more residents.",1,15,2018-03-20-T-002-S-00015
2018-03-20-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Er Dr Lee for her supplementary question and for her suggestion. I certainly agree with her that prevention is better than cure; that is the approach that we take in MOH. And HPB will be happy to work with our Regional Health Systems, our healthcare institutions to be able to reach out to residents in the community to raise awareness and to give talks focusing on prevention, on health promotion. This is something which we will continue to work with our community partners to do, including our grassroots organisations and community leaders, to reach out to our residents.",1,16,2018-03-20-T-002-S-00016
2018-03-20-T-002,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. In Clementi where I serve, we have a number of elderly residents, some of whom have shared about the costs of consumables that they need because they have incontinence. For example, adult diapers and other recurring expenditure items. Would MOH either on its own or together with MTI be willing to consider studying the costs of such consumables for patients with incontinence and to see whether there are areas where these consumables might be delivered in a less expensive way?",1,17,2018-03-20-T-002-S-00017
2018-03-20-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I thank Dr Tan for his supplementary question. Indeed, I think he is right that the help that we provide to our residents suffering from incontinence is not just for treatment but also in other areas like consumables. Diapers, for example. If seniors require adult diapers, they can apply for assistance under the Seniors Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF). The fund provides means-tested subsidies – 50% or 80% subsidies – for consumables such as diapers.",1,18,2018-03-20-T-002-S-00018
2018-03-20-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"It would be something that we would be happy to work with Dr Tan and his team in Clementi, to raise awareness and to reach out to his residents who require such assistance.",2,19,2018-03-20-T-002-S-00019
2018-03-20-T-003,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,asked	 the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many cases of small fires on expressways or roads have been reported in the last five years; and (b) how many of these fires have been caused by errant motorists or motorcyclists who throw their cigarette butts onto the central dividers or roadside plants and trees.,1,20,2018-03-20-T-003-S-00020
2018-03-20-T-003,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Mr Speaker, the SCDF only started keeping records of roadside vegetation fires from 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, SCDF attended to about 350 such fires annually. Most of these fires were caused by cigarette butts.",1,21,2018-03-20-T-003-S-00021
2018-03-20-T-003,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"SCDF leads an inter-agency taskforce to deal with vegetation fires. Among other measures, NEA regularly clears the roads of dry leaves, which are more susceptible to catching fire.",2,22,2018-03-20-T-003-S-00022
2018-03-20-T-003,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"But no amount of clearing will help, if some members of the public continue to illegally and irresponsibly discard cigarette butts. Such persons can be charged under the Environmental Public Health Act for littering at the least, and if we can prove the fact and the fires also cause serious damage, such persons can be charged under the Penal Code for fire-related offences. We encourage the public to report such offences via NEA's website, its mobile app or its hotline.",3,23,2018-03-20-T-003-S-00023
2018-03-20-T-003,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Second Minister for her reply. I am a bit surprised to know that there are so many fires annually caused by cigarette butts on roads. We know that in public places and in our estates, NEA takes a very serious approach to littering. But it is probably a little bit difficult when motorists are on the go and they litter as they drive or ride. So, what other forms of action or enforcement can be taken on them? And to what extent is the fines imposed? Are there demerit points or compulsory community action, for instance, imposed on them once they are caught?",1,24,2018-03-20-T-003-S-00024
2018-03-20-T-003,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, the Member asked a very good question. It is actually quite difficult. When you think of a vegetation fire, the fact is that it would not have started immediately, let us say, when a cigarette butt is discarded. It would take some time. So, hypothetically, even if someone happens to be at the right spot, at the right time, and manages to capture on camera or through video someone who had thrown a cigarette butt, it is not so easy to establish whether that particular fire started as a result of that particular littering incident.",1,25,2018-03-20-T-003-S-00025
2018-03-20-T-003,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"There are no easy ways to prevent, except to appeal to people's civic-mindedness, except to make it a habit of reminding people that whenever you discard a cigarette butt, whether it is in a housing estate or anywhere, that could lead to some other situation, such as a fire. That is why the NEA takes a very strict view of littering, especially when someone were to throw a cigarette butt. I am sure, as Members of Parliament, we have received appeals from our residents who tell us, ""It was just that once"" or ""I wasn't thinking"". But yet, the NEA will have to take a strict view and really because, if it does result in a fire, it is not so easy to prove who did it. And yet, the damage could be serious.",2,26,2018-03-20-T-003-S-00026
2018-03-20-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked	 the Minister for Home Affairs (a) when will work begin on the installation of smoke and fire alarms for HDB rental flats; (b) which housing estates will be covered in the initial stage; and (c) how long will this exercise take to complete the installation for all rental flats.,1,27,2018-03-20-T-004-S-00027
2018-03-20-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Speaker, MHA announced in November last year that SCDF, HDB and PA were working together to provide free installation of home fire alarm devices, or HFADs, for all 60,000 public rental flats.",1,28,2018-03-20-T-004-S-00028
2018-03-20-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The installation will commence in June 2018 and will be carried out in phases, starting with housing estates with a higher number of rental households with elderly residents.",2,29,2018-03-20-T-004-S-00029
2018-03-20-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),We expect to complete the installation for all HDB public rental flats by 2021.,3,30,2018-03-20-T-004-S-00030
2018-03-20-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, I have two supplementary questions. First, the installation, is it for all the rental flats? Previously, it was planned for only those rental flats with senior residents but I think we should do it for all the rental flats. The second question is, Nee Soon South is under which phase?",1,31,2018-03-20-T-004-S-00031
2018-03-20-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I thank the Member for asking those two questions. The first answer is yes. I made the announcement and I had explained then that between HDB and SCDF, they have reached an agreement. Because of the unique circumstances of rental flat tenants, we have decided that the installation will be for all rental units.",1,32,2018-03-20-T-004-S-00032
2018-03-20-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To the second question, if Er Dr Lee Bee Wah did not ask that question, I would be rather surprised. It probably would have been someone else in disguise. I would be very happy if Nee Soon South was in the first phase. But if it is not in the first phase, then it would be in the second phase or perhaps in the third phase. The good news is that everything would be done by 2021.",2,33,2018-03-20-T-004-S-00033
2018-03-20-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I just want to ask the Minister, what about after the rental flats are done, would you consider the studio apartments as well, because it is mostly seniors living there.",1,34,2018-03-20-T-004-S-00034
2018-03-20-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, I think we take things one step at a time. Rental units – we decided to do for all, for a very simple reason because the unit does not belong to the tenant. And there are also more movements; people move in, people move out. There is not quite the case for studio apartment. They are owned property. And if we extend it to the studio apartments, then the argument could also be made – what about for seniors living in their own homes elsewhere, not in studio apartments? So, for the time being, the decision is very clear. We would do so for rental households.",1,35,2018-03-20-T-004-S-00035
2018-03-20-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked	 the Minister for Manpower (a) in 2017, how many mediations have been handled by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM); (b) what have been the outcomes; and (c) when either party refuses to attend the mediation session, what are the options offered under TADM.",1,36,2018-03-20-T-005-S-00036
2018-03-20-T-005,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) was set up in April 2017, slightly under a year ago, and its purpose was to help employees and employers manage and resolve employment disputes. This includes both salary and non-salary-related disputes. A large majority of the disputes received by TADM are salary-related disputes which are governed under the Employment Claims Act (ECA), where mediation is compulsory. For non-salary disputes, voluntary mediation is offered.",1,37,2018-03-20-T-005-S-00037
2018-03-20-T-005,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Between April and December 2017, TADM concluded mediation for 6,000 salary-related claims under the ECA. About 95% of these claims were filed by employees, and the remaining by employers for notice pay.",2,38,2018-03-20-T-005-S-00038
2018-03-20-T-005,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Seventy-nine percent of these 6,000 claims were settled amicably through mediation. Twelve percent were not settled as parties were unable to work out a settlement. These cases were then referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) for adjudication. The remaining 9% were claims involving non-attendance at mediation. In other words, someone did not show up.",3,39,2018-03-20-T-005-S-00039
2018-03-20-T-005,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"One-third of the non-attendance cases were closed as the claimants themselves did not show up. For the remaining two-thirds, when respondents did not attend mediation, claimants could have their claims heard and adjudicated by the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT), even if respondents do not turn up for the hearing. Where there are good grounds, the ECT can and will make a payment order in favour of claimants, for the full claimed amount. As a consequence of non-attendance, the ECT may also order the respondents to pay costs to the claimants.",4,40,2018-03-20-T-005-S-00040
2018-03-20-T-005,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"To date, TADM and the tribunal have helped about 92% of employees with valid salary claims recover their salaries in full. Most of the remaining employees received some form of partial payment.",5,41,2018-03-20-T-005-S-00041
2018-03-20-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Sir, I have two supplementary questions. First, is there any salary cap, or is it that any person can go and file their case at TADM? The second question is, I have a resident who was referred to TADM and the employer did not turn up. TADM says that since the employer did not turn up, so they closed the case. But they should have referred the case to the Employment Claims Tribunal, as the Second Minister mentioned just now. So, perhaps, better training should be given to the staff at TADM. Instead of closing the case, we should see how best to help the claimant, in this case, the employee.",1,42,2018-03-20-T-005-S-00042
2018-03-20-T-005,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In answer to the first question, I stand corrected, but there is no cap to the claims that can be filed. To the second question, as I said in my earlier reply, even if the respondent does not turn up, it does not prevent the claimant from bringing the matter to the tribunal, and the tribunal will look at the validity of the claims and if the tribunal is convinced that the claimant has filed a valid claim, then the fact that the respondent did not show up at the hearing, does not prevent the tribunal from awarding full payment as claimed to the claimant. In the case of your resident, if there are some particular situation that we are not aware of, I invite the Member to let me know and we will look into it.",1,43,2018-03-20-T-005-S-00043
2018-03-20-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"What I meant is that a lot of employees are not aware that they can go to the tribunal. For the staff in TADM, instead of closing the case, they should have told that employees and advise them that they can file in tribunal. So, perhaps, there should be a better training to the TADM staff so as to help the employees or the claimants.",1,44,2018-03-20-T-005-S-00044

2018-03-20-T-006,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,"asked	 the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can provide an update on how many households, companies and businesses currently practise recycling of recyclable items respectively; and (b) how extensively are recycling bins used within our housing estates and public places.",1,46,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00046

Of those who practised recycling, 91% indicated that they did so via the recycling bins provided by our public waste collectors. Based on NEA's data on the commercial sector, 94% of large hotels and shopping malls have implemented recycling programmes for their premises. As a whole, the non-domestic sector had a recycling rate of 76% in 2017.",2,48,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00048

This is higher than the figure cited in recent media reports, which only covers the National Recycling Programme (NRP). The NRP, which provides recycling bins and CCRs to make it convenient for households to recycle daily, is only one means by which domestic recyclables are collected. Other means include door-to-door collection by the informal sector and collection drives at community events.",4,50,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00050

For example, from 1 April this year, all new non-landed private residential developments above four storeys will need to provide dual chutes for refuse and recyclables. These dual chutes have already been introduced in new HDB Build-to-Order flats since January 2014. All existing condominiums will also have to provide one recycling bin per block from 1 August this year. We also recently announced plans to implement an e-waste management system through the Extended Producer Responsibility approach by 2021.",5,51,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00051

NEA will continue to engage Singaporeans and NGOs via social media posts, educational materials distributed at community and school events, and providing information on NEA's website and NEA's myENV mobile app. We hope that through these initiatives, more will be encouraged to do their part for the environment.",6,52,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00052
2018-03-20-T-006,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answers. I am wondering, what is the impact on the recycling process when items are all mixed together, because there are some recycling bins that allow you to separate items but there are some which allow you to mix the items together. For the buildings that have dual chutes – one for rubbish and one for recyclable items, I wonder whether it is effective, because for example, glass bottles that can be recycled, when they are thrown from height, the moment they reach the ground floor, they shatter into shards. How would that impact the recycling process and can better education be carried out for residents who may confuse the two chutes, thinking that they can just throw rubbish into either one of them?",1,53,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00053
2018-03-20-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for her supplementary questions.

2018-03-20-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The blue commingled recycling bin is placed at every HDB block and provided to every private landed residential home. That is really for ease of access. First of all, they do not need to invest extra effort and time in segregating the different recyclables. They also do not need to make space at home for the different recyclables because they can just deposit the recyclables in the blue bins anytime.",2,55,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00055
2018-03-20-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"These recyclables will be taken to the materials recovery facility (MRF) where the recyclables will be segregated and brought to the relevant recycling plants for processing. Regarding the contamination of recyclables that the Member alluded to for the blue commingled recycling bin, yes, there is contamination of recyclables if they deposit food waste or non-recyclables in the bin. The contamination rate is about 40% on average.",3,56,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00056
2018-03-20-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In this area, what we want to do is to appeal to the public to be gracious and not deposit the non-recyclables in the bins, particularly if it is food waste. When it contaminates the recyclables, you waste people's effort in wanting to do their part for the environment. What we will also do is to work with stakeholders on the ground, for instance, the town councils to make sure that there are sufficient waste bins around.",4,57,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00057
2018-03-20-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We are also looking into putting up more prominent labels on the blue recycling bins to tell them ""no food and liquid waste” in the recycling bins and we hope that Singaporeans will be more gracious.",5,58,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00058
2018-03-20-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to dual chutes, HDB's study in 2012 showed that blocks with dual chutes system – that means one for waste and one for recyclables – actually contribute up to three times more recyclables than the blocks without those chutes. Because of this, HDB has implemented the dual chutes system for all the BTO flats, launched from 2014 and we are requiring private non-landed residential developments above four storeys to also have this dual chute system from 1 April.",6,59,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00059
2018-03-20-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"You are right that if you throw recyclables into the chute, depending on where they land, glass bottles, for instance, might be broken. But this will not affect the recovery of the other commingled recyclables at the MRF. Actually even for glass pieces, particularly for the larger pieces, they can be recovered for recycling.",7,60,2018-03-20-T-006-S-00060
2018-03-20-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked	 the Minister for Education (Schools) whether it is feasible to scan or digitise examination scripts before sending them to Cambridge Assessment in the United Kingdom for marking so as to better deal with incidents of scripts being misplaced or stolen.,1,61,2018-03-20-T-007-S-00061
2018-03-20-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Education (Schools)),"Sir, each year, about 900,000 scripts are sent to Cambridge Assessment for marking. Cambridge Assessment has shared that this is the first time examination scripts were stolen and it is taking this unfortunate incident very seriously. Cambridge Assessment has assured MOE and SEAB that they will review their processes to ensure the security of examination papers and scripts, and safeguard the integrity of our national examinations. This includes a full scrutiny of the courier services offered by its suppliers.",1,62,2018-03-20-T-007-S-00062
2018-03-20-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Education (Schools)),"I thank Mr Pillai for his suggestion of using technology to reduce the risk of physical movement of examination scripts. Indeed, SEAB is studying the option of scanning and marking answer scripts electronically. This would potentially reduce the risks, such as theft or misplacement, associated with transporting hardcopy examination scripts. However, given the large volume of answer scripts and number of subject papers offered each year, the implementation of the scanning and electronic marking of answer scripts would have to be carefully considered.",2,63,2018-03-20-T-007-S-00063
2018-03-20-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I thank the hon Senior Minister of State for his explanation. I have a supplementary question. In relation to the case of the 238 ""A"" Level Chemistry examination papers that went missing or were stolen, rather, may I ask how did the measure taken by MOE to assess the candidates by giving them an aggregate score or to allow them to re-sit their exams, square against the need to be fair to the other candidates, and make sure that they are not disadvantaged?",1,64,2018-03-20-T-007-S-00064
2018-03-20-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,The option of allowing a re-sit can be understood as being fair. It was a full examination and these were candidates that did not have the opportunity to have their submissions marked.,1,65,2018-03-20-T-007-S-00065
2018-03-20-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The issue, I suppose, is really to look at those candidates who had a presumptive grade assigned. If you look at that subset, the technique that was used is something that has been used and the model has been developed quite robustly.",2,66,2018-03-20-T-007-S-00066
2018-03-20-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"One can imagine that on a regular basis every year, there are candidates who, through illnesses or unfortunate circumstances, are unable to submit every component of an exam. In this case, it is only one out of four components of the exam which went missing.",3,67,2018-03-20-T-007-S-00067
2018-03-20-T-007,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Between MOE, SEAB as well as Cambridge Assessments, we have not just a single model but a number of mathematical and statistical models derived to predict, I suppose, or triangulate the final performance of a candidate. This is something we have developed over time. The three bodies involved did their analysis on this occasion, and also back-checked the analysis with respect to the outcome for these candidates. It was felt that this was a reasonable proxy but the choice was then given to the candidates should they wish to re-sit the paper. In the process, none of the other candidates, who had their scripts properly marked and went through the process, were in any way disadvantaged.",4,68,2018-03-20-T-007-S-00068

2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"We have invested substantially in our public transport network and will continue to do so. By 2030, eight in 10 households will be within a 10-minute walk of a train station. The advent of sharing services of active mobility devices, such as bicycles, power-assisted bicycles (PABs) and personal mobility devices (PMDs), has made the journey between the train station and our homes and work places even more convenient.",2,83,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00083
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Over time, we will reduce our reliance on cars. Today, two in three trips during peak periods are already made on public transport. By 2030, we aim for three in four trips to be so. We will continue to work towards a car-lite Singapore, which will allow us to maximise the use of limited land and free up car park space for other uses, such as housing, schools and hospitals.",3,84,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00084
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"This Bill will support our vision of a car-lite Singapore, by making two key changes to the Parking Places Act (PPA).",4,85,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00085
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"First, the Bill introduces a licensing regime for dockless vehicle-sharing operators, which will cover sharing services for bicycles, PMDs and PABs. While such sharing operations contribute to the attractiveness of our public transport network, it was unfortunate that it has led to pervasive indiscriminate parking of bicycles which degrades our living environment and creates safety issues. A licensing regime will address the problem of indiscriminate parking and allow sharing operations to grow in a more sustainable manner.",5,86,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00086
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Second, the Bill will allow the Government to improve the management of parking provision by private developments, to support our car-lite vision. This will in turn allow us to maximise the use of the limited land in Singapore, and free up space to improve our living environment.",6,87,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00087
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),Let me explain each of these changes in turn.,7,88,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00088
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"The first set of amendments pertains to the licensing of dockless vehicle-sharing operators. Dockless bicycle-sharing started just over a year ago and has expanded rapidly. There are now more than 100,000 shared bicycles in Singapore. There are many advantages to dockless bicycle sharing.",8,89,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00089

2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Third, users can pick up the bicycle at the start of a journey and drop it off at the end, which is very convenient and offers Singaporeans more travel options. This has in turn helped to encourage active mobility in Singapore.",11,92,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00092
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Unfortunately, indiscriminate parking of shared bicycles has marred this positive development. The bicycle sharing operators have exacerbated this problem as they grew their fleets too quickly in a bid to capture market share. There are also inconsiderate and irresponsible users who leave bicycles outside of the designated parking spaces.",12,93,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00093
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"LTA has worked hard to address the problem. LTA has been increasing parking infrastructure for bicycles. There are now over 170,000 public bicycle parking lots at MRT stations, bus stops, HDB estates and parks. LTA and other public agencies plan to provide another 50,000 more bicycle parking lots by 2020. Collectively, they provide ease of accessibility without cluttering our urban landscape, a balance we need to strike even if some users prefer bicycle parking lots right at their doorstep.",13,94,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00094
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"LTA, NParks and Town Councils have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with bicycle-sharing operators in October 2017.

2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"In addition, LTA has impounded indiscriminately parked bicycles which were not removed by operators within half a day, and fined operators. Since mid-last year, LTA has issued more than 2,100 removal notices, and collected about $180,000 in fines and administrative fees from the operators.",15,96,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00096
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Despite these efforts, the problem of indiscriminate parking remains. To strengthen LTA’s levers to deal with indiscriminate parking, we propose to introduce a licensing framework for active mobility device-sharing operators. I have spoken about this during my Ministry’s Committee of Supply debate earlier this month and many Members in the House have expressed their support.",16,97,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00097
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Clause 6 of the Bill introduces a new Part 3, which consists of new sections 8 to 8T setting out the proposed licensing regime. It will be an offence to operate without a licence under section 8C. If convicted, unlicensed operators will face a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment of up to six months, or both. A further fine of up to $500 will be imposed for each day the offence continues after conviction.",17,98,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00098

2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Section 8 defines public places as State land and land controlled or managed by a statutory body, where the public has free access.",22,103,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00103
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Vehicle-sharing services that operate only in private land, or in areas where the public does not have free right of access, will not be covered by the licensing regime. Examples include private land such as shopping malls, places where access requires proof of identity such as military camps or ticketed attractions like the Singapore Zoo.",23,104,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00104
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Third, we will not regulate docked vehicle-sharing businesses whose vehicles must be hired from or returned to exclusive vehicle docking stations, such as Vélib in Paris or YouBike in Taipei. A bicycle rental business operating from a shop is also excluded from the licensing regime if its customers must return the bicycles hired to the shop. The nature of such services makes them less likely to cause parking-related disamenities.",24,105,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00105
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),The licensing regime has three key features.,25,106,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00106
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"First, LTA will manage the size of each operator’s fleet. This will be done by using its powers under section 8G to impose licencing conditions, including conditions on the maximum fleet size that each operator can deploy.",26,107,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00107
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Given the scale of the indiscriminate parking problem today, LTA will take a more conservative approach in setting the fleet sizes at the start. However, we will review the fleet sizes regularly. Operators who manage their fleets well can apply to LTA to grow their fleets.",27,108,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00108
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"In assessing applications to increase fleet size, LTA will take into account factors such as the operator’s ability to manage indiscriminate parking by its users, its fleet utilisation rate, and other relevant factors such as the demand for the service and availability of parking spaces. This will create the right incentives for operators to put in place processes to manage indiscriminate parking, and ensure that each operator grows its fleet in a more sustainable manner.",28,109,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00109
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Second, the licensing regime will give LTA regulatory levers to require operators to manage indiscriminate parking.",29,110,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00110

For example, under section 8N(2), LTA will set industry-wide standards relating to the use of geo-fencing and on the frequency of removal of indiscriminately parked vehicles in a timely manner.",30,111,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00111
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Under section 8P, LTA can take regulatory action against operators who fail to comply with its directions, standards of performance or licence conditions, such as the maximum fleet size. A range of regulatory action is provided to LTA to enable a better calibrated response to non-compliance by licensees. Regulatory action ranges from reducing the maximum fleet size, imposing financial penalties of up to $100,000 for each instance of non-compliance, suspending or even cancelling licences.",31,112,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00112

2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"Third, LTA will direct licensed operators to work together to collectively ban individuals who persistently park improperly in public places.

2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"LTA will be able to leverage on data and technology to improve enforcement. Section 8K imposes obligations on operators to keep accounts and records, and to provide information to LTA. This can include data on the location of each deployed vehicle so that LTA can remotely track indiscriminately parked vehicles and enforce more effectively. Section 8M also requires operators to provide information when requested by LTA for enforcement purposes. Failure to provide information to LTA under sections 8K and 8M will be offences.",38,119,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00119

Today, the PPA allows LTA to make rules on the number of parking places or spaces to be provided on any type of land or buildings. Private developments have to provide a specified minimum number of parking lots. Clause 17 introduces a new section 22 which empowers LTA to make rules prescribing the range of parking lots which private developers have to provide, defined by a lower and/or upper limit. This will enable LTA to better calibrate parking provision requirements for private developments. LTA will release more details by the end of the year.",43,124,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00124

As a result, accidents which have resulted in injuries to pedestrians, cyclists and PMD users have occurred. We need to expedite the building of cycling and PMD-friendly paths, especially along LTA's road pavements.

Sir, to support bike sharing in public housing estates, the 15 PAP Town Councils have drawn 3,000 yellow boxes at the void decks of our blocks.

2018-03-20-T-010,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, besides regulating bike sharing operators, it is necessary for the LTA to conduct regular enforcement operations to address the reckless behaviour of some cyclists and PMD users. I urge the Ministry to consider imposing default liability on cyclists and PMD users if an accident occurs along a pedestrian footpath, unless it is proven that the accident is attributed to the behaviour of pedestrians, rather than the cyclists and PMD users.",18,148,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00148
2018-03-20-T-010,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"To ensure the safety of all parties, all cyclists and PMD users must slow down and signal in advance to warn pedestrians. The LTA should also set up mobile enforcement teams to act against reckless cyclists and PMD users based on feedback from the public. In the facilitation of enforcement, a telephone hotline to gather information from the public on “hot spots” or accident-prone areas will be of great value. The setting up of a hotline will also encourage more people to keep watch on the behaviour of cyclists and PMD users. This will enhance safety for all. Sir, I support the Bill.",19,149,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00149

2018-03-20-T-010,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"The first is on the role and accountability of the operator to maintain roadworthiness of their vehicles so as to ensure the safety of hirers.

2018-03-20-T-010,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Sir, the sections in this Bill, however, are not clear on the responsibility of the licensee on claims on hirer in events where accidents can be attributable to improperly maintained vehicles or negligence in other forms from the operator. I would like to suggest that inclusion of liability requirements and consideration on reasonable closure to cases of claims or dispute as part of licensee application and renewals.",4,153,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00153

2018-03-20-T-010,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Sir, I would like to seek clarification on what is the need for such detailed level of trip information on the hirer, and other what circumstances can the authority call on such information, and how would the information be protected. Sir, notwithstanding the clarifications, I support the Bill.",6,155,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00155
2018-03-20-T-010,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. The amendment to the Bill has with it, the intention to move Singapore towards a car-lite society. Though the Bill aims to implement a licensing regime on dock-less bicycle-sharing operators to address the problem of indiscriminate parking; and to better manage provision of parking by private developments to support our car-lite vision, however, we need to also calibrate the regulations, monitor and evaluate the parking measures if this invariably results in less take-up of bicycle sharing as a result of this Bill.",1,156,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00156

2018-03-20-T-010,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Licensing for bicycle-sharing operators is a good idea, however, LTA must also look into the size of each operator’s fleet. While there must be regulations, it should not be a deterrent to the market players with high barriers to entry. Industry players currently operate in a free market, yet with fairly many regulations, these operators may not have the incentive to compete to expand their market size, as well as to invest in innovation for more efficient operation methods if their business is not viable.",3,158,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00158

However, the responsibility should not lie solely on the operators, but also on the end user. Having said that, imposing fines as punitive measures alone may not be the best idea to discourage adverse behaviour, but rather to reward good positive behaviour. One of the operators, ofo, has designed a reward scheme for users who parked the bicycle properly. This reward scheme can be practiced by other operators to encourage and incentivise correct behaviours.",4,159,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00159
2018-03-20-T-010,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),Operators may be pressured to exit the industry while new entrants may be discouraged with financial penalty imposed on them.

Will there be feeder bus services available in such situation for those who wish to take public transport?",10,165,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00165
2018-03-20-T-010,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Lastly, I would like to propose for the Government to encourage and incentivise developers' partnership with private operators. Such partnership will help to retain the connectivity and convenience of movement around the private development and/or access to public transport. Developers can be incentivised to partner with operators to provide bike-sharing facilities within the infrastructure development, that it, having designated bicycle parking lots near the building. Sir, notwithstanding this, I support the Bill.",11,166,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00166

QR codes can also be vandalised, rendering them useless.",3,169,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00169

Zone 1 refers to the buildings in the CBD and Zone 2 refers to areas within 400m radius from the MRT stations outside Zone 1.",3,184,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00184
2018-03-20-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In view of the push for car-lite society, it is understandable for MOT to remove the minimum parking lots required for residential and commercial buildings. With the current amendment Bill, MOT is stipulating a maximum number of parking lots, instead of a minimum required for each building. While I can understand the benefits of replacing car park lots with more commercial space at office buildings and shopping centres, I am more sceptical about the benefits for the buyers of residential units, unless there is a corresponding change in the building codes. Thus, I would like to clarify a few points with the Senior Minister of State.",4,185,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00185
2018-03-20-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Firstly, will the new parking provisions be applicable to existing commercial buildings, especially those in Zones 1 and 2? If so, would the Minister mandate a certain percentage of the extra space to benefit the public and the community? For example, the windfall arising from having to provide fewer carpark spaces can be shared with the public by providing the additional space for bicycle parking, car sharing/electric car charging facilities, or lease extra space for use to childcare centres or eldercare centres at a cost-recovery rate.",5,186,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00186
2018-03-20-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"As a guide, I will like to suggest that MOT could consider working with MND to direct the building owners to share at least 50% of the benefits arising from the lower carpark provision. The lower carpark provision should also translate to facilities that can benefit members of the public. And for new commercial buildings, the lower carpark provision should also translate to facilities that also benefit the public, such as promotion of healthy living, promotion of car-lite measures and provision of childcare and eldercare facilities at a cost recovery rate.",6,187,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00187
2018-03-20-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Next, will the new parking provision be applicable to existing residential buildings as well? If so, would the Minister mandate a certain percentage of the newly available space for use as shared bicycle or PMD parking facilities? Or for that matter, devote space for car sharing and electric car charging facilities?",7,188,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00188
2018-03-20-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In a similar fashion, the lower car park provision for the new residential buildings should not end up benefiting the developers alone, and alone. I know that developers are capable of maximising the residential units for sale, so as to maximise their profits. Hence, I hope that MOT could work with MND to mandate the bulk of the additional space arising from lower car park provisions for communal spaces like gardens, physical fitness facilities and even shared car, bicycle or PMD parking facilities. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin please.",8,189,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00189
2018-03-20-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I would like to applaud MOT's intention to control the abuse and indiscriminate parking of shared bicycles. However, we should caution against over-correction.",9,190,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00190
2018-03-20-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The chief benefit of shared bikes is that they can be parked anywhere, anytime. Many residents use them to go from HDB void decks to the MRT stations before going to work or school. If after the amendment is passed, residents have to walk several hundred metres to use the bikes, it will be taking a step backwards.",10,191,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00191

2018-03-20-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I support LTA’s plan to designate more yellow boxes at HDB void decks, MRT stations and bus stops.

2018-03-20-T-010,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, hirers utilising the bikes need somewhere to leave the vehicles when they have completed their journeys. Mandating the installation of quick response (QR) codes for approved parking areas will go a long way to ensure that these bikes will be deposited where they will not cause disamenities. Having designated parking lots will also enable the rental firms to collect the bikes more easily in a timely manner when needed.",4,200,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00200
2018-03-20-T-010,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"However, we need more designated parking lots in a wider spread of locations to ensure the viability and utilisation of shared bikes. The LTA has indicated its commitment to enhance our parking infrastructure and I urge the agency to expedite the set-up of more dedicated parking places to facilitate responsible parking. Areas with significant human traffic, in particular, should have more designated parking areas for these bikes.",5,201,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00201

2018-03-20-T-010,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, I just mentioned that the dockless bikes need more dedicated parking places to deter indiscriminate parking.

2018-03-20-T-010,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"The sense of responsibility of each user is very important. My residents said that indiscriminate parking is akin to littering. They said jokingly that indiscriminate parking is not just a ‘land’ issue; it has also become an “air, sea and land” problem. They explained that ""sea"" means bicycles are dumped in the drains or by the river; ""air"" means that you even see bikes on trees or left in the corridor of HDB blocks. So, this is really an “air, sea, land” problem.",8,204,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00204
2018-03-20-T-010,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),We must adopt a carrot and stick approach. Hence I support the provision that all operators will impose a temporary ban on users who repeatedly park the bicycles irresponsibly.,9,205,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00205
2018-03-20-T-010,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"In addition to public education to remind users to park responsibly, we should also consider imposing a fine on recalcitrant offenders, or we can reward those who park responsibly. I think this can send the message more effectively to riders that they must be responsible for the bicycles used.",10,206,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00206
2018-03-20-T-010,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to ask whether the Ministry possesses any users' data, such as age and the average income. This data can help us determine the amount of the fines or reward.",11,207,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00207
2018-03-20-T-010,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"According to my observation, users are from various social strata, and the majority are from the low income group. Most of them are young and middle-aged, including students and foreign workers. The fine should not be set too high and the award should not be too little so that it can achieve a good deterrent or rewarding effect.",12,208,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00208
2018-03-20-T-010,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"The amendments require that all operators must apply for a licence. This will help the Government to control the quality of the operators and ensure that they properly manage the number of bicycles. Perhaps the market is already saturated. It is estimated that out of the 100,000 bicycles, only half are frequently used.",13,209,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00209
2018-03-20-T-010,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Recently, SUTD and the Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology did a study on one major bike-sharing operator in Singapore. They analysed their data of 10,000 bikes in April and May 2017 and found that each bike was only rented for 30 minutes a day on average. Hence, it is wise for the Government to control the operators and the number of bicycles through licensing.",14,210,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00210

2018-03-20-T-010,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"It is a timely one, with better clarity and provisions made on the parking of vehicles in public places. I support the overall recommendations made in the amendment Bill. However, I have a few clarifications to make and one suggestion to offer.",2,213,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00213
2018-03-20-T-010,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"First, I wholly support the inclusion of Part 3 that introduces the new sections 8 to 8T. These sections provide better clarity on the various provisions made in Part 3 relating to public parking places, licensing requirements, and enforcement actions, which are much needed. Residents I met have expressed their frustrations with shared vehicles and bicycles that have dotted the void decks and green spaces in our estate. Personally, I have also had to manoeuvre through obstacle courses made up of indiscriminately parked bicycles at the void decks, including that at my own block.",3,214,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00214
2018-03-20-T-010,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"However, I wish to clarify if these provisions and restrictions apply only to vehicle hiring operators and users or hirers of shared vehicles such as bicycles or personal mobility devices (PMDs), and not to private owners of similar vehicles? At the moment, there is still no requirement for private bicycles or PMD owners to register ownership of such vehicles, and if they also indiscriminately park their vehicles in public places, then no enforcement action can be taken on them. Are there plans to require private bicycle or PMD owners to be registered so that proper monitoring of indiscriminate parking and subsequent enforcement can be carried out?",4,215,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00215
2018-03-20-T-010,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, while the amendments in this Bill seek to rein in on the licensing requirements of the operators of shared vehicles in order to bring about greater responsibility towards the hiring of shared vehicles, how will the users or hirers of such shared vehicles also be made to shoulder equal responsibility in the use and parking of these shared vehicles? What enforcement actions can be taken on errant or irresponsible users or hirers of shared vehicles? And since there are numerous users or hirers of shared vehicles, will monetary fines be the only form of enforcement to be meted out to irresponsible users for indiscriminate parking? Would LTA consider imposing compulsory community work on repeat offenders, for instance?",5,216,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00216
2018-03-20-T-010,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Third, the requirement for geo-fencing of a shared vehicle operator’s vehicles has been made known to the operators for quite some time, yet no adherence to this requirement has been made and little or no enforcement carried out. Hence, for the shared vehicle operators, how does LTA plan to impose the standards of performance such as the use of geo-fencing technology or monetary fines to minimise or eradicate indiscriminate parking of the shared vehicles under their licence? Will vehicle docking systems, for instance, be imposed on these operators should they fail to comply with the requirements for proper parking of their shared vehicles such as through the use of geo-fencing technology? Will current LTA enforcement officers be sufficient to carry out checks to ensure adherence to the required standards of performance by the shared vehicle operators, or will more enforcement officers need to be recruited?",6,217,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00217
2018-03-20-T-010,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Finally, I would like to suggest that for places or buildings where there are absolutely no designated parking lots for motorcycles, some flexibility is to be accorded to dispatch riders and food deliverers who usually move about on motorcycles or PMDs. To elaborate, when such dispatch riders or food deliverers need to deliver whatever items as assigned as part of their job at these buildings or places, they would park their vehicles at a spot in a public area while they go about delivering the items as assigned, since there are no designated parking lots for motorcycles there. Examples of such buildings are DBS Building, Marina Bay Sands and Novena Hospital, from what I understand, though I may stand corrected. Can LTA work with the management of such private developments to provide designated Interim Parking Lots for dispatch riders and food deliverers to park their motorcycles or PMDs for free for a period of no more than 10 to 15 minutes so that they would not get parking offence summonses and would not obstruct traffic or pedestrian access? These dispatch riders and food deliverers can be given vehicle stickers or decals that clearly indicate they are delivering items as assigned as part of their job and some leeway can be given to them to park their vehicles at these Interim Parking Lots during such work assignments.",7,218,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00218
2018-03-20-T-010,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, notwithstanding the clarifications I have put forth and the suggestion posited, I support the Bill.",8,219,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00219

2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,Let me first address Members’ queries on the three key features of the proposed licensing regime.,2,222,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00222
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"First, Mr Gan Thiam Poh expressed his support for LTA's management of the size of each operator's fleet by setting a maximum fleet size. LTA will review the fleet sizes regularly. Operators who manage their fleet well can apply to LTA to grow their fleets.",3,223,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00223
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,This will ensure that they grow their fleet sizes in a more sustainable manner and are incentivised to put in place measures to manage the indiscriminate parking as they grow their fleet.,4,224,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00224
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,LTA will use a bottom-up approach and consider each application on its own merits. This is because the fleet size needs to take into account how well each operator manages his business to maximise utilisation and minimise disamenities.,5,225,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00225
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"With LTA managing the fleet size of each operator, operators will be incentivised to deploy their limited fleet wisely, instead of flooding public bicycle spaces with unused shared bicycles. LTA will also monitor the situation and if necessary, step up the expansion of bicycle infrastructure.",6,226,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00226
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Second, LTA will be able to impose licence conditions as well as set industry-wide standards, to address indiscriminate parking.",7,227,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00227
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"With regard to Dr Teo Ho Pin’s suggestion on the penalty framework for licensees, we will look into it as LTA works out the implementation details of the licensing regime. We would also like to assure Dr Teo and Dr Intan that LTA will take strong action against repeated or serious infringements of licence requirements, including revocation of the operator’s licence.",8,228,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00228
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Faisal Manap asked about the data requirements under the new section 8K. Section 8K imposes obligations on operators to keep accounts and records, and to provide information to LTA. This can include data on the location of each deployed vehicle, so that LTA can track indiscriminate parking and enforce more effectively by leveraging on data and technology. LTA will put in place safeguards to protect the information, including implementing controls to limit access to the database.",9,229,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00229
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"To ensure that dockless bicycle-sharing remains attractive to users, and to prevent indiscriminate parking, several Members spoke about the importance of having adequate parking and I agree. While it is not possible for us to always have parking at our door-steps, we are striving to have parking spaces available within a short walk of most households and key destinations.",10,230,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00230
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Currently, there are over 170,000 bicycle parking spaces which are well-distributed across Singapore. More than 99% of public homes and 90% of private homes are within a five-minute walk from bicycle parking. There are also public bicycle parking areas close to more than 80% of key destinations, such as polyclinics, community centres, schools and town centres.",11,231,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00231
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"We will continue to work with HDB, Town Councils and other public agencies to provide more parking spaces where there is demand. Fifty thousand bicycle parking spaces will be added by 2020 at MRT stations, HDB estates and parks.",12,232,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00232
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"To address Ms Joan Pereira’s suggestion of sheltered bicycle parking, we will try to locate bicycle parking spaces within sheltered areas as far as possible. However, this may not always be possible in areas with site constraints.",13,233,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00233
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Ms Joan Pereira will also be pleased to note that in industrial estates and business parks, JTC has already designated more than 50 parking zones for shared bicycles. LTA will continue to work with JTC to implement more parking spaces in industrial areas.",14,234,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00234
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The data that the operators provide to LTA on the distribution of shared bicycles will also help us better plan parking provision, including providing more bicycle parking spaces at areas with high demand.",15,235,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00235
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I share Ms Thanaletchimi’s view that the provision of shared device parking in private developments would improve convenience for their tenants and visitors. LTA is working with the operators to have them reach out to condominium managements, foreign worker dormitory operators and commercial buildings to allow for the parking of shared devices within these developments. However, the decision to allow shared devices to be parked within their premises ultimately rests with the private developer.",16,236,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00236
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"QR codes will be installed at all public parking spaces at MRT stations, bus stops, parks and HDB estates. I would like to assure Ms Joan Pereira that these parking spaces will continue to be open to all privately-owned and shared bicycles. Private users can continue to park their bicycles at these spaces as they currently do today, and operators do not have to rent these parking spaces. Allowing shared bicycles to be parked at public parking places benefits members of the public who use these services.",17,237,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00237
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Ms Joan Pereira also asked about how QR code-enabled geo-fencing would work and whether its potential downsides can be mitigated. QR codes complement the accuracy of GPS-based geo-fencing. Safeguards will be put in place to reasonably ensure that the scanning of static QR code geo-fencing cannot be “gamed”. Each parking location will have a unique QR code and users will only be allowed to end their trip if the scanned QR code matches the GPS location of the parking location. For example, if users take a photo of a QR code and use it to park anywhere outside of the specified parking location, they will not be able to end their trip because the QR code does not match with the GPS location of the shared bicycle. Where a QR code has been vandalised, users will still be allowed to end their trip if they take a photograph of their bicycle parked within the bicycle parking area and submit it within the operator’s application. LTA will also act promptly to replace QR codes which have been damaged.",18,238,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00238
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"At the same time, LTA will continue to study other ways of geo-fencing to strengthen our capabilities to pinpoint the location of shared bicycles.",19,239,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00239
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Third, Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Dr Intan spoke about the measures which will be put in place to engender greater user responsibility.",20,240,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00240
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to clarify with Dr Intan that under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with existing bicycle-sharing operators, LTA has worked with the operators to implement GPS-enabled geo-fencing and geo-tag bicycle parking spaces in their mobile applications. With this function, users can plan ahead for where to park before they start their journey. Despite this, there are still irresponsible users who choose to park indiscriminately.",21,241,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00241
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Hence, it is necessary to take firmer steps to deter irresponsible user behaviour. We will do so through the collective ban. Users will also not be allowed to end their trips with the operators until the bicycles are parked within designated parking areas. In other words, irresponsible users who park indiscriminately will continue to be charged until they park properly.",22,242,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00242
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested that the Government hold users accountable for improper parking, instead of relying on operators to do so. Under the Street Works Act, LTA can fine users who are identified as parking improperly. However, it is often difficult to catch users red-handed. As operators can track the whereabouts of their bicycles, they are better-placed to detect and prevent indiscriminate parking from occurring in the first place. Nevertheless, LTA will continue to see how we can better enforce against improper parking under the Street Works Act, including using information from the operators to identify hotspots for enforcement.",23,243,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00243
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh also suggested differentiating the fine amounts for individuals based on age and income. It is not possible to do so as the law has to be fair to all individuals who have committed the same offence. Ms Joan Pereira suggested imposing a fine on users who are caught using someone else’s identity to rent a vehicle when they have been banned, while Dr Intan suggested compulsory community work for repeat offenders. We will study these suggestions.",24,244,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00244
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Ms Thanaletchimi asked if LTA could consider waiving the financial penalties for operators who have done their due diligence to discourage users from parking indiscriminately. I would like to clarify that operators will not be penalised if their users park indiscriminately. Users will be penalised for parking indiscriminately through the collective ban. Through geo-fencing, if users do not return their vehicle to a proper parking area, they will not be able to end their trip and will continue to be charged by the operators. However, LTA will take regulatory action against the operators if they do not remove the indiscriminately parked vehicles in a timely manner, and if they do not comply with other licence conditions such as implementing the collective ban.",25,245,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00245
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"To address Dr Intan's query on enforcement resources, we will use data and technology to enforce more efficiently.

2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about recovering from the operators the costs of the licensing regime, including the cost of providing yellow boxes and QR codes. We have invested in providing bicycle parking spaces to support active mobility and our car-lite vision. Hence, we do not intend to charge operators for rental of surface-level bicycle parking spaces and will continue to allow residents who use both private and shared devices, to use these spaces. Under the licensing regime, LTA can require the operators to provide additional parking spaces if needed. As far as possible, we intend to recover the costs of the licensing regime through licence fees.",27,247,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00247
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Ms Thanaletchimi cautioned that the licensing regime should not result in high barriers to entry and innovation. We do not intend for the licensing regime to be unduly onerous for operators. However, the licensing requirements are costs which should be internalised by the operators in the course of their business as they reflect the social disamenities caused and efforts needed to address them.",28,248,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00248
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"To reduce barriers to entry for new operators and encourage innovation, we are considering implementing a “regulatory sandbox” for new operators with no track record. We recognise that new operators could benefit from a trial phase as they scale up their operations and learn how to manage their fleet responsibly. They would be granted a much smaller fleet and subjected to a subset of the full licence requirements. LTA will monitor their performance closely before determining whether to grant them a full licence.",29,249,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00249
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"We agree with Mr Henry Kwek that is it important that our regulations evolve to keep up with public behaviour, as well as new technology and business models. The proposed licensing regime was developed based on feedback on indiscriminate parking from members of the public, LTA’s engagement with stakeholders and interest groups, and the passionate debates we have had here in Parliament. We will continue to track the situation, and engage the public and operators to review the effectiveness of these regulations. Where necessary, we can also update the licensing conditions to better address indiscriminate bicycle parking.",30,250,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00250
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Some Members have also raised other issues which lie outside the scope of this Bill. I would like to reiterate that the proposed licensing regime under the Parking Places Act aims to address indiscriminate parking. It is not intended to address issues unrelated to parking, such as reckless riding behaviour and cycling paths improvements which was raised by Dr Teo Ho Pin, and maintenance standards and liability issues in the event of accidents, which was raised by Mr Faisal Manap. However, I understand these are useful and pertinent suggestions. The Active Mobility Advisory Panel will be reviewing the active mobility rules to address reckless riding. Maintenance standards and liability issues are covered under the MOU with the operators and all bicycle-sharing operators under the MOU have purchased insurance for riders and third parties.",31,251,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00251
2018-03-20-T-010,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"With regard to Dr Intan’s query, the licensing regime is for dockless vehicle-sharing operators, and will not cover privately owned vehicles and devices.

Developments within 400 m of an MRT station, for example, are considered to be well-connected via public transport. For areas which are more than 400 m away from an MRT station, there is already an extensive feeder bus network to provide first-and-last mile connectivity.",34,254,2018-03-20-T-010-S-00254

Some key similarities are using the device for paying for carbon units issued by the Government called ""carbon credits"" in our legislation rather than direct taxation on fuel sources; imposing this only on firms and exacting households and only taxing facilities with 25,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions. However, Australia had set its carbon price at A$23 at their plan's inception.",17,377,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00377

It is of course necessary to balance the goal of disincentivising carbon emissions with the goal of ensuring that our economy has time and resources to adapt to the tax while remaining competitive. Therefore, it is prudent to set the price at a low level initially.",18,378,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00378

I have called for this in the House previously. Such a goal, even if expressed as arranged, has the effect of focusing minds both in Government and in the private sector, and may nudge decisions to trial tests and, ultimately, adopt cleaner technologies knowing the tougher measures are inevitable. Note that this is not the same as arguing for subsidising renewable technologies using devices like feed-in tariffs.",21,381,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00381

With a new stream of funds available, there are hopes that greater support can be given to promote the use of clean energy.",11,434,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00434
2018-03-20-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I would like to ask the Ministry if it intends to develop new schemes with the new stream of funds, to further assist industries in the transition towards a low carbon future, and specifically, if it would consider using these funds to directly subsidise the production, research and development of clean energy in Singapore. Sir, notwithstanding the above clarifications, I stand in support of this Bill.",12,435,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00435
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Mr Speaker, I am a board member of the Singapore Environment Council. I must confess that prior to being on the council, my awareness of environmental issues was low. I still have much to learn but at least now I am more conscious about the effect my actions have on the environment and the need to take steps to reduce my carbon footprint. The consciousness to protect our environment is not just a lofty ideal but an essential value, which should be present in all of us. This value should be nurtured and we need to continue to educate people, young and old, about the role each of us plays in protecting the environment.",1,436,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00436
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The introduction of this Bill is an opportunity to further inform and edify people about the environment. This Bill is premised on the desire and need to create a sustainable future for our children. In addressing the common feedback and concerns about the Bill, we should continue to remind the public and various stakeholders of this pertinent vision. At the same time, there also needs to be support to the people, businesses and stakeholders in adjusting to the changes put in place and the knock-on effect of the same.",2,437,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00437
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"There are clearly challenges in implementing such a bold and new initiative to regulate conduct and practices which have been in place for a long time. It is understandable and commendable, therefore, that the Government has chosen a soft start and an incremental approach by imposing a lower tax per tonne of emission at the beginning and increasing the same over time. The carbon credit system has also been lauded for allowing for some flexibility. There were some queries as to whether there is a plan to move towards a carbon trading system in the future where companies with low emissions could sell off their credits to larger emitters. It does allow for flexibility but we do need to think about the overall impact to the effort in reducing emissions.",3,438,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00438
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),I also note that the Minister had made reference to the International Credit System and that Singapore will carefully study the feasibility of linking our carbon tax framework to other carbon pricing jurisdictions with high environmental integrity.,4,439,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00439
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The implementation of this Act, if it comes to pass, will clearly change the way businesses are run. There will be administrative work to be done, mechanisms which need to be put in place to track emissions as well as auditing to be carried out to ensure compliance. Given that this is a completely new regime that the businesses are facing, would the Government be providing support, perhaps in the form of business consultancy to help the affected entities manage the change?",5,440,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00440
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Following from this, perhaps the expected revenue from the carbon tax could be channelled towards supporting or incentivising companies to stay through the course in their efforts to reduce emissions. While we show the stick, it is also useful to dangle the carrot to encourage positive development in this sector. There is a lot of potential to harness green innovation but some further funding may need to be allocated to this cause.",6,441,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00441
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The Government is expected to collect carbon tax revenue of about S$1 billion over the next five years. I note that the Minister for Finance had indicated that the Government is prepared to spend more than the revenue generated from the carbon tax within the same period to support worthwhile projects which deliver the necessary abatement in emissions, and the Minister had earlier repeated this in his speech. This is heartening. In this regard, I would like to know from the Minister if there will be any new or enhanced grants in place to encourage green innovation.",7,442,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00442
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Aside from the concerns and feedback from the businesses, we have also heard a lot of comments from the public about their fear on how the carbon tax will impact the cost of living. There has already been a buzz about increases in prices of food and drinks at coffee shops. Some businesses have attributed the increases in cost, to the cost of water as well as to the prospective increase in GST and the carbon tax, even when they have yet to be imposed. I therefore wonder if there is any way for the Government to monitor the knock-on effect of the implementation of the carbon tax to consumers and put in place some regulation to avoid unfair profiteering. It is necessary to note that in our effort to protect the environment, that we do not inadvertently hurt the very people whom we are protecting the environment for.",8,443,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00443

2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] We often talk about the importance of protecting the environment; preserving it for future generations. However, this is not about just paying lip-service but rather something that we should embody. It is an essential value which should be present in all of us and we must take actions in our daily lives to execute this vision.",10,445,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00445
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The Bill before us today is an important measure that can encourage people to be more concerned about the impact of our lives on the environment. Our daily activities usually generate carbon that will pollute the air and destroy the environment. Most of the carbon in the air is emitted by certain industries. Under this new legislation, certain companies will be taxed based on their carbon emissions. The money that needs to be set aside for this carbon tax will nudge these companies into paying more attention to carbon emissions and find new ways to be more productive and environmentally-friendly.",11,446,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00446
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),Many have voiced concern that the cost of living will rise due to this carbon tax. I think perhaps the Government can try to monitor this and do something so that companies and businesses do not take the opportunity to engage in unfair profiteering.,12,447,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00447
2018-03-20-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"However, I think that people should also be aware and change their way of life gradually and reduce our carbon footprint.

2018-03-20-T-011,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Imposing carbon tax on major GHG emitters is a wise move by the Government.

However, the increase is estimated to be bearable for the general households. The Government has estimated that for a 1-room flat, electricity costs will increase by only 30 cents per month and for an EC apartment, $1.10.

On average, the additional U-Save rebates will cover the expected increase in electricity and gas expenses arising from the carbon tax. This will help HDB households to adjust to the carbon tax, as they reduce their utilities consumption over time. We will assess the impact of the carbon tax at a later stage and review the need to extend these rebates.",27,491,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00491

2018-03-20-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This year, we are moving the Carbon Pricing Bill to provide the added motivation – the motor fuel if you like – to spur companies to actively pursue emissions reduction. The Government has been providing support to continue to improve EE and many have forged ahead. Let me just share two stories.",32,496,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00496
2018-03-20-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Globalfoundries, a semiconductor company, has been innovating and investing in new technologies to improve EE and reduce emissions. For example, it redesigned the combustion chamber in its thermal abatement units and reduced its Liquefied Petroleum Gas consumption by 31%. This resulted in annual cost savings of about S$260,000 and an annual carbon abatement of about 640 tonnes.",33,497,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00497
2018-03-20-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"With further support from the Government, Globalfoundries is working to replace a process chamber cleaning gas that has high global warming potential, with one that has no global warming potential. This will reduce their emissions significantly by more than 400,000 tonnes, when completed in 2019.",34,498,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00498
2018-03-20-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Another role model is Chevron Oronite Pte Ltd which has consistently achieved EE improvement rates above the industry average. To improve EE, it installed a boiler system to recover waste heat from its thermal-oxidiser for steam generation. It also installed a mechanical vapour recompression system to lower the energy use of its new manufacturing unit. These projects have resulted in energy savings of S$1.8 million and carbon abatement of 4,800 tonnes each year.",35,499,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00499

More support will go to projects that achieve greater emissions abatement, beyond basic enhancements.",38,502,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00502
2018-03-20-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Perera has asked whether part of the revenue from the carbon tax will be used to provide loans to companies. The EDB has been piloting an EE Financing Programme whereby companies that are not able to afford the upfront costs of EE projects can apply for loans through a third-party financier.,39,503,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00503
2018-03-20-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The potential benefits of such a programme are that industrial facilities will not have to pay for the upfront costs of these projects, but can still enjoy part of the energy savings. Part of the risk is transferred to the third-party financier.",40,504,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00504
2018-03-20-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Beyond financial support, the Government will also grow the wider industrial EE ecosystem in Singapore to develop greater expertise in the energy services sector. Initiatives include engaging Institutes of Higher Learning to train and up-skill energy services professionals, and working with professional bodies, such as the Institution of Engineers Singapore to develop Chartered Engineer certification for EE professionals.",41,505,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00505

2018-03-20-T-011,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Ms Thanaletchimi asked if the Government can provide incentives for companies to adopt renewable energy sources. The Government’s policy is to ensure that energy, regardless of source of generation, is correctly priced to fully reflect the cost of generation, and let the market work out the equilibrium. Instead of providing subsidies, what we have done is to invest in the R&D of renewable, clean energy technologies.",43,507,2018-03-20-T-011-S-00507

As one would expect in a multilateral framework, negotiations are complex. Publicised positions may be transitional and do not reflect the landing points.

In more egregious and serious cases of misconduct, the Court of 3 Judges can order that a lawyer be suspended or struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors.",10,536,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00536
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"This Bill introduces more nuanced and calibrated options to the range of disciplinary measures.

Such remedial measures can be imposed in addition to, or in lieu of, the current options which are available to the Law Society Council. The amendments will enable the Council to prescribe remedial measures such as those which involve training, counselling and other means of rehabilitation. This does not mean that serious cases of misconduct will be dealt with lightly. Rather, it strengthens our disciplinary framework for lawyers with a broader range of disciplinary options that can be imposed together with other existing measures, or in lieu of, where appropriate.",12,538,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00538

In these cases, the lawyers and law practices concerned would be unable to close the client account, and must hold the unclaimed client money indefinitely, incurring costs in administering the client accounts. Lawyers who want to retire and dissolve their law practices, but who are holding onto unclaimed client moneys, are in a difficult position.

A new Unclaimed Money Fund, or “UM Fund”, will be maintained and administered by the Law Society. Solicitors and Singapore law practices will be able to transfer unclaimed client money into the UM Fund, provided that they satisfy certain requirements and the Law Society approves the transfer. These requirements will be prescribed by the Law Society Council with the Minister's approval, and will include what reasonable efforts the solicitor or Singapore law practice should have made to return the money, before the Society will approve a transfer. Such ""reasonable efforts"" will take various circumstances into account, for example, more robust steps may be required in the case of larger amounts, and account may be taken of practical issues which may arise in cases of very old client accounts. Provision is made for the framework to be extended, where appropriate, to foreign lawyers and foreign law practices or entities regulated under the Act.",16,542,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00542

The Law Society's discretion will be exercised on a case by case basis. In exercising its discretion, the Law Society will consider factors such as the reasons why the claimant did not approach the Law Society before the time bar, for example, whether they were prevented by matters such as fraud or disability; and whether there will be undue hardship if no ex gratia payment is made.",20,546,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00546

2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"First  Clauses 3 and 20 of the Bill amend the Act to give the Law Society Council the power to require prescribed classes of solicitors who practise or intend to practise in a prescribed area of law, to make a declaration when applying for a practising certificate. This amendment puts into effect the recommendation of the Study Committee on Professional Standards and Etiquette in Court under the auspices of the Singapore Academy of Law’s Professional Affairs Committee.",32,558,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00558
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The intention is to prescribe that solicitors who practise in the area of litigation will need to complete a short online test on professional conduct rules administered by the Law Society and declare that they have done the test before applying for or renewing their practising certificates. The test is not intended to be an onerous requirement but will serve as a self-learning and self-assessment tool, to remind solicitors of their obligations as members of a noble profession. This will propagate good practices as well as reinforce and serve as a useful reminder of changes relevant to the practice area. Council also has the powers to exempt a solicitor or a class of solicitors from making a declaration, if the Council is satisfied that the solicitor or the class of solicitors is already equipped with the knowledge and skills required for practice in that area of the law.",33,559,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00559
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Second  Currently, the Law Society Council is only able to apply interest, dividends and other accretions of capital arising from the Compensation Fund which consists of contributions from solicitors, to purchase and maintain a library for its members’ use. Clause 19 of the Bill makes amendments to provide Council with greater flexibility to use such interest, dividends and other accretions of capital towards a wider range of worthwhile causes.",34,560,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00560
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Third  Clause 17 of the Bill allows penalty sums which are collected from solicitors who fail to vote at the annual election of Law Society Council members to be credited to the Law Society, instead of the Compensation Fund.",35,561,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00561
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Fourth  Clause 4 of the Bill extends an exception relating to the requirements for a practising certificate, which are currently applicable to solicitors employed by the Law Society, to those employed by wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Law Society.",36,562,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00562
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Fifth  Clause 30 of the Bill allows Singapore law practices which are structured as law corporations and limited liability law partnerships to form a group law practice. Currently, only Singapore law practices structured as sole proprietorships and partnerships may form a group law practice. This updates the group law practice scheme which was introduced prior to the introduction of law corporations and limited liability law partnerships.",37,563,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00563
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),Sixth  Clause 25 of the Bill clarifies that a senior judge of the Supreme Court of Singapore can be appointed to sit as the President of the Disciplinary Tribunal.,38,564,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00564
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"And last  Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill repeals section 36F of the current Act and makes consequential amendments as this category of registration of lawyers has been subsumed into other legislation categories under the regulatory regime and is no longer needed.",39,565,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00565
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In summary, all these amendments that I have mentioned will ensure that our framework for the legal industry continues to remain up-to-date and responsive to changes in the legal landscape. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.",40,566,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00566
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),Question proposed.,41,567,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00567
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, two of the three stated objectives in the long title of the Legal Profession Act are to constitute the Law Society and to amend and consolidate the law relating to the legal profession.",1,568,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00568
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The legal profession plays an important role − an integral role − in the administration of justice in our rule of law society. Through ways such as providing legal advice, representation and promoting legal literacy through education, lawyers play an important role in access to justice. This Bill furthers their efforts and the legal profession’s contribution to society.",2,569,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00569
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, this Bill facilitates the Law Society to perform functions and activities better. It provides for wholly-owned subsidiaries which would allow the Law Society to make use of separate legal entities to perform functions and activities.",3,570,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00570
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),One of these functions could be pro bono services as clause 4 also allows solicitors employed under the wholly-owned subsidiary to apply for a practising certificate. This is also supplemented through clause 19 that allows the wholly-owned subsidiary to use accretions to capital from the Compensation Fund.,4,571,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00571
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Through the new section 70J(3)(b), the new Unclaimed Money Fund would also complement that financial support for the Law Society’s pro bono services and the activities of a wholly-owned subsidiary. These amendments would support the on-going pro bono efforts by the Law Society.",5,572,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00572
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"At this point in time, I should declare that I am a legal practitioner at the Singapore Bar.",6,573,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00573
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One of the stated missions of the Law Society is to ensure access to justice for all, and one way this has been done is through pro bono services. Some of the excellent work is reflected in the Community Legal Clinic Scheme, the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme and the Ad Hoc Pro Bono Referral.",7,574,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00574
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Not restricted to individuals, the Law Society also works with VWOs and charities who are unable to afford legal consultation and representation due to limited resources. Law Awareness seeks to ""break 'legal jargon'"" into accessible ""easy-to-understand elements"" for the public through talks, exhibits, resource materials. Therefore, these welcome amendments enhance the Law Society’s contributions to our community.",8,575,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00575
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, Sir, the Bill furthers the drive to make Singapore a robust regional and global legal hub. Clause 30 introduces a new Division 5 that would regulate group practices in Singapore by Singapore and foreign law practices. This provides for another option that law practices may choose to organise themselves within, allowing for more flexibility in how practices may choose to position themselves in the legal industry.",9,576,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00576
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill also provides for law experts to appear before the Singapore International Commercial Court and relevant appeals in the Court of Appeal. The expertise from which the SICC can draw on in a proceeding is no longer limited to practising solicitors, persons admitted under section 15 ad hoc admissions or foreign lawyers registered under section 36P. But these legal experts serve a separate function. They come into the picture when the SICC orders that a question of foreign law be determined on the basis of submissions, instead of proof.",10,577,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00577
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thirdly, this Bill seeks to further regulate the Bar. On this theme, I have two clarifications for the Minister.",11,578,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00578
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, I would like to ask for an elaboration on clause 20, new section 75E, which provides for declaration of practice areas on practising certificates, unless exempted. May I ask the Minister what is the thought behind this and how would it work?",12,579,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00579
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"My second clarification for the Minister is on the introduction and expansion of remedial measures. While it may provide for an intermediate option in addressing situations, the Bill sets few parameters on what kind of remedial measures Council can make under the new section 97A. While Ministerial approval is necessary, it seems as though the power is constrained only by the purpose of the rule, that is, new section 97A paragraph (a) which says ""to address any issue concerning the professional practice, etiquette, conduct of discipline of a regulated legal practitioner"" and paragraph (b) ""any requirements that Council may specify for compliance with an order of the Council under section 88(1A) or 94(3A)"".",13,580,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00580
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The latter seems to include warning, reprimand, and financial penalty as remedial orders. My clarification for the good Minister is this  why are the safeguards in section 88(2) and section 88(3) not extended to the new subsections (1A) and (1B) even though they may carry similar consequences?",14,581,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00581
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In short, my position is that  any remedial actions must also be fair to the practitioners, and the process in deciding whether a remedial action should be administered should also be fair to the practitioner.",15,582,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00582
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Fourthly, Sir, through the setting up of the Unpaid Money Fund, clients’ interests continue to be safeguarded, while providing a practical solution for some solicitors’ conundrum. These changes would allow lawyers who wish to retire to do so, by relieving lawyers of the burden and expense of maintaining the client account. This is especially pertinent as the solution mechanism of ""intervention money"" being paid into the Compensation Fund does not reflect our current legal industry landscape where law firms may not always continue across generations.",16,583,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00583
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Hence, the Unpaid Money Fund would allow solicitors to avoid this conundrum in the future. Furthermore, these unclaimed monies can be used for a public good. The new section 70J(3)(b) in clause 18 provides that it can be used for ""pro bono services provided by the Law Society or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Society"".",17,584,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00584
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, even as this solution provides a win-win situation for the community and the relevant solicitor, it will also provide sufficient safeguards to ensure client’s interests are not compromised. The purpose under which a solicitor may apply to transfer money into the Unclaimed Money Fund will be restricted under section 70J(2) and (3). Claims against the Fund are also allowed up to six years after the transfer, after which the Society still retains the discretion to pay part or whole of the amount being claimed. In this manner, the Unclaimed Money Fund provides a practical win-win solution for all.",18,585,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00585
2018-03-20-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, the Legal Profession has an important role in ensuring that Singapore remains a country run on the rule of Law. This Bill augments that aim and, therefore, I support it.",19,586,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00586
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I declare my interest as a practising lawyer.",1,587,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00587
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill introduces various amendments to the Legal Profession Act. The introduction of a further disciplinary option that can be imposed against an errant legal practitioner and the creation of the Unclaimed Money Funds are noteworthy innovations that should be welcomed by Members of this House.,2,588,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00588
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I wish to make three short points on the proposed amendments.,3,589,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00589
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"First, clause 17 of the Bill proposes to amend section 50 of the Act to allow for the penalty paid by any lawyer for failing to vote in council elections to be paid to the Law Society and not the Compensation Fund. The Compensation Fund is a fund administered by the Council of the Law Society to serve a public purpose in that grants may be paid out of the Fund to mitigate loss suffered by any person due to dishonesty of a lawyer or a member of his staff.",4,590,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00590
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"A similar amendment was made in 2001 for penalties paid as a result of disciplinary proceedings to be paid to the Society, instead of the Consolidated Fund, so that the Law Society could use the monies for worthy causes, such as providing pro bono services or creating legal awareness.",5,591,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00591
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In these circumstances, what is the purpose behind the change, and will the monies directed to the Society be also used for similar worthy causes to serve public interest? What would be the consequent effect on the Compensation Fund, in terms of its funding level, if the monies were to be channelled to the Society? Would the Fund have sufficient funds to meet claims from members of public? Also, given that the Law Society has just moved to e-voting recently, what is the expected amount of revenue generated for use by the Society from penalties for failing to vote?",6,592,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00592
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Second, the Bill introduces the establishment of a new Unclaimed Money Fund to allow for the transfer of unclaimed client or intervention monies to be paid into the Fund and to vest in the Law Society absolutely. At the same time, it does not appear that the proposed amendments require the Law Society to take reasonable efforts to return the monies to the owners.",7,593,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00593
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In this regard, I note that the hon Senior Minister of State stated that the Law Society requires solicitors to expend reasonable efforts before they are being allowed to transfer those monies to the Law Society. But vis-à-vis the Law Society itself is not clear what steps the Law Society would have to undertake and who checks on the Society in relation to the steps the Law Society would have to undertake to locate these claimants or potential claimants.",8,594,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00594
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In the context of Government agencies, MOF had made a statement that all Government agencies, including Statutory Boards, are required to make all reasonable efforts to return unclaimed monies to the rightful owners promptly. This being the case, what can be done to ensure that the Law Society expends sufficient efforts to contact the rightful owners of these monies before it decides to use these monies for pro bono services?",9,595,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00595
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Finally, the proposed amendments to the Act expands the range of measures that may be imposed by the Inquiry Committee, the Council and the Disciplinary Tribunal to include remedial measures to be taken by the legal practitioner.",10,596,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00596
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Given the breadth of professional conduct rules legal practitioners are bound by, could the hon Senior Minister of State please clarify what kind of remedial measures are contemplated, and in what situations would remedial measures be imposed? I believe the hon Member Mr Christopher de Souza made a similar request.",11,597,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00597
2018-03-20-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In this regard, I wonder if there is any reason for the proposed amendments not to provide for the Court of Three Judges, which sits at the apex of the disciplinary process to also impose remedial measures. Would the hon Senior Minister of State accept that the absence of the empowering provision does not curtail the powers of the Court of Three Judges to impose requirements on legal practitioners, such as undertakings to the court which may mirror obligations imposed through the remedial measures? Notwithstanding the clarifications I raised, I support the Bill.",12,598,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00598
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I stand in support of this Bill. Lawyers I spoke to welcome, in particular, three changes that have been proposed.",1,599,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00599
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The first relates to the appointment of law experts in cases before the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC), a move, no doubt, put in place to improve the quality of arguments raised in the SICC on foreign law issues.",2,600,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00600
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The second relates to the establishment of an Unclaimed Money Fund to be administered by the Law Society of Singapore. The amendment will result in certain monies that are unclaimed being put to use in amongst other things, pro bono services.",3,601,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00601
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Finally, there is the introduction of the imposition of remedial measures upon a regulated legal practitioner by the Council of the Law Society of Singapore or the Disciplinary Tribunal.",4,602,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00602
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Previously, the options were limited to the issuance of a warning, a reprimand or the imposition of a fine. These were aimed at censuring and punishing the errant regulated legal practitioner and may not have addressed root causes for the impeached conduct.",5,603,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00603
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"While the precise type of remedial measures that may be imposed will be set out in further subsidiary legislation, it is heartening to see that there is now another option available, which is not entirely punitive in nature.",6,604,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00604
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, it is with this last change that I now seek clarifications. The Bill proposes to allow an Inquiry Committee to recommend to the Council of the Law Society of Singapore that a penalty, warning, reprimand, and/or requirement of compliance with remedial measures be imposed on a practitioner, without any formal investigation by a Disciplinary Tribunal. The Council of the Law Society can then make such a determination under the new section 87 of the Act.",7,605,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00605
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Significantly, the amendment to section 88(1) proposes to make the imposition of a penalty, warning and/or reprimand mandatory by changing the wording to ""must give"" from the original ""may give"". The question is, why are we changing from a ""may"" to a ""must""?",8,606,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00606
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Lawyers I have spoken to are concerned about the mandatory imposition because this seems to render the practitioner's opportunity to be heard on the matter under section 88(3) futile.,9,607,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00607
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In the interest of fairness and in line with the right to be heard, the practitioner really ought to be able to make her or his case on the matter and section 88(3) should remain. Can the Senior Minister of State clarify how section 88(3) is consistent with the mandatory imposition under section 88(1)?",10,608,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00608
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Further, I note that the imposition of the remedial measures by Council is sought to be introduced by way of a new section 88(1A), but section 88(3) of the Act remains unchanged. This seems to suggest that a practitioner will not be heard before remedial measures are imposed upon him or her by the Council.",11,609,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00609
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Senior Minister of State clarify whether a practitioner also has the right to be heard before Council imposes remedial measures on him in the same spirit of fairness?,12,610,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00610
2018-03-20-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, while we welcome the introduction of measures that focus on remediation rather than punishment, I hope the Senior Minister of State can clarify whether the right of the practitioner to be heard will be preserved. Sir, notwithstanding the above clarifications, I stand in support of this Bill.",13,611,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00611
2018-03-20-T-012,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I declare that I am a lawyer in private practice.",1,612,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00612
2018-03-20-T-012,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The Legal Profession Act and the various subsidiary legislation including, the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules and the Legal Profession (Solicitor's Account) Rules, govern the profession and help ensure that the integrity of the profession is preserved. I am heartened therefore by the further enhancements that I believe will ensure that the high standards expected of the profession, will be maintained.",2,613,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00613
2018-03-20-T-012,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),I wish to record my observations on several proposed amendments in this Bill.,3,614,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00614
2018-03-20-T-012,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Firstly, I note clauses 22, 23, 24 and 26 to 29 of the Bill relate to amendments to expand the range of measures that may be imposed in disciplinary proceedings to include remedial measures. This is a laudable move in that it allows for a suite of more nuanced, meaningful and fair sanctions. The profession calls for high standards of conduct and I believe we should continue to assert this. However, it is important to have regulation that seeks to encourage good behaviour and rehabilitate undesirable conduct; instead of being merely punitive. I therefore hope that in its application, the directions or orders for remedial measures will help to encourage better conduct amongst the lawyers who had faced the disciplinary proceedings.",4,615,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00615
2018-03-20-T-012,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Secondly, I note the introduction of the new Part VB relating to the Unclaimed Money Fund. This is definitely a welcomed move. For far too long, lawyers have had difficulties in dealing with monies put in as deposit by clients or deposited in favour of the clients, who subsequently cannot be reached. Lawyers are required to keep monies belonging to clients in the client's account, until there is a proper invoice or proper instructions are given for monies to be paid out. When the clients cannot be contacted, the lawyer then has difficulties. There have been situations where the lawyer cannot close the firm because of this outstanding issue. Typically, the lawyer would ask another lawyer to take over the account but this can be a hassle. The issue is now resolved with the introduction of the Unclaimed Money Fund.",5,616,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00616
2018-03-20-T-012,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I appreciate the effort in calibrating the provisions of this new section to be fair to the lawyer, the Law Society as well as the client, especially if he or she does show up or eventually if he or she does show up and claim the monies. I note that the effect of the proposed sections 70K(3) and 70K(4) is that the lawyer may potentially face a claim from a client that resurfaces within six years from the time the unclaimed money is transferred to the Law Society. I appreciate that the proposed clause 70L allows for a channel for the client or claimant to apply to the Law Society for payment of the whole or part of the unclaimed money and upon payment, the Law Society and lawyer are discharged from liability to the claimant for the amount paid. In these circumstances, may I seek clarification on the intent of section 70K(4) as there would be a wait of six years before the lawyer is discharged and free from any liability?",6,617,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00617
2018-03-20-T-012,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),I am heartened that there is provision in the proposed section 70L(5) to deal with situations where claims come in after the expiry of the six-year period. I believe this reflects reasonableness and compassion; values which should be upheld by the fraternity.,7,618,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00618
2018-03-20-T-012,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The final point I wish to raise is on the usage of the monies in the Unclaimed Money Fund. I note that the monies forming part of the Fund may be used to fund amongst other things, pro bono services provided by the Law Society. The provision of pro bono services, in my view, is a key component within the community as it helps to augment the existing Legal Aid scheme that is available. I hope that with the access to this new Fund, there would be more resources and additional effort to bridge any gaps in the provision of legal services, especially to those who may not meet the criteria to obtain Legal Aid.",8,619,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00619
2018-03-20-T-012,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"As mentioned above, I believe that the proposed amendments will ensure that the high standards expected of this profession will be maintained. I stand in support of this Bill.",9,620,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00620

2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,Mr Murali and Mr de Souza inquired about the circumstances under which remedial measures may be imposed on a lawyer and what kind of remedial measures can be imposed.,2,623,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00623
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The introduction of remedial measures under the disciplinary framework for lawyers allows the Law Society Council to have a wide range of measures to deal with less serious disciplinary matters. These remedial measures can be imposed in addition to or in lieu of the current options which are available. Such remedial measures may involve training, counselling and other means of rehabilitation. These provide for a more nuanced, tailored and effective means to address the root causes of certain types of misconduct as well as reduce recidivism. Such remedial measures will be set out in subsidiary legislation.",3,624,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00624
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,Mr Murali also asked why the proposed amendments do not provide for the Court of 3 Judges to impose remedial measures unlike the Law Society Council or the Disciplinary Tribunal.,4,625,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00625
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The answer is that the system design is such that by the time it comes before the Court of 3 Judges, it means the case has gone well beyond remedial measures.",5,626,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00626
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The Court of 3 Judges is disciplinary in nature, not remedial. By the time a complaint involving misconduct by a lawyer comes before the Court of Three Judges, three stages in the disciplinary review process would have been completed",6,627,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00627
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First, a Review Committee would have decided that the complaint is of such substance that it must be referred to an Inquiry Committee.",7,628,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00628
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Second, the Inquiry Committee would already have found that the case of misconduct has been made out against the lawyer, and it would have taken the view that the complaint must be referred to a Disciplinary Tribunal.",8,629,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00629
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Third, the Disciplinary Tribunal would have determined that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists such that the matter has to be referred to the Court of 3 Judges.",9,630,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00630
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"As you see, it is a vigorous process and one in which less serious infractions capable of remediation are weeded out early and dealt with. Each step of the process deals with increasing levels of severity of lapses or infractions. The complaints which come before the Court of 3 Judges are therefore the ones that involve egregious cases of misconduct for which the remedial actions are not sufficient or appropriate.",10,631,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00631
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But that said, as pointed by Mr Murali, that does not foreclose the Court of 3 Judges from imposing requirements on legal practitioners such as undertakings to the court which may mirror obligations imposed through remedial measures.",11,632,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00632

2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,This brings me to Mr Louis Ng and Mr de Souza's point on the correlation between the amendments to section 88(1) read with section 88(3) and the opportunity to be heard under the latter provision.,13,634,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00634
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"As mentioned, the disciplinary process for lawyers is multi-tiered. A lawyer who is the subject of a complaint may have reasonable opportunity to be heard by the Inquiry Committee. After Council has considered the report of the Inquiry Committee, it can determine that no formal investigation is required and no penalty will be imposed on the lawyer. Council can also determine that there should be a formal investigation by the Disciplinary Tribunal.",14,635,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00635
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"What section 88 deals with is the intermediate situation where it has been determined by the Council that some wrongdoing has occurred but no formal investigation is needed. So, it does not need to be referred to the Disciplinary Tribunal.",15,636,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00636

2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In line with the nature of the remedial measures which are not punitive and consistent with the objective of rehabilitating the lawyer, these are not entered against the name of the lawyer on the roll. In the event Council wishes to impose the former (meaning the reprimand or the penalty), the lawyer is always offered an opportunity to be heard. If having heard his explanations, Council remains of the view that those sanctions continue to be appropriate, those sanctions will be applied. This is how it is currently done and therefore, there is no substantive change to the operations of section 88(1).",19,640,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00640
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Where the lawyer has been heard by Council and Council agrees that a warning, reprimand or penalty is not appropriate, Council may, pursuant to the new section 88(1A), impose a remedial measure that does not go onto the lawyer's disciplinary records. And in that situation, he would already have been heard in the first instance. So, this addresses both Mr Louis Ng's points as well.",20,641,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00641
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,Mr Murali asked whether there are sufficient monies in the Compensation Fund.,21,642,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00642
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The Compensation Fund was first established in 1962 and it is maintained and administered by the Law Society.

For the financial year ending 31 March 2017, the balance in the Compensation Fund amounted to S$13 million. Over the past six years, about S$500,000 was paid out from the Compensation Fund.

2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First, the Law Society's position is that the failure to vote at Council elections has no nexus with professional misconduct, but rather pertains to the administration of the Law Society or its governance. As such, penalty sums should be credited to the Law Society instead of the Compensation Found. This will allow the Law Society to use the monies in a manner that advances the public interest.",26,647,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00647
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Second, as the Member has highlighted, allowing the penalty sum to be credited to the Law Society also aligns with the current crediting of penalties to the Law Society under section 95 of the Act, where the Council has ordered a lawyer to pay a penalty.",27,648,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00648

Its other role is to make discretionary decisions on payments out to clients after expiration of the limitation period.",37,658,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00658
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Broadly summarising, the new section 70K provides that a solicitor or Singapore law practice may apply to pay into the Unclaimed Money Fund, money which should be paid to the client but which they are unable to do so, despite making such reasonable efforts as the Law Society may require. So, in other words, the lawyer or the law firm has to make all reasonable efforts first, before they can pay money over to the Fund. As to what the “reasonable efforts” are  the subsidiary legislation will prescribe what the required “reasonable efforts” are, taking into account relevant circumstances previously mentioned. In turn, The Law Society may not approve a transfer unless it is satisfied that the prescribed “reasonable efforts” requirements have been satisfied.",38,659,2018-03-20-T-012-S-00659
2018-03-20-T-012,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The burden of taking steps to return the money is rightly placed on the lawyers because they are the ones with the primary duty to return the money to the client, and they are the ones who have the files and records, and will therefore be in a better position to contact the clients.
