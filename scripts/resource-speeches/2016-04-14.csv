First, building on the Government's SGfuture engagement efforts, Mendaki will reach out to the community through a series of Future Ready Conversations and NextStop engagements. The Conversations will help Mendaki to better understand the hopes and aspirations of our community, and how it can provide more targeted and effective support. ""NextStop"" is more targeted.

This dynamic 21-year old Ngee Ann Polytechnic graduate was the top student in his specialisation. As a child, his parents had exposed Danish to IT, and it has been his passion ever since. In Primary school, Danish built websites and, in Secondary school, he worked on an app to help students learn better. It was in Polytechnic where his passion and his strength converged. There, Danish's participation in Microsoft's YouthSpark programme prompted him to develop an app called ""Taxi Split"". Based on his experience with sharing taxi fares with his friends who alight at different destinations, this app helped to calculate the exact taxi fare using game theory. He later shared his knowledge on creating computational thinking programmes with students and social enterprises, as part of his work as a YouthSpark coordinator for Microsoft Asia Pacific.",16,28,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00028

Our pioneers such as the late President Yusof Ishak, Allahyarham Ustaz Ahmad Sonhadji Mohamed, Allahyarham Pak Ridzwan Dzafir and Allahyarham Ustaz Ibrahim Kassim exemplified these principles and worked hard to strengthen the social fabric of a multi-cultural and multi-religious Singapore. Our pioneers have showed us how we can remain rooted to our traditions, values and principles, and participate actively in our nation building efforts.

At its peak, Team Nila had 23,000 members. These volunteers were deployed in a wide spectrum of roles from ushers, anti-doping officers to safety officers. They are not athletes and do not compete in the Games but Team Nila allowed them to participate fully in the Games. It was a movement and an inclusive community. Volunteers with disabilities worked alongside those without; volunteers in their teens alongside those in their 70s; children alongside their parents; expats alongside locals.

You are ready for the fears that life might throw at you. Whether it is the inverse tower or kayak expedition, our youths will be presented with obstacles, challenges and unfamiliar situations. They will learn to work with one another. They will venture out of their comfort zone. They will have a chance to experiment, to fail, and to learn from that failure.

2016-04-14-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mdm Chair, I would like now to speak about how we are reaching out to the community through the arts and heritage. Dr Teo Ho Pin spoke about promoting community arts. Our community arts programmes and initiatives have been specially designed to make the arts more accessible to all Singaporeans.",26,281,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00281

So, we welcome Dr Teo to offer Bukit Panjang Art Street to play host to future editions of Arts in our Neighbourhood.",27,282,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00282
2016-04-14-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"We will also continue to develop more Arts and Culture Community Nodes to dedicate more community spaces for the arts. Through the PAssionArts programme and the annual PAssionArts Festival, we have been boosting exposure, interest and participation in community arts by residents and grassroots enthusiasts. This adds buzz and build attachment to community spaces.",28,283,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00283
2016-04-14-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"A great example of this is the beautifully painted Kolam Ayer Bridge. Named ""Rainbow"", this work of art was designed by local Visual Artist Shah Rizzal and painted by more than 200 residents of Kolam Ayer. Under the PAssionArts Hotspots programme, residents can also showcase their other artworks right in the heart of the neighbourhood, in spaces like hawker centres, parks and playgrounds. By partnering citizens to co-create artworks, we can involve residents who are new to art, enliven conventional community spaces and bring these enriching experiences closer to home.",29,284,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00284
2016-04-14-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"In fact, last year's PAssionArts partnered with Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA) to bring the arts experience into the homes of residents in the heartlands. Artist-mentors were engaged to work with 25 homeowners to transform their living rooms into theatres. So, even ordinary Singaporeans had the opportunity to work with artist-mentors to co-create art works for a prominent festival like SIFA.",30,285,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00285
2016-04-14-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"As Mr Kok Heng Leun highlighted, the Arts and Culture Strategic Review has seen significant investment to increase the accessibility of community arts and we agree that efforts to promote community arts should go beyond one-off projects to bring opportunities to experience and participate in art-making to the community. It should look at how the arts can be made a more integral part of our lives. That is why initiatives like PAssionArts and the Arts in your Neighbourhood series are on-going efforts. We will continue to broaden access and the reach of the arts, and enhance the quality and diversity of programmes to deepen engagement within the community.",31,286,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00286
2016-04-14-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"For instance, we have, under the New Grants Framework, supported arts practitioners and organisations to engage and collaborate with communities. Mr Kok mentioned the ArtsWok Collective, which NAC's Seed Grant proudly founded.

Examples of such intermediaries include ArtsWok, the Singapore Drama Educators Association, Art Outreach and National Book Development Council Singapore and these are already being funded NAC's Major and Seed Grants. These grants allow them to focus on their professional development and to produce high quality programmes that can better reach out to their various beneficiaries and target audiences.",33,288,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00288

We can assure him that the objectives for Major and Seed Grant companies are customised to reflect the companies' vision, target audience and programmes. For example, a performing arts company's KPIs could include audience outreach at their performances and training workshops for practitioners, while an intermediary's KPIs would also consider the quality of the experience rather than just outreach numbers alone. In fact, NAC will be conducting a review of the Major Grant framework, and we welcome ideas on how to improve the schemes including KPIs.",34,289,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00289
2016-04-14-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,Mr Kok Heng Leun also pointed out that a space does not simply become a place without support from the local community and we recognise the importance of creative place-making being relational and ground-up. Minister Grace Fu shared our plans to continue investing in programming and marketing efforts to revitalise the Bras Basah-Bugis precinct and the Civic District. And this needs to go hand in hand with the community ownership and strong support from the arts and heritage groups within the areas.,35,290,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00290

2016-04-14-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"We are indeed looking at ways to uplift the traditional arts sector, and keep traditional arts relevant and accessible to Singaporeans. We will continue to professionalise and nurture the next generation of traditional arts talent. NAC's funding to traditional arts groups has almost doubled in the last five years from $1.26 million in FY11 to $2.51 million in FY15. Many of the arts organisations supported by NAC's Major Grant Scheme have a strong focus in developing quality traditional arts programmes and are also actively reaching out to the community. In fact, in the recently announced list of NAC Major Grant recipients, more than one third are traditional arts groups.",39,294,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00294

For example, at last year's Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations at Gardens by the Bay, traditional arts groups like Dicapella Dizi Ensemble and Nam Hwa Opera put up nightly cultural shows for 10 days. About 50,000 audience members enjoyed their performances. NAC will continue to work with Gardens by the Bay to showcase traditional arts performances at this year's festival. If you dropped by River Hongbao this year, you may also remember the lively 乖小丑 performance by the young students of Sheng Hong Arts Institute. They are adorable and full of energy, so it's no wonder why the performance was so well-received. I think we can and should find more platforms for Traditional Art performers to showcase their talents to an even wider audience. That is why we are also working with companies such as Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Dance Theatre, Era Dance Theatre, and Ding Yi Music Company to bring their signature traditional arts programmes to the heartlands and closer to residents.",44,299,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00299

NAC is currently working with Traditional Arts Centre to develop an original and age-appropriate Chinese opera production to perform at different schools. We are also piloting a series of bite-sized programmes by local and regional arts companies customised for pre-schools and primary schools to deepen our young Singaporeans' understanding of our multicultural society during Racial Harmony Day in July. As a start, we will introduce these taster programmes at 5 schools in 2016.

The Minister mentioned that there are four million visits to our museums and 700,000 visits now to the National Gallery. I would like to know whether out of this four million and 700,000 – how many are locals, how many are foreigners?

We will take guidance from MOE but certainly, we will make sure that our system is ready to accommodate and adapt to the new system that MOE will puts in place.",2,329,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00329
2016-04-14-T-005,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, my clarification is for Minister Yaacob. I am heartened that 80% of our Asatizahs are registered the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS). My two clarifications  were all teachers teaching Islamic education be required to register under this scheme? Second, what is the basic qualification required to be registered and assessed to be having the knowledge and competency to teach Islamic education?",1,330,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00330
2016-04-14-T-005,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, we have an Asatizah Recognition Board (ARB) which is basically a board which is supported by secretariat with Pergas and MUIS, comprising learned Asatizah to make an assessment. I do not have the details of the assessment criteria, but we look at their qualifications and experience. There are those who may not have formal qualifications but they have taught the religion for many, many years. They could have just ""O"" level pass or ""A"" level pass from the local madrasahs and they have done well, and so, they will make certain assessment. I have left it to the ARB and thus far, the number of appeal cases is very limited.",1,331,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00331
2016-04-14-T-005,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"To the first question, it is almost whether we should make the ARS mandatory. I mean, it is 80% now. And as I mentioned in my reply, we want to encourage the 20% to come on-board. We have to study this very, very carefully. Certainly, it is in our interest and the interest of the community to get as many as possible onto the registration system because it gives our community, both parents and institutions, a wide selection of Asatizah whom we feel will understand the local context and who can teach Islam to our students. It is good for our students to have a good grasp of the knowledge but also be a part of modern Singapore.",2,332,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00332
2016-04-14-T-005,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"The Minister talked about using art for the purposes of unity, for harmony and for comments. Any society is not just based on that, it is also about discord, dissensus as well as, a lot of times, disagreement. So, what does the Minister think about providing that safe space so that we can have diversity? I just want to remind the House that John F. Kennedy did say ""If we cannot end now our difference, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity"".",1,333,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00333

Based on what I hear, most of the engagement for place making tends to be top-down. Can Minister talk about how we can start democratising the whole engagement process, and especially, it is important to give time for a place to happen. Can we talk more about that?",2,334,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00334

During this process, training becomes especially important. It will require time and expertise. I would like to ask whether the National Arts Council (NAC) has a framework to allow these Traditional Artists to have time to immerse and learn.",4,336,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00336
2016-04-14-T-005,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Second, Traditional Arts also needs innovation. Li Yu in his book ""Sketches of Idle Pleasure"" (闲情偶寄) talked about ""thinking out of the box"" in length. In another word, only by creating new things can we communicate with the audience. The process of ""thinking out of the box"" also takes time. May I ask whether the Traditional Arts Master Plan has taken this into consideration?",5,337,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00337

2016-04-14-T-005,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Thank you, Mdm Chair. I do agree that in art, we look for opportunity where we can have discourse. I think art has that potential of allowing the expression of opinions. But we also need to recognise that art has this ability to evoke emotions. I think artists want to see that their work has that ability to influence and to affect. Having these considerations in mind, I think discourse, dissent, disagreements can take place and have their place in Singapore, and we do that by classification, by giving advisories. Creating a space where certain segments, perhaps the more mature, perhaps those able to deal with the issue, can be engaged in that discourse.",1,339,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00339
2016-04-14-T-005,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I would like to reiterate the point that if you look at the art scene, over time, we have actually moved. Artworks that were not shown in the past, now have been shown regularly including some of the forum theatre work that Mr Kok himself is so closely associated with. In terms of diversity, too, topics that were perhaps uncomfortable in the past, whether they deal with specific lifestyles or values, or deal with issues such as conservation of an environment – I think Mr Kok recently also did a work on Bukit Brown – issues that arouse disagreement and dissent in the society get a hearing, get their place in the arts, including works like ""Gemuk Girls"" which has criticised parts of the political system. We have, over time, allowed more variety, greater diversity in artworks. I hope that the art community will give the regulator acknowledgement that it has happened.",2,340,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00340

2016-04-14-T-005,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"On the second question about place making, some parts of it may seem to be top down initially but it has evolved. Let me give an example. I think PA PAssionArts, when it first started, it was top-down. We needed to have some organised activities; we needed to provide some training; we needed to decide what was the theme and so on, because it was something new. But without a push from the agencies, probably we may not have been able to develop it as quickly as we would have liked.",4,342,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00342

They are putting in their themes; they are staking their claim; they are deciding what to be depicted, what to be portrayed. That should be the way to go. With the local community stepping forward, agencies like PA would gladly step back and let the locals have greater decision-making.",5,343,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00343
2016-04-14-T-005,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Also in some projects, we have deliberately assigned the job to a theatre production professional. Let me give you the example of Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA). SIFA is actually undertaken by Mr Ong Keng Sen who is not part of the agency.

Since the Minister had mentioned just now that Madrasah Aljunied and Arabiah, which are under the JMS, in collaboration with MUIS, are rolling out new programmes, I commend these collaborative efforts in making madrasahs a more progressive institution.

The point to be made is that there is no shortage of funds for the mosques to tap on. They have zakat funds and they have donations that they receive every Friday and every day of the week. I know for a fact that mosques do have a lot of resources. The partnership is also very good for the Malay/Muslim organisations because it gives them a way to extend their programme into the mosques, especially for the use of the facilities and greater outreach.

2016-04-14-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, artists, by their nature, throughout history across the world, they criticise the way things are and they posit alternative ways for the way things are. So, I think that restriction on NAC funding is holding back all that Singapore art could be.",2,386,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00386
2016-04-14-T-005,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mdm Chair, I do not think this point was specifically brought up. Neither did the Member file a cut on this. Nevertheless, I will attempt to clarify.",1,387,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00387
2016-04-14-T-005,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As I explained earlier on, there have been works that showed dissent, including, what I have just mentioned, this play about ""Gemuk Girls"" that has been put up by one of the groups that has received funding, and that play was critical about the political system. So, I think we have gone quite far already about allowing dissenting voices and different voices to be voiced out in the arts sector.",2,388,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00388
2016-04-14-T-005,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Let me just put it this way. If we agree that there should be rules and regulations to protect and maintain social harmony, then I think we can talk about how this is calibrated and whether the calibration is the right one. There will always be differences at the boundary because it is in the nature of art to want to break away. As Mr Kok so appropriately said in his Budget speech, artists want to − if I paraphrase him correctly − tear down the pieces and improvise. That is the nature of artwork. They always want to challenge themselves. They challenge the boundaries, and the regulator would want to maintain the space for the majority in the middle.",3,389,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00389
2016-04-14-T-005,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, there will be tension always but, as an art promoter, we will work as much as we can to facilitate respectful discussions between the artists, the arts industry, as well as the regulator.",4,390,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00390
2016-04-14-T-005,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, I do not agree with what the Member has said that we have withheld funding from arts groups that have been critical of the Government. Far from it. Many of the arts groups that have put up plays, that have been critical of the Government, continue to be funded. In fact, some have had their funding increased over the years.",5,391,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00391
2016-04-14-T-005,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mdm Chair, allow me to just clarify on the earlier point to Miss Cheng Li Hui. I said that half the cost of the $250 million relates to the campus per se. That is correct, but the remaining half − I have just been alerted − not all of it is first-mover cost. Forty-five million dollars is needed to link the OBS campus to basic facilities, such as water and sewage, and $75 million has to do with increased staff, equipment and programming costs, to ensure safety as we triple the capacity of OBS.",6,392,2016-04-14-T-005-S-00392

We have a full agenda ahead of us and much work to do. Will we still be a shiny red dot in the next 50 years? This will depend not just on this House, or the Government, but the whole of Singapore. It is a shared responsibility. The next chapter of the Singapore story will be written in partnership with Singaporeans. That is how we build a stronger, better Singapore that we can all be proud to call Home. [Applause]",17,453,2016-04-14-T-008-S-00453
2016-04-14-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Hon Members, this year's Budget debate, with a number of firsts, is an important one. This is the first Budget of our 13th Parliament and the first Budget of our newly-minted Finance Minister Mr Heng Swee Keat who, I must say, delivered the Budget with great panache. It is also the first Budget for our many newly-elected Members of Parliament, NCMPs and NMPs and they have all performed well.",1,454,2016-04-14-T-008-S-00454
2016-04-14-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"I say it is an important Budget for another reason. It was delivered in the 51st year of our Independence, to set the trend of change for the next 50 years by calling for transformation − a word that was echoed by both the front and back bench Members during the two-week debate.",2,455,2016-04-14-T-008-S-00455
2016-04-14-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Transform, indeed, we must if we are to stay relevant to the fast changing economic, socio-political and security environment both locally, regionally and globally. As the Minister for Defence put it very aptly, we are now in a new normal period of ""troubled peace"", and I must add not just from the security angle alone. There will be disruptions, some pretty serious ones, as many Members noted, as we transform.",3,456,2016-04-14-T-008-S-00456
2016-04-14-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,Many Members cheered the slew of industry transformation programmes for SMEs outlined in the Budget to spur the transformation of enterprises and industries through innovation. But there were also very strong calls for changes and adaptation on the part of our people and workers too. Many Members were concerned with loss of livelihoods through skills obsolescence due to automation and strongly welcomed SkillsFuture and stronger measures to support PMEs.,4,457,2016-04-14-T-008-S-00457
2016-04-14-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Whilst skills obsolescence was a fear previously faced by low-skill, blue collar workers, it is now more pervasive among middle income, white collar workers, where the impact of job losses will be much greater and re-employment a lot tougher, without effective labour market intervention.",5,458,2016-04-14-T-008-S-00458
2016-04-14-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Listening to the debate, I cannot help wondering whether there are two labour markets running in parallel. One covers the traditional sectors like cleaning, security and landscaping, jobs that will always be with us and which are still bedevilled by low wages, poor working conditions and lack of career opportunities. Running in parallel are sectors that are better able to leverage on technology such as finance, technology and FinTech that promises better pay, better careers and a brighter future. Members were rightly concerned that if we fail to transform the low-wage jobs, our society will become more fragmented as the income disparity widens.",6,459,2016-04-14-T-008-S-00459
2016-04-14-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,This Budget is also special and will be remembered as one that slayed not one but two sacred cows that Members have been raising in this Chamber for a long time; the PSLE grading system and extended maternity leave for unmarried mothers. It reflects a transformational shift in policy aimed at placing children at the heart of what we do instead of focusing narrowly just on academic excellence or procreation.,7,460,2016-04-14-T-008-S-00460
2016-04-14-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Members welcomed the efforts to strengthen our social safety net through schemes such as Silver Support, but also reminded us on the need for fiscal prudence and sustainability, a difficult balance. But supporting our seniors or the lower income is not a zero sum game. In helping to uplift them, we are also helping to stimulate the economy as they are also consumers. Giving them hope will not only contribute to a more humane and compassionate society but will also strengthen social cohesion, giving greater legitimacy to our economic programmes and achievements.

How to motivate and empower people to be more interested in what is going on so that they can make informed choices and better decisions for themselves?",13,466,2016-04-14-T-008-S-00466
2016-04-14-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"All said and done, the challenge now is how to help people navigate this period of disruption and transformation to a better future. The schemes are there, grants provided, support given but will that move individuals, companies and our society forward to embrace the challenges of transformation? What can we, as citizens, do for ourselves and our family to ride this period and emerge stronger? The Government can only do so much. It can act as a catalyst, it can prod, nudge, persuade and influence, but beyond that it really depends on all of us how fast we want to run and how much of that rainbow we want to catch.",14,467,2016-04-14-T-008-S-00467

Likewise, by way of reciprocity, our civil judgments may be recognised and enforced in the same 11 countries.",5,517,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00517
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"With the Convention and passing of this Bill, the 11 countries will be joined by another 28 states − that include Mexico and all countries in EU, except Denmark. Our civil judgments may be recognised and enforceable in these additional countries and, likewise, we may recognise and enforce their courts' judgments. Hopefully, the US will ratify the Convention soon. More than that, I hope that it will be a matter of time before other parties sign up to the Convention. When more countries sign up and ratify the Convention, more countries will be added to the 39 states.",6,518,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00518
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments among contracting states will certainly help to promote international trade. The cooperation of contracting states and the recognition and enforcement of judgments will, hopefully, help to enhance our courts as one of the leading judiciaries in the area of commercial law.",7,519,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00519
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"It has been said that the Hague Convention seeks to create a regime for recognition and enforcement of court judgments comparable to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, commonly referred to as the New York Convention. The New York Convention applies to the recognition and enforcement of international arbitration awards and currently has about 156 signatories. Hopefully, in time to come, the Hague Convention will be as successful as the New York Convention.",8,520,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00520
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Over the years, Singapore has grown to be a leading forum for international arbitration in the world. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) has become one of the leading international arbitration centres. In more recent years, the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA) has become a leading maritime arbitration body.",9,521,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00521
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The Government has been trying to develop Singapore as an international dispute resolution centre.

The other pillar is our courts, particularly where it involves adjudication of disputes arising from international contracts.",10,522,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00522
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Our High Court and our Admiralty Courts have their share of landmark decisions in international jurisprudence. It is not by chance that the signing of this Convention and now this Bill coincides with the recent setting up of the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC) in January this year. And, indeed, rightly so. By enhancing the enforceability of our court judgments abroad, I hope that they can enhance the attraction of SICC and, indeed, Singapore courts generally, and persuade more international commercial parties to have their disputes to be decided in our courts. To this end, I am in support of the ratification of the Hague Convention and of this Bill.",11,523,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00523
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),I hope the SICC will develop to be a premier international commercial court. The Court has already appointed distinguished and reputable judges from different countries to sit on its bench. But we also need to think about the mechanics of getting our courts to be chosen as the exclusive choice of court in the jurisdiction clause of the commercial agreements that international parties enter into.,12,524,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00524
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"We have to persuade people to put Singapore courts or SICC into their contracts as a court of choice to adjudicate any dispute that may arise. We need to approach MNCs and other international companies. We can start by persuading our own Singapore companies to use our SICC or Singapore jurisdiction clauses. We need to persuade them to fight for such clauses to be used, even in the face of their international business counterparts disagreeing.",13,525,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00525
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),Jurisdiction clause is frequently not an item of priority to consider when parties are negotiating a contract. They may be more excited about the price of the contract or the operational details of the contract. Most people think that jurisdiction clauses are not something that should break a deal. This may make the task of persuading a change of mindset a little bit more difficult.,14,526,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00526
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"We need to persuade lawyers who draft contracts for their clients; sometimes, we need to persuade lawyers to persuade their clients. From my experience, some clients are creatures of habits and may take time to be persuaded.",15,527,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00527
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"We should also try to persuade the many international lawyers based in Singapore or in Asia to promote Singapore, whether for SICC or for arbitration. We should take a leaf from the experience of SIAC, and in recent years, SCMA, their marketing efforts, to persuade companies to use their respective house of arbitration clauses. Over time, SIAC has grown in its reputation and stature. On the other hand, SCMA has come a long way in the last few years. SCMA has become a much better known name in the international maritime circle. The SCMA arbitration clause is becoming more and more widely used in the world.",16,528,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00528
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"In 2013, SCMA has even managed to persuade BIMCO to have SCMA BIMCO arbitration clause options in its many standard contract templates. BIMCO is the world's largest shipping association with 2,200 members worldwide. Its contract forms are recognised and used by shipping companies worldwide as industry standard templates. Persuading BIMCO to have a SCMA arbitration clause was no mean feat for a relatively young maritime body like SCMA. Before that, only London and New York made it. Efforts like this should inspire all stakeholders in their promotion drives for not just arbitration in Singapore, but also in the use of SICC or Singapore courts as a chosen choice of court for dispute resolution.",17,529,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00529
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"One of the strengths of Singapore as a legal hub is that it can and often does provide a neutral forum for non-Singapore parties. For example, for international arbitration, Singapore is often a preferred neutral forum of choice for a dispute involving, say, two Asian parties, for example, Chinese and Indian parties or between, say, a European party and a Chinese party. We can and should tap on this for SICC too. Certainly, with the 27 states in the European Union being contracting states under the Hague Convention, European parties must certainly be a key object of our persuasion.",18,530,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00530
2016-04-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Finally, with the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015, it will make sense to have reciprocal recognition and enforcement of civil judgments between all ASEAN countries. Currently, such reciprocity only extends to Brunei and Malaysia. For example, our court judgment is not recognised in Indonesia. I know that many Indonesians prefer to have their commercial disputes determined by arbitration in Singapore and frequently SIAC, and sometimes, even when their business counterparts in the same contract are also Indonesians. We should persuade our ASEAN neighbours to follow our footsteps in signing up to the Hague Convention. Madam, with that, I support the Bill.",19,531,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00531
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill. I should declare my interest as a lawyer who practises dispute resolution and deals with cases that would be considered international cases under this Act.",1,532,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00532
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"This Act is an important development in Singapore. Singapore started developing as a centre for international dispute resolution in the 1980s. We became a party to the New York Convention on Enforcement of Arbitral Awards in 1986 and this heralded the rise of Singapore as a dispute resolution centre for international arbitration in the 1990s. The importance of arbitration, and especially international arbitration, was manifold.",2,533,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00533
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"First of all, it provided parties the opportunity to have the disputes resolved before a confidential forum. It was a one-stop solution; there was no appeal on the arbitral award generally. But perhaps, most importantly for international disputes, it also allowed an arbitral award obtained in Singapore to be enforced in many other countries, and in particular, all the countries that are parties to New York Convention. At the moment, there about 156 such countries.",3,534,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00534
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"What this means is that parties who are involved in a dispute that involved multiple jurisdictions, can now choose any country that is a party to the New York Convention and that includes Singapore, have the dispute resolved there, and if that dispute is an international arbitration, they can enforce it in many other countries. This has been an important attraction of international arbitration.",4,535,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00535
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),It is in this context that this Bill changes the equation somewhat. What this Bill does is that it gives court judgments and a fact that it might be similar to international arbitral awards as far as enforceability goes.,5,536,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00536
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"There are three key components to this Act. The first, and this is reflected in Article 5 of the Convention as well as section 11 of the Act, is that a court that is chosen, as long as it is one of the courts that is in the contracting states, these courts will have to take up the dispute, subject to certain exceptions. But otherwise, if a court is chosen as the venue for dispute resolution, it has to take up the case. This is even if the case has no other relationship with the country concerned.",6,537,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00537
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second is that, this is in Article 6 of the Convention as well as section 12 of the Act, the courts of the countries that are parties to it must actually stay proceedings or dismiss proceedings if they are subject to the jurisdiction of another court. So, what this means is that even if the court might otherwise have had jurisdiction, as a result of this clause, they would have to decline to take up the case. This is very similar to what happens in the arbitration framework as well. If a dispute is subject to arbitration and it is governed by the International Arbitration Act, typically the courts will stay any court cases that try to go round that clause.",7,538,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00538
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),The final component is the enforcement of judgments and is under Article 8 of the Convention and section 13 of the Act. This basically says that courts have to give effect to judgments from another contracting state.,8,539,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00539
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"What these three mechanisms do is, in effect, they give judgments in Singapore an effect similar to an international arbitral award, in that a judgment that is made here can be enforced in any other party that is a contracting party to the Hague Convention.",9,540,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00540
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),It is in this respect that it is also important to look at some of the implications. I will just do a quick comparison. There are still important differences between the two for parties that are deciding whether to choose to use arbitration or to use the courts.,10,541,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00541
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"As a practitioner, I can say that one the biggest advantages of the courts is that where a dispute is complex and where non-parties may be involved, it is easier to get them involved if the dispute is in court. So, it is one of the classic rules of arbitration that only parties to the arbitration agreement can bring their dispute in that arbitration agreement. If there is a dispute that involves the two parties in the arbitration agreement as well as non-parties, the only way the non-parties can get involved is with the consent of both parties to the arbitration agreement.",11,542,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00542
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"However, if the same dispute is brought into court, there is no such limitation on the courts' power to bring another parties involved in the dispute into that dispute, provided the court otherwise has jurisdiction. This actually gives the courts a great deal more flexibility and in fact, the choice of using a court would give you more flexibility if you envision that your dispute may involve other parties.",12,543,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00543
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"So, this is an important advantage the courts have over arbitration. This used to be counter-balanced by the limitation on enforceability of a court award in other jurisdictions, but this Bill will remove that limitation somewhat.",13,544,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00544
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"It is also here that we come into one of the limitations of this new development and that is, the number of contracting states. The New York Convention for Arbitral Awards has about 156 parties. That means an international arbitration award can be enforced in 156 different countries. This current Convention is relatively young. Mexico was the first country to ratify it. The European Union was the second and that took place only in about October last year. The European Union brought in the other 27 countries. Singapore is the next country to ratify it. The United States has signed it but has not yet ratified it.",14,545,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00545
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In fact, right now, the only parties to which this Act will apply would be Mexico, Singapore and most of the European Union, with one exception. I believe that this Act has tremendous potential but it still does not have the same reach as an arbitral award because of the number of signatories to the underlining Convention.",15,546,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00546
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One of my suggestions, in fact, if we were to make this Act even more meaningful, would be to try and get more of our friends to sign up to the Convention. We could start with ASEAN because a lot of our business is in ASEAN, potentially other trading partners as well; potentially India, China. This would help to give the Act even more reach because the more parties that ratify the Convention, the more we will allow the dual-enforceability of court judgments. Courts, otherwise, have a bigger advantage over arbitration as a forum for dispute resolution.",16,547,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00547
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I should also caveat that there are some complex disputes for which even this Act will not provide easy answers. I explained that multi-party disputes are one of the biggest limitations of arbitration. That limitation may still apply in court. For example, if a dispute were to occur entirely, say, in a third country, but the parties of that dispute ask for it to be resolved in a court in Singapore. And if there were non-parties involved, it does not automatically follow the Singapore court's jurisdiction over the non-parties. So, it does not overcome all the limitations but I think it still gives more flexibility to involve non-parties to the arbitration agreement.",17,548,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00548
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The final thing I should point out is, there are some concerns that there is no limitation on which countries can become party to this Convention. While we will not name specific countries, there are some countries where people have more doubts about the judicial systems.",18,549,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00549
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Does it mean, for example, that an award, where we may suspect the legitimacy of that judicial system, does it mean that we will automatically have to enforce it? Well, the short answer is, apart from one carve-out for public policy, the answer would be yes. This is why it is quite important for parties to make a clear choice on the choice of law because ultimately it is for parties to choose which forum they like. This was the criticism that was made about international arbitration as well when it first took off because, ultimately, parties choose their arbitrator. There is no real quality control over that. But international arbitral awards are still in force, and that is because we recognise the choice of parties. So, likewise over here, if parties choose a certain jurisdiction that happens to be a contracting state, then we are obliged to recognise that subject to public policy and other considerations.",19,550,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00550
2016-04-14-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"But overall, I think this is an excellent development. I think it gives parties a great deal more choice in resolving their disputes. My only suggestion is that we wear our hats in the international front and get more people to sign up to the Convention.",20,551,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00551
2016-04-14-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Tan and Mr Nair for their strong support for the Bill. There are just a couple of points to which I should reply.",1,552,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00552
2016-04-14-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First, Mr Nair raised the question of whether there was a limitation because of the relatively smaller number of contracting states. The answer to that is we certainly expect it to grow. But even with the present signatories as well as states that have ratified, it is already very promising. Having the European Union, for example, as a contracting party immediately extends our reach to the European Union, save, of course, for Denmark.",2,553,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00553
2016-04-14-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In addition to that, the United States and the Ukraine are signatories to the Convention and there is growing interest in the Convention in the region. We for our part, will certainly, as suggested by Mr Tan and Mr Nair encourage more ASEAN member states to become parties to the Convention.",3,554,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00554
2016-04-14-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I think Mr Nair also raised the issue of what would happen if we are obliged to recognise judgments from Convention states with less robust systems and whether that would necessarily have to take place. Possibly so, but I think that this is mitigated by two things. One is the element of choice and second is built-in safeguards in the Bill. Let me explain what I mean.",4,555,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00555
2016-04-14-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First  choice. The Convention applies where there is an exclusive choice of court agreement. So, once they choose the forum, it means that parties have made a choice of that court. You have to assume that when they make that choice, they took into account the relevant factors, including the robustness of the judicial system of which that chosen court is a part. This really means that they have taken it into account and what the Bill does is it gives effect to that choice. It means parties must think carefully when choosing an exclusive choice of court forum.",5,556,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00556
2016-04-14-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Logically though, I think that this would act as a natural filter because, by and large, parties act rationally. So they are likely to take into account the factors that I mentioned earlier – neutrality, that the system is not corrupt. They will look at the robustness of the system in which that court resides – and they will make their choices accordingly. So, that would act as a sort of natural filter.",6,557,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00557
2016-04-14-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"And secondly, the Convention and the Bill have their own safeguards. For example, the Convention permits the Singapore court to refuse recognition or enforcement of foreign judgments on certain specified grounds. The courts must refuse to recognise or enforce a judgment where the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud in connection with the matter of procedure or when the defendant was not notified of the proceedings against it, and recognition or enforcement is incompatible with the public policy of Singapore. There are also some discretionary grounds where the courts can refuse recognition or enforcement. Those operate as safeguards.",7,558,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00558
2016-04-14-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Essentially, at the end of the day, what being a party to the Convention means is that it extends the enforceability of the judgments of our courts and that, in turn, is good for the industry and for Singapore as a dispute resolution hub as a whole. I thank the Members once again for their support.",8,559,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00559
2016-04-14-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),Just one point of clarification for the Senior Minister of State. I noticed that clause 9(1)(b) of the Bill specifically or explicitly excludes employment contracts and collective agreements. I am aware the Hague Convention has likewise,1,560,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00560
2016-04-14-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,The reason why the Bill does not include things like employment contracts is because they are not covered in the Convention. The Convention does not extend to this. The reason for that is because this is a Convention that deals with international civil and commercial matters. It is in the realm of international trade and international investment and it is meant to address commercial disputes.,1,561,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00561
2016-04-14-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Employment matters fall under the category of more personal law where individuals are concerned. By their nature, they tend to be governed by more domestic regimes, and so it does not fall within the ambit of the Convention and thus, does not come within this Bill.",2,562,2016-04-14-T-009-S-00562
