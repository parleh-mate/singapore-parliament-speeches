2014-05-29-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,– The following question stood in the name of,1,1,2014-05-29-T-001-S-00001
2014-05-29-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,1 To ask the Minister for Transport (a) what is the average ridership on the Downtown Line during the morning and evening peak and non-peak hours since it started operations in December 2013; (b) how much has the Downtown Line helped alleviate the load on the North East Line during the morning and evening peak hours; and (c) whether the Downtown Line has also eased the load on the Circle Line during peak hours.,2,2,2014-05-29-T-001-S-00002
2014-05-29-T-001,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),Question No 1.,1,3,2014-05-29-T-001-S-00003
2014-05-29-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Mdm Speaker, in reply to the Parliamentary Question from Mr Gan Thiam Poh, the average weekday ridership for the Downtown Line 1 (DTL1) from January till April 2014 was approximately 58,000 passengers daily with about 40% of the passengers travelling during the peak hours.",1,4,2014-05-29-T-001-S-00004
2014-05-29-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"The DTL1, given its short length, is primarily intended to provide connectivity within as well as into and out of the city area, rather than to alleviate loading on the North East Line (NEL) and Circle Line (CCL). The full DTL, on the other hand, when completed in 2017, will help relieve some of the loading on the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) as well as some of the crowded interchange stations in the city.",2,5,2014-05-29-T-001-S-00005
2014-05-29-T-001,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"We can expect some relief to the loading on the NEL and the CCL from 2015, when a total of 42 new trains will be added progressively. The fleet capacity of the NEL and the CCL will then increase by up to 70% and 60% respectively.",3,6,2014-05-29-T-001-S-00006
2014-05-29-T-002,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,"asked the Minister for Defence (a) what are the strategies utilised for screening of mental health disorders in National Service recruits; and (b) what is being offered in terms of management and counselling for those in the SAF, Navy and Air Force who already have a mental health disorder.",1,7,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00007
2014-05-29-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mdm Speaker, the spectrum of mental health disorders within any given population can vary considerably in severity, and because our National Servicemen are drawn from the general population, this is also true for National Servicemen with mental health disorders. Further, for the affected individual, his condition may not be static and could worsen or improve over time. So, MINDEF's approach for National Servicemen with mental health disorders takes into account this variability; variability of conditions across different individuals, the variability of an individual who has the condition over time. And only those who are assessed professionally to be able to perform his National Service (NS) duties are enlisted.",1,8,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00008
2014-05-29-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Before enlistment, all pre-enlistees are screened by Medical Officers for psychiatric, behavioural and adjustment problems. The screening guidelines are established by the SAF Psychiatry Specialist Advisory Board, and this comprises senior psychiatrists drawn from private practice and public hospitals. Pre-enlistees with severe mental illnesses who are unable to perform NS duties are exempted from NS. And in the last three years, about 500 were exempted from NS because they had this condition, annually, due to mental health problems. Five hundred annually.",2,9,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00009
2014-05-29-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"For those enlisted, we want to ensure that national servicemen with mental health disorders pose no risk to themselves and those around them. They are monitored while they are serving NS. To protect their medical confidentiality, only the Commanders and Medical Officers who monitor their progress are notified about their conditions. Should they require closer observation, these National Servicemen are seen regularly by psychiatrists at the Psychological Care Centre.",3,10,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00010
2014-05-29-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Any time there is doubt whether the National Servicemen can perform his duties or about safety risks, the individual is again assessed by the psychiatrist and could be redeployed to a more suitable vocation or excused from his NS duties.",4,11,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00011
2014-05-29-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"I have spoken about a specific regime which the Member has asked for. But in addition to this specific regime for those with known mental health disorders, the SAF also educates trainees in Officer Cadet School and Specialist Cadet School. We give them basic counselling and mental health awareness programmes. This is to help our Commanders better identify fellow soldiers with mental health issues. Soldiers with mental health issues can be referred to the Psychological Care Centre. The Member also asked what other avenues there are. There is also a 24-hour SAF Counselling Hotline, which soldiers can call – whether they themselves or others for them – whenever they need help.",5,12,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00012
2014-05-29-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Our approach towards national servicemen with mental health disorders ensures that they are not discriminated against or stigmatised if they are able to perform NS safely. They are treated similarly with national servicemen who have other physical health disorders, where risks are also managed accordingly based on guidelines, again, developed by our Specialist Medical Boards. The risks from their medical conditions, whether physical or mental, will exist even when they are not performing NS.",6,13,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00013
2014-05-29-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Under our present regime, there have been many national servicemen with mental health disorders who have completed their NS duties well. MINDEF and the SAF will continue to periodically review and strengthen the mental health system, in consultation with the Psychiatry Specialist Advisory Board, to ensure that all National Servicemen with medical conditions receive good care during NS.",7,14,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00014

2014-05-29-T-002,,,"Secondly, in the decision to downgrade for fitness to perform during National Service or in the SAF, is it required that a psychiatrist in a restructured hospital is consulted, or is it just the SAF psychiatrist who can make a decision? Also, for medication for the psychiatric conditions, which can be quite expensive for some, are there subsidies that these people can tap?",2,16,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00016
2014-05-29-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Madam, before I answer specifically, we treat psychiatric conditions similar to other medical conditions, with regard to whether the serviceman can be re-deployed or exempted from National Service altogether. The SAF makes no distinction between private and public medical specialists who have seen the serviceman and alert us to either the condition or if the condition has worsened. But the final decision on deployment and exemption or continuing of NS is made by a Specialist Board. We have a number of these Specialist Medical Boards. Rather than one person doing it, we draw them from both private and public sectors – as I had mentioned. We have a Psychiatrist Board that consists of specialists drawn from both private and public sectors, and they help us to assess any particular individual's condition.",1,17,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00017
2014-05-29-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Our subsidy and treatment regimes fall under the general healthcare framework. If there are issues in terms of financial assistance, we have separate schemes but no, we do not have any particular scheme that addresses medical subsidies for National Servicemen with medical health conditions.",2,18,2014-05-29-T-002-S-00018
2014-05-29-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,asked 	 the Minister for Health (a) what safeguards are in place to ensure that foreign healthcare staff who can only speak English do not miscommunicate with our non-English speaking patients; (b) how the Ministry intends to encourage more foreign healthcare staff to attend courses to learn our official languages (other than English) and Chinese dialects; and (c) how many full-time interpreters for local languages and dialects are there in the public hospitals and polyclinics currently .,1,19,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00019

2014-05-29-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Health),"About 35% of foreign staff recruited in the last five years had participated in at least one language programme. Some of the foreign staff are Malaysians or have been in Singapore for some time and are already familiar with our language and culture, and therefore may not need to attend such programmes. The Ministry also provides the public healthcare institutions with a training fund, to support foreign nurses in enrolling for language courses. More than 2,000 foreign nurses have benefited from this scheme between 2009 and 2013.",2,21,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00021
2014-05-29-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Health),"Pictorial guides are available in our public healthcare institutions to aid staff in their communication with patients. In addition, our public healthcare institutions ensure that a good mix of local and foreign healthcare staff is rostered for each shift. They work as a team to care for our patients. In some institutions, foreign staff may also partner colleagues who speak the language of the patient, if necessary.",3,22,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00022
2014-05-29-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Health),"With these measures in place, the risk of miscommunication is reduced. Therefore, only a few public healthcare institutions have assessed that it is necessary to employ interpreters for local languages.",4,23,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00023
2014-05-29-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Health),"MOH and the public healthcare institutions will continue to encourage foreign healthcare staff to improve their communication skills, so that they can converse accurately and independently with our patients.",5,24,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00024
2014-05-29-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the answers. I have three supplementary questions. The first is whether MOH has done any study to see what percentage of time is spent by staff who have to partner others to help with the interpretation duties and whether that has impacted their work because it is added to their workload.,1,25,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00025
2014-05-29-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is  in a previous Parliamentary Question reply, MOH stated that the language training programme is about 30 hours long spread over a few weeks. Is there evidence that the healthcare professionals will be equipped with sufficient language skills to communicate with non-English speaking patients after this 30-hour course? And whether there will be some proficiency tests that are conducted for healthcare workers, especially those who do not attend these language courses at all.",2,26,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00026
2014-05-29-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Lastly, I am not sure if there was a reply to the part about the full-time interpreters. I would like to know how widespread is the practice for full-time interpreters to be in hospitals. Thank you.",3,27,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00027
2014-05-29-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Madam, I would like to thank the Member for the questions. I do not have the figure with regard to the time spent by the staff on language coaching. It is part of the work process. I would like to share with the Member that many of our staff look at it as part of the process of working with each other. If you look at nurses in the public healthcare or the nursing communities, it is a vibrant group of people working together to see how they can care for the patient. Even though it is about 30 hours on average, as what the Member mentioned, but I am happy that beyond this, the whole group of nurses will help one another. Many of these foreign nurses or healthcare workers will pick up from the job, from the interactions. The initial courses that they take are certainly very helpful for them, as part of their engagement process.",1,28,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00028
2014-05-29-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"It is about how we monitor them. We monitor them very closely in the sense that we want to make sure that the communications with the patient is done properly as part of the care process. I want to assure the Member that we actually monitor them and we take this seriously because at the end of the day, we want our patients to be well cared for.",2,29,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00029
2014-05-29-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"For interpreters, as I have mentioned in my answer earlier, at the end of the day, it is about working together, and how we can serve the patient better. We have found that by working together with the different nationalities, and those who are fluent in certain languages, we have found that we are able to cope. As a result, we do not need as many interpreters as what the Member mentioned earlier. We find that it is not necessary, but we do have interpreters in a few of these institutions that require them.",3,30,2014-05-29-T-003-S-00030
2014-05-29-T-004,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"asked 	 the Minister for Manpower from 2003 to 2013, how many Permanent Residents have withdrawn their CPF monies when they leave Singapore permanently and what is the total amount of CPF monies withdrawn.",1,31,2014-05-29-T-004-S-00031
2014-05-29-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Mdm Speaker, the average amount withdrawn per year by CPF members leaving Singapore from 2003 to 2013 was $426 million, or 0.3% of average total members' balances. This includes the amounts withdrawn by former Singapore Citizens, former Permanent Residents (PRs) and foreigners who contributed to the CPF before 2003.",1,32,2014-05-29-T-004-S-00032
2014-05-29-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),CPF Board does not track the amount separately for PRs who have given up their Permanent Residency.,2,33,2014-05-29-T-004-S-00033
2014-05-29-T-004,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for the response. I have three supplementary questions. Among the PRs who left Singapore permanently by way of withdrawing their CPF, what is the average length of their PR status in Singapore? Secondly, can PRs keep their properties after withdrawing their CPF monies when they leave Singapore for good? Can they be employed again in Singapore?",1,34,2014-05-29-T-004-S-00034
2014-05-29-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, with regard to the first question, my Ministry does not track PRs specifically, so I do not have the details of the length of stay by PRs here. With regard to their properties, perhaps the Member would like to file a specific Parliamentary Question. I would imagine that if they owned properties here and they leave Singapore, if they are able to own the property, they could continue to own it in their names. With regard to the last question which is whether PRs are able to come back here to work, we will evaluate anyone who is applying to come back to work in Singapore. Obviously, their track record and their past histories will have a bearing on whether they are able to be employed here or not.",1,35,2014-05-29-T-004-S-00035
2014-05-29-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,– The following question stood in the name of,1,36,2014-05-29-T-005-S-00036
2014-05-29-T-005,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"5 To ask the Minister for National Development (a) how many HDB main contractors have been levied liquidated damages for job delays in the past two years; (b) how many time extensions, if any, have been given to main contractors who are affected by the tightening of foreign workers in the past two years without liquidated damages being levied; and (c) what measures has the Ministry taken to ensure that there is no compromise in quality, safety and workmanship in the construction of HDB flats in view of the tightening of foreign workers and strict timelines.",2,37,2014-05-29-T-005-S-00037

2014-05-29-T-005,Desmond Lee,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"HDB has a robust system in place to ensure quality, safety and workmanship at all stages in the construction of HDB flats. For example, before construction, HDB sets the required quality standard based on construction of sample units. During construction, HDB conducts audits to ensure that the work is carried out according to the design specifications and up to standard.",2,40,2014-05-29-T-005-S-00040

Over the years, HDB's CONQUAS scores have been rising, reflecting the higher quality of flats built.",3,41,2014-05-29-T-005-S-00041
2014-05-29-T-005,Desmond Lee,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"HDB will continue to maintain quality, safety and workmanship in the construction of HDB flats. At the same time, we continue to encourage our contractors to adopt greater mechanisation and more productive methods of construction to reduce their reliance on foreign workers.",4,42,2014-05-29-T-005-S-00042
2014-05-29-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I thank the Minister of State for his answer. I just want to ask this  in terms of the shortage of manpower in the construction industry today, how does HDB manage that? Knowing that the industry is a bit short on workers, at the same time, does the Ministry still bring Liquidated Damages (LD) on them in view that they do have issues with manpower shortages? How does HDB help some of these construction companies get their manpower resource?",1,43,2014-05-29-T-005-S-00043
2014-05-29-T-005,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, Singapore is experiencing a tight labour market across all economic sectors, as we are all well aware. For the build environment sector, this applies both to the private as well as the public sector projects. Because the tightening of foreign worker numbers is one of the measures to incentivise contractors to increase productivity, it is normal that they have been affected as well.",1,44,2014-05-29-T-005-S-00044
2014-05-29-T-005,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"What we have done to help contractors is to help them defray the cost of mechanisation uptake, and to raise their workers' skill levels. This is so that they can meet the challenges ahead of them. We do this through the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund. In addition, HDB has introduced various initiatives such as the use of pre-cast technology, system form-work and mechanisation of the work process onsite, as well as the piloting of the dry wall system and so on.",2,45,2014-05-29-T-005-S-00045
2014-05-29-T-005,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To cushion the impact and to drive up productivity in the HDB sector, if they still need more workers, beyond these measures, then they can apply for more workers beyond the Man-Year Entitlement quota through the Man-Year Entitlement Waiver tier.

2014-05-29-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Madam, just to rephrase my question  having spoken to some of these contractors – we have LUP in my estate, for example, and they have also seen delays. One of the common feedback was that they cannot get foreign workers. Will HDB help these companies get the workers they require in order to finish these existing projects which are caught in between?",1,48,2014-05-29-T-005-S-00048
2014-05-29-T-005,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Well, I have just said earlier in response to the Member's question that HDB proactively helps these contractors by driving up productivity, by introducing in their projects productivity-enhancing methodologies. That is the first approach. The second approach is to allow them to mechanise, raise productivity and skills through the provision of a fund. If they do need more workers, then, they are certainly entitled to apply for more workers. It is not that HDB prevents them from doing so. But in so doing, there is the incurring of additional levies. I hope that addresses the Member's question as to whether HDB contractors, when they face difficulties in getting workers, are they able to apply. The answer is yes.",1,49,2014-05-29-T-005-S-00049
2014-05-29-T-006,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,asked the Minister for Health whether the use of MediShield for secondary depression can be reviewed as it is not a primary mental disorder but secondary to other medical or drug-induced diseases.,1,50,2014-05-29-T-006-S-00050

2014-05-29-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"First, let me say that I empathise with the case raised by the Member. It is a specific case. Let me say that in this particular case, it is really, unfortunately, a question of timing. Allow me to briefly explain. First, MediShield claims are based on the conditions for which that person was admitted, and not the original trigger. So, it is the primary condition for which the person was admitted. In this particular instance, the hospital had determined at that point in time of admission, that the primary reason for the admission was depression. Prior to 1 March, depression was not covered by MediShield. So, there was admission prior to 1 March 2013. And then, there was another admission in 2013 after 1 March.",1,55,2014-05-29-T-006-S-00055
2014-05-29-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have noted earlier, since 1 March 2013, MediShield coverage was extended to inpatient treatment of newly diagnosed psychiatric conditions. Again, when the patient was admitted, the hospital determined that the primary reason for admission was depression. But because depression was already diagnosed prior to 1 March 2013 for this case, it is pre-existing condition and, therefore, again, MediShield coverage could not be extended to this particular case.",2,56,2014-05-29-T-006-S-00056
2014-05-29-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have noted, once MediShield Life is introduced, all patients with pre-existing conditions, for psychiatric conditions whether it is primary or secondary, will be covered by MediShield. In the mean time, Government subsidies actually are already inherent when the patient is admitted to subsidised wards in the hospitals. In addition, the patient can utilise Medisave of up to $150 per day or $5,000 per year for inpatient psychiatric treatment. If the patient is needy, he can avail himself to financial assistance through Medifund.",3,57,2014-05-29-T-006-S-00057
2014-05-29-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Let me end by saying that we are aware of the case, and for the admission in 2013, we are actually working with the hospital to better understand the condition for admission and the treatment. We will assist the patient in whatever way we can.",4,58,2014-05-29-T-006-S-00058
2014-05-29-T-007,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,asked the Minister for Law whether he can give an update on the assessment of a need for a Good Samaritan law to be implemented in Singapore.,1,59,2014-05-29-T-007-S-00059

In respect of civil liability, our laws only require a person who offers assistance to comply with the standard of care that can be reasonably expected of a person of his skill and experience. As for criminal liability, a person is generally liable only if there is an intent to cause harm or injury. Clearly, a Good Samaritan acting in good faith will not fall into this category.",2,61,2014-05-29-T-007-S-00061

For instance, in October last year, five members of public helped to extricate a taxi driver and his passengers when the taxi was crushed by a tipper truck in a road accident. There have been no reported cases where persons had refused to come forward out of fear of incurring legal liability.

2014-05-29-T-007,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In some jurisdictions, Good Samaritan laws impose duties on bystanders to provide reasonable assistance in emergency situations.

2014-05-29-T-007,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The first is to address the situation where people generally do not come forward to assist and the law is intended to require the person to assist. That, of course, presupposes there is a situation where people generally do not assist, but that is not the case here, as I have illustrated.",4,69,2014-05-29-T-007-S-00069
2014-05-29-T-007,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The second purpose is to protect persons who assist others, to protect them from civil liability. And that, I think, is the scenario which the Member is alluding to, where somebody comes forward to help, but in the course of assisting may actually render further injury to the person.",5,70,2014-05-29-T-007-S-00070
2014-05-29-T-007,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"As explained earlier, our current law only requires a person offering assistance to comply with the standard of care reasonably expected of a person with his skill and responsibility. So, let us say you are somebody who has no medical experience and you go forward to help and you are helping in good faith, you are not expected to render the kind of assistance that a doctor or a paramedic would be rendering because that is not the level of care that is expected or level of expertise that you have.",6,71,2014-05-29-T-007-S-00071
2014-05-29-T-007,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"By way of assistance and with respect to comparative legislation – perhaps this will help Members to understand what other countries have done – even in other countries, it is not a blanket protection. In British Columbia, for example, they have a Good Samaritan Act where the person coming forward is not liable for damages for injury or death, unless the person is grossly negligent. In the Australian Capital Territory – it is the same thing – the person is exempted unless the person acted recklessly. In Queensland, the person is exempted unless the person acted with gross negligence. In New South Wales, a person is exempted unless the person has failed to exercise reasonable care and skill.",7,72,2014-05-29-T-007-S-00072
2014-05-29-T-007,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In these examples that I have cited, you can see that if a person acts outside of what is expected of them, meaning if you are a paramedic, for example, but you act without care and skill or you are grossly negligent, you will still be liable in any event. That is not so very different from the law in Singapore where the only standard that is expected of you is of a person with your particular skill and expertise. We would not require a person to have a very high standard if that person is a lay-person and does not have a particular expertise, skill or responsibility.",8,73,2014-05-29-T-007-S-00073

2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"Given the rapidly changing socio-political environment, it is a timely reminder to everyone that while we may have a robust public debate, as Singaporeans, we must not lose sight of the need for ""constructive politics"" so that we do not undermine our peace and harmony and fracture the institutions that we have built up over the years. I am pleased to hear the President's call to the young to prepare themselves to take over the torch which I am confident will not fall on insensitive ears. While the President has touched on a broad range of topics from social to economics, it is his outline on Education which will be the focus of my delivery today.",2,83,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00083

2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"There are three main areas of concern and I would like to highlight them and also have some constructive feedback to these three areas  one, hands-on leadership; two, infrastructures for childcare and preschool; and three, the heterogeneous sector and levelling the playing field.",4,85,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00085

While we have made progress in developing a talent pool of special teachers schooled in the skills of childhood education, more needs to be done to bring the whole approach to a new and more professional level. There needs to be an overhaul in the way we run and deliver preschool education. After all, we have to remember that we need to give a very strong foundation to our very young for they are the ones who will eventually be called to carry the torch to bring our country into the future. They are our most valuable resource and the best and only hope for our future.",5,86,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00086
2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"To begin with, I feel that the Government should take on a more hands-on approach in this area. I know we already have an Early Childhood Development Agency set up last year. They are making efforts to improve standards. This is good. But, in my view, good is not enough. Preschool is so important that we should have at least a Parliamentary Secretary, if not a Minister of State, to be devoted full-time looking into the policies, curriculum, standards and even child health, and so forth. It should not be left to an agency where the MOE and MSF have an oversight on its operations. On matters relating to elderly and ageing issues, we have a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to handle the portfolio. I feel that preschool and young children should be given similar priority. We are dealing with young children in whose hands we have to rely on when they grow up. We want parents to have children. We must show parents that we will journey with them when their kids are ready to go for infant care and preschool.",6,87,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00087
2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"Two, infrastructures – plan and build bigger and better preschool facilities. Today, when we look at our plans for our towns, we do see land allocated for flats, transport nodes, Primary and Secondary schools, sports facilities, parks, nursing homes, but we do not see any land allocated for childcare and preschool. Such centres are usually opportunistically inserted or planned when there are void deck spaces available. In fact, in many of the young towns, the demands for such facilities are overwhelming, with many centres, including in Sembawang town having three-digit waiting numbers. One parent actually requested for a queue number at one of my centres, and the only problem was that she just got pregnant and is hoping to book a slot for childcare two years later.",7,88,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00088
2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"Can we relook at how we plan for childcare and preschool facilities? Can town planners incorporate such facilities with the same priority as Primary and Secondary schools? We do have very high-density living in our HDB estates. Instead of building childcare centres at void decks and other opportunistic spaces available, which are usually limited in size, can we change our current paradigm and consider building bigger preschool and childcare centres that have better facilities and bigger capacity similar to the Primary schools? There will be economy of scale in terms of operations. More facilities can be built, including gyms, music facilities, art rooms and so on that can further enhance our preschool education.",8,89,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00089
2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"I know some are concerned about hand, foot and mouth and other viral disease transmission in large centres. We can build in quarantine as well as care facilities with nursing staff to take care of affected children, instead of asking parents to take leave to take care of their children at home. I am sure the possibilities for better educational programmes are endless, if we can cater space for them. For those who are concerned with transport, the centre can be located in the estate where most blocks are within 2 km away. Dedicated transport services can be arranged when there is demand. Larger centres also mean more staff, more opportunities for early childhood educators in terms of their career promotion.",9,90,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00090

2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"Instead, I feel that we have a gap and should not let various groups in the private sector to meander down the fast-flowing stream, sometimes pandering to the calls of parents because of operators' motivation to boost their operational bottom line. This is the scenario today  a network of childcare centres and preschools run by entrepreneurs, and another network run by the Labour Movement and a non-profit foundation. The disparity in the fees charged creates an unease in the minds of many parents with young children. Is it just for a brand name? Is this just for the ambience? Or is this because there is, indeed, a gulf in the standards? Or is there something which is missed by everyone? Perhaps, some schools are being held to ransom by landlords who own the premises and up the rents every two years or so.",11,92,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00092

They follow closely the guidelines given by the agencies and they struggle to keep up with the demand for good teaching staff because there is a fierce competition out there. This is one sector where it is not an employer's market. Instead, the reverse is true.

We need a holistic approach to this issue.",14,95,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00095
2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"There is a plethora of learned studies done on the importance of preschool education. Our MOE must have pored over this literature. But are we giving enough weightage to the wisdom therein? In one study titled ""Investing in Our Future  The Evidence Base on Preschool Education"", it pointed out that the most important aspects of quality in preschool education are stimulating and supportive interactions between teachers and children, and effective use of curricula. It said, ""Children benefit most when teachers engage in stimulating interactions that support learning and are emotionally supportive. Interactions that help children acquire new knowledge and skills provide an input, elicit a verbal response and reaction from them, and foster engagement in and enjoyment of learning.""",15,96,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00096
2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"To my understanding, the Government has been very diligently working on increasing the number of childcare centres in Singapore. We are expected to build 200 by 2018. This is a commendable approach to tackle the childcare crunch. I hope the Minister will be able to share with the House on the progress of this project. Can we get enough qualified manpower to staff all these centres without sacrificing standards? Are our teachers able to elicit ""stimulating interactions"" with their pupils?",16,97,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00097
2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"The Government has been very generous in giving subsidies, but this is not good enough. The Government should take on the development and running of early childhood centres as well as preschools, just as it has done in the driver's seat for Primary and Secondary education. A farmer needs to give his personal attention and tend to the saplings in his nursery, if he wants to see a good harvest in the summer.",17,98,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00098
2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"Children are typically most impressionable between birth and the age of eight. This is the time when the child is more open to learning and vulnerable to influences. They are like sponges and will absorb about anything. This makes it even more prudent to train the right type of preschool teachers because, for every class, there will be a teacher who is setting an example, consciously or subconsciously, to dozens or more young children.",18,99,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00099
2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"Those who aspire to be in early childhood education must be given the same recognition as normal education officers in our Primary and Secondary schools. Childhood education is not a ""play-play thing"". There are a host of institutions offering courses from certification, diplomas to degree on early childhood education. I do not doubt their legitimacy, but guidelines and national assessments should be in place to ensure these courses equip the trainees with the required knowledge, hands-on experience and values to be adequately prepared for their teaching career. In Shanghai, for example, candidates must pass a national teaching examination to be qualified as a preschool educator.

The common misconception that preschool teachers double as nannies must be addressed. This is unattractive to young people who have yet to develop a maternal or paternal instinct for children. After all, one who enjoys the company of children may not necessarily know how to take care of them.

2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"I shall now move on to the issue of road safety for students. Let me first thank the Government for the new measures which I suggested previously for School Zones and Enhanced School Zones schemes, including lowering of speed limit at school zones and higher penalty for traffic offences committed in school zones. These are laudable efforts to prevent traffic accidents involving students. I hope these measures can be implemented faster. The lowering of speed limits will be done only in school zones around 10 schools from August onwards this year. I hope the Government can speed up its implementation to all primary school zones in the nation. The current additional demerit point to be given to errant motorists who committed any traffic offences that already attract demerit points may not be a sufficient deferent to offenders. I hope the Government can do a review and adopt the earlier proposal to double all penalties, including fines and demerit points, to motorists who commit traffic offences within the school zone.",21,102,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00102
2014-05-29-T-010,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"But while they are good deterrent measures, they may not constitute direct preventive measures. I have some suggestions to propose. Every effort must be made to ensure all our roads are free of visual obstruction. These include construction materials near upgrading and construction works, as well as overgrown bushes and trees. Blind spots should be eliminated as far as possible. In light of students arriving in the early morning and leaving school after CCA in the late evenings, all roads should be well-lit around the schools.",22,103,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00103

These days, the issue of road safety for children has become complicated by the distractions posed by mobile devices, such as music players and handphones. With reduced awareness of their surroundings, they may cross roads at the wrong time or fail to notice the impending danger in time. Harsh penalties, to a certain extent, have a deterrent effect on motorists, but pedestrians, too, have a role to play in personal safety. Local traffic laws dictate that pedestrians have the right of way, but this right of way will not bring a fatality back to life.",23,104,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00104

2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Before the introduction of the Minimum Sum Scheme in 1987, turning 55 of age is an exciting day for many retiring workers. For low-wage workers, who find it hard to save on their meagre income, those CPF savings could be their only life savings after 30 to 40 years of hard work. I witnessed the excitement through the eyes of my father. Such excitement and anticipation no longer exist at age 55 for many Singaporeans today. We are living longer and the statutory retirement age has been raised to 62. The re-employment age will be raised from 65 to 67 over time and the CPF drawdown age will follow suit. CPF savings up to the Minimum Sum will be locked up, all in the hope of achieving retirement adequacy.",2,109,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00109

2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I am sure we have met residents who were caught by the change in the Minimum Sum at our MPS. While it is prudent to adjust the Minimum Sum every year to beat inflation, the way to achieving it should not rest solely with the members because the CPF scheme is a highly regulated instrument. At this moment, the only way for most Singaporean workers to meet any revised Minimum Sum is basically to work longer and harder and nothing else.",6,113,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00113
2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The goal of the CPF Minimum Sum Scheme is to help local workers meet their basic retirement needs. The CPF Board acknowledged that there are many ways that they can help members achieve this goal, some of which are to live within one's means, to invest wisely, as well as to continue employment beyond age 55. To live within one's means is something the Government cannot legislate. To continue employment at age 55 has already been legislated. So, the missing component now is to invest wisely our CPF savings so that it can beat inflation. And that is a challenge as most CPF members may not have the technical knowledge and financial literacy to make an informed choice to grow their savings. This is something that the Government can certainly help. The former Minister for Manpower had promised to look into this as well.",7,114,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00114
2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Madam, while we want Singaporeans to work longer and harder for their retirement, it is also prudent to make our CPF savings work harder for us at the same time. The former Minister for Manpower said in 2007 that money placed in the Special, Medisave and Retirement Account (SMRA) should enjoy a higher rate of return than the Ordinary Account. The interest rate for SMRA is pegged at the yield of the 10-year Singapore Government Security plus 1%. This formula came into force on 1 January 2008. On the MOM website, it was stated that the Government will review the formula after five years, to finetune, if necessary.",8,115,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00115
2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"We have passed the five-year mark. The interest rate for our CPF savings had not changed for the past 15 years. A call by the President to enhance retirement adequacy is certainly more than timely. The formula, including that for the Ordinary Account, should be reviewed so that our workers will have enough to retire on in an ageing society. We need better SMRA returns so that our workers do not need to worry about not meeting the cohort Minimum Sum every year, and having nothing more than $5,000 or less to withdraw at age 55.",9,116,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00116
2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"This brings me to another issue – the drawdown age. The Workers' Party believes that the drawdown age should not be linked to the retirement age or re-employment age. I understand this issue has been debated in this House before. Whatever amount our workers can withdraw at age 55 will be the last they see of their CPF savings if they do not meet the Minimum Sum, until they reach the drawdown age. For workers born in 1954 or later, the drawdown age is 65. The drawdown age will be raised to 67 over time as the Government intends to link it to the re-employment age. By doing so, it will leave no room for Singaporeans to decide how they want to live their lives after age 55 or upon reaching the statutory minimum retirement age.",10,117,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00117
2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The President has said that the Government will strengthen safety nets to help the vulnerable and the elderly cope with the vicissitudes of life. Madam, the vicissitudes of a working life begin at age 55 when the Minimum Sum kicks in; at age 62, when retirement kicks in, and then a few years later when the drawdown age kicks in. For workers who do not have any other form of life savings, these CPF savings are the only safety nets. Delaying the CPF payout for these older workers may cause them undue anxiety and stress. Older workers on part-time employment may need such drawdowns to supplement their income. And not all older workers can work after age 55 or 62. As Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor had said on Tuesday, ""Sometimes the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak."" As for workers who do not have any other form of savings other than their CPF accounts, it spells trouble when ""the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak"".",11,118,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00118
2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The Minimum Sum Scheme, before CPF LIFE comes into existence, is designed to last for about 20 years or until a member's Retirement Account savings are depleted. The CPF LIFE, which is a better scheme, guarantees payout for life.",12,119,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00119
2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Madam, our life expectancy at birth is 82.5 years. At the drawdown age of 65 to 67, most members would probably enjoy 15.5 to 17.5 years of payout under CPF LIFE, which is about 13% to 23% shorter than the 20-year payout period under the old scheme. Although the payout under CPF LIFE is slightly more, can we not allow a member to draw down on his CPF LIFE a little earlier then?",13,120,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00120
2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"When we are young, we need a disciplined instrument like CPF to help us save for the future. But when we are old, we need a more flexible instrument to help us plan for the uncertainties of ageing. Issues like job security, health, mobility and so on cannot be taken for granted anymore. The current CPF LIFE plans do not offer older workers the flexibility to plan for an early or semi-retirement.",14,121,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00121
2014-05-29-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I call for a third CPF LIFE plan to address this issue. This plan will give a monthly payout with no bequest, similar to the old Life Income Plan but come with an early drawdown age of 60. This plan will give our workers a choice to go slow after age 60 for whatever reasons. Many pension schemes in OECD and Asia Pacific countries do offer such early age withdrawal. Madam, we are an ageing society. I urge the Government to look into providing more choices for older Singaporeans to access their CPF savings.",15,122,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00122

It has now dwindled to very few countries that have been able to maintain an NS of meaningful periods, or are capable of having a conscript military force. Many countries, particularly European countries, abolished their national service, some in response to the end of the Cold War to reap the peace dividend. Others have basically dismantled their NS system, not because their threats have disappeared but because public support waned. Members would know which countries these are, I do not have to name them specifically. But many of the leaders of these countries that have done so – given up their national service – lament privately that they know it was a mistake, they knew it was a mistake, but could not stop it.",10,132,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00132

It is double the current 45%. In other words, under the current system, 45% of pre-enlistees are called up after they finish their post-Secondary education, that is, ITE, Polytechnic, or ""A"" Levels.

The usual June and September intakes will be brought forward to May and August respectively, which are mainly Polytechnic graduates. Enlisting them earlier will mean that they will get into the workforce faster because they will complete it earlier. It also means that Polytechnic students, enlisted previously in September and bound for local Universities in August, will not need to be disrupted.

2014-05-29-T-010,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"First, I am glad that all Members here acknowledge that there has been progress. We are in a very different and much better position than 20 to 30 years ago, or even 10 years ago. Today, Malays are, indeed, in all Services of the SAF. Mr Pritam Singh shared how he personally witnessed Malay NSmen in a Combat Engineer Unit.",27,166,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00166
2014-05-29-T-010,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Defence Ministers before me have informed this House and I will do so again today  deployments of soldiers into vocations and their promotions are based on merit, capability and aptitude, as well as their commitment to the SAF and Singapore, regardless of race or religion. Over the years, Malays have made significant strides in skills and educational attainment. So, we now have Malays in all Services, whether as pilots in the Air Force, as Commandos, Combat Engineers, Artillery Men in the Army, and in the Navy, which hon Member Dr Intan Mokhtar shared about.",28,167,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00167
2014-05-29-T-010,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The SAF has been doing this quietly and progressively without fanfare, applying the principles of merit and aptitude. Which means that every Malay soldier who is posted to any vocation or unit got there on his own merit. Some of you may ask – because some of you have said there is a perception out there – so, why not do it with great publicity, greater fanfare?",29,168,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00168
2014-05-29-T-010,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There is a simple reason. I have many senior Malay commanders within the SAF. I meet them from time to time, not because they are Malays, but because I meet senior commanders. To take any actions based on race, even if it is an affirmative action, puts us onto the path of tokenism. None of us in this House wants this, or has called for it, nor do all my Malay soldiers and commanders who have earned their positions on sheer merit alone.",30,169,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00169
2014-05-29-T-010,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Many of these senior Malay commanders have been asked to profile themselves by the Malay community. The Malay community is proud of them. They want to erase some misconceptions, and they say, ""We want to profile you."" But the Malay commanders tell me, they replied, ""Why should I do so? Why should I push myself out? In the SAF, I have been promoted because of what I have accomplished and am capable of, not because I am Malay. As a commander, I lead my men, not Malay, Chinese or Indian men, but all my men. And I am not their Malay, Chinese or Indian commander but just their commander. No one purposely draws attention to my race within the SAF."" These Malay senior commanders want to keep it that way. I think these words from Malay senior commanders, spoken in private, are the most eloquent public statement of how far we have come, and how we must continue to progress.",31,170,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00170
2014-05-29-T-010,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We will continue to expand the opportunities for all Singaporeans, regardless of race and religion. This is one of the main recommendations of the Committee to Strengthen National Servicemen, to empower every Singaporean to do more through National Service. Singapore needs it and the SAF wants it.

2014-05-29-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Minister, just one quick clarification with regard to the Committee to Strengthen National Service's recommendations specifically on WSQ certification for skills picked up by National Servicemen in the military  can I ask the Minister what skills, beyond the leadership, will be covered by WSQ certification? That is the question.",1,173,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00173
2014-05-29-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Just a quick clarification on the Malay issue. I thank you for those remarks. I certainly look forward to more Malays serving in all SAF units.,2,174,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00174
2014-05-29-T-010,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We will have to work on the administrative aspects of the skills certification, or accreditation for skills that they pick up. First of all, we want to plug it into the national grid so that the skills accreditation is portable beyond NS. So, we have to reach a certain rigour and we have to comply with certain requirements that WSQ requires. WSQ does not differentiate whether it is skills picked up in NS or civilian life. It is a common standard. We will strive for it. I know that Mr Pritam Singh has talked about drivers. Certainly, that is one of the areas that we think will be useful.",1,175,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00175
2014-05-29-T-010,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I would say that the centre of gravity for the WSQ is, indeed, as I have said, for ITE and Polytechnic graduates. There are specific skillsets, for example, in the IT industry, engineering capacities because some of them can be trained for maintenance and logistics, which, again, are portable and directly, if you like, relevant to the next job that they apply to after NS.",2,176,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00176
2014-05-29-T-010,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There is also another set of leadership skills. We believe that the SAF trains good leaders. Leadership skills will be a premium that companies want – initiative, able to lead projects, able to do things, which is what you do in NS.",3,177,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00177
2014-05-29-T-010,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, I think the Committee members were excited by this. So is the SAF, and they are working in partnership with WDA and the economic agencies to see what value you can give. The idea is that we will add value to NS even as you do your NS.",4,178,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00178
2014-05-29-T-010,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for reaffirming this perception that there are no Malays in some sectors of the SAF as being not true. And I do look forward to the SAF opening up more opportunities for the Malays to play a more critical role in the SAF.",1,179,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00179
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to participate in this debate. I support the Motion of thanks to the President for his Speech.",1,180,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00180
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"I like the many initiatives and plans made by the various Ministries. There is a shift in our focus now to the social and people sectors, and we have, indeed, seen the gradual move in this direction over the last few years. But there are people out there who still feel that the Government is not doing enough. Why? Is it because of photographs and videos showing old people collecting cardboard, cans and selling tissue paper that go viral in social media?",2,181,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00181
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"These images do distort the reality because they do not tell the full story. Let me share a true story of a news vendor in Tampines who is wheelchair-bound. A couple of years ago, a resident asked me if the Government could buy this gentleman a motorised wheelchair because she sees him pushing, struggling with his wheelchair as he goes around in the estate. It was a very meaningful, very thoughtful, very kind suggestion, so I said, ""Yes. I would look into that."" I went to speak to this elderly man and I found out that he actually already has two motorised wheelchairs at home. He said that he had stopped using these motorised wheelchairs because as he does not exercise his arms, he became weaker and fell sick easily. Therefore, he switched back to the manual wheelchair. What I did was to ask the Town Council to make sure that the route he takes from his flat to the newspaper stall is barrier-free. I think that is what we can do to help him.",3,182,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00182
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Sometimes, we do jump to conclusions without knowing the full facts and we easily point the finger at the Government. Let us be fair and make the effort to find out more first.",4,183,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00183
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"In 2011, Madam, during the debate on the President's Address when he opened this Parliament, I gave suggestions on how Government communications could improve. I have to give the Government credit that over the last 2.5 years, we have seen good initiatives like ""Our Singapore Conversation"", Ministries and Government agencies are also getting more active on social media, and the recent Pioneer Generation Taskforce has been formed to focus on communications and reaching out to Singaporeans. I applaud all these efforts.",5,184,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00184
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"However, the Government can still do better in policymaking. In communications, we need content that is developed to be easily understood and easily consumed. There is just this much that messaging and packaging can do. Now, in Mandarin, Madam.",6,185,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00185
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The Pioneer Generation Package has been well-received by all, yet, most do not fully understand the Package. I have organised a few briefing sessions and have personally experienced how difficult it is to clearly explain the Package.",7,186,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00186
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) has just launched a series of briefing sessions in Mandarin and dialects and they have roped in several volunteers to help convey and explain the contents of the Package. We invited officers from MOF and MOH to train them, and the volunteers also felt that it was very complicated, even after listening to the officers' explanation.",8,187,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00187
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"In the end, we decided to simplify everything and just tell everyone that the Government will give the Pioneer Generation more help in terms of health insurance and subsidies, that their Medisave accounts will be automatically topped up every year. They do not have to worry when they seek treatment at Government hospitals and polyclinics, just pay as much as they can afford and seek help from social workers and their Members of Parliament when they cannot pay the bill. They should never believe that it is better to be dead than to be sick, and they should be reminded to seek treatment early.",9,188,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00188
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Recently, the Government announced that the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) card will provide more benefits than the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) blue and orange cards. However, maximum subsidy per visit and per year differs according to whether one has general illness, single chronic illness or multiple chronic illnesses. I fear that this will confuse the man-in-the-street again. I hope the Government will consider simplifying these measures.",10,189,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00189

2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"The intent of PGP has been widely lauded and it is evident that much thought and effort had been invested in its formulation to ensure its viability and coverage. My elderly residents, like Pioneers all over Singapore, are very appreciative that their contributions are being acknowledged in this tangible way. However, it did not take long before the feeling of confusion cast its shadow over their initial elation. I understand that some constituencies had even come up with quizzes and show-and-tell performances to explain the details. Unfortunately, a nationwide survey tells us that people are still not very clear about the PGP benefits. Based on feedback I received from younger residents, they, too, are unclear.",12,191,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00191
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"I wonder if we could have come up with a scheme which is easier for people to understand. The $9 billion package for 450,000 Pioneers will average out to be about $20,000 per recipient, and this is very substantial. If our Pioneer Singaporeans are allowed, for example, to access free treatment at C or B2 wards in Government hospitals, for, say, the common 15 chronic diseases, would this have probably amounted to about the same cost to the Government? But if we have done it in this way, a more blanket way, I think this would have given a great assurance to all Pioneer Singaporeans. It will be a lot easier to understand as well.",13,192,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00192
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"In the current package, we are providing for MediShield Life subsidies and Medisave top-ups, but the money spent and used, may not be used by our pioneer recipients if they maintain a healthy lifestyle and remain in good health and Medisave top-ups are eventually passed on to their descendants instead.",14,193,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00193
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Yes, there is a valid concern that free treatments could be abused, but as the Government hospitals act as gatekeepers to the necessary treatments, I believe this could be minimised and managed.",15,194,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00194
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"In countries like the US where the third party, a private sector health insurance company, pays for the care provided by the public sector, naturally, patients would want to maximise their entitlements, and pharmaceutical companies and hospitals would be very happy to guide them to maximise their own revenues. However, in countries in the Nordic region, for example, where the provider and payer of medical services are aligned in the public sector, medical expenditure is better contained than in the US. That is why during this year's Budget debate, I called for our new MediShield Life scheme to be administered and managed by the Government.",16,195,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00195

I deliberately did not want to check income slips, ask for Public Assistance or CHAS cards or even ICs. Yes, I cannot guarantee that these people who come for haircut are all low-income, but the fact is that we hold it at the void deck of the largest rental block in the constituency. With this, I am confident that I am making it convenient for those who need help to come by and, for most of the people, I am reaching the target audience. If someone else really makes the effort to be there just to get a basic trim with no washing, perming or colouring services and out in the open, I am happy to offer it. I do not want to be so calculative because I know that the needy also want to have some dignity in their lives, to be treated with dignity.

This is because all the different tiers, categories, terms and conditions to deal with the various permutations do not take into account the limited time and processing bandwidths that most people have at their disposal. As a result, the targeted population sometimes does not behave or respond as expected.",20,199,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00199
2014-05-29-T-010,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"A case in point would include our ERP system. The ERP charges alone would span various spreadsheets. In fact, I just checked out onemotoring.com.sg – it is 16 spreadsheets long. Probably, I would have to print it in A3 size in order to read it easily. The four categories of vehicles and all the different time zones, the different gantries – it makes a very complicated matrix.",21,200,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00200

There are so many rates involved. Every few months, we will adjust the rates to take into account changing road conditions or school holidays. Our civil servants are superb in finetuning in packets of five minutes, 30 minutes and 50 cents.",22,201,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00201

When this happens, the deterrent effect is lost; (ii) motorists are just so irritated every time they pass by or see an ERP gantry without knowing exactly what the ERP rate is. In this case, the resentment builds up. I am sure there are drivers like me who deliberately take a longer route to avoid a gantry but, in the end, just to find out that I have just saved 50 cents; probably I spend more paying for the petrol and the time cost.",23,202,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00202

I do not think it is because they cannot afford the few dollars to pay for the admission tickets to museums or pay for MRT fare. It is the ""free"" mentality, but it does not mean that free is no good. I am glad that the Government is slowly moving away from the ""No Free Lunch"" philosophy.",27,206,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00206

One group received the usual notice about paying taxes on time, while the other group included this information that nine out of 10 taxpayers in the UK filed their taxes on time. As a result, this second group had a higher percentage of compliance. This experiment demonstrated the power of social norms, the desire to conform. The power of social norms should not be under-estimated. It is clear that ""nudging"" people towards decisions is far better than imposing fines.",31,210,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00210

This is not only ineffective but an approach, and this approach will also contribute to moral deterioration. Once market norms replace social norms, it becomes very difficult and costly to revert to social norms.

Parents late in picking up children are first advised to come earlier. Subsequently, fines were imposed. I think this is practised in many of our childcare centres as well. Unfortunately, more parents turned up late because they had rationalised that since they were paying for additional hours of service, they are entitled to it. Their feelings of obligation towards the teachers disappeared. Even worse, when this childcare removed the fines, the number of late parents did not go down because it had been ""normalised"". The childcare centre should have tried harder to use the power of social norm to encourage parents not to be late. They could inform parents that most people, most parents pick up their children on time, and share with them the personal impact of their late-coming on their waiting children as well as the teachers, the caregivers.",35,214,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00214

Like many other Singaporeans at his time, he used to take public buses to school. While he was travelling on the public bus and admiring the private cars zooming past him, he asked himself when he would be able to drive a car one day. Fast forward 30 years. Today, when he drives his son to his school in his BMW, his son asked him, ""Daddy, when would you bring me to take a bus?""

2014-05-29-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Before I elaborate, I would like to applaud the effort of MOE for re-emphasising the importance of values in our education system. MOE stresses the inculcation of value thinking through the Values in Action programme. At the same time, MOE also encourages overseas study trips to develop in our students an international awareness and interest in cultures and issues concerning the world beyond Singapore. To this end, I understand that more than 100,000 students have the opportunity to go for overseas field trips organised by schools yearly.",13,259,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00259
2014-05-29-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Maybe we can marry the two concepts together, that is, learning through values in action during overseas trips. I would like to propose that MOE organise more field trips to some less developed rural areas of our neighbouring countries, where our students get the opportunities to help their less privileged counterparts through activities like conducting English lessons, teaching IT skills, setting up computer laboratories, building a library and so on. Some schools are already organising such trips for selected students as part of their learning journeys. Students who signed up or are selected for such trips may already have a higher propensity to help others and are more willing to go through hardship.",14,260,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00260
2014-05-29-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I am proposing that MOE organise more field trips of this nature and extend this experience to all students. After overcoming the initial operational and logistical challenges, I hope MOE would eventually make it mandatory for all students to spend a stint of one to two weeks doing community service in some rural villages of our neighbouring countries. MOE could schedule each cohort of students to participate in these trips when the students are in Secondary 3 or 4. There are three main benefits of such overseas field trips.",15,261,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00261
2014-05-29-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Firstly, the students would learn to appreciate what it is like to live in an environment with limited modern amenities. No air-con, no potable tap water, no proper roads. Instead of city lights, the students would enjoy a beautiful sky full of stars. Instead of air-conditioned system, the students would enjoy the fresh morning dew. Instead of morning traffic noise, the students would enjoy the sound of singing birds. After going through the relatively tough field trip, the students will, hopefully, appreciate the infrastructure in Singapore better.",16,262,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00262
2014-05-29-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Secondly, the field trip could serve the purpose of character building and inculcation of the values we would like to observe in our youths, such as empathy, resilience, resourcefulness and so on. Moreover, it could help to foster close friendship ties among the students and hone their interpersonal skills, especially when many students choose to communicate through social media rather than direct human contact nowadays.",17,263,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00263
2014-05-29-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Thirdly, the constant flow of students participating in such field trips would help to ensure the continuity of help rendered to the villages over time, which makes such effort more sustainable and meaningful. The effort also helps to generate goodwill with our neighbouring countries.",18,264,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00264
2014-05-29-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"When I broached this proposal to different groups of people, there is a general agreement on the benefits of the field trips. But I also receive some objections. For example, one parent's immediate response was, ""What if my child falls sick? Who will be responsible?"" Another teacher said, ""Wow! This means that teachers also have to suffer with the students and stay at those places with harsh conditions! Susah!"" One Secondary 4 student remarked, ""Going to a third world country? What a waste of time!""",19,265,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00265
2014-05-29-T-010,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Such responses are not unexpected. In fact, they reinforce the benefits of sending the entire cohort of our students for such field trips. Over time, just like National Service, I hope parents and teachers will see the value of such trips when the students return from the trip more mature and sensible. I am confident that such compulsory service-learning field trips will help our youths appreciate Singapore's success better, reduce the sense of entitlement and inculcate the value of service to others. It will be money well-spent. It will generate a wind of gratitude. It will help us cherish the pioneering spirit that ""built the Singapore we see today"" and to ""pledge ourselves anew to build a better, brighter Singapore"".

The boy recognised his footsteps and asked  ""Were you the one who changed my sign this morning? What did you write?"" The man said, ""I only wrote the truth. I said what you said but in a different way."" Same same but different. What he had written was  ""Today is a beautiful day and I cannot see it.""

Singapore's life expectancy is at the very top when compared with the rest of the world. Our average life expectancy at birth stood at 82 years in 2011, making it a joint fourth with Italy and just behind Japan in Asia.

Our seniors would be idling around for a good 18 to 20 years. This is a potent recipe for mental and chronic illnesses. While staying employed will help build their retirement savings, it is also very much about self-worth, dignity and productive ageing.

There are those who ask whether the CPF should, apart from providing for retirement adequacy, also be looking at housing adequacy. We believe that it is an important component and this forms part of that pillar.",8,381,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00381
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The other one is with regard to healthcare. We have talked about it in terms of Medisave, Medifund, MediShield and of course MediShield Life. And this is particularly important. The Pioneer Generation Package is something that we have been working on for a long time. The details will be coming out. We wanted to make sure that we can provide the level of assurance for our Pioneer Generation but, at the same time, make sure that it is affordable. It is something that we can sustain and that do not burden the next generation because we know from demographics, apart from the fact that we are going to live longer, we are also going to have a smaller tax-paying base. And that is our children's generation.",9,382,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00382

So, we need to make sure that healthcare is provided for. Why again do I raise this? Because CPF plays a part, as through the CPF system, we are also looking out for the healthcare needs of the people.",10,383,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00383
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Of course, lastly, in terms of retirement adequacy, we have got a couple of components in terms of how adequate it is. There are three parts. One is wages. That is important in terms of opportunities, jobs, wages in terms of your ability to upgrade, your ability to draw better wages, increasing the productivity. And the competitiveness of your country is important, so that not only do you have jobs available, you are also able to command better wages over time. That helps boost your accumulation for retirement.",11,384,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00384
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"An important component of that is Workfare, which is something we top up, particularly for the lower income groups. This is important. Workfare top-ups and other top-ups periodically are added on especially for the lower income and also for other Singaporeans.",12,385,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00385
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Along with this is to create a climate where jobs are available and there is also an intensity of jobs where as Prime Minister had mentioned, there is the ability to work longer. Now, raising the retirement age is not about forcing people to work longer. If you do not want to work longer, you can actually stop working any time that you wish to. But the fact of the matter is that we are living longer, we are staying healthier and many people actually find working as part of active ageing. Allowing people to continue to work longer is an important part. The intensity of work, the length or period of work is an important part in terms of helping you accumulate funds for your retirement needs.",13,386,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00386
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Tied to the intensity of work is also making sure that jobs are always available. We want to minimise unemployment. Not only do you have job opportunities, good wages over time, the length or period of work, you also want to make sure as often as possible, you do have work available. How do you create an environment where jobs are readily available for people? How do we keep Singaporeans relevant? Through training, retraining and, of course, job matching through some of the efforts that we put in through e2i, WDA and so on.",14,387,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00387
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The third component is with regard to returns. Several Members have talked about this. I think it is a fair concern – whether our returns are adequate. All of us here would like more than 2.5%, 4% and plus 1% on $60,000. All of us would prefer that. But where would it come from? How do we fund it?",15,388,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00388

Many members of the public outside of the House have also raised the issue of CPF interest rates and returns. Some have asked if the CPF interest rates should be higher in order to withstand inflation. That is a fair consideration. Meanwhile, others have advocated for higher returns, perhaps taking on more risk with CPF monies. But is that something we want to do?",16,389,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00389
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We all know that with higher returns come higher risks.

You can always smoothen it out, but that would always affect returns ultimately.",17,390,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00390
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The long and short of it is whatever that we are providing today – 2.5%, 4%, the plus 1% extra interest on the first $60,000 in every member's account – these are rates that are far higher than the equivalent rates provided by similar products out in the market today. Be that as it may, as the Prime Minister had mentioned and as the President had highlighted in his Address, this is an area that we are looking at – to make sure that we enhance CPF LIFE.",18,391,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00391
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"CPF LIFE is a system where you can provide payouts for the rest of your life. You do not have to worry about having payouts run out. But how do you enhance that? That is important and that is something that we are looking at. We have been working on that together with the Pioneer Generation Package for some time and when the details are ready, as the Prime Minister mentioned, probably closer to National Day Rally. That is the timeframe we are looking at in terms of announcing some of the details, in terms of how we are going to enhance this.",19,392,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00392
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Mr Png Eng Huat highlighted this point. He cited the example of his father, how he was looking forward with excitement in his eyes to turning 55. I can understand that, but I think that excitement in the eyes would turn into a look of horror if we do not make adjustments because life expectancy is increasing. If we kept to what it was and we are going to live longer, and many of us have also acknowledged it is not easy to plan for the long term, to make sure that whatever savings you have will sustain for the long term, it would turn into a look of horror when you realise that your monies are beginning to run out.",20,393,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00393
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We think it is important, from a dignity perspective, that individuals are able to provide for themselves as best as they can, which is why it is important for us to make sure that as you work longer, as you accumulate more, as you try to enhance the returns, you are also able to then provide for yourself through your payouts. But the more you draw out earlier, what it means is that the payouts would correspondingly reduce. The more we allow spending on housing, it would correspondingly mean less accumulated savings in your CPF Accounts and your payouts correspondingly would be smaller. That would create a strain.",21,394,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00394
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"As acknowledged by many, including Mr Png, in terms of investments, it is not easy. If there are people who can assure us that they can get high returns with low risk, do let me know, I would like to be their friend. Many of us would like to be their friends. There are many people who believe that they can get high returns but it does not happen in real life. That is the reality that we face.",22,395,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00395
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The key thing is that we are adapting to the situation because life expectancy is increasing. As a point of clarification, Mr Png Eng Huat is correct to say that our current life expectancy is 82.5 years. But what the actuarial experts are looking at is also cohort life expectancy, that is, life expectancy going forward. This is going to increase. And that is an issue that many people are concerned with. As the cohort life expectancy increases, how do we deal with that? That is why CPF LIFE kicks in. More importantly, how do we make sure CPF LIFE is a viable and an attractive option to ensure we provide that level of adequacy with peace of mind?",23,396,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00396
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"In conclusion, I would like to add that the CPF system remains a valid system. It is not a perfect system. There are trade-offs. Obviously, those who believe that you should have full flexibility in using it, the CPF does not afford that, and for good reason. Because ultimately, the CPF allows us a peace of mind as you do have a constant, regular stream of income at the point of retirement, and to ensure that that continues, rather than depending on somebody else or the state.",24,397,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00397
2014-05-29-T-010,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"But if you allow monies to be extracted early and prematurely, there will be concerns. This is not about shifting risk to the people. This is about shifting risk to our children's generation. The responsible thing to do – may not always be the most popular – but the responsible thing to do is to take into consideration these fundamental changes that are facing our society, facing many societies in the world, and to grapple with them head-on.",25,398,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00398

That is the intent of the enhancements that we intend to make with CPF LIFE. That is also the purpose of why we are strengthening healthcare and the way we are doing it. It is why we are continuing to ensure that housing remains an option for people, not only just in terms of the access to housing but at the later stage of their lives, should they need, they will have means to rent out their house or rooms, and whether they want to downgrade, Lease Buyback, the Silver Housing Bonus or other measures that we are now presently looking at to enhance that as an option, should you need to use that as a means to enhance your retirement adequacy.",26,399,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00399

If we get it right, we will be a diverse, plural society where mutual respect is built around a Singaporean identity that is strongly felt, but at ease with herself. If we get it wrong, we may become a brittle nation of closed-minded individuals divided along real or imaginary social fault lines, where an uneasy semblance of peace has to be enforced by interventionist security agencies. The Government has a major role to play in mitigating those risks while making the most of the opportunities. I have two points to make in this regard.",3,403,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00403

2014-05-29-T-010,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Madam, we should distinguish between complicated problems and complex issues. Complex social, economic and political issues are not the same as, say, complicated mathematical problems. Unlike problem sums, there is no clear right or wrong answer to complex issues. As Mr Baey Yam Keng has pointed out, we have learnt, for instance, that Singapore's declining fertility rate is a multi-faceted and complex issue that Baby Bonuses alone could not address. The passage of time changes the nature of complex issues, which can neither be resolved easily nor settled in perpetuity. They can only be managed poorly or well. Often, they are issues the Government alone cannot resolve.",5,405,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00405

2014-05-29-T-010,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"That being said, I also acknowledge that it is equally important to build our capacity as a people to participate well and constructively in debate. We need the means and tools to engage and think – philosophically, culturally, politically and so on – the means to look at and make sense of a complex world through different lenses. This capacity needs to be developed from young. Through education, it is vital that our students are able to hone their faculties for critical thinking and empathy, so that they learn from a young age, how to question, dialogue and understand that there is no one right answer in a complex issue.",8,408,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00408

In the long term, however, society is given the opportunity to consider all sides of the argument, to learn to agree to disagree where necessary, and to listen to each other.

In contrast, other civil society organisations, like advocacy groups that lobby for policy reform or legislative changes that may not be closely aligned with the state tend to be viewed as problematic and not only do not receive state funding, but are constrained by restrictive laws or financial controls that limit fundraising.",14,414,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00414

Both create circumstances or situations found in the real world, but under artificial, laboratory-like conditions, so that we can examine that world all the more closely. Through scenes, dialogues and monologues in a drama, for instance, the audience has a chance to peek into the inner lives of characters – their doubts and struggles – and recognise them as their own. What is Hamlet doing when he asks, ""To be or not to be?"" He is debating with himself about the value of life. What are the characters of Kuo Pao Kun, Haresh Sharma or Eleanor Wong doing on the Singapore stage?

Avoiding ""sensitive"" topics or steering clear of ""out-of-bound"" markers does not mean we have moved any closer to understanding an issue or each other's differences. In fact, censoring or restricting films, plays or online sites that seek to examine a complex issue in our society simply because some might find the framing of the issue objectionable is tantamount to cutting off the space for constructive civic discourse to take place and has a chilling effect far beyond the immediate circumstances of the case.",17,417,2014-05-29-T-010-S-00417

The MTL curriculum is thus differentiated to cater to the needs of students with different starting points and MTL ability.,1,483,2014-05-29-T-017-S-00483
2014-05-29-T-017,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Students are given exemption from taking MTL only under exceptional circumstances. There are two broad categories of students who can be given exemption  (a) those who join or rejoin the school system mid-stream without prior learning of the MTL; and (b) those with certified medical condition that would adversely affect their ability to cope with MTL. The top three medical conditions for which MTL exemptions have been granted are dyslexia, autism spectrum disorder and ADHD.",2,484,2014-05-29-T-017-S-00484
2014-05-29-T-017,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"MOE started to process applications for MTL exemptions electronically in 2005. The 2005 P1 cohort was thus the first cohort for which we can track exemption cases all the way from P1 to their PSLE year in 2010. From the 2010 PSLE cohort to the 2013 PSLE cohort, the proportion of students exempted from taking MTL has remained stable, at about 3.5% of each cohort.",3,485,2014-05-29-T-017-S-00485
