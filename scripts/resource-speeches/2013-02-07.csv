2013-02-07-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"asked  the Acting Minister for Social and Family Development if there are plans to set up more services, such as respite services, residential homes and day activity centres for the moderately to severely disabled adults in Singapore.",1,1,2013-02-07-T-001-S-00001
2013-02-07-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mdm Speaker, many parents and families who have adult members with moderate to severe disabilities are concerned about the availability of care services. This is especially so when many of them are living longer and may outlive their care-givers. We also share and empathise with these concerns. Under the Enabling Masterplan 2012-2016, my Ministry will invest more resources and work with Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) to enhance such services.",1,2,2013-02-07-T-001-S-00002
2013-02-07-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"We will develop more community-based facilities. Today, we have 19 Day Activity Centres (DACs) which provide 950 places for the adult disabled who need full-day care. We will increase this to 29 centres offering about 1,450 places by 2020. The first five new centres will be up within the next five years. We will also enhance the skills set of the Day Activity Centre staff so that they are better able to care for adults with moderate to severe disabilities.",2,3,2013-02-07-T-001-S-00003
2013-02-07-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"This year, we also intend to pilot a new drop-in disability programme at existing community facilities. This will cater to those who do not require full-day care but social interaction and recreational activities for a few hours a day, a few times a week. We aim to start four pilots at different locations this year.",3,4,2013-02-07-T-001-S-00004
2013-02-07-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"We will continue to support families who care for adult members with disability at home. We have introduced home care services which cover areas, such as personal hygiene and meals. About 600 families with disabled members have also benefited from the monthly $95 Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) Levy Concession, while another 320 families with disabled members received the monthly $120 Foreign Domestic Worker Grant introduced last October. Family members or FDWs may also tap on the Caregiver Training Grant to pick up skills in care for the disabled.",4,5,2013-02-07-T-001-S-00005
2013-02-07-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Despite our effort to support home and community-based care, there will be some adults with disabilities who need residential care. The demand will rise given the longer lifespan of persons with disabilities. Today, we have eight Adult Disability Homes which provide 830 places. We plan to provide an additional 2,400 residential places by the year 2020. To complement the Adult Disability Homes, we also intend to work with VWOs to pilot group homes for persons with disabilities who are relatively independent. If successful, this will widen the residential options available.",5,6,2013-02-07-T-001-S-00006
2013-02-07-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Some of our efforts are in its nascent phase, while others are more established services being expanded. We will invest the necessary resources but we will need time to implement the plans. More importantly, we will need the support of the families and the community so that all the efforts put together will give parents and care-givers the peace of mind and enable our disabled to be well cared for.",6,7,2013-02-07-T-001-S-00007
2013-02-07-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Acting Minister for the comprehensive reply. I wanted to ask if the Acting Minister would be able to, either now or later, provide a forecast of the requirements of this particular target group, which comprises mainly people who have more severe disabilities and who need special handling. There are three main needs in terms of setting up facilities  one is physical facilities; the second is funding, especially for the more severe cases; and the third – which is the largest bottleneck – is the manpower. Many local people do not want this kind of jobs because it is difficult and they have other choices, in terms of careers. I would like to ask the Acting Minister to provide, firstly, the forecast. Secondly, some segmented needs profile so that those who really need help but help is not easily gotten – like for this group with very severe disabilities – that we can use together to formulate some solutions. The VWOs are willing to work on them. We just need to be able to work with the Ministry on this.",1,8,2013-02-07-T-001-S-00008
2013-02-07-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Ms Denise Phua for her supplementary questions and suggestions. Yes, certainly, we will provide the forecast and we are working closely with the VWOs to meet some of these needs. The Member is right. The physical infrastructure is probably the easier part to meet. But more importantly is the funding of the programmes; and, most importantly, is the manpower requirement.",1,9,2013-02-07-T-001-S-00009
2013-02-07-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For the funding of the programmes, we are open to working with more VWOs to pilot different sorts of programmes for different tiers of needs. As for manpower, as what we have described in other sectors, we are also looking at new sources of manpower to see whether we can open up more opportunities for people to contribute part-time services to this community. At the same time, in order to ensure that our manpower supply is robust, we would also need to explore alternative sources of manpower beyond the traditional countries that we have been working with.",2,10,2013-02-07-T-001-S-00010
2013-02-07-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked  the Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the Ministry has plans to increase the age and income limit under the Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE) Scheme to help divorced women who have custody of their children; (b) whether the support for divorcees in the areas of housing costs and childcare will be improved; and (c) how does the Ministry ensure that divorcees receive maintenance fees in a timely manner.,1,11,2013-02-07-T-002-S-00011

2013-02-07-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mdm Speaker, the Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE) scheme helps young, less-educated and lower-income couples who choose to keep their families small. The scheme does not specifically focus on divorced mothers. But following a review in 2009, divorced mothers can apply to join the scheme. As at September 2012, 301 divorced mothers were on the scheme, including some who had marginally missed the eligibility criteria but were admitted on a case-by-case basis. MSF is reviewing the HOPE scheme now and we note Dr Lee's various suggestions.",1,13,2013-02-07-T-002-S-00013
2013-02-07-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Divorcees with young children may sometimes find it difficult to afford alternative housing after they have sold their matrimonial flat. For those in financial hardship, HDB will look into ways to help them. For example, HDB can help them source for a flat that they can afford, and consider incorporating the resale levy into the price of the flat or provide loans to reduce the upfront cost. For those who need temporary accommodation, HDB can offer them interim housing under the Interim Rental Housing Scheme, while they rebuild their savings or work out more permanent housing arrangements. For those who cannot afford home ownership, HDB can consider offering them a public rental flat.",2,14,2013-02-07-T-002-S-00014
2013-02-07-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"In the area of childcare, single parents are eligible for infant and childcare subsidies. In addition, ComCare childcare subsidies provide further financial assistance to families earning a household income of $3,500 or below, or a per capita income of up to $875. MSF regularly reviews the support provided for childcare and infant care, especially for lower and middle income families.",3,15,2013-02-07-T-002-S-00015
2013-02-07-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Receiving timely payment of maintenance is an issue some divorcees face. Under the Women's Charter, the Court can make an attachment of earnings order when it makes an order for maintenance. An attachment of earnings order will deduct the maintenance amount directly from the payer's salary and transfer it to the maintenance recipient. This will help to secure payment of the maintenance.",4,16,2013-02-07-T-002-S-00016
2013-02-07-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"In 2011, MSF amended the Women's Charter to increase the range of sanctions against maintenance defaulters. With the amendments, the Court can order a defaulter to post a bank guarantee against future defaults, perform community service or attend financial counselling. This is in addition to the Court being able to make a garnishee order, levy a fine or sentencing the defaulter to imprisonment. Complainants are also empowered to report the maintenance debt to a designated credit bureau.",5,17,2013-02-07-T-002-S-00017
2013-02-07-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I have one supplementary question. I have a resident who is a divorcee with three children, and she has joint custody of the children with her ex-husband. She confided in me that her ex-husband always defaults on the maintenance payment. Worse still, he always makes applications to the Family Court, and brings along his lawyer. My resident is working, and so she has to apply for leave to attend the hearings. It is very stressful to deal with three children, no maintenance payment, and still face the need to apply for leave to attend the court hearings. Otherwise, she said she would be issued with warrants of arrest. In a situation like this, how else can the Ministry help a divorcee in such a dire situation?",1,18,2013-02-07-T-002-S-00018
2013-02-07-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, I do not have all the details of this particular case, but MSF will be most happy to extend help to this resident of Dr Lee's. If the Member can provide details, I will ask my staff to follow up to see how best we can provide the legal and financial help to the family.",1,19,2013-02-07-T-002-S-00019

2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Launched in April 2012, the Community Engagement Masterplan aims to bring the arts and culture closer to many more Singaporeans. We want to encourage Singaporeans to pursue their interests in the arts and culture, enrich their quality of life and strengthen their sense of heritage, and also their connection with the community. This is a long-term programme that requires strong support and participation from the community.",1,25,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00025
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As at 31 December 2012, an estimated $19 million has been expended under the Masterplan. Around 50% of these funds have gone towards establishing networks of staff and volunteers to engage residents and to work with them to tailor programmes of interest to the local community. These networks also disseminate information on activities, resources and facilities that are available, thereby enhancing interest in arts and culture in the community.",2,26,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00026
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Another 40% of the Community Engagement Masterplan funding has been used to support new programmes.

2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Other programmes supported under the Masterplan include the over 450 Arts and Culture 101 programmes held at NLB's public libraries, and other targeted programmes for youths, seniors and working adults, which aim to increase appreciation for arts and culture.",4,28,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00028
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Many of these programmes have involved professional arts practitioners, creating new platforms for professional artists to engage the community. To date, more than 140 artists and arts groups have participated in various platforms as performers, instructors and mentors.",5,29,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00029
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, NAC had a Silver Arts Platform which supported the literary publication Ceriph in their first community project ""10 X 10"". Basically, they paired 10 young writers with 10 senior citizens to collaborate on creative writing projects. NAC's ""Let's Connect"" networking sessions are another example, providing opportunities for community organisations and arts practitioners to collaborate.",6,30,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00030
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The remaining 10% of funding has gone towards the development and upgrading of facilities under the Community Engagement Masterplan. These include a number of new and enhanced heritage trails and the recently opened community museum at Taman Jurong. These developments have served as touchpoints to engage volunteers and other enthusiasts. Our Museum @ Taman Jurong alone involved the participation of more than 200 residents in the lead-up to its launch in January this year.,7,31,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00031
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides the more broad-based programmes rolled out in this initial phase, funding under the Community Engagement Masterplan will also support programmes to deepen engagement among new audiences.

2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To gauge the Masterplan's success, we monitor a range of indicators that are both quantitative and qualitative in nature. The quantitative measures include the number of programmes that are supported and the number of Singaporeans the programmes have reached out to. Some of the qualitative indicators include Singaporeans' perception of arts and culture, which are captured in NAC's biennial National Population Survey on the Arts. We also monitor the percentages of Singaporeans who agree that arts and culture have contributed towards a better quality of life, a greater sense of belonging, and a better understanding of people of different backgrounds and cultures.",9,33,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00033
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In addition to these indicators, our implementation agencies, such as NAC, NHB, PA and NLB, also have separate quantitative and qualitative indicators for their respective initiatives under the Masterplan. For example, NLB tracks whether there is a change in a person's interest in arts and culture after he has attended the NLB's Arts and Culture 101 programme; NAC tracks the impact of arts and culture on the well-being of beneficiaries for its programmes in the social sector.",10,34,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00034
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Collectively, all of these efforts contribute towards the long-term outcomes set out in our Arts and Culture Strategic Review (ACSR). One of the outcomes that is envisaged in the Arts and Culture Strategic Review is that by 2025, we hope that at least four out of every five Singaporeans will attend at least one arts and culture event, and at least half of all Singaporeans will participate actively in the arts.",11,35,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00035
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As the lead agency for the Community Engagement Masterplan, MCCY will monitor and account for our overall progress to ensure that the investment in the Community Engagement Masterplan translates to real benefits for Singaporeans.

2013-02-07-T-003,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Acting Minister for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. I am really glad to hear that the agencies implementing the Masterplan initiatives are developing their own basket of quantitative and qualitative success indicators. I think a biennial survey might be a little too general and does not necessarily just capture the impact of the community initiatives. I am wondering if those outcomes will be made public. My second question is related to manpower, and whether or not the cultural officers that have been deployed or are hired to work at the CC level have been given the requisite training, as well as the exposure to the arts.",1,37,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00037
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. The first question, on whether the indicators at the agency-level can be published, we would do so to the extent possible. We do want to make sure that each agency tracks the programmes that it is initiating and it is implementing, and be accountable for these programmes. When we do a review of the overall effort, then we will see whether there is scope to fine-tune our programmes at that stage. So, the indicators are, indeed, helpful for that purpose and, to the extent possible, we would encourage the agencies to put out these indicators.",1,38,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00038
2013-02-07-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The second question, on manpower and training, it is something that we would like to do. We are doing this, and I think we can do better. We have had a group of staff and volunteers, as I mentioned in my reply earlier, who are deployed within the community. That is manpower that is needed in order to help link up the community with arts groups, arts professionals, to help understand better what the community needs are. I appreciate the point that these officers also need to be trained in arts at some level, so that they understand not only the needs of the community, but also have a good understanding of what is happening in the arts space, who are the professionals in the arts, sectors that they can link up with. We have done some of that kind of exposure and training, but I think we can do more. And we will continue to do so.",2,39,2013-02-07-T-003-S-00039

We have set up a new scheme, Medifund Junior, from 1 March 2013 to provide additional financial assistance for healthcare bills incurred by children. Children with congenital conditions diagnosed before 1 March 2013 will benefit from this additional assistance under Medifund Junior, if their families face difficulties with their healthcare bills. Medifund Junior will help us to more effectively target families with higher needs and provide added assurance to Singaporeans.",2,42,2013-02-07-T-004-S-00042
2013-02-07-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. Basic healthcare insurance for every person, not just for children, regardless of ability or health condition, is an essential good that is needed, as the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has said, in times of hospitalisation, or even for treatment such as chemotherapy, and so forth. I am really grateful to MOH and the Government for responding to the public's cry for – especially in the special needs community – covering children who are born on or after 1 March 2013 with congenital or pre-existing conditions. So, thank you for that, I want to register that.",1,43,2013-02-07-T-004-S-00043
2013-02-07-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"However, there is still this group who are in the transition who happened to be missed out and excluded from this wonderful package. Say what we want, they are still excluded, and they are not provided with what is basic healthcare insurance. We have always heard that if we include them, then a higher premium will be incurred. But I think this is something that is more than economics. It is a basic good or essential good that should be provided to every citizen, I ask the Ministry to look at this again. It is not an easy topic. I feel that the Medifund Junior that is set up will help some but not cover every child, and does not include every Singaporean that needs to be covered. This is only a transitional period. I ask for a special look into this.",2,44,2013-02-07-T-004-S-00044
2013-02-07-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"I also ask the Ministry to make public what is Medifund Junior. What is the definition of ""children""? Does it mean that if they are older than 12, they are not covered? What is really covered? What kind of criteria are we looking at? And what happens to the rest of the Singaporean children, youths and adults who are not covered currently? And also, to look urgently into situations under which they need to go beyond the usual MediShield coverage ceiling; to see if there are best practices in other countries and other societies that we can look into so that they can be safe from that kind of hardship that they will experience if they do not have money to treat their congenital or pre-existing illnesses. So, I look forward to MOH's help in this. It is not easy. I thank you very much for the M&P Package. I really think that we might as well complete it and include this group that is not included.",3,45,2013-02-07-T-004-S-00045

That is the precise intention of what we are doing. In fact, we are going to roll out the Medifund Junior, which is for children aged below 18. Essentially, with Medifund Junior, we would cover our children. No Singaporean children will be deprived of medical attention and treatment, even if they do not have the financial resources. But we will look into the Member's views. To me, it is an on-going journey that we are looking at to see how we can further enhance our healthcare system.",1,46,2013-02-07-T-004-S-00046

I would like to know how long that on-going journey will be, because I am advocating not just for those below 18, but there are many, for example, adults with Down Syndrome where it is not transparent if they are covered or not under the current scheme. I understand they are not covered in many instances. Many insurers are not interested in covering them, but I think the State should look into this and see how we can come up with some solutions on this. For some families, it may be co-sharing. For others who are from the lower income families, the State might want to take over the insurance. I would just like to ask for some timeline on this.",1,47,2013-02-07-T-004-S-00047

We have increased it from $80 million to $100 million. Like I said earlier, essentially, we will look into the needs of Singaporeans, regardless of their conditions. We want to ensure that no Singaporeans are deprived of medical services. Again, I thank the Member for her views.

I am heartened to hear that LTA is open to this. I just want to register that LTA has been very responsive in my area whenever we make requests. As you know, there are some areas in Singapore which have predominantly elderly people, such as where I serve, Kampong Glam; or where Dr Lily Neo serves, Kreta Ayer; and even Mr Sam Tan's Redhill area. I hope that some priority will be given to these areas so that the old people would not have to wait until it is too late to enjoy some of these elderly-proof facilities.",1,54,2013-02-07-T-005-S-00054

Exhibitions at our museums are now presented with stronger curatorial focus, a broader scope, running for a longer duration and accompanied by a broader array of accompanying programmes, such as performances, public lectures, curator tours, artist-led workshops and activities for children.

2013-02-07-T-006,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker, and I thank the Acting Minister for his reply. It is great that SAM is trying to be a little more focused in terms of its theme on Southeast Asian and Asian art. However, I still feel that the broader Singaporean public that does not have easy access to high quality international artworks should still continue to have some kind of access, and that helps raise our cultural literacy and appreciation for the arts in general. I know it is a lot more expensive to bring in the ""blockbusters"", but I hope that the Ministry will consider other museums who can take over this role. These ""blockbusters"" bring a large number of Singaporeans who may not ordinarily go into the museum to see world-quality art.",1,62,2013-02-07-T-006-S-00062
2013-02-07-T-006,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"My second question is regarding marketing and publicity. We can see from the numbers that both SAM and the National Museum had a drop in changing exhibits in the last two years. However, the National Museum had an increase of about 10% visitorship whereas SAM had a decrease of about 15%. It could have been that a few ""blockbuster"" exhibitions at the National Museum still managed to attract a high number of visitors despite the fact that they had fewer exhibitions. It also has to do with the quality of exhibitions, as well as the outreach and marketing efforts. So, I would like to ask the Ministry to ensure that SAM, as well as the smaller museums, have enough of a budget to reach out to a wider number of Singaporeans.",2,63,2013-02-07-T-006-S-00063

I share all her points because, indeed, I think we need to do more to reach out to Singaporeans and to make quality art accessible to them. It is not just through the museums. We had the Singapore Art Week recently, which was a very good show, and offerings of art exhibitions at the Art Stage, Gillman Barracks, SAM, amongst others. And we had a good turn-out. But we can still do more in terms of getting people to come to these exhibitions, reaching out to school kids, students, community groups to organise tours in these various platforms, in which people can enjoy and appreciate art. We hope to do more of that, not just for SAM but the broader platforms or other museums, as the Member has suggested, other art exhibitions that could be done at the Gillman Barracks, at the Art Stage, or at the other Art Fests in Singapore.",1,65,2013-02-07-T-006-S-00065

That is something we hope to do in the Ministry, and working with our partner agencies as well.",2,66,2013-02-07-T-006-S-00066

2013-02-07-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the point about quality of exhibitions and making the balance between local/regional art and international ""blockbusters"", the museums are mindful of this. They do want to have more focused exhibitions, providing platforms for local and regional artists. I think it is commendable that they are doing that. We do need to promote that space a lot more but they cannot just do it exclusively. They will need to find a balance between the kinds of exhibitions that they have – some will be international ""blockbusters"", and there will still be a continuation of these exhibitions – whether at SAM or the National Museum. But, overall, we do also want to have a strong focus on developing local and regional artists, and also strengthening the cultural and heritage connections that the museums can provide for Singaporeans.",4,68,2013-02-07-T-006-S-00068

2013-02-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Mdm Speaker, when this White Paper was released, like most Members of this House, I received a lot of feedback from Singaporeans from all walks of life. Many were concerned about the headline population projections, wondering if it could be achieved and, more importantly, at what cost. Others opined that the exact figures were unimportant as long as Singaporeans could continue to enjoy a good standard of living. There were even a few bullish ones who remarked that perhaps the figures were even too conservative and a larger population was needed.",1,81,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00081
2013-02-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"I believe that everyone holds an opinion on this, and that is the first remarkable aspect of this White Paper that I would like to highlight, that it has encouraged all Singaporeans to really begin thinking about the directions that our country should take, and the preparations that are needed to achieve this. I hope that all Singaporeans will take the time to read through the White Paper in an open and considered manner, and realise that, far from being a means to an end, it actually represents a means to a beginning.",2,82,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00082
2013-02-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"This White Paper presents a bold vision. But we are all heartened to note that, at its very foundation, if you read it closely, is its aim to, first and foremost, affirm the position of Singaporeans as the focus of this vision, no matter what future challenges await us. And I am sure that no one would disagree with this, so I am more than a little disturbed that Members from the other side of the House have not come to fully appreciate this point but have chosen instead to concentrate on numbers rather than truly providing constructive and realistic ideas about how we can improve the quality of our lives while moderating population expansion, because this is exactly what this White Paper is really about.",3,83,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00083
2013-02-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"As it has already been established, and contrary to what some detractors had tried to portray, the Government is not trying to target any population target or any population composition. But we are trying to impress on Singaporeans the gravity of the challenges facing us, of which population expansion is just one key consideration. There has been no attempt, I am glad to note, to sugarcoat the stark realities that face us, although there are concrete proposals as to how to deal with them. In fact, it reflects a recalibration to acknowledge lower growth expectations and pushes for lower population growth rates and foreigner influx, rather than the other way around. If we are able to assure a good quality of life and the continued survival of our city state in 2030, 2040 and beyond with a population of – well, we can paint any figure, for example, 5.5 million, 5.7 million, 5.8 million, 6 million, 6.5 million, then so be it, because nowhere in the White Paper does it say that there is any pre-ordained economic growth or population figure to be pursued at all costs.",4,84,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00084
2013-02-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"If you would allow me the indulgence to perhaps draw a parallel from my profession as a doctor, as a responsible doctor. What I see most days are patients, for example, who come into my clinic with pain in the knee. This is typically an elderly patient, and the most common diagnosis is that of arthritis of the knee. Arthritis of the knee merely means that the cartilage or the tissues in the knee are wearing out. So, my duty as a doctor is to fully explain the diagnosis to the patient, tell him what the problem is and also what the problem may be like in the future. Sometimes, the patient does not want to know, but I may also have a duty of care to explain the facts to the care-givers, the children and so on. Once all this is done, then my next job is to explain all the choices that this patient can make to deal with his particular problem. In many cases, I may have to prescribe or recommend surgery. But, of course, there are trade-offs with this. Surgery is an uncomfortable process, at least in the beginning. The care-givers must give special attention to deal with this period of hospitalisation or aftercare. But the final expectation is that the patient would have a good quality of life once he or she is fully recovered. However, an equally valid proposition or choice for this patient is to say, ""Well, I would be prepared to accept that, as I grow older, I will be less mobile, I may have a little bit more pain and be less active in my life."" This is an equally valid proposition and deals away with the pains of surgery. But, as a doctor, I would also have an opinion as to what I think would be the best treatment for this patient because if I have my patient's best interest at heart, then what I would want for this patient is to allow this ""Ah Mah"" or ""Ah Pek"" to go back to the way he or she was before he or she had this condition. And this is what a responsible doctor has to do.",5,85,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00085
2013-02-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Similarly, what a responsible government has to do is to make all the facts available to the population and not sugarcoat any of it and begin a debate as to the choices and the alternatives that are in front of us. This is not an end of any policy that has a defined end point. This is the start of the debate. There are alternatives, choices and trade-offs, and I think it is well and good that we begin to discuss this right now rather than trying to defer the issue or to ""kick the can down the road"", as has been mentioned previously.",6,86,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00086

Certainly, in the near to mid term, to achieve the growth in citizen workforce without relying on non-citizens might very well mean that our children will need to enter the workforce at a younger age, and we may only be able to retire to enjoy our senior years at a much older age.

It was a big task, but Singaporeans believed in the call and we grew to be a nation to be proud of and which other nations envied. In recent more challenging times, the Government has still managed to maintain us on an even keel and we even prospered whilst many countries around us are in crisis, but relative deficiencies in keeping the infrastructure growth apace of population expansion has led to many expectations not being met.",18,98,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00098

This, to a large extent, should be above politics. Now, more than ever, as an adolescent nation striving towards greater maturity, our people need to be kept informed of our internal as well as external changes, possible scenarios, roadmaps to the future, their views and concerns must be collated, they must be sought in order to refine this plan and all the alternative trade-offs and not just any single plan presented to the voting public.

How did we go from fearing ageing and depopulation to having a potential population explosion? Where does this dependence on growing GDP through increased immigration end? If we continue the 1.4% total population growth projected for 2020-2030 in the White Paper beyond 2030, our population size will double every 50 years. This means it will hit 9.8 million in 2050 and 19.7 million by the end of the century. I hope the Government would reassure us that doubling our population every 50 years is a ""no-case scenario"".",2,111,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00111

Despite saying that we must ""moderate the future growth of the foreign workforce"" in the ESC report, we saw a growth of non-resident labour force of 6.3% from 2010 to 2011, and 7.4% the following year, and a total labour force growth of 3.2% and 3.9% respectively.",6,115,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00115

We should also slow down the intake of new naturalised citizens to 10,000-15,000 of new births.

So, what are the equivalent plans today? Because if you exit these firms, and, with them, the lower skilled foreign labour, you can bring in higher skilled foreign labour to fill the positions at higher VA companies coming in through EDB's attraction. So, why do we express great alarm today when some firms leave, when I think it should be naturally expected that some will do so and should do so?

Otherwise, we would just be in the company of only a handful of countries like Yemen, Somalia and Tonga with no minimum wage. Redistributing income to low-income earners is never the same as being able to earn a fair living wage in the first place.

Like the Government, we aim for the same stretch rate of productivity growth. But the Government's solution is contradictory. It tells businesses that they are addicted to cheap foreign workers and need to improve their productivity instead. Yet, the Government is proposing to use foreign workforce growth to boost the slowing economy. Would foreign workforce growth not suppress productivity growth?

Madam, this is a matter of national survival, and the Government is only weakly hoping with an ambiguous target with no specified timetable. Without a TFR recovery plan with clear targets, our birth rates are not going to go up. So, when 2030 arrives, what solution are we going to turn to? Immigration again?

Actually, this is not only my personal view. When Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean spoke on the first day of the debate, he said that if we can achieve our objective of creating a better life for Singaporeans, and the total population number is kept lower than 6.9 million, it is actually a good thing. So, we reiterated several times that 6.9 million is not our target but a projection for planning of infrastructure.",19,205,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00205
2013-02-07-T-007,Lim Swee Say,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Swee Say)","We must also understand that there are actually ways to continuously lower total population growth, if we can work together. For example, in terms of work distribution, just as Deputy Prime Minister Teo had mentioned, in future, two-thirds of the population will be professionals, one-third will be general workers. For general workers, a lot of jobs are positions that cannot attract Singaporeans, and wages are not good enough. In the past, the idea is that if you have a job that does not attract Singaporeans, then you should look for foreigners. Looking forward, our views have changed. For example, we can use technology and innovation, or robots. In the USA, the use of robots is widely encouraged to improve competitiveness. I believe that if we go in the same direction, we can also keep the total population numbers as low as possible. But as I said previously, we should not act in undue haste because it will not only hit businesses but also hurt workers.",20,206,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00206

It is a brave and bold move by Government to release this Paper which speaks about a larger population in the future, although crowding and congestion appear to be a significant grouse at the ground level today. The Paper is more like the bitter pill which is often not liked but presents the fact and remedy in the best interests of the person and future generations of Singaporeans. This forward planning is commendable and, in an effort as futuristic as this, there may be differences in approaches and attempts but the Paper needs to be seen with the perspective of an overall plan and in the best interests of all stakeholders in Singapore.",15,225,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00225
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"This was necessary as the Government aimed to meet the three objectives of this exercise – to strengthen the Singaporean Core in our society, to create more high-quality jobs enough for a more educated workforce and to ensure a high quality living environment here. However, there are parts of this Paper I do not agree with and I would like to share these thoughts and I hope they will be given due consideration.",16,226,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00226
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Keeping Singaporeans at the Core. The Marriage and Parenthood package will help Singaporeans marry and have children earlier. However, I believe it is not enough to get the desired effect of pushing our Total Fertility Rate (TFR) from the current rate of 1.2 to 1.4. Many of the initiatives in the package are encouraging but they are typically the incremental sort of measures that the Government has been trying for years now. Those have not yielded much result, and I feel these would be not effective as well. The problem is many of the measures in the package designed to help parents with the costs of starting a family are one-off measures that may alleviate some of these costs in the beginning of the journey of starting a family.",17,227,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00227

The brutal truth is that cost is high at all of these stages from buying simple things like milk powder and diapers to going to school and paying for tuition classes and so on. And this is provided the child is completely healthy, otherwise medical costs are an add-on. So, what they need is, in fact, help continuously along the way.",18,228,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00228
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"I feel that while economic growth and addressing the concerns of low fertility rate with the economic benefits may help to some extent, a large need will be to emphasise the family values and shifting the cultural importance away from the purely monetary measurement. Today, fertility indexes remain healthy mainly in societies where binding force is beyond wealth and where success measures are beyond money. A change in Singapore may be possible considering the horizon of time for discussions is 17 years up to 2030 and not a short term. More thoughts on making this shift than presently mentioned in the White Paper will be welcomed.",19,229,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00229
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Under the area that the Government could have done to help Singaporeans with respect to starting a family is where Singaporeans marry foreigners. I understand it is quite difficult now for foreign spouses to be given PRs and I think this should not be the case. In the past few years and even now when we give PRs to eligible foreign candidates, their wives are also extended PRs to help them settle down in Singapore. Then why should Singaporeans be made to face uncertainties and instability in their marriages just because they choose to marry a foreigner?",20,230,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00230
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"While Minister Grace Fu highlighted the other day that the Government understands this concern and agrees to help Singaporeans with such cases, it is important to have a timeframe to integrate these Singaporeans. At least, within a year upon their arrival in Singapore, we should give them PR status so that their early integration will only help them to be part of the workforce. I think such cases should be given priority so that these couples can get on with their lives with more certainty and contribute towards the TFR and strengthening the Singapore Core. Moreover, it is important in this whole exercise that Singaporeans are given priority and their sense of importance and belonging to the nation is not eroded. I feel that the White Paper can improve in this regard in placating Singaporeans and reassuring them that they have first priority in all matters, ensuring a vibrant and sustainable economy.",21,231,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00231
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Moving on, I would like to register my appreciation for the Government in attempting to create high-value jobs for Singaporeans and this will hopefully lead to a higher income and better quality of life for them, at least in terms of material needs. I am not entirely sure though if the approach of pushing businesses up the value-chain is the best approach to take.",22,232,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00232
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Firstly, moving up the value chain makes our industrial landscape here a narrower one. The further we move up the value chain, the narrower it is upwards, almost like a pyramid.

2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Also, as a SME operator myself, I understand the concerns of the business community in wanting to know and understand what timeframe the Government has in mind in getting companies to move up the value chain.",24,234,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00234
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"This, obviously, will take time and cannot be done instantaneously. But it seems that companies here are expected to do that soonest. Will the Government be helping companies making this shift with assistance schemes? Will there be Government help in creating opportunities for allowing businesses to move up the value-chain as the nature of their businesses otherwise may make it difficult for them to do so?",25,235,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00235
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"I also worry that moving up the value chain too quickly may lead to frictional or structural unemployment, especially if workers, probably older ones, are unable to train to fully make such a transition. This may dislodge the labour market and create a scenario where some segments of the population find themselves irrelevant to the demands of the industry.",26,236,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00236
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"While we speak of moving the economy up the value chain, it needs to be noted that more than 60% of the Singaporean workforce are employed by SMEs. Many of the economic activities at consumer level like retail and F&B remain an SME domain. These service sector jobs are labour-intensive, which require working in shifts, standing long hours while at work, including weekends and public holidays. Today, the young Singaporean is unwilling to accept these jobs and, as has been pointed out in the White Paper, aspire for PMET jobs. This is a key reason for foreign workers being hired by SMEs today and not the cost advantage, as is perceived commonly. If the SMEs are unable to hire people, they will cease to exist. By the way, this will hurt the very core of the Singaporean society which we are keen to protect.",27,237,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00237
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"As has been highlighted by SBF and the many chambers of commerce, the shortage of right talent and the associated imbalance in the labour market, in terms of costs, will force even larger companies, and not just SMEs, to operate outside of our eco-system, much to the detriment of the Singaporean Core. This is no longer a myth as newspapers have highlighted how foreign companies are willing to leave if this situation does not ease up. While there is no one silver bullet, I urge the Government to identify and isolate sectors where our Singaporean labour force can cope in terms of quantity and quality and selectively impose restrictions on hiring of foreign talents. An investor is likely to look at returns even if it is a Singaporean investor and, therefore, seek the right talent ultimately. Our blanket actions, I fear, may affect long-term investments from local businesses and foreign businesses alike across the economy. It may not be right to allow the entire economy to suffer for this reason.",28,238,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00238
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"As a retail business operator, I wish to voice out the difficulties we have been facing in the business over the past one year. The business is today constrained in terms of growth not because of investments or opportunity but because of insufficient labour to run the potential businesses. This is not only leading to loss of business opportunities but a compromise on service levels built with pains and the years of investments. The continuous tightening in policies for hiring foreigners as front liners at stores is straining the local workforce to the extent that locals do not want to work in this sector. That is why the idea put forward by some of my Members here in this House to keep foreign workforce growth rate at zero is one that will kill businesses here, whether local or foreign. The business community is already concerned by the tightening of the workforce as proposed by the White Paper. I cannot imagine anything tighter than that so I do not understand the merits of reducing it even further because doing so will inevitably result in loss of jobs, thus, ultimately, hurting Singaporeans.",29,239,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00239
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Further, a lot of this economic strategy is built on assumptions, such as that productivity may help fuel growth, in the context of this slower workforce growth, for the rest of this decade. It is a risk to hinge so much on productivity growth, which we all know is more difficult to come than we may plan or hope for. For instance, if our actual productivity numbers fall short of the projected numbers, are we going to sit back and allow the economic growth to suffer? Or will we at an appropriate time implement a review to see how the productivity growth is faring and then maybe decide if we want to revise some of these strategies? If so, what is a likely time such a review may be considered?",30,240,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00240
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"I think allowing the workforce growth to reduce may create undesirable consequences. The war for talent is already quite heated, and this would obviously worsen that. If this puts an upward pressure on wages, then I fear that we may artificially increase wages here. If companies decide to pass these high costs on to consumers, then we may have created a wage-cost inflationary pressure. With slower growth and inflation increasing, we may run the risk of having stagflation.",31,241,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00241
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"So, it is necessary to see that we do not squeeze the workforce growth as much as it hurts the economy, businesses and jobs. Perhaps, this can be done more gradually.",32,242,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00242
2013-02-07-T-007,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"In essence, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill but hope that the Government will consider keeping Singaporeans at the core of their population strategy, and not just economically, but also socially so that they do not feel alienated.

Today, Singaporeans are confronted with a stark population projection again. The Population White Paper, unlike the 40- to 50-year concept plan, has projected our population to hit 6.5 million to 6.9 million over a period of just 18 years, and the percentage of the Singaporean Core would be almost half.",6,249,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00249

His predecessor has this to add when he raised the long-term population projection to 6.5 million; the ex-Minister said in 2007 that ""the Government has decided that 6.5 million is a realistic number for the next 40 to 50 years.

The White Paper is not maintaining a strong Singaporean Core; it is shrinking it further.

If we were to compute the population density for public housing alone, we will understand how dense it is to live in Singapore today.",12,255,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00255
2013-02-07-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"In 2010, it was reported that 82% of our resident population, or 3.1 million, live in HDB flats. The 2010 figure on land use shows that public housing took up only 7% of the total land mass or about 5,000 hectares in Singapore. This gives us a staggering actual population density of 62,000 people per sq km for public housing alone. We even beat the densest district in Hong Kong which comes in at slightly above 55,000 per sq km. When this Government allocates only 7% of the land to accommodate 82% of the resident population, how do you think Singaporeans whom the White Paper addresses as the core of our society and the heart of our nation would feel at the prospect of living with 6.9 million people by 2030? How liveable can Singapore be going forward with more and more people?",13,256,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00256
2013-02-07-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"According to Forbes report in 2012, the most stressful city in the United States is also among the biggest and the densest. How is this Government going to convince our young people to stay and procreate when commuting to work every day is such a stressful thing to do?",14,257,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00257
2013-02-07-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I read with deep concern that this Government intends to optimise our land, limited land space, just to accommodate 6.9 million people by building more housing units in mature estates, wherever pockets of housing land it can find. Mdm Speaker, the Government sees these pockets of land as opportunities but many of us see these as essential green spaces to keep the sanity of living in a concrete jungle in check. If every piece of green space in a mature estate is measured by a number or value, then we have missed the meaning of quality of life.",15,258,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00258

Geneva is nestled in a region of beautiful lakes, views and mountains for citizens to escape to, away from the stress of high density urban living. We do not have the luxury of such open spaces. So, we should preserve whatever pockets of greenery out there, especially in mature estates, so as to mitigate the stress of living in one of the densest cities in the world.",16,259,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00259

Because when yesterday's problems are not fixed, the vision for a better tomorrow is a hard sell. It is a ""no sell"". The irony of the Mercer survey is that Singapore is ranked No 1 in infrastructure, but 25th in quality of living. What that means to me in plain English is that we are way too overcrowded here. This Government may have put its heart and soul into building a dynamic economy for people to come from all over the world to make money here, but has it done the same to building our nation?",18,261,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00261

But no matter what numbers we project, the Government of the day has to subject itself to do the will of the people who elected it.

AWARE did a study in 2004, where they concluded that it was the quality of life, adequate support structures, including flexi-work, gender equality and a less pressurised education system, that will help the TFR. As for housing, studies have shown a strong correlation between housing prices and fertility (lagging about two years) and a very weak correlation between baby bonuses and fertility.

In 2030, the difference in the Singapore citizen population, or the Singapore Core as we call it, was just 3%. However, if we allowed net migration, there would be a more important effect in increasing our overall population numbers, especially for the young and working age group. Hence, we need to ask the question of how much effort do we need to throw behind raising the TFR and, ultimately, will it be that effective? Or should we be looking at better integration of the new migrants?",16,279,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00279

For the immigrants who do not have to serve NS, can we offer them an alternative like volunteering in local community services or registered VWOs? Our current integration programme consists of a tour, a session with grassroots leaders, an online tutorial and quiz and a citizenship ceremony. Can we not add on local community service programmes to better ingrain them to our local communities so that they, too, can serve our nation and become more ""Singaporean""?",17,280,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00280

We want to be able to tell Xue Ni and other Singaporeans like her, and we want to be able to look them in the eye and say, ""Yes, the world is your oyster, but Singapore, too, will have exciting opportunities for you to realise your dreams, and that we are doing everything we can to make it happen."" And we want to reassure her parents and many other parents like hers that, indeed, we will create the opportunities for their children so that they will have reason and purpose, and continue to be able to make Singapore their home.",44,353,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00353

2013-02-07-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"First of all, I would like to thank the Minister for reminding this House of my concern which I had expressed in a past debate here. I would like to assure this House and Singaporeans that the Workers' Party's proposal has taken in all the concerns that I expressed in this House and I was very careful that we do not want to rock the economy. The proposal is a very careful, considered, calibrated approach. We are looking at a GDP growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. It is not an extreme model, as what the Minister has suggested. And remember we still have the current workforce – foreign workers and all that. We are not saying, ""Let's get rid of all the foreign workers."" We are not saying that. If we are saying that, then it is fair that the Minister said we are being extreme. With the current workforce that we have, to grow our resident workforce, we probably could still view the workforce we need for expansion. And if the foreign workers' work permits or their contracts have expired and they go back, we can still get back the same number, but we keep the total size of the population and the workforce.",2,358,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00358
2013-02-07-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"The Minister was concerned. I understand the businesses are complaining. I also receive the same complaint saying, ""We cannot get work permit approval."" And this is not a new problem. It has been a problem that businesses have a big appetite for cheap foreign labour. And the consequence of that is that Singaporean workers' wages are not going up because of the foreign labour. Do we want to continue with that? Do we want to say, ""Look, yes, we need more foreign labour because the businesses are asking for it.""",3,359,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00359
2013-02-07-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"And I know, and I can understand the Government is facing tremendous pressure from big business MNCs and also the concern whether we will miss the boat. But I recall reading somewhere that during the early days of Independence, there was a company that came to Singapore to invest and wanted to put their tank, diesel tank or whatever tank, on Singapore soil and threatened that if they could not, they would withdraw. Then Dr Goh Keng Swee said, ""Stand firm on that.""",4,360,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00360
2013-02-07-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"I think we need the PAP leaders to stand firm to the MNCs and say, ""Look, this is our way and we think we should do that for the betterment of Singapore."" Because if you do not do that, then what is the consequence? What is the trade-off? We will reach 6.9 million, and then come 2030, what? You still need more foreign labour in order to continue to grow the economy to provide good quality of life for Singaporeans. Same argument. Then the roadmap? Ten million in 2050?",5,361,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00361

2013-02-07-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Yes, Madam. Now, I refer to another statement that the Minister made. He said that the companies will be asking, if we are going down the road, ""Why Singapore?"" and ""Not Singapore."" But I want to caution the Government that, yes, the company may ask you, ""Why Singapore?"", because this is your labour policy and ""Why should we invest here? Why should we come here?"" But how about Singaporeans? Will you not worry that, one day, Singaporeans may ask you the same question  ""Why should I stay here? Why should I continue to be in Singapore?""",1,363,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00363

2013-02-07-T-007,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Yes, Madam, the last clarification. The Minister talked about perseverance in productivity. I do agree. But I also urge the Government to persevere in investing in our own population. Increase our TFR. Otherwise, one day, there will be a Singapore without Singaporeans.",1,365,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00365
2013-02-07-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, in my speech earlier, I made the point about the fear for the workers in terms of over-tightening of the labour force. If I may have your permission to clarify the point in my speech earlier, Mdm Speaker?",1,366,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00366

2013-02-07-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, I spent quite a few years with the EDB. In the EDB, we had to go round the world to attract investments. I can speak from my experience that some of the challenges we face are these. Take, for example, the case of the electronics sector. For a long time, Singapore was a capital for disk drives. We did very well. In fact, we had something like 10,000 or 20,000 workers working in the disk drive sector. But way before the disk drive sector went into consolidation, the EDB had to look ahead. If we did not look ahead, eventually by the time the disk drive sector exited from Singapore, then we would not have had new investments continue to flow in.",1,368,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00368
2013-02-07-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"At that point in time, EDB had to look ahead. The next stage of developments for the electronics sector was wafer fabrication. When we went into wafer fabrication investment, investments of the wafer fabrication companies were well sought after in the world. Each investment was worth about US$1 billion. However, each project required 1,000 persons to operate the plant – 500 engineers or PMEs; 500 are operators.",2,369,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00369
2013-02-07-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"At that point in time, I still remember very clearly, that the first significant project we were competing with Korea for, actually decided to go to Malaysia. Finally, we went to the Japanese companies and tried to bring a Japanese project to Singapore. The Japanese management basically asked a very simple question. They said, ""Look, we have the money to put in the investment. We know Singapore has committed to provide the land, water, and so on. But they said, ""Look, the most important factor is manpower because once you go to higher value-added, knowledge-based economy, it is all about manpower."" At the same time, they also reminded us that it is not possible to operate the new state-of-the-art wafer fabrication plant with 100% PMEs because you need 50% who are the operators.",3,370,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00370
2013-02-07-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In other words, the investor was asking the EDB, ""Are you able to promise us a total package? Which means I must be able to find the 1,000 engineers, technicians and production operators. Otherwise, I cannot operate the plant."" We said, ""Sure, we are prepared to do so."" But we had a problem because, given the tight labour market in Singapore, 80% of the engineers, the PMEs are Singaporeans. Twenty percent, we told them, ""Fine. If you cannot find enough engineers in Singapore, you can take 20% from other countries, but 80% are Singaporeans."" But for operators, it was the other way round because we just could not find enough operators for them. In the case of operators, actually, it was more than half were foreign operators and less than half were Singaporeans.",4,371,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00371
2013-02-07-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, my point here is this. If we had insisted to this wafer fabrication company and said, ""Look, you can come to Singapore, bring —",5,372,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00372

2013-02-07-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Yes. I am trying to clarify this point that if we had told the investor, the wafer fabrication company, ""You can only hire the operators and wait until the disk drive companies ""close shop"", when they will release the manpower, the operators, then you hire these operators,"" because we have a policy of zero net increase in foreign workers.",1,374,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00374
2013-02-07-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, if this was the case, the projects would not have come to Singapore. My point here is that as a Labour Movement, we are very concerned that, yes, we want restructuring. But with restructuring, it cannot be like a restructuring cliff-jump. Today from disk drive to wafer fabrication tomorrow, overnight. It would not happen. You have to go through a process of transition. Therefore, I think it is an important point that I wish to clarify.",2,375,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00375

To me, it says that he understands the gravity of the situation, and he is trying to explain a quite different point of view. I want to first assure him that this Government has not in any way lost its resolve to make tough decisions. In fact, if you look at our track record, we do it and we do not shirk away from it.",1,377,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00377

We are talking about millions of jobs, and hundreds of thousands of companies. I think it warrants caution and a certain level of measure in the way we do things. You stated that your GDP projections are not extreme. Indeed, I agree with you. In fact, your GDP projections are not the issue. That is arithmetic. What is extreme is your proposal as a policy on foreign manpower addition to this economy for this decade. That is what is extreme. That is what is going to cause the kind of issues I talked about, and that is what is going to cause the wrong signals to go out and potentially cause irreparable damage to our reputation, and our ability to then turn on the tap in the next decade, as the Workers' Party thinks we can.

2013-02-07-T-007,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The basis of the White Paper is driven by many current pressures, one of which is our declining TFR. The enhancements to the Marriage and Parenthood (M&P) Package seem to be a small step in the right direction. Credit must be given where it is due. The young couples I have interacted with recently generally applaud the M&P Package. In particular, the enhanced package has gone one step further in providing greater safeguards to working pregnant women, in addition to monetary and housing incentives. The emphasis on a paternal role in parenting recognises the equal burden that each parent should bear.",4,388,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00388

It remains to be seen how this will impact TFR. My fear is that we may overly monetise our children, that again they are seen through the lens of digits, that each person has a price. It is certainly not the intention, but, unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult for people to think otherwise, which is why the idea of a Singapore Core is an important one to define.",8,392,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00392

They wondered why this Government is planning to increase the population by another 1.6 million when the infrastructure is already not enough to cater to their needs, and many Singaporeans are still waiting for their homes. Singaporeans feel that Singapore is already too crowded; the transport network is inadequate and they have to compete with foreigners for jobs. In this context, they do not look forward to the prospect of a larger population, even if that only means that it will happen in 17 years' time. The plans announced by MOT and MND to ramp up our transport network, build more parks, homes, waterways to provide a high quality environment were simply washed over in people's mind.",1,411,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00411
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The Government has repeatedly stressed that the figure is not a target. It is used to plan the infrastructure required. If we search our hearts and conscience, we will know that this is not a rash Government. For decades, it is the same Government that shared the country's problems openly with the people. This way, it hopes to rally the people to find solutions to the difficulties that we faced together. The Government's objective is to sketch out a possible scenario for Singapore in 2030. This is laudable. They took the bull by the horns and are upfront with the people. They could have taken the easy way out and not bring this subject up till after the next GE, or better still, two GEs from now when the transportation network is improved and flats are built. But typical of this Government who has always been open with the people about the country's problems, it has taken this bold move to share frankly with Singaporeans the key challenges that Singapore is facing.",2,412,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00412
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, this White Paper is not about growing our population to 6.5 million or 6.9 million, or even 5.9 million. Neither is it about the GDP growth per se. It is about Singaporeans' future. It is about how we can provide enough well paid jobs to the people, especially our younger generation, most of whom will have a diploma or a degree, and what we must do to provide for the needs of an ageing population. The demographic change in the next 17 years is a serious challenge that will confront us, regardless of the political party in power. The debate on the White Paper and the feedback by the public will inform our choices as a society, and help us to understand the long term consequences and implications of these hard choices. There will be trade-offs, either today or we pay in the future.",3,413,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00413
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Being a small country, Singapore will always have population issues. Let us cast our mind back to the last decade. The context of the population issues that confronted Singapore 10 years ago was very different from what we face today. In the year 2000, we were just recovering from the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998. In 2003, just as we were recovering from 9/11 and the Jemaah Islamiyah arrests, SARS struck. Singapore economy grew by 1.1% and unemployment hit a high of 4%. COE prices were on the down trend. Some Members will also recall the debate in Parliament about how to clear the 10,000 units of unsold HDB flats. It was not that long ago.",4,414,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00414
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Two thousand and four marked the beginning of a boom cycle to 2008. Companies were investing and employing again. Yet, it was not without challenges and risks. Global interest in China as a source of cheap labour and low-cost manufacturing base picked up. The US economy was vibrant and talk of renaissance in Europe was common. Now we know what is happening. There were good opportunities then for Singapore, and if taken, would benefit all Singaporeans. Any Government would find it hard to pass that over. We had to make sure Singapore continues to build and to attract foreign companies and investments so that they can create jobs for Singaporeans. Unemployment fell to 3.4% and to 3.1% the following year. We were quickly running out of the labour pool to keep companies interested in coming to Singapore. We were concerned about competition so we decided to let in more transient foreign workers and grant permanent residence and citizenships to more people. Even with the increase in foreigners and PRs, our unemployment dropped to 2.1% in 2007. By 2008, people were feeling the strain seeing too many foreigners among them and they were also worried about their future as a result of the Global Financial Crisis.",5,415,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00415
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Madam, with the benefit of hindsight, we were a bit too liberal then in bringing in too many foreign transient workers, and granting PR. By January 2009, the Government responded by tightening the immigration criteria to take in less PRs and new citizens. Could we have built up more infrastructure and housing then, when barely a few years before that, our prospects were not very bright? Again, with hindsight, many think that the Government should. Admittedly, the Government was caught off-footed.",6,416,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00416

The future looked very bleak in January 2009 when the Government brought forward the Budget, and rolled out the Resilience Package to help Singaporeans and companies ride out the crisis. There were still some job losses but, overall, unemployment of Singaporeans was held steady and some transient foreign workers left Singapore. I saw all these developments first hand. I was in the ring as the Minister for Home Affairs and, later, as the Minister in charge of Population.",7,417,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00417

Building new HDB flats, private homes, new schools and new hospitals takes more than two years. Constructing a new MRT line or a major highway takes more than six years, sometimes more. This lag in infrastructure investment thus contributed to the feeling of congestion, overcrowding and competition from transient foreign workers as Singaporeans feel today.",8,418,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00418
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The White Paper before this House today is the effort made by the Government to prevent a repeat of history. The point is that it is not whether the population size should be 5.9 million or 6.9 million. It is about how we keep our economy growing at a sustainable rate, create better jobs for Singaporeans and provide care and support to our elders who have contributed much to our country. These objectives are the key responsibilities of the Government. But they must have the people's support. We must build a consensus on these objectives in order for the Government to act for the benefit of Singaporeans. For the White Paper and the Land Use Plan sketched out by the Government, it should start investing in infrastructure today so that Singapore has the capacity to respond to the challenges and the needs of tomorrow. These are fundamental shifts, as explained by Deputy Prime Minister Teo and Minister Khaw Boon Wan recently.",9,419,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00419
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The White Paper makes assumptions on the projected rate of economic growth, Singaporean population growth, numbers of new PRs and new citizens to add and how many transient workers for a certain level of economic activity to serve the interests of Singaporeans. Transient foreign workers are required when we cannot find enough of our own Singaporeans to fill the jobs. But Madam, in the light of global uncertainties and rapid changes, the jury is still out as to whether we can achieve our goals. We cannot take economic growth for granted.",10,420,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00420
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, allow me to say a bit more on the issue of our demography. We have heard the old adage ""Demography is destiny"". A shrinking workforce impacts job creation and tax collection. An ageing population stresses government budgets and healthcare. Without economic growth, the Government cannot generate tax dollars and budget surpluses to invest in the next generation while meeting the social security needs of the present generation. Failure to find the right balance will cause economic uncertainty. Developed economies like Japan and Europe are grappling with this right now. The threat looms large for other growth economies even the likes of China. Being used to having economic growth for decades except for short periods, Singaporeans cannot imagine what it will be like to have zero or very low economic growth for long periods. But we do not need to look far to find an example in Japan. Its growth has been anaemic for the last two decades and people's lives have not gotten better. Its society is ageing rapidly, and since a few years ago, deaths are more than newborns. Let us hope that Europe is not heading the way that Japan did in the last twenty years, or it will affect us.",11,421,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00421
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Singapore's ageing society is not spared if we do not grow. We are ageing faster than many developed economies. There will be a tipping point where a shrinking workforce will not generate sufficient tax dollars to meet the needs of the growing elderly population. This will be exacerbated by companies that leave for other markets if our workforce is not sufficient to meet their needs. Singapore does not have unlimited past reserves to plug the gaps. The White Paper sets out the Government's thinking on how to keep Singapore going and continue the Singapore Story. We have to have some growth in order to take care of Singaporeans. And we need workforce growth to do that, apart from productivity.",12,422,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00422
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),There are three ways to grow the workforce  (a) encourage procreation; (b) increase labour participation rate; and (c) bring in transient foreign workers with the right profiles.,13,423,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00423
2013-02-07-T-007,Wong Kan Seng,Mr Wong Kan Seng (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The first is a highly personal choice and takes time. The second is a long running Government effort, and our participation rate is high by global standards. I am sure the Government will continue to find innovative ways to encourage Singaporeans to work as long as possible, and attract men and women back to the workforce. But no matter what measures are taken, the number of Singaporeans aged 65 years and above will increase. That will mean a bigger budget for social expenditure and health care. With fewer Singaporeans working, tax revenue will also be less. This leaves the last option and we now know that pacing the influx of transient foreign workers is important and the Government is calibrating the inflow. There are no silver bullets.",14,424,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00424

That our young adults can realise their aspirations, find good jobs and take care of their families. That our elderly can spend their twilight years in comfort and in dignity.

If you look back into the history of China, you know that at the points of its weakness, it has been the subject of invasion and bullying by other countries. On the other hand, at the highpoints of its history, there is a strong direct correlation to its economic strength, and that economic strength reinforces and is reinforced by its political and military standing and capabilities.",2,427,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00427

Japan went into the Second World War and was defeated. But then it mounted a spirited and disciplined economic recovery after the Second World War and it became the second biggest economy in the world after the US. Then in the 1990s, it went into recession deflation and was caught there for two decades. Its economy stagnated and eventually it was overtaken by China in the year 2010 as the second biggest economy in the world, after holding that position for 42 years. Meanwhile, Japan's population aged very quickly – low birth rate and, as a result, the population began shrinking. In 2012, 1.2 million Japanese babies were born but 1.24 million Japanese died. The Japanese government projected that by 2060, the country's population will shrink by another 30% from today's 128 million, and go down to 87 million. Those aged 65 and above will increase from today's 14.8% to 40% of that population. That country battles deflation, which saw the value of assets held by the Japanese people decline.

There is also no link between the payout made and what the money is used for. Hence, the payout may or may not be for better eldercare. But in other countries, such as in the US, there are alternative arrangements on how this kind of insurance can be arranged and with better linkages to ageing well, as well as eldercare, with the payout.

At the same time, we expect employers to do more to demonstrate merit-based employment practices, and for unions and Government to remain alert to toxic discriminatory environments and corporate practices, and for all three parties to commit to continual and resolute action against discrimination and to embrace good and innovative fair employment practices to attract and retain talent in an increasingly tight labour market.",31,456,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00456

Initially, I thought he was going to talk to me about traffic congestion, housing prices and about the cost of living. Because these are, indeed, some of the issues that our residents are very concerned about. However, what he said was, ""With more and more people on this island, what are we all going to eat?""

I pondered over it because I felt that it was very interesting. Indeed, what are we all going eat? The term for population in Mandarin is made up of the characters ""human"" and ""mouth"", and every human being needs to eat. With more people on this island, we are going to have more demand for services like education, healthcare, transport, recreation, social security and so on. Unlike other countries, we cannot live off the land, whether in the form of agriculture, mining or petroleum. However, we each have a pair of hands, and we can work. With our hands, we can work for others, create wealth and support ourselves. We can pay taxes and when these taxes are redistributed to help others, we can contribute to society. So, manpower also involves the concept of ""production"" and ""contribution"".",4,461,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00461

Hence, the Population White Paper is essentially a Manpower White Paper. If there are too many people, then there will be congestion and overcrowding. As a Member of Parliament, 70% to 80% of the daily problems that I deal with are related to transport congestion. Resolving these problems includes meeting with the other committees and also meeting with our residents to get their feedback. Of course, I also hope that the transport problems faced by my residents can be resolved immediately, so that residents can commute to and from work and school smoothly.

Our reserves are used to safeguard the value of the Singapore dollar, it is the main tool used against imported inflation. We are all concerned about the rising cost of living.

The idea is to retain and up-skill our educators. Under this scheme, if an early childhood educator completes certain professional development courses, she will be eligible for the Professional Development Incentive Award. For example, the award can pay somewhere between $6,000 and $10,000 at the end of three years if the person remains in the sector. The amount should be co-shared by the Government and operator. I tested this idea with some operators and teachers and many welcome such a move, of course, with some variations.",12,496,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00496

This will also give parents the assurance that their children will receive quality education. Beyond pre-school, I think it is also important that we address the types of opportunities our next generation, like my nieces and nephews, will have by the year 2030. For example, recently, I was at the kindergarten and I saw children there experimenting with various art forms and performing at concerts. Having piqued their interest at a young age, many may eventually venture into one of these areas as their choice profession.",13,497,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00497

Whilst their friends opt to study in colleges and Polytechnics, they choose to study in an arts or design institution. Our mindset must change, and not perceive those who take a non-academic route differently.

Recently, I observed a Singaporean carpenter at work while he was at my kitchen to repair a cabinet. It was apparent to me that he was very skilful with his tools and could do the job very quickly.

But a passerby said they were being silly to walk when they could just ride on the mule, so the father climbed onto the mule. After a while, another passerby came along and said the father was not loving, for he himself rode on the mule while his son had to walk, so father and son decided to switch places.

My Taiwanese union friends tell me that the so-called thought leaders and politicians need only use their mouth to talk, and it is enough to cause the government to change policies constantly. What is worrying is that populist opinion is constantly swayed, just like the moon on the first day and the 15th day of the lunar calendar, it is never the same. If we look at these views separately, they seem to make sense, but when put together, they contradict each other and nothing can be achieved. When political leaders are swayed by populist opinion, ultimately, it is the people who will suffer. If this goes on, it is no surprise that everyone is worried about the future of Taiwan. Will Singapore become like Taiwan? I am more optimistic, I believe we will not. As another Taiwan friend pointed out, we have a very pragmatic government and a united people.

This group is a strong alternative source of manpower, although it is a smaller pool but it is useful for us to help them. Today, as Long-Term Social Visit Pass holders, these individuals are not subject to the same controls, such as the foreign worker quota, as the typical Work Permit holder, making them attractive to employers who, after having invested in productivity, still find themselves requiring foreign augmentation.

It is essential that we also improve the social safety net in Singapore and boost support to organisations such as all our Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs). For example, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) has been having to do more with less, as, over the years, donations have decreased while demand rises. Ironically, the changes in subsidy policies mean more patients now qualify for full subsidies – a good thing for them, but an added financial demand on NKF. So, it is important for us to note that in Singapore, today, for example, about 750 Singaporeans are diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure every year. With these added demands and more patients, the organisation is seeing an increasing operating deficit and rising shortfalls. I would urge the Government to look into such areas as well even as it seeks to grow the necessary physical infrastructure.

But that pulls in the opposite direction because we also want to reduce the presence of foreign manpower in Singapore. How do you reconcile that? We know that we have an ageing population, we need to restructure. So, what exactly does that mean? What shape and form of growth? It is not just the numbers, indeed, it is about the quality of growth. What should that shape look like to ensure that we have good quality, sustainable growth to provide for our people?",13,540,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00540

We all agree on that with a smaller labour force. But, yet, we need to improve TFR, we need to give time for couples to be on their own, work-life balance is important. Again, tensions, but this is real life. It is important to have a White Paper to pull things together so that there is an overarching framework and concept to plan forward. And we will evolve this plan with time.

But if we are able to achieve our desired outcome with less, it may well open up the possibility for us to tighten up more.

Unfortunately, it does not operate that way and we know that. So, do we grow when we can, as perhaps we tended to in the past because we do not take growth and opportunities for granted? Or do we take some risks and forgo this growth while trying to establish a more sustainable path? It is quite clear that where there are opportunities, we will have to turn our back on growth.

Because these businesses are owned by Singaporeans as well. SMEs, these are salt-of-the-Earth Singaporeans, who built up their businesses, provide employment for Singaporeans. Companies provide jobs for our people. I am both pro-worker and pro-business but, above all, I think we need to be pro-Singaporean and pro-Singapore.

In fact, during last year's Budget session, Mr Low and we had a long discussion on whether to have differentiated dependency ratios for sectors which are finding it difficult to recruit Singaporeans and to free up the space so they could have access to more foreign workers. My position, and it remains, is that those sectors which find it most difficult are those sectors which actually are demanding and pulling in more foreign workers. So we need to be disciplined and change that. But this position has changed. So it is a bit difficult to reconcile what their next step will be.

But I think we can do more. The various measures that we have put in place, we will continue to work on it. But labour force participation rate has limits. This is because, as with every country, we know that the labour force participation rates for the older workers, older Singaporeans, will be lower than the younger segment of the workforce. But our workforce is becoming older. There are fewer younger people in the workforce. This means that the labour force participation rate will decrease over time, but we will try as much as we can to improve it. But I think those are the dynamics.",41,568,2013-02-07-T-007-S-00568

So, we need to try, and the truth of the matter is that it is not just cash incentives, and I think we know that. It is a whole range of incentives. It is about work-life balance. It is about institutional changes. Incentives, schemes − we will continue to strengthen them. We know that education is a pressure. It gives Mr Heng Swee Keat no end every week in the Cabinet about how the education system should be, and we realise that actually we all have very different views as well.

Because this is a rainy day, we should boost our productivity effort. I agree that we should really work at productivity effort. We should perhaps put in more money, but this is not that rainy day. We should be careful dealing with our reserves, because when we talk about the ageing population, I think you can see the rainy days that might be ahead.

Which is why my colleague, Mr Vikram, mentioned the other day about how we run the Town Council. I think it is not being facetious, it is about how would we translate this into the real world, and in real terms. Every single person in the town council, professional or otherwise, should be entitled to such schemes. Ideally, I would say this  I am a big champion, I believe we work for too many hours. And I do want us to work fewer hours, and to strike that balance. Legislation – I am not sure if it is a solution to everything, but we will look at some of these, and we do welcome ideas from both sides of the House and from all Singaporeans.

And just to quote Mr Pritam Singh, he just said in the House as well, referring to the construction industry  ""They will have to make do with what they have and Singaporeans must accept a slower pace of construction as a result, which means they have to wait longer for their BTO flats.""",8,632,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00632
2013-02-07-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"On the issue of the pace of restructuring, let me quote Mr Low from his Budget speech on 29 February last year, ""We all hope we can raise workers' income, the faster the better because the cost of living has been increasing. However, it will be a long arduous journey to restructure the economy and increase productivity. And I urge the Government to be cautious in economic restructuring process.""

This is because Permanent Residents do not need to apply for work permit and are not restricted by Government's limit on foreign workers. The number of applications for approved for permanent residents has decreased from 79,000 in year 2008 to 29,000 in 2010. Looking at the current situation, I think the Government should limit the number of approval for PR application to 30,000 a year."" I repeat this, ""I think the Government should limit the number of approval for PR application to 30,000 a year."" Has the Workers' Party changed its position now and they want to reduce it from 30,000 now to 10,000?",10,634,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00634

I and a few Members over the last few years have brought this up time and time again in this House during Budget debate. I had warned that the dangerous addiction of cheap foreign labour that may have numbed our enterprises into complacency and lowered productivity growth. I have proposed two options in the past. One is a gradual reduction on this dependency on foreign workers which is what the White Paper is proposing. The other is cold turkey treatment which will also be effective but many enterprises may not survive the cold turkey treatment and many Singaporeans will lose their jobs.",11,635,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00635

It can be quite unworkable and will finish off our SMEs. Having said that, the alternative proposal may be worth considering. I would like to call upon our Workers' Party colleagues to walk the talk; to implement what they proposed in their constituency. They should consider  can they freeze all foreign workers headcount for all contractors serving their constituencies now, and get more elderly and women to take up the jobs there?",12,636,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00636

I also hope they can implement what they proposed for the benefit and welfare of the workers in their Town Council, that is  strictly eight hours workday with mandatory OT (Over Time) payment for any overtime including working at home; and two weeks of child bonding leave that can be taken anytime in addition to the Government proposal of one week paternity leave; and on behalf of their Town Council staff, let me thank the Workers' Party in advance for their implementation.",13,637,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00637

In this sustainable population steady state, we all still want to be pollution-free with good clean air, clean water, and thriving ecosystems in our green spaces that preserve our fauna and flora and also a thriving vibrant economy that provides good jobs.

I know we have a very prudent Government that makes sure public spending is sound. With the current traffic congestions and high property prices due to a mismatch in demand and supply, many are apprehensive of any further increase that will aggravate the current situation. I welcome the Government's pledge in the White Paper to build infrastructure ahead of demand. I do not think Workers' Party and our Nominated Members of Parliament will object, with the exception of Nominated Member Ms Faizah Jamal, as long as proper environmental impact studies are done before development. As a show of commitment to the Government's pledge, perhaps the Government can build the swimming pool, stadium and hawker centre in Sembawang town ahead of population growth. The residents of Sembawang town have been waiting patiently for the past 12 years for these facilities.

They must be here to complement and not to compete with existing Singaporeans. The White Paper quoted a figure of 15,000 PRs and the Workers' Party's alternative plan is 10,000 PRs. May I ask both sides what are the criteria that both sides will use to decide who gets the PR? The current PR population is about half a million and the White Paper's projection is also about half a million by 2030. There is no real increase. The Workers' Party's proposal of lowering PR annual intake will result in many foreign spouses of Singaporeans remaining as foreigners and dashing their hope to be PRs or citizens.",18,642,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00642

What is the percentage of core Singaporean in the alternative proposal by the Workers' Party? Where do we house the 45% non-Singaporeans? Currently, we have 1.2 million residential units with 900,000 as HDB. I understand 700,000 residential units will be added. If we maintain our current 75%-80% residential units as public housing and if 20% out of the 55% stays in private estates due to good economic prospects as proposed by the White Paper, then the remaining 35% will stay with the 45% non-Singaporeans in our heartlands. Will we reach a situation where there are more non-Singaporeans staying in the heartland? I think the housing and transportation of these 45% transient foreign workers need a review and rethink.

The next tsunami that may come earlier than the silver tsunami is the political tsunami. The shifting of our political tectonic plates is faster than most had anticipated. I am happy to hear that the Workers' Party has come out with an alternative plan which the public expects of the Opposition, too. As an elected Member of Parliament, it is also my duty to hold the Opposition accountable and make the Opposition work hard, so as not to let down the public. I must say that your alternative plan is actually very similar to the White Paper except for some tweaking of the figures to make the public happy and sway the public's emotions.

I agree with what the Paper says – that we should act to make the future of our children and grandchildren secure. More importantly, I agree with the spirit of the Paper which, to me, is the essence of what it means to be Singaporean.",1,661,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00661
2013-02-07-T-011,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"First, it is the spirit of looking at challenges boldly in the eye, not pretending there exist any easy options, not fearing that what lies ahead may be a very long and tough journey. The White Paper is the result of many people thinking about and trying to overcome a very serious problem which we have, a problem happening in 2030 which I remember first hearing in the 1980s after I just graduated. Simply put, Singapore is ageing fast and we know that fast-ageing societies, notably Japan, find it hard to grow and provide opportunities for their young citizens. So, we want to start thinking now how not to be hit by the same sad situation, which my learned colleague, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, called a tsunami.",2,662,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00662
2013-02-07-T-011,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"We owe it to our children, grandchildren and future generations. But telling it straight like this has elicited responses, such as ""the aged are seen as a burden to society"", ""there exist less unpalatable measures than having lots of foreign workers"", ""the Government has given up asking people to marry and have children"". All these are not true at all. As Deputy Prime Minister Teo has repeatedly assured Singaporeans, the White Paper is a roadmap to the future for all Singaporeans, the aged included. As for foreign workers, as explained in the White Paper, we need them to do the less skilled work because more Singaporeans will upskill and take on PMET and higher jobs. Lastly, the Government is stepping up efforts to help Singaporeans marry and have children, not slowing down.",3,663,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00663

To be realistic is to be aware and be able to accept things as they are, not as we wish them to be. To be realistic is to be practical and not deal with what is abstract or what seems ideal. Some views I know of may be summarised as such  ""it will be better to persuade Singaporeans to take on jobs which they are now unwilling to do rather than hire foreigners to do them. We can get them to take up these jobs if we make it worth their while to do so.""",5,665,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00665

There have been many attempts to help Singaporeans who are not in the workforce to find employment, with limited success, for various reasons. We all see these at our MPS.

If you ask employers to pay more for their workers and they say business costs are too high, the business will move elsewhere. In short, we have to be realistic. The Government will calibrate the foreign labour required and there is no doubt that a realistic mindset will serve Singapore better, as it has always been until recently.",8,668,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00668
2013-02-07-T-011,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Most people would agree that it is hard for any affluent society to maintain a high standard of living if there are few young people and lots of old people. At the personal level, a young family with members all working will live more comfortably than a family of two childless retirees. You do not have to be an expert to see this. Why then do Singaporeans baulk at the thought of more foreign labour needed, more young people targeted?",9,669,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00669
2013-02-07-T-011,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"A likely cause is a keenly-felt sense, especially among less well-off senior citizens, that with the rising cost of living each year, the aged cannot afford to be sick in Singapore and before long they will be marginalised. More effort should be put into assuring Singaporeans that while it is true, costs will go up particularly when there is economic growth, things will become more expensive in the years to come, we can, on our part, prepare for the future. Perhaps we can find positive stories to share, of how senior citizens deal with worries about life after retirement, and what keeps them going. Our senior citizens and Singaporeans approaching retirement must feel that they belong here in Singapore, that ours is an inclusive society and that they matter. One good way would be to provide support to help senior citizens achieve their dreams. For instance, if a 56-year-old worker at a hospital wants to be a staff nurse and plans to first take the Normal Maths exam followed by the ""O"" level Maths exam, the employer – with the Government's help – should give her the support she needs so she can realise her dream and retire at the level she wants. Other senior citizens who share similar dreams will feel encouraged if all employers have the same mindset and, gradually, this lifelong learning culture will set in and become a distinctive part of our society.",10,670,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00670

Indeed, working hard and, more importantly, working smart, have helped us to stay ahead in the global competition for growth opportunities. We have to communicate clearly that seizing growth opportunities is not what Singapore's future is about. It is about building a happy home for ourselves. Many arguments about how the Government cares only about making money missed the point that growth makes it possible for us to pay for a nicely renovated flat, wholesome and delicious food on our tables, good books and enrichment classes for our children, good caregivers for our aged parents, grandparents and so on. Money is not the goal, using money wisely to make life better for ourselves and our family is the goal. The logic is straightforward but many Singaporeans failed to appreciate the Government's approach to seizing growth opportunities because there are those who pretend there exist better options which other countries have and trumpet them while ignoring the crucial differences, such as we are uniquely small and without any natural resources to help us in a fiercely competitive world.",12,672,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00672

A simplified White Paper would make a good Youth Day present for all youths to read and appreciate what the country has done for them.

Picture for yourself what the future will look like and get involved in the envisioning process. Another question would be  so what if we do not care about what happens? Think of places like Italy where graduates leave the country in despair to seek their future elsewhere. Think how Japan has to borrow money to take care of its huge number of very old citizens. Enough of thinking, now act. I suggest we ask schools to discuss the White Paper during Character and Citizenship Education class to gather their students' thoughts and feelings, too.

Look what happened to Japan; we cannot make a choice that is detrimental to the next generation. Refusing to import foreign labour to supplement the shortfall will not be workable; many companies will close down or leave Singapore due to manpower shortage.

During his speech, he made a reference about between now and 2020, that MOM's estimates are that there is a requirement for another 100,000 foreign domestic workers to look after the elderly. Can I just confirm whether that is the correct estimation? And if it is, I would like to know why these estimations are not included in the White Paper and additional estimations which would have been helpful for Singaporeans to try and understand what sort of future we are looking at? I did mention in my speech that the White Paper is very, very thin on detail and this is exactly that sort of detail that I think would have been very useful for Singaporeans to actually look at and consider.",1,680,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00680

Unfortunately, to the many Singaporean low-wage workers who are facing stagnating wages, coupled with rising inflation, it means nothing to them. I was driving into Parliament this morning when I asked the armed security officer about his wages. He shared with me that his income has not increased for the past seven years despite having worked in his present job for 12 years. I have also come across many workers working under outsourced contracts lamenting their wages have not increased for many years. I believe there are thousands out there facing a similar situation.",2,692,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00692

The time to take class-based affirmative action is now. NTUC has embarked on many initiatives to help low-wage workers earn better wages through productivity improvements, skills upgrading and promoting better business practices.

Let me share a real case study involving one of our premier tertiary institutions. Last year, when NTUC learnt that they had a cleaning contract up for renewal, NTUC engaged them early to share on the progressive wage model, hoping that they would be amongst the first mover in helping the cleaners earn better wages. I personally attended the meeting. Despite sharing with the institution in advance, they, however, concluded their recent cleaning contract without insisting that the service providers adopt the progressive wage model, citing that official announcement of the progressive wage model was not made. If they had, the cleaners would have obtained better wages based on their skills and job nature. How many local cleaners were affected? I am not sure, but behind each of these cleaners is a family that most likely will find it difficult to cope with the rising cost of living.",5,695,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00695

Without doubt, the Government has instituted a range of measures, like the Inclusive Growth Programme, Workfare Training Scheme and Workfare Income Supplement, targeted at raising the salaries of low-wage Singaporean workers sustainably over the longer term. The Government must continue to improve on these narratives.",7,697,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00697

This requirement has the potential to impact 7,000 local cleaners working under Government contract but we still have another 50,000 local cleaners out there working and not earning wages as recommended by the Tripartite Cluster for Cleaners.

It is estimated that Government agencies engaged a total of approximately 1,200 security officers and 1,800 armed Police officers. While there has been much progress to raise their productivity and wages, the security industry is in a vicious cycle characterised by long working hours, low basic salary and, for some, even stagnating wages. I would like to urge the Government Ministries to work with the unions and industry players to help these security officers.

Many Singaporean low-wage workers are vulnerable because of the business practice of outsourcing. Competition amongst service providers inadvertently leads to cost-cutting and this manifests itself in the form of low salaries for their workers. To make matters worse, contractual obligations spanning a few years at fixed contract price means that the salary of these low-wage workers will stagnate. Many Singaporean low-wage workers are working for companies who are successful because they are operating based on a very low-wage, low-benefit model of employment.",10,700,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00700

She shared that, this year, her employer changed her terms of remuneration to $1,062 per month for the same amount of work. NTUC is following up with this case but, if it is true, then this is an example of companies operating based on a low-wage, low-benefit model of employment.

This, however, is not necessarily true. While unions can ensure they are accorded their statutory benefits according to the Employment Act, it is a challenge to negotiate for better wages if the workers are working under an outsourced contract with their salaries largely determined by what the company is getting from the Service Buyers.",12,702,2013-02-07-T-011-S-00702

The Singapore Business Federation echoed similar views. Government has given subsidies for them to restructure and improve their productivity but we know it is not easy. It takes time. I can understand why they want the policy to be reversed.

2013-02-07-T-015,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Students' performance in Literature in English at ""O"" and ""N"" level has been consistent over the years, with passes at about 90% and distinction rates of over 30%. In 2012, for example, 95.8% of the ""O"" Level Full Literature candidates and 91.8% of the Elective Literature candidates passed the subject and the distinction rates were 40.8% and 34.0% respectively. For the ""N(A)"" level Full Literature, the pass rate was 90% and distinction rate was 38.1%.",5,733,2013-02-07-T-015-S-00733
2013-02-07-T-015,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"As both students' performance in English Language and the candidature for Literature have not varied significantly, it is not possible to infer any correlation between the take-up rates for Literature and English Language performance in schools.",6,734,2013-02-07-T-015-S-00734
2013-02-07-T-015,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"To promote Literature, MOE organises regularly sharing sessions on the teaching of Literature and a biennial Literature Seminar for teachers. A special interest group has been set up for Literature teachers to share ideas and resources. MOE also reviews and revises the Literature syllabus to make the subject accessible to and interesting for students.",7,735,2013-02-07-T-015-S-00735
