2016-02-29-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,Order. Questions for Oral Answer.,1,7,2016-02-29-T-002-S-00007
2016-02-29-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked	 the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) whether current retail petrol prices at petrol pumps reflect the fall in oil prices; (b) whether there is a trend of petrol companies increasing prices faster than they decrease when there are changes to the oil prices; and (c) if so, whether the Ministry plans to implement measures to ensure that petrol companies adjust prices accordingly.",1,8,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00008
2016-02-29-T-003,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked	 the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) whether the Competition Commission of Singapore regularly monitors the price of petrol in Singapore to ensure that there are no cartel practices that will breach the competition rules in Singapore.,1,9,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00009
2016-02-29-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"asked	 the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) in view of local petrol prices not falling as much as crude oil prices, whether the Competition Commission of Singapore will consider launching an inquiry on the practices of local oil companies.",1,10,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00010
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry)),"Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 1 to 3 together, please?",1,11,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00011
2016-02-29-T-003,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,12,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00012
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"In 2015, the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) commenced a study on the factors affecting the movement of petrol prices in Singapore since 2010. CCS found that the petrol companies use Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) prices, not crude oil prices, in their cost accounting and pricing decisions for retail petrol. Crude oil price is the price of unrefined oil while MOPS price is the price at which petrol companies purchase refined wholesale petrol from the refineries. MOPS price tends to be higher than crude oil price as it includes the cost of refining crude oil into wholesale petrol.",1,13,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00013
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"In 2015, MOPS price made up less than one-third of the listed retail petrol price. Other components of retail petrol price include operating costs, taxes and duties, land costs, discounts and rebates. These non-fuel components have generally increased in the past few years.",2,14,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00014
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The retail petrol price that consumers generally pay includes the petrol levy as well as discounts and rebates. Consumers enjoyed an average of about 18% in discounts and rebates off the listed price for Octane 95 petrol in 2014 through site discounts, loyalty programmes and credit card payment.",3,15,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00015
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Between June 2014 and January 2016, crude oil price fell by an average of S$0.59, MOPS price fell by S$0.52 and the listed price for Octane 95 petrol fell by S$0.35. The pass-through, while relatively high at around 70%, is not complete because of the non-fuel components which make up more than two-thirds of listed retail petrol price. After taking into account the discounts and rebates that consumers enjoy and the levy increase in February 2015, the effective price that consumers paid for Octane 95 petrol fell by S$0.45, implying a pass-through of over 85%.",4,16,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00016
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Over the six-year period between 1 January 2010 and 31 January 2016, CCS observed that the listed prices for Octane 95 petrol moved in tandem with MOPS prices. There was no significant variation between the time taken to either raise or lower the listed prices for Octane 95 petrol in response to changes in MOPS prices. The magnitude of the change in listed prices for Octane 95 petrol relative to the change of MOPS prices was also observed to be the same whether MOPS prices increased or decreased.",5,17,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00017
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Based on the information gathered, there is no evidence, Mdm Speaker, to suggest collusion in retail petrol pricing, even though petrol companies do monitor and react to each other's published prices. CCS will continue to monitor developments in the retail petrol market.",6,18,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00018
2016-02-29-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker, and I thank the Minister of State for the answer. We are not saying that they are colluding but we are not happy with the amount of the reduction in the petrol price. I would like to ask the Minister of State  did the Ministry study the price of petrol during the last cycle of upward trend of crude oil and how fast the petrol companies increased the petrol price.",1,19,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00019
2016-02-29-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),The next question  could it be that there is a lack of competition in Singapore – there are just a few of them. Can the Ministry consider removing the three-quarter tank rule?,2,20,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00020
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mdm Speaker, between June 2014 and January 2016, MOPS price fell by S$0.52, or 53%, as I had said earlier, while the listed price of Octane 95 fell by S$0.35, which is about 15%. The smaller percentage drop largely reflects the fact that MOPS price made up only of a third of the listed retail price. So, a third of S$0.52 would be a ballpark of about 15%. The lack of complete pass-through could also be due to changes in non-fuel components, as I had listed earlier.",1,21,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00021
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"As to whether we will be studying this further, yes, CCS will continue to monitor and will continue to study. We will be embarking on a study on the supply side of the equation to see if consumer behaviour does affect pricing from the petrol companies.",2,22,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00022
2016-02-29-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive reply. Comprehensive Commission of Singapore (CCS) said that MOPS price makes up about one third of the listed retail petrol price. When we look at the average MOPS price of Octane 95 last week , it was about US$46.5 per barrel. Three times of that average MOPS price is about US$139.5 per barrel.",1,23,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00023
2016-02-29-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"When we look at the retail price of Octane 95 in Singapore at the petrol kiosks, it costs about S$1.82 per litre before discount. Even if we are given a discount of 15% on average, it costs about S$1.55 per litre or US$174.64 per barrel, as compared to three times the MOPS price which is equivalent to US$139.5 per barrel. That is, the retail price of Octane 95 is US$35.14 higher than US$139.50, or 25% more. It appears that the petrol companies are charging Singaporeans at least 25% more. A lot of Singaporeans are looking towards MTI to help us to regulate retail petrol prices, so that we are not over-charged. I hope the Minister of State can look into it.",2,24,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00024
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. Let me just go through what exactly is the difference between listed prices and effective prices. Listed prices are prices that are observed at petrol stations, for example, those that are displayed at the pumps. Effective prices are listed prices that exclude the levy hike introduced in February 2015, but have factored in the discounts and the rebates that are enjoyed by the consumers. The price that consumers pay will be the listed prices minus the discounts and the rebates.",1,25,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00025
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The question of whether the petrol companies' prices will go up and how much the increase in petrol prices are affecting the operating income of the companies, for example, in terms of the profit margins that the Member was alluding to, on average, on a per litre basis, the operating income of petrol companies has generally increased over the past few years, but the increase is smaller relative to the increase in the non-fuel components that the companies have to shoulder.",2,26,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00026
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Unfortunately, CCS is unable to provide further details about the change in the operating income at the company level, as such information is deemed to be commercially sensitive. As to whether the companies are profiteering, on average, the operating income of petrol companies has generally increased over the past years.",3,27,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00027
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"As I have said earlier, this increase is smaller relative to the increase in the non-fuel components such as operating costs, taxes and duties, land cost, discounts and rebates. An increase in profit, in itself, is not a contravention of the Competition Act, unless the increase is due to market players engaging in anti-competitive behaviours which would contravene the Competition Act. Based on information that CCS has gathered in the market study, there is no evidence to suggest whether there is any collusion in petrol pricing even though they do monitor the prices.",4,28,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00028
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Consumers, generally, as the Member pointed out, do enjoy discounts and rebates off the petrol prices. In 2014, consumers enjoyed an average of about 18% discounts and rebates off the retail petrol prices for Octane 95. The discounts and rebates, especially for credit cards, are quite variable and are not easily comparable due to varying terms and conditions.",5,29,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00029
2016-02-29-T-003,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, may I ask the Minister of State whether MTI would consider publishing petrol prices, both retail and crude oil prices, and make them readily available to the public so that members of the public can see how the prices move. The Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) did a study recently and realised that despite crude oil prices coming down, the price of Octane 98 went up by S$0.02. Clearly, there is some issue of education.",1,30,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00030
2016-02-29-T-003,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The other question that I wish to ask the Minister of State is whether MTI would consider encouraging a third party, for example, the cooperatives under NTUC, to run another petrol company, so that we would have greater competition. This is very much like what IDA did to introduce to introduce a fourth telco to provide greater competition, so that our consumers have greater choices.",2,31,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00031
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. There is currently no legal requirement for petrol companies to display their pump prices prominently. CCS notes that the reason why petrol companies do not display their prices prominently is because in certain jurisdictions overseas, petrol companies are accused of anti-competitive price signalling when they do so, when it is not legally required to do so in the first place.",1,32,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00032
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"That said, CCS recognises that improved price transparency in the retail petrol market may facilitate easier comparison and more informed petrol buying decisions by consumers. CCS will be conducting a customer survey on petrol demand in Singapore to understand consumer choices and their switching behaviour on petrol purchases, in particular, whether improving price transparency will facilitate a more competitive market.",2,33,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00033
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"As to whether we should be having another petrol player the in the market, that will be a commercial decision that NTUC has to take. I am not sure whether NTUC is contemplating this in the first place.",3,34,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00034
2016-02-29-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),I would like to seek the view of the Minister of State. I would like to ask whether in the view of the Minister of State the petrol companies are profiteering at the expense of consumers' interest.,1,35,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00035
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. The petrol companies do make a profit but as long as the profit that they make is not in excess of what is a reasonable margin that other similar petrol companies make over the same time period, I do not think that they are making a profit at the expense of consumers.",1,36,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00036
2016-02-29-T-003,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr Low, you have a follow-up question?",1,37,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00037
2016-02-29-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Thank you, Madam. How does the Minister know that the profit made by the petrol companies is not excessive; and if so, by what standard?",1,38,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00038
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mdm Speaker, based on the CCS study, there is no evidence of collusion in pricing between the different companies. As far as the pricing of petrol is concerned for which the key variation in response to market crude oil prices is the MOPS pricing, that has been consistent with all the other companies. MOPS pricing was also used as an international standard in pricing for petrol sale across jurisdictions, so I think that is a fair method for pricing crude oil and how retail petrol is being used in Singapore.",1,39,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00039
2016-02-29-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Two clarifications. First, I think there are two ways of addressing this issue. One is to regulate more and look more closely. The second is actually to open up competition, and I actually would prefer the second approach. One way of doing this will be as the Minister of State had mentioned – to have more price transparency. In doing that, I would also suggest that any discounts and so on be factored in; otherwise, it is very difficult for customers to track what a 10% or 15% discount on this price is.",1,40,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00040
2016-02-29-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Secondly, and this I echo my colleague, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's suggestion to review the three-quarter tank rule, because sometimes the best way to raise competition may be to open the market up and to allow those more price sensitive customers to go overseas and top up their petrol.",2,41,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00041
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mdm Speaker, I just want to clarify with regard to actual petrol pricing, MOPS is a recognised international standard of pricing based on actual international trades from Singapore. The MOPS price is a price on which oil is traded in Singapore and the region. MOPS prices are also used in the region as a price benchmark to make an assessment of the financial value of oils, which are transferred from upstream production to refineries and subsequently to the market.",1,42,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00042
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"For example, Australia imports wholesale petrol from Singapore based on MOPS price which is a key pricing benchmark. So, in terms of pricing of petrol, how the price varies with crude oil changes, I think that has been used as a consistent and fair international benchmark.",2,43,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00043
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"As to whether we should continue to open up competition, as suggested by the Member, I think that is something that we will continue to study and see if the market is suitable for such an introduction.",3,44,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00044
2016-02-29-T-003,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, last question.",1,45,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00045
2016-02-29-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I think the Minister of State has not answered both my questions. I asked if the Ministry studied the price of petrol during the last cycle of the upward trend of crude oil. What he explained on MOPS pricing, we do not understand, but if we could take a look at the upward trend of the crude oil in the last round and how fast the petrol companies increased their price? So, could you study this?",1,46,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00046
2016-02-29-T-003,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,The other question – remove the three-quarter tank rule so that there is more competition. Thank you.,2,47,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00047
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mdm Speaker, using a time series regression analysis, CCS has found that for a longer period that we looked at between January 2010 and January 2016, for every S$0.10 increase or change in the price of MOPS pricing, the listed price of the petrol for Octane 95 changed by about S$0.07 in the same direction on an average, and this took place relatively over a short 10-day period. On average, there was no significance between the prices whether it was on the rise or on the decline. So, on a day-to-day basis, the level of pass-through and time taken for adjustments may deviate due to fluctuations in the fuel and non-fuel components but on the whole, the fluctuations do reflect the changes in the petrol pricing.",1,48,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00048
2016-02-29-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Three-quarter tank rule, I think that is something we have to continue to study and see the merits of whether it is something we should implement.",2,49,2016-02-29-T-003-S-00049
2016-02-29-T-004,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked	 the Minister for Home Affairs what measures are taken by the Police during the investigation and law enforcement process to safeguard the interests of children and vulnerable young persons who are suspected of, or accused of, committing an offence.",1,50,2016-02-29-T-004-S-00050

2016-02-29-T-004,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked	 the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Ministry could have timeously addressed the extensive speculation on social media surrounding the case of the 14-year-old boy who was found dead after being interviewed by the police; and (b) whether there will be a thorough review of police procedures on the interview of vulnerable suspects.,1,53,2016-02-29-T-004-S-00053

2016-02-29-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the main factors taken into consideration when deciding on the possible underground alignments in the vicinity of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR) for the Cross Island Line; (b) in view of the moderate environmental impact on the nature reserve for the alignment option that cuts beneath the CCNR, whether the Ministry will consider the alternative alignment along Lornie Road which will allow the MRT line to serve more residents and commuters in that vicinity and also result in the protection of our nature reserve and primary forest; and (c) whether the Environmental Impact Assessment report that was recently published can be made available for viewing online.",1,66,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00066
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Mdm Speaker, the Cross Island Line (CRL) will be an important part of our future MRT network. It will link east to west, from Changi to Jurong, covering more than 50 km with about 30 stations. The exact alignment is being studied. Our preliminary estimate is that commuters from residential areas like Loyang, Pasir Ris, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio, Sin Ming, Bukit Timah, Clementi and West Coast will make at least 600,000 trips on the CRL every day. This will place the CRL higher, in terms of capacity and usage, compared, for example, to the North East Line (NEL). The CRL will also significantly enhance our network resilience as commuters will have many more routing options with the CRL connecting to other lines.",1,67,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00067
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),What this means is that – nearly half of the 30-plus new stations will be interchange stations and that means that every other station will be an exchange station where you can switch to another line. This will significantly enhance the resilience of our network.,2,68,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00068
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Now, specific to the question raised by the Member, the Government is studying two possible alignments for the CRL in the vicinity of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR). Both options are underground, and construction of the tunnels for this stretch of the CRL will be carried out using bored tunnelling, instead of the cut-and-cover approach. Cut-and-cover means you cut through like a huge bulldozer and chop down whatever is in between, then you build the tunnel and you cover it up. With bored tunnelling, you avoid all the trauma and damages above the tunnel.",3,69,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00069
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"For the 4-km direct alignment option, 2 km will be deep below the CCNR. How deep is deep? About 40 m – or 12 storeys – below ground level. And more importantly, at that level, this is what geologists call the hard bedrock level. In our case, this is the Bukit Timah granite. At this level, there are no vegetation, no trees, no animals. Under this option, there will not be any construction of infrastructure at surface level within the CCNR.",4,70,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00070
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"The skirting alignment option, on the other hand, is about 9 km long. Because it is 9 km long, it will require longer tunnels. And therefore, it will require ventilation shafts and facilities on the surface; whereas in the earlier option, because it is short enough, you do not have to build all those quite ugly exhaust ducts which you see at some of our road junctions.",5,71,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00071
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"This option could incur around $2 billion – $2,000 million – more in expenditure and could result in land acquisitions. The Member suggested that the skirting alignment could potentially serve more residents. However, the catchment there is already served by the Circle Line and the upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line.",6,72,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00072
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"The CRL is a massive project and the Government will decide on its entire alignment only after making a total assessment including financial viability, technical feasibility and other relevant considerations. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is only one of the many studies which we need to undertake to help us determine the best alignment for the stretch of the CRL in the vicinity of the CCNR. Later, my MND colleague will provide some details on the EIA and also describe how the Government agencies are working closely with the nature groups on the EIA. It has been a very productive collaboration, although much remains to be done.",7,73,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00073
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"As the alignments can have different impact on the environment, commuters, taxpayers, businesses and home owners, the Government has a responsibility to study both options thoroughly. Besides the EIA, there are upcoming technical site investigation works which will allow us to determine the soil profile and condition. This will feed into the Engineering Feasibility study. Only after all these environmental and technical studies on both possible alignments have been completed, and taking into account the potential impact on the nature reserve, the travelling distance and time for commuters, the cost to taxpayers, and the potential acquisition of homes and businesses, will we be able to make an informed decision on the project and its exact alignment. There will be many more public consultations so that we can adequately factor in all views. All these studies and consultations may take two more years to complete.",8,74,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00074
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Meanwhile, the EIA Phase 1 report is available online.",9,75,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00075
2016-02-29-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Minister for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. One, could the Minister clarify what is the total cost for the construction of the CRL and what percentage increase that is of the total construction cost if we use the skirting alignment?",1,76,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00076
2016-02-29-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, if we do use the skirting alignment, could the Minister clarify exactly which buildings or which houses may need to be acquired?",2,77,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00077
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, a short answer to both questions is  I do not know yet. As I have said, this is a massive project and usually, it would take easily four to five years for all the important studies to be made. In fact, although the EIA is published now, this is a product of two years of discussions and consultations. In this particular instance, it is because of the interest of nature groups and the sensitivity of the possible impact of any work of this part of the CRL on the nature reserve that the issue now surfaces.",1,78,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00078
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"For the next leg of the studies, if we are allowed to proceed with the site investigation, we will be doing much more public consultations and that will allow us, LTA, to firm up on many of the answers to many of the questions that have yet to be answered, such as – who are affected, how much will it cost and so on. We have some idea because this is not the first time we are building an MRT line. We can have some idea about how much the cost will be, but one can never be sure because what happens underground is invisible; we do not know. And soil conditions, even though we are a tiny little red dot, the geology of east and west, north and south, can be very different. That is why it is so important to do a thorough site investigation.",2,79,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00079
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"So, the bottom line is this – what we are seeking is permission, in this case, from MND, to allow us to proceed with the site investigation for which there is a necessity to do this EIA. The EIA, after two years of study, is now published online. By the gazette requirements, Singaporeans, interest groups, stakeholders, are invited to give their comments. I am quite sure MND will take all those views into consideration and decide whether they would allow the site investigation to proceed. And if they do, we can then enter into Phase 2 of the EIA, which will study what are the tunnelling methods, what will be the impact of those construction works and subsequent running of the train on the nature reserve, and more importantly whether, there are suitable mitigation measures.",3,80,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00080
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sorry for a long reply, which is that there are many questions which remain unanswered. What I urge of Singaporeans is this  keep an open mind. Go with the facts, keep an open mind and look for the evidence.",4,81,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00081
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, over the weekend, I took my granddaughter, 3 years old, to watch Disney's latest movie ""Zootopia"", the utopia for the animal kingdom where all animal species, even though they are former predators or preys can live in harmony, peaceful with one another. It was a good movie because it was not just for the kids; it carries important values, and some political messages. It tells the story of a little female bunny whose ambition is to bring about justice and change the world, and she wants to be a police officer. The police world, at that time was largely monopolised by larger animal species and all males. But she was determined to be a police officer. So, she had to fight stereotyping, sexism, racism, bias and prejudice. In the end, she succeeded through wit and effort, and demonstrated what she can achieve. Likewise, for the EIA, let us keep an open mind. I have read some of the very toxic comments on the EIA. They were made even before the EIA was published. I think there is an English word for that – that is bias, prejudice.",5,82,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00082
2016-02-29-T-006,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),I thank the Minister. I just want to find out if maintenance cost will also be considered beside the capital cost in the study.,1,83,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00083
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Yes, indeed. As I have said, this four-to-five year study is a total impact study. The EIA is just an environmental impact study on a short stretch of a line, but our job is to do a total impact study  the impact on the environment, the impact on taxpayers, the impact on the commuters. I should not be biased. I should not be prejudiced. So, I am not opting for one or the other yet. I am keeping a completely open mind but there has been comments about the second option that of course, clearly, anybody reading the map would know, it will take a longer route, takes a longer time. To the commuters, it means extra time. The media have been guessing the figures; they say ""an extra four minutes"".",1,84,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00084
2016-02-29-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I asked LTA, ""Is their estimation correct?"" And they did a calculation. They said, ""No, not quite."" The extra time taken to cross the reserve if it takes a longer route is six minutes. Some people commented, ""Well, that is just a few minutes."" I am not so sure we can just brush aside the extra six minutes, just like that, because in the mindset of the MRT commuters, an extra half a minute is already terrible. We know it! When the train has a disruption, causing an extra one minute of delay, commuters can, within that one minute, send off, maybe, 100 tweets to flame LTA or SMRT. So, an extra one minute is a lot of time, let alone six minutes! That is why, in the rail industry, they define disruption as anything that causes delay of more than five minutes; and six is more than five.",2,85,2016-02-29-T-006-S-00085
2016-02-29-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked	 the Minister for National Development (a) what are the impediments to releasing the Cross Island MRT Line (CIL) Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Phase 1 report online; (b) what are the main environmental impact the EIA has identified about the site investigations preceding construction of the CIL through the Central Catchment Nature Reserve Area and how the Ministry intends to mitigate them; and (c) how is the ""moderate"" impact from the CIL (assuming successful mitigation measures) determined and what is the reasoning for why this is acceptable.",1,86,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00086
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mdm Speaker, before I begin, may I have your permission to distribute handouts to Members, please?",1,87,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00087
2016-02-29-T-007,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please. [",1,88,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00088
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Thank you. Let me begin as Members await the notes that are coming around. Madam, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the two possible underground alignments of the Cross Island Line (CRL) consists of two phases.",1,89,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00089
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Phase 1 of the EIA, which is where we are right now, focuses on the impact of site investigation on the two alignment options. The data and the findings from the site investigation are needed for Phase 2 of the EIA, which will provide a detailed assessment of the environmental impact of the construction and the operations of the CRL based on those two possible alignments.",2,90,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00090
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"When LTA first announced the possible alignment of the CRL in 2013, nature groups understandably, raised concerns about the potential serious environmental impact that this may have on the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR). Because of these concerns, LTA formed a working group to define the scope of the EIA study of the CRL. This working group included representatives of nature groups. NParks also participated in the working group to provide views, inputs and the expertise. Separately, a group made up of residents staying around the CCNR expressed concern about how the possible alignments may affect their homes and LTA has been engaging them as well.",3,91,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00091
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Over the course of more than two years, LTA consulted the nature groups extensively in preparing for Phase 1 of the EIA. For example, in studying the impact of the proposed site investigation works on the water quality, ecology and biodiversity within the Nature Reserve, LTA's EIA consultant took into consideration a very useful baseline study on various aspects of the CCNR which was put together by our nature groups.",4,92,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00092
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As indicated in the Phase 1 EIA report, the impact assessment framework adopted by LTA's EIA consultant has two criteria. One, the sensitivity of the receptor, which is the CCNR in this case, and two, the magnitude of the environmental impact on the ground. So, if Members look at the handout  look at the x-axis – it talks about the sensitivity of the receptor; the y-axis – refers to the magnitude of the environmental impact. It is a framework which the EIA consultant uses to band an impact.",5,93,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00093
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"LTA's EIA consultant has rated the sensitivity of the CCNR as ""high"", as it comprises primary rainforest with ecologically sensitive habitats. While this is so, the consultant has assessed the magnitude of impact due to the site investigation to be mainly ""small"". This is because of the adoption of stringent mitigating measures that had been proposed. These mitigation measures were arrived at in close consultation with several representatives of the nature groups and NParks. Both groups saw the report before it was published.",6,94,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00094
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Let me briefly describe what the site investigation entails and what mitigation measures have been proposed.,7,95,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00095
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The site investigation adopts two methods to determine the geological properties of the site. The first method is borehole drilling, by which boreholes, about 10 cm in diameter, are drilled to extract vertical columns of soil and rock samples. To minimise these disturbances and damage to the forest environment, the number of boreholes to be drilled will be reduced from an earlier estimate of 72 down to 16. More importantly, these boreholes will be confined to existing trails so as not to affect any vegetation. And the drilling machine will be modified to reduce the noise level and prevent spillage of slurry and fuel.",8,96,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00096
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To make up for the drastic reduction in the number of boreholes, and because boreholes will be restricted only to the trails, a second method of site investigation will be carried out. This involves non-intrusive geophysical survey. To carry this out, surveyors will venture off-trail into the forest to collect data using hand-held equipment. This will be of significantly lower impact than actual borehole drilling in the forest. So, they will manpack the equipment into the forest and they will place it on the ground to detect the signals and to determine the geology of the ground at the location.",9,97,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00097
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"One of the concerns is that the surveyors may inadvertently trample on plants on the forest floor as they move through dense vegetation off-trail. So, the geophysical survey is therefore limited to a 100 m-wide corridor and will not be carried out in sensitive locations such as streams, swamps and dense vegetation. NParks officers will supervise the surveyors full-time to ensure that they adhere to the strict rules for movements in off-trail forested areas and to reduce damage from trampling on plants and vegetation. All site investigation activities will be restricted to daylight hours, so as not to affect nocturnal animals.",10,98,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00098
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"These stringent measures have been incorporated into the Phase 1 EIA report, which will reduce the impact of the site investigation to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable. A great amount of efforts has been put in by all parties – representatives of nature groups, the National Parks Board and LTA – to arrive at this set of mitigation measures. The on-going public consultation for the EIA report, and this report has been put online, allows the public an opportunity to provide further suggestions to LTA on what more can be done to further reduce the impact of the site investigation.",11,99,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00099
2016-02-29-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for his very detailed reply. I just have two supplementary questions. The first is regarding the EIA itself. Will the Government, as a default position, be releasing future EIAs that are done in relation to other projects online, as the default stance of the Government?",1,100,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00100
2016-02-29-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is in relation to the on-going studies that are going to be done over the next two years, as the Senior Minister of State mentioned. This is early days yet, but my question is, will the Government consider publishing all the information that is relevant to making this decision, to evaluating the trade-offs, in a single document and releasing that document for public debate and public consultation. The information I am referring to includes all the costs, the environmental impact, the commuting time impact and so on and so forth, when the information is ready, when the Phase 2 of the EIA is done and so on and so forth.",2,101,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00101
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, agencies will consider making these EIA reports in future projects more readily available online, especially when there is significant public interest involved, as was the case for the Cross Island Line.",1,102,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00102
2016-02-29-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for the second question by the hon Member, we are still at Phase 1. Let us work through Phase 1, consider people's views, focus on what needs to be done for the soil investigation, and in tandem with MOT and LTA, let us consider the Member's suggestions as to what level of information would be useful for members of the public, for interested persons, to consider.",2,103,2016-02-29-T-007-S-00103
2016-02-29-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,asked	 the Minister for Defence (a) how much is the Government paying for the extra days of National Day Parade (NDP) rehearsals at the Sports Hub; and (b) whether the Government expects to pay similar amounts for future years when the Sports Hub is chosen as the NDP venue again.,1,104,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00104
2016-02-29-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,asked	 the Minister for Defence (a) what is the current estimated total cost for National Day Parade (NDP) 2016 after including the cost of rental for the extra days of rehearsals; and (b) how does this compare to the NDP costs of the previous five years.,1,105,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00105
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mdm Speaker, can I have your permission to take the next two questions together?",1,106,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00106
2016-02-29-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,107,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00107
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,Let me also inform Members that my reply will address the Question for Written Answer from the hon Member Mr Vikram Nair.,1,108,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00108
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mdm Speaker, this year we will celebrate the National Day Parade (NDP) at the National Stadium after a hiatus of 10 years. When compared to other NDP sites at the Padang and the Marina Bay Floating Platform, the new setting calls for a different format. For example, what Members here particularly like and what Singaporeans like, the Red Lions parachuting down into the site will not be possible for obvious safety reasons. We will also not be able to have a mobile column or aerial displays – we just cannot see them.",2,109,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00109
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"However, the new National Stadium also provides advantages for a different type of show, utilising the larger confined space and central pitch as a large stage. The NDP 2016 Executive Committee the EXCO – is excited about the possibilities that the new setting provides and has been hard at work preparing for NDP 2016 so that all Singaporeans can enjoy it and be proud of it.",3,110,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00110
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Another distinct advantage of the new National Stadium, because it has a seating capacity of 55,000, almost twice that of the number of Singaporeans that can watch it either at the Padang or the Marina Bay Platform, is exactly this  there will be many more Singaporeans who will be able to watch the rehearsals and the NDP physically at the site compared to the Marina Bay Floating Platform and the Padang. Both of these have capacities of about 25,000. In all, in the new site, we expect about 275,000 Singaporeans to be able to watch the National Education shows, the Preview show and NDP 2016 physically at the site. As with previous NDPs, ""live"" telecast will also allow Singaporeans to watch the shows at home.",4,111,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00111
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Let me address the questions which have been posed regarding costs of NDP at the National Stadium, and compare it, as asked, with NDPs held at the Marina Bay Floating Platform or the Padang. Previous NDPs at the Marina Bay Platform cost between $15.7 million and $17.9 million. The cost of NDP at the Padang in 2010 was $20.6 million and in 2015, $40.5 million. The cost of NDP at the National Stadium this year is expected to be about $39.4 million.",5,112,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00112
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There have been questions asked about itemised cost. Itemised cost comparisons between the three different sites, are sometimes difficult and not meaningful as the venue conditions vary considerably for each site. For example, among these factors, the number of ""live"" spectators in the main venue and surrounding areas, the costs for added security in some sites will be more than the others, and also the collateral impact of opportunity costs on surrounding businesses and retails shops. Be that as it may, I will still give some figures and some comparisons.",6,113,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00113
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The cost of the show segment, for example, for all three sites is similar, about half of total costs. But the cost to build infrastructure varies considerably. For example, each time we hold it at the Padang, we have to build all the spectator stands and that costs about 22% of the total cost, as you can well imagine. But it is negligible at the Marina Bay Floating Platform because it is already built, or the National Stadium. Venue costs, which was the question asked, are expected to be very low for public sites at the Marina Bay Floating Platform and the Padang – about 4% of total costs – because the Padang and the Marina Bay Floating Platform are public sites. For NDP 2016 at the National Stadium, the venue cost is about 15% of total costs, similar to other national events held at private venues.",7,114,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00114
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Executive Committee is aware that after the Golden Jubilee NDP and SG50 celebrations, expectations of this year's show, NDP 2016, are high and I think that they have resigned themselves to the fact that comparisons will be inevitable. However, I believe that ultimately the NDP is a show with Singaporeans, for Singaporeans, and by Singaporeans. The committee will do their best to live up to expectations, but I ask that Singaporeans support the EXCO so that they can put up a really good NDP this year for all of us to celebrate together. Thank you.",8,115,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00115
2016-02-29-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Supplementary questions for the Minister. The first supplementary question is he mentioned that for NDP 2016, the venue cost would be about 15% of the infrastructure cost, if I heard him correctly. Could he specify that in dollar terms, how much would the rental of the Sports Hub cost?",1,116,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00116
2016-02-29-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question, Madam, we understand that the agreement between the Government and the Sports Hub allows MINDEF to use the Sports Hub for 45 days free of charge each year. My question is did the Government foresee that it would be holding the NDP at the Sports Hub? Next, why were only 45 days provided for when we understand that the average number of days needed for the NDP is closer to about 80 days?",2,117,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00117
2016-02-29-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"And, third, whether there is any dispute resolution mechanism provided for under the public-private partnership, between the Government and the Sports Hub, over the use of the Hub?",3,118,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00118
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Madam, 15% of $39.4 million is the figure which I have provided. The Member asked for details relating to the contract. The contract was negotiated as is, in the usual way that we negotiate with private providers and it is 15% of the total cost of the show, which is equivalent to the cost of public events held at private venues. Whether there is recourse for dispute resolution, I expect that it will be similar to all public contracts held in private venues as well.",1,119,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00119
2016-02-29-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Minister, thank you for the reply. I understand that the proportion of amount spent this time has gone up from 4% to 15% just for venue cost. For 2016, what is the proportion between the cost for rehearsals versus the cost for the actual venue for the actual day itself, as well as the key rehearsals? For example, the 45 days set aside versus the 80 days needed. Did the Ministry consider doing the rehearsals elsewhere and why were alternative locations not considered to save on the cost?",1,120,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00120
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Madam, I have left it to the EXCO to decide whether they can hold it off-site, and indeed, many of the side rehearsals are held off-site. In other words, they come together when they feel that there is a need to be physically at the stadium. Whether it is held in Padang, Floating Platform or the National Stadium, they start fairly early. In fact, they usually start about seven or eight months before the actual show in various groups, and some of these are held in camps. But ultimately, to put up a good show, we have to put people together and test it. Whether we could have done or we can do more of it off-site and then come to the venue itself, I leave it to the Executive Committee. The mandate and the deliverable for them is to put up a good show. I will pass the suggestion by the Member to them, to see whether they can reduce costs by doing it off-site and they will have to determine whether they can.",1,121,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00121
2016-02-29-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Yes, Madam, supplementary questions for the Minister. The Minister mentioned that the 15% is a figure, so I would like him to confirm that what he is saying is that the rental cost of the Sports Hub is calculated to be under $6 million?",1,122,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00122
2016-02-29-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The next question is, will the detailed figures be provided in the Government Budget in the coming Budget for 2016 in terms of the itemised costs for MINDEF?",2,123,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00123
2016-02-29-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The third question is the Minister mentioned in his speech that public expectations have risen since the SG50 NDP. In last year's Budget, we were told by the Government that extra expenditure was expected for NDP 2015 because it was the SG50 year. So, I would like to ask the Minister whether actually it is not correct or not justifiable for the Government to proceed on the basis that the SG50 is a benchmark for future parades in non-milestone years.",3,124,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00124
2016-02-29-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,The last question is the Minister did not quite answer my question about the dispute resolution under the public-private partnership (PPP). Is he able to give a more detailed answer about how disputes will be resolved under the Agreement?,4,125,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00125
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Madam, let me deal with the last question first. First, there is no dispute, I do not have the detailed answer to that question, so, if the Member could file it as a separate question on about dispute resolution, I will be happy to answer it or get the relevant party to answer it.",1,126,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00126
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I never said that last year's NDP would be used as a benchmark. This is what the Member has said. I have just given the cost for this year's NDP 2016. I have provided many figures including the fact that the number of spectators in the show that can be physically there will be more than double. I said 275,000. The Member has chosen not to talk on that figure but to move back to her points.",2,127,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00127
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So let me clarify the answer to what the question asked. We have given cost, we have given what the spectators see. I have given itemised costs in terms of what it costs for infrastructure. The Member has asked whether we will provide details in the Budget. The Member has been in this House for many years. She knows that we do not provide those details in the Budget and if you ask a question we will tell you.",3,128,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00128
2016-02-29-T-008,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Last question, Mr Vikram Nair.",1,129,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00129
2016-02-29-T-008,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I thank the Minister for the detailed reply. National Day has historically been at the National Stadium for many, many years. The Floating Platform and the Padang was a change for about the last 10 years or so. But now that it is coming back to the National Stadium, what I am really interested in is, the Minister mentioned that 275,000 people would be able to enjoy it, would this also mean that there will be more tickets available for things like the Previews and so on? What is the usual number of people who apply for these tickets because I know there are a lot of disappointed people every year?",1,130,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00130
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mdm Speaker, this is a vexing problem. We have usually many more who apply than can come. I dare not raise hopes. All I can say is that more than double the number of people will be able to watch it at the National Stadium. But still, there will be many more who cannot because the numbers go up. Now that I have given this figure that 275,000 can watch it, I am sure I will get more than double the amount of people applying.",1,131,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00131

2016-02-29-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Madam, could the Minister answer my question about future NDPs, whether there is an expectation that we will go back to the Sports Hub and what is expected to be paid? That was in my question filed.",1,135,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00135
2016-02-29-T-008,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Madam, that is a theoretical question and I do not have the answer.",1,136,2016-02-29-T-008-S-00136
2016-02-29-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked	 the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the frequency of incidents involving the cutting of telecommunication cables by contractors carrying out earthworks; and (b) what steps are being taken to reduce such occurrences.,1,137,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00137
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, the number of cable cut incidents has increased in recent years. The number of incidents has grown steadily, from four each in 2013 and 2014 to seven in 2015. In 2016 alone, there have already been three of such incidents.",1,138,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00138
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, the rise in the number of cable cuts has been due to an increase in the number of road works and construction projects across Singapore in the past few years. All 18 cable cuts from 2013 to 2016 were caused by third-party contractors involved in the construction of new MRT lines, such as the Downtown Line and the Thomson East-Coast Line, power cabling, water and sewage piping works and other development projects. Of the 18, one was caused by contractors hired by a telecom operator.",2,139,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00139
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"IDA takes a serious view of all cable cut incidents. Such incidents result in significant disruptions to telecommunication and media services delivered to our homes and businesses, causing great inconvenience to thousands of subscribers for many hours.",3,140,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00140
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"IDA's investigations revealed that most, if not all, of these cable cut incidents could have been avoided if contractors exercised due diligence and caution when undertaking road works and construction projects. These contractors failed to comply with clearly established standard operating procedures (SOPs), such as ascertaining the location of telecommunication cables prior to commencing earthworks and protecting underground cables against damage when they carried out their earthworks. In 16 of these cases, the service plans and cable detection reports obtained by the contractors clearly indicated the presence of telecommunication cables. In the remaining two cases, the contractors did not obtain the necessary service plans and engage cable detection workers to detect the cables.",4,141,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00141
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, the Telecommunications Act requires any contractor who intends to carry out earthworks within the vicinity of telecommunication cables to take certain precautions.

IDA has previously prosecuted errant parties in court, which imposed penalties ranging from $60,000 to $570,000.",9,146,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00146
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Given the rise in the number of cable cut incidents, IDA is doing more. It is working closely with public agencies and telecom operators on preventive measures. I understand that our telecom operators have agreed to advise contractors on the type of earthworks that should be avoided and the additional procedures to adhere to before and during earthworks. These include digging ""trial holes"" to locate any cables in the vicinity before commencing any earthworks and to contact the relevant telcos should they encounter any difficulty in locating the cables. IDA has also been participating in regular dialogue sessions held by agencies, such as LTA and EMA, with their contractors. These sessions are meant to educate the contractors on the established SOPs and the precautionary measures needed to prevent a cable from being cut.",10,147,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00147
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"To aid efforts in locating telecommunication cables going forward, IDA has directed all telcos to indicate GPS geographical coordinates for new deployments of telecommunication cables and manholes on their service plans; and to install metallic tracer wires along new underground optical fibre cables. These measures will help facilitate the detection of new underground telecommunication cables and, hopefully, reduce the occurrence of cable cuts.",11,148,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00148
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"At the same time, IDA will thoroughly investigate and prosecute those responsible for cable cuts, and will apply for deterrent sentences upon conviction.",12,149,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00149
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Mdm Speaker, frequent telecommunication cable cuts will diminish Singapore's reputation as a reliable business and financial hub, and undermine our efforts to build a Smart Nation. My Ministry and IDA will continue to work closely with other public agencies to reduce the frequency of such cuts. I wish to emphasise that the parties involved in road works or construction projects must also adopt the necessary precautions to avoid such incidents. Only through a concerted effort by all relevant parties can cable cut incidents be avoided.",13,150,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00150

2016-02-29-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, what are the Ministry's estimates in terms of the numbers of consumers or businesses affected and the number of hours impacted generally from the 18 cases that were raised?",2,152,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00152
2016-02-29-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Secondly, does the Minister think that the fines imposed are sufficient in terms of compensating and making good on the impact and the damages done for each of those cases, and what is the average fine or damages received for each case?",3,153,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00153
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"I thank the Member for the two supplementary questions. On the second question, as mentioned in my reply, the range of fines determined by the court is from $60,000 to $570,000. We think they are adequate. In fact, we have worked with all the operators to make sure that they can avoid such an incident.",1,154,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00154
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"On the first question as to the estimate, it varies. We have sometimes as long as a couple of days, as well as a couple of hours, and the consumers affected can also vary, depending on the network configuration. The largest area we know of is probably in some parts of the areas in the northwest of Singapore. By and large, the most important thing is that the telcos have remediation programmes in place to make sure that we can minimise the disruption.",2,155,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00155
2016-02-29-T-009,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"At the end of the day, I think if we can minimise the cable cuts, then we do not have to deal with all these problems. We know that our underground is getting congested and, therefore, we need to work with the agencies and, more importantly, to educate the contractors that they have to take due diligence to avoid such an incident.",3,156,2016-02-29-T-009-S-00156
2016-02-29-T-010,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked	 the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the number of complaints that the Personal Data Protection Commission has received since the implementation of the Personal Data Protection Act on Do-Not-Call related offences; (b) how many companies have been convicted or have had their offences compounded; and (c) whether public education efforts have been effective in educating businesses with regard to compliance of the Act.,1,157,2016-02-29-T-010-S-00157
2016-02-29-T-010,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, the Do Not Call, or DNC, rules under the Personal Data Protection Act came into effect on 2 January 2014. Over the past two years, the Personal Data Protection Commission, or PDPC, has received about 9,700 valid public complaints against some 1,500 companies.

2016-02-29-T-010,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"PDPC's investigations revealed that most companies who flouted the DNC rules did not clearly understand the requirements of the rules and how to comply with them. Given that it was still early days of the Act and most complaints involved one-off breaches, PDPC issued advisory notices and warnings to about 3,000 organisations. These were meant to provide useful guidance to these companies on specific steps to be taken, in order to comply with the DNC rules.",2,159,2016-02-29-T-010-S-00159

In addition, two others had their offences compounded in lieu of prosecution, given that the breaches were not as serious.",3,160,2016-02-29-T-010-S-00160

2016-02-29-T-010,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"The PDPC has been proactive in its public education and outreach efforts to organisations and members of the public. PDPC has conducted briefings and workshops for organisations to explain how the Act would apply to various types of businesses and what organisations would need to do to ensure compliance. PDPC's online e-learning and educational resources have also been helpful, especially for smaller organisations.

2016-02-29-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"SARS and Zika viruses are spread through different modes of transmission. SARS is spread from person to person, while Zika is spread by mosquitoes. Containment measures like isolation of cases, contact tracing and quarantine of close contacts are important for SARS. For Zika, vector control remains paramount. MOH will isolate confirmed cases of Zika infection to reduce the risk of transmission in the community. But once there is community spread – that is, if Zika virus takes root and infection takes root in the community – we will then move from containment to mitigation measures. Measures to admit a confirmed case, isolate him until he recovers and history of the virus will not work anymore. So, we will move to containment measures and move to mitigation measures and this means that we will take measures similar to dengue prevention and control – that is, source reduction.",1,183,2016-02-29-T-011-S-00183

In such cases, HDB will advise them to settle their dispute amicably or seek help from the grassroots organisations or the Community Mediation Centre.

A few supplementary questions  first, how effective is the HDB's current mediation framework in helping to resolve such disputes between co-tenants, because I do see quite frequent cases of co-tenants having disputes and having difficulties coping? The next question is  some of the flats under the JSS are currently occupied by only one tenant instead of two. What actions is HDB taking to ensure that such flats are prudently and optimally rented out? My last question  although there is now the option of a rental flat with a partition, will HDB consider other rental flat options for singles, so as to reduce such conflicts of strangers living together?

Usually, these are medical-related conditions. In cases of difficulty getting along, we will usually allow some time for the RCs, local grassroots as well as the Community Mediation Centre to mediate between the two tenants and hope for a good resolution. In cases for which the tenants cannot get along, we would usually not force such pairings and may exercise some flexibility but we would usually seek an approach in which we encourage the tenants to continue to look for an eligible partner with whom they can get along to share the flat with.",1,204,2016-02-29-T-014-S-00204

Agencies that currently conduct the Marriage Preparation Programme will do so for this additional group of couples. This will take effect for marriages on and after 1 October 2016.,13,239,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00239
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Beyond legislation, we will also enhance the pre- and post-marriage support continuum for this group of couples. We will put in place group marriage education programmes, one-on-one marriage assessments and post-marriage support sessions by 2017.",14,240,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00240
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Even as we try to strengthen marriages, there will be those that have irretrievably broken down. Divorcing couples and their family members go through periods of anger, anxiety, grief and stress. The children are often the ones most adversely impacted when caught in the middle of their parents' fights.",15,241,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00241
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Let me cite you some examples that we had picked up while working with families. There was a child whose paternal grandma told her that if she really loved her daddy, she should stop thinking of mommy. The little girl grieved over this but hid it from her dad and grandmother because she did not want to disappoint them; she did not want to make them angry.",16,242,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00242
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Another example. There was a child who was told by her mother that her daddy did not love her anymore, as he had a new family with a new baby. The child felt abandoned, unloved and insecure. She asked whether her mommy would also not love her anymore if she had a new baby herself. These are stories which the children shared with some of our workers who work with families. And these stories tell us that we must always make sure that children's voices are heard and their interests and needs are taken care of during divorces.",17,243,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00243
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In 2011, the Ministry amended the Women's Charter to require divorcing parents with children to attend mandatory mediation and counselling after a writ of divorce has been filed. This has been quite effective in helping some divorcing couples reach agreements on children matters in less acrimonious ways.",18,244,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00244
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"But going for mandatory mediation and counselling on children's issues, after first battling it out in Court to settle the divorce, is really not ideal. Many divorcing parties have become hardened in their positions or too caught up with their emotions, by then. Social workers, counsellors and lawyers have told us it is much better to have divorcing parents consider their children's well-being early, before the divorce process formally starts.",19,245,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00245
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We are, therefore, introducing a new section 94A in the Women's Charter to require divorcing couples with minor children who are not able to agree on all matters of divorces to attend a mandatory parenting programme before they can file for divorce. For a start, those with at least one child aged below 14 years will be required to attend the programme. We plan to eventually extend this requirement to those with children aged below 21 years old.",20,246,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00246
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The new pre-divorce mandatory parenting programme will cover a range of issues that will have a tangible impact on children such as housing, school, care arrangements, and bread and butter issues. These practical aspects, when overlooked, add unnecessary turmoil to a child's life post-divorce.",21,247,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00247
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The new mandatory programme will also stress the importance of positive co-parenting after divorce. Even though a marriage ends, parental responsibilities remain. And I think it is important that parents remember that. Children need both parents to co-parent even after divorce. Allow me to say this with the best of intentions. I know that co-parenting is not easy. But, in many cases, it is probably the best ""gift"" that divorced parents can give to their children – the certainty that they still have both parents to love them despite everything. Then, the children do not feel that they have to take sides; they do not feel they are to blame; and they do not feel guilty.",22,248,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00248
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The process where divorcing parents go through in applying for the mandatory parenting programme will also include self-reflection questions − questions that focus parents' minds on their children's well-being. For those who may still have questions about their marriage and divorce, we will also point them to agencies that provide marital counselling. I hope that with this, perhaps some, upon reflection, may actually reconsider divorce and seek help for their problems.",23,249,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00249
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"During our public consultation on the Bill, some members of the public expressed concern that the new mandatory requirement could lengthen the divorce process. They felt that in some situations, for example, where there is family violence, the divorce process needs to be expeditious.",24,250,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00250
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Let me assure the House that our intention is not to make it more onerous for parties to be granted a divorce. Neither do we aim to make it easier. But the objective is to better equip parties with knowledge and awareness of the issues arising in a divorce that will affect their children. It will enable couples to be more informed and make child-centric decisions during the process of divorce.,25,251,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00251
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The pre-divorce mandatory parenting programme will be funded by my Ministry and conducted by the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (DSSAs). These four agencies offer a range of programmes and services. Since they started operating a year ago, they have served over 3,000 divorcing couples. The feedback from the couples and their children, as well as from judges and community partners, has been positive.",26,252,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00252
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I will now move on to the next area of amendments, which is on maintenance. Today, under the Women's Charter, maintenance may be ordered for two broad categories. The first is maintenance for children. Both fathers and mothers are responsible for maintaining or contributing to the maintenance of their children. This is so even after a divorce, and whether or not they have custody of the children. A mother may, therefore, seek child-maintenance from the father, and vice versa.",27,253,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00253
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The second category of maintenance is for a spouse or ex-spouse. This is the focus of the proposed amendment. Today, a woman can seek spousal maintenance from her husband or ex-husband. The law, however, does not enable men to seek spousal maintenance from their wives or ex-wives. This is something that is increasingly being questioned and debated, and my Ministry has certainly received a broad range of opinions.",28,254,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00254
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"At one end of the spectrum, some Singaporeans have argued that spousal maintenance should be gender-blind and based on needs. Let me cite you an email feedback that we received during the public consultation; and I think it sums it up quite neatly. The writer wrote, ""I find it hard to believe that Singapore, a First World society, is unable to accept that women should be our equals and should provide towards maintaining their ex-spouse equally if he is unable to do so.""",29,255,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00255

2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"At the other end of the spectrum, there are those who feel strongly that men should be the main breadwinner – and by and large they remain so – and spousal maintenance should be reserved for women only. After all, a wife is more likely to give up her career to care for the family. She is also more likely to be financially more vulnerable post-divorce. Allow me to quote from two emails we have received to illustrate.",31,257,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00257
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"One said, ""Despite the call of gender equality, we must face the reality that there cannot be absolute equality between the two genders.

2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Another argued  ""Remember that the Women's Charter is supposed to protect women's rights and not allow women to fall prey to the irresponsibility of men who wilfully refused to work, in the name of providing care for the family.""",33,259,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00259

I do not honestly think there is one decision that can satisfy all the differing views. This is one issue that there will be a range of issues. There is merit on both sides. Indeed, there are more women today with more successful careers. Some of you may have read about a recent Court of Appeal judgement which disallowed a woman's claim for a nominal maintenance order of $1. The Court found her ""more than capable"" of taking care of herself.",34,260,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00260

2016-02-29-T-019,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, gender equality has long been a heavily debated issue across national borders, cultures and generations. Regardless how far we have come, how much further we should go, one thing is for sure – as a nation, we pledged to build an equal and democratic society. Prejudice against either gender is frowned upon in the workplaces and public domains. Yet, it is common to find that cultural baggage from the past continues to hinder our progress in the pursuit of gender equality. There is a Chinese saying, 男主外，女主内. This continues to be presumed and desired as the default relationship dynamic.",1,299,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00299

2016-02-29-T-019,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The Women's Charter was established in 1961 to empower the law to protect women who were seen as the weaker sex. Back in those days, many women did not pursue higher levels of learning, and they would marry and become stay-home moms almost after leaving school. Or, they would quit their jobs when they decided to have a family. Granting maintenance to women in a divorce has been the rightful thing to do in appreciation of her contribution to the family when she has sacrificed her youth and potential incomes. Today, the female demographic is vastly different. Labour force statistics last year showed that employment rate for woman in Singapore was 76% for the prime working ages of 25 to 54.",3,301,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00301

2016-02-29-T-019,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has for years called for the extension of spousal maintenance to men. This is in line with alimon y laws in societies where gender equality is actively pursued, such as Britain, the US and Canada. But the Ministry deduced from talks with various groups that our society is not ready for women to shoulder the same responsibilities as men, and so up till today, men are still not able to claim alimony, apart from a small group of men in genuine need that can get spousal support. Hence, with this Bill I would say any progress is good progress. It is good that we have made this small step out.",5,303,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00303
2016-02-29-T-019,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I strongly believe that men who quit their jobs to become house-husbands on mutual consent and perform their designated roles adequately, should also be entitled to maintenance. Please note ""mutual consent"" because I also have residents who told me that their husbands are lazy to work and, hence, they are forced to become the sole breadwinner and some of them have to work day and night, taking on more than one job and their husband goes out jalan-jalan. So, for cases like this, when it comes to divorce, the husband should not be entitled to any maintenance, even though he is not fit to work.",6,304,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00304
2016-02-29-T-019,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I also believe that the Courts should weigh carefully in cases where the wife is better off than the husband, and has not been financially dependent on him during their marriage. I refer to the case where Justice Choo Han Teck, who, in 2014, generated somewhat of a debate when he rejected a woman's $120,000 maintenance claim from her former spouse after their 10-year marriage ended in 2012. The wife in this case earned slightly more than the husband, grossing $215,900 in annual income. She also had more than twice the assets he had. Justice Choo had rightly said that to award the woman even a token sum ""would be wrong if it was merely symbolic. That symbol for women has to be torn asunder, in fact and in spirit"". It is unfortunate that not every man in a similar situation gets a fair resolution.",7,305,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00305

2016-02-29-T-019,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, what is equally important, if not more important, is to make maintenance claims more straightforward. More resources and enforcement should, in fact, be dedicated to spouses who are truly deserving of maintenance and alimony. We have to find a more effective means of prosecuting ex-spouses who default on maintenance fees that they are rightfully supposed to provide. I have encountered cases in which the women had to spend a lot of time frantically trying to secure much-needed child support and financial support from their irresponsible ex-husbands.",9,307,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00307
2016-02-29-T-019,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Sometimes, a woman has to go to court every few months to get her ex-husband to pay up. In one of those cases, a woman had her case drag on for 10 years and heard by over 20 judges. Imagine! Ten years! Ten years of suffering! Ten years of uncertainty! She had given up her career for the sake of their four children, and upon divorce, was left to raise them on her own without monetary contribution from her ex-husband. Imprisoning the man for a token few days as a punishment is hardly beneficial if he is determined to make the life of his ex-wife very difficult. I think a woman should not have to haul her husband off to Court repeatedly if he is habitually paying maintenance fees late or not paying up at all. His poor track record should be more than enough for immediate tougher action. Right now, it is by definition the men who are defaulting, but in the future we could see women default as well. Reforms in this aspect will benefit spouses who are awarded alimony, whether male or female.",10,308,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00308

He said that a faster, simpler and more effective system is being planned to get defaulters to pay up. I look forward to an update about this new system. The process of seeking maintenance from an unwilling hand is undoubtedly a gruelling and worrisome one. I hope more support can be given to those long-suffering spouses. There should also be pro bono lawyers to help with the legal matters. There should be readily accessible support networks that they can tap on, with counsellors who can offer guidance and help to find fuss-free assistance for a range of related issues from financial aid to housing, health and school matters.",11,309,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00309

Here is where I want to touch on visitation rights to children. This is something that needs to be addressed in the parenting programme as part of a post-divorce plan where all the arrangements concerning the child are mapped out, from visitation schedules, decision- making to parenting responsibilities and more. Additionally, make counselling and support programmes for children of divorced marriages comprehensive and easily accessible. Counsellors must work closely with parents to ensure that the children are attending the sessions and programmes as regularly as required with the goal of adapting well to their new life with one parent.",13,311,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00311

First, those ex-husbands who cannot work due to health reasons will be able to seek maintenance from their ex-wife. Today, there are many women who are as successful as men in the workplace. Hence, we can gradually move towards gender equality in terms of paying maintenance. Second, we will make it mandatory for divorcing parents to attend specialised Parenting Programme to minimise the impact of divorce on their children.",15,313,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00313

This is especially relevant for those who face financial difficulty in the first place and can ill afford to take leave from work or from taking care of their children to go to the Family Courts to make the application in person and attend Court for the subsequent mentions or for the trials. And in the case of ""incapacitated husbands"", I am not sure if he is physically able to make the application at the Family Courts should his ex-wife default.",4,318,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00318

That, number one, the application process for maintenance complaints to be made more convenient for an ex-husband or ex-wife who wants to serve a private summons on their ex-spouse who has defaulted on maintenance payments. An example could be to have the application done at family service centres and in the case of an incapacitated husband, that a proxy should be allowed.",7,321,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00321

2016-02-29-T-019,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar),"On maintenance for incapacitated husbands, whilst I consider it as a right and humane thing to do, there are some who argue that we are drifting towards the equal rights issue where, in the past, such responsibility rested solely on the men with the traditional role of men supporting women instead of the vice versa. Some have also asked if this is going to be the beginning of change towards equal rights with more amendments to come on the Women's Charter to equalise in all aspects. I can understand this argument because with our Asian-values based society here, we have yet to reach the level of gender equality to be looking at equal rights in all aspects. For example, women are still under-represented at senior management levels, child-rearing and care-giving responsibilities are still considered roles for women with many young women having to put their jobs on hold and also, some women are not paid equally as their male counterparts for similar jobs and so on.",2,324,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00324
2016-02-29-T-019,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar),"Another issue with this amendment, Madam, is the resultant burden being too excessive for some, if not all, of the divorced wives with incapacitated spouses. This would be especially so for those with young children. It will definitely be doubly difficult for a wife to look after the children and also the long-term needs of the incapacitated ex-husband. In the past, the siblings or even the parents will take care of or share the care of the incapacitated spouses. With this Bill, this past norm of extended family's responsibility will be shifted to the ex-wife and thus the possibility of leaving the entire long-term care to her. Another point is that the extra long-term burden on the wife may indeed disadvantage her in getting into another relationship. It is because the potential new partner may not be comfortable with having his future wife supporting another person permanently.",3,325,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00325

On the other hand, children troubled with parental divorce are particularly prone to develop problems with anger, disobedience, rule violations, prolonged sadness and even depression. Their performance in school can be adversely affected too. The emotional, social, health and economic costs associated with marital conflict and family dissolution causing delinquency, depression, poverty and crime and, especially, the devastating harm done to children have been well documented.",5,327,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00327

This is a good thing as divorces here are on the rise. The absolute number of divorces was 1,551 in 1980 and 6,861 in 2014, 7,307 including annulments. MSF had previously published that marriages involving younger grooms, regardless of the age of the brides, were particularly vulnerable to divorces. Thus, this Mandatory Marriage Preparation Programme may be useful in preventing divorces.

This will strengthen marriages more before they deteriorate or start to breakup. Thus, I am suggesting not just giving pre-marriage courses but three further subsequent marriage courses in communication, conflict resolution and marriage enhancements together with parenting courses for minors. Can MSF also set up a fund to make it easier for couples to have such courses without monetary constraints?",12,334,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00334

When certain characteristics or signs, such as wide age gap, foreign bride and lower income, of a marriage of convenience exist, there should be extra measures in place to determine such applications.

When enacted in 1961, the Women's Charter was a momentous and courageous legislation that swam against the tide of opinions and the traditional values of society. I would like to remind the House that the traditional values of Asian society just 60 years ago was the patriarchal treatment of women and the widespread acceptance of polygamy. The preservation of the so-called traditional family was not the original intent of the Charter. On the contrary, the Women's Charter instituted the modern moral view of the family as a cooperative partnership between husband and wife who have equal rights as independent individuals and have equal responsibilities in caring and providing for the children.",1,341,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00341
2016-02-29-T-019,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"It is a waste that the present and recent amendments are cautious reactions to rising divorce rates. These were opportunities to replicate the visionary spirit of the framers of the original Charter in using the law to shape society for the empowerment of its members. The main changes proposed by the present Bill attempt to deal with two sets of problems besetting the modern family following the principles of the original Charter. The first set concerns the better protection of the well-being and interests of children and follows the principle of parental responsibility. The Bill gives the Courts powers to order divorcing parents to attend the Mandatory Parenting Programme (MPP) and restates who can apply for a protection order in situations of family violence. The second set follows the principle of gender equality and makes incapacitated ex-husbands eligible for receiving maintenance from their ex-wives. The proposed changes, each on their own and on the whole, do not go far enough to plug the widening cracks and empower the modern family in increasingly trying times.",2,342,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00342
2016-02-29-T-019,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"On the matter of parental responsibility and better protection of children, I would like to make four points. The first point is on the MPP. My worry is that divorcing parents would go through the motion of attending the MPP. To be effective, the MPP should be tailored to parenting in divorced situations targeting both custodial and non-custodial parents. It should be integrated with mandatory mediation and counselling of divorcing parents at the Child Focused Resolution Centre and should stretch across the pre-divorce and post-divorce periods.",3,343,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00343
2016-02-29-T-019,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Furthermore, the MPP and the counselling should try to involve the children as much as possible. Children should not be treated simply as passive victims whose problems could be solved by positive parenting. Article 12 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child states that we should ""assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child"" and that these views be ""given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child"". In divorcing situations, children should be and could be active stakeholders whose participation in the process could help to protect their interests and help them achieve some emotional closure.",4,344,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00344
2016-02-29-T-019,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second point I would like to raise is that while parental courses, mediation and counselling are good soft solutions persuading couples to go through amicable divorce in the interest of their children, they do not solve the hard problem of ex-husbands defaulting on maintenance support. The 2011 amendments to the Charter giving the Courts powers to impose financial counselling, community service, attachment of earnings and credit bureau recovery have only managed to cause a dent in the problem. It has been reported that the number of applications for enforcement orders on maintenance had only dropped from 1,900 in 2009 to 1,700 in 2013. This means thousands of children remain at serious financial risk.",5,345,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00345
2016-02-29-T-019,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Repeated stalling and refusal to pay maintenance could be the continuation of abusive relationships, specifically economic abuse to deprive other members of the family the sustenance to maintain a decent standard of living. The Charter continues to fail to recognise this as a form of family violence. Even if we allow that most ex-husbands who default on maintenance simply failed to put responsibility to their children as priority in their economic affairs, this goes against the Charter's core principle of equal parental responsibility. Whatever it is, the children suffer and may grow resentful of their parents.",6,346,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00346
2016-02-29-T-019,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The principle of equal parental responsibility requires the law to make sure that the cost of recovery of maintenance does not reach unreasonable levels and is not laid on the single parent with custody of the children. There have been cases of mothers who have to drag their children to visit the Courts many times to get their maintenance, as they cannot afford legal representation. Many families end up in economic hardship because social service organisations are unable to help as long as the maintenance order is there to be enforced. The problem is precisely enforcement.",7,347,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00347
2016-02-29-T-019,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"This is not a new proposal, as women's organisations have proposed it previously. The Government can help tremendously vulnerable divorcee families to protect the interest of the children by setting up a central agency with strong enforcement powers to recover maintenance on behalf of the families. These powers could include intensive debt collection, investigative surveillance, litigation and overseas travel bans, as in the Australian example. A central agency, let us call it the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Families, could also serve another purpose, which is to provide support to divorcee families dependent on maintenance so that they would not fall into the poverty trap while waiting for the recovery of owed maintenance. The Commissioner for the Maintenance of Families could provide means-tested advance support capped at a quantum to meet basic needs while the owed maintenance is being recovered.",8,348,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00348
2016-02-29-T-019,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"My third point concerns maintenance for single unwed parents. The Charter could also give the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Families powers to take a proactive approach in helping single unwed parents, especially the mothers, to claim child maintenance from the biological father. This is in line with the principle of parental responsibility, as the onus for raising children out of wedlock should not fall on the women while men easily avoid taking responsibility. It is also important for the protection of the children since they are the ones who suffer most and should not be punished for the mistakes of their parents. Many single unwed mothers, because of their socio-economic background or due to the difficult situation of stigmatisation and isolation they are caught in, are not aware that they could apply for child maintenance from the fathers.",9,349,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00349
2016-02-29-T-019,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"If the worry is that helping single unwed parents will cause the moral hazard of promoting more children born out of wedlock, then the Government should know that studies have shown that enforcing child support for single unwed mothers, when coupled with widespread education and publicity, can reduce the rate of non-marital pregnancies. Enforcing men's parental responsibility has the knock-on effect of making men responsible in their overall behaviour towards women.",10,350,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00350
2016-02-29-T-019,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"My fourth point concerns the tackling of family violence. Is there any evidence that the ""Many Helping Hands"" approach has helped to reduce family violence? It seems that spousal violence, which makes up the majority of family violence cases, is taking place earlier in the first five years of marriage rather than in the later years of marriage. Family violence remains a pernicious problem. The Government's approach is to strengthen the touch-points that help identify family violence so that early intervention through counselling can be achieved. It is said that the legal route is not the best solution, so the Courts and applications for Personal Protection Orders (PPOs) should be the last resort.",11,351,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00351

This Bill restates the persons who can apply for PPOs, which remain severely limited to the very victims of violence or the persons responsible for the victims if they are below the age of 21 years. However, women and mothers responsible for children being abused are often trapped in precarious positions of recurring violence. They often experience helplessness and cannot act to protect themselves and their families.",12,352,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00352

Family members, relatives and friends who are explicitly authorised by the victims are in a good position to know when violence takes place and should be empowered to apply for PPOs. Doctors are also an important touch-point. Right now, the onus is on victims to tell doctors about abuse and request a report for possible PPO application. By the time the violence results in physical injury, it is at the critical stage. Doctors should be empowered to report cases to the Police and draw up medical reports without request. In many jurisdictions, mandatory reporting by doctors to law enforcement has helped to mitigate family violence.",13,353,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00353

Allowing incapacitated ex-husbands to claim maintenance from their wives is a belated concession to the principle of gender equality. The call to allow ex-husbands to apply for maintenance was first raised in 1996. The Government rejected it on grounds of tradition, that it is the duty of husband to maintain the wife. The same call was rejected six years ago on account that society is not ready for gender equality when it comes to maintenance. This is a double irony since the Women's Charter was enacted regardless of whether traditional polygamous society was ready for the modern nuclear family. Gender equality was enshrined in the Charter despite tradition or the readiness of society.",16,356,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00356

Thus, the division of matrimonial assets must be made in ""just and equitable"" proportions giving due credit to non-financial contributions to marriage. Realising this principle of gender equality today means doing two things. Men should be given full rights to being eligible for maintenance and we should allow the Courts to make gender-neutral decisions regarding asset division and maintenance based on discernments of financial and non-financial contribution to the matrimonial household and also potential earning power. Second, the law should factor in opportunity cost in lost earnings due to being a homemaker in the determination of maintenance, especially given that men and women have full access to the labour market.",17,357,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00357

This Part is even more outdated than the Women's Charter as it reflects the old colonial Women and Girls' Protection Ordinance. The world in the 21st Century has changed, and as scandals regarding the sexual grooming and sexual trafficking of boys indicate, we need to update this Part urgently. In fact, Part XI is an anomaly and its inclusion in the Charter conflates prostitution and sexual exploitation with the family.

There have been calls for the Women's Charter and all other legislations dealing with the family, including the Children and Young Persons Act, to be combined into a landmark piece called The Family Charter.

2016-02-29-T-019,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Mdm Speaker, the Women's Charter is an important piece of legislation in Singapore. It was passed in 1961 to protect and advance the rights of women and girls in Singapore. At that time, the typical household division of labour was such that women would take care of the family at home, while men go out to work and bring the bread home. Many women, due to the lack of education and little control over or access to resources then, were often bullied and in worse instances, faced domestic violence. Therefore, I believe the Women's Charter passed in 1961 was a progressive and much needed piece of legislation.",1,365,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00365

Singaporean women today are driven and well educated. We are capable of holding our own at workplaces. And with jobs, this means that we are or can be financially independent, generally speaking. Moreover, we have also observed a small, but growing, group of men who give up their jobs to devote their full time to caring for their families. Therefore, it is timely to review the Women's Charter and update parts of the Charter to offer somewhat more gender balance. In this case, inserting a provision to allow men, very specifically incapacitated men who cannot work and support themselves, to apply for maintenance from their ex-wives is a step in the right direction.",2,366,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00366

2016-02-29-T-019,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Firstly, what safeguards will the MSF put in place to ensure that even though the applicant is incapacitated and appears to be the weaker party, maintenance will be granted only on legitimate grounds?

She has been working, she has been financially independent but her financial prowess and position were simply not strong enough for her to afford the payment of the home after the divorce because of the compulsory, mandatory requirement to sell off the matrimonial flat. And having custody of her two sons means she will have to take care of them.

Otherwise, while we may have moved a step forward on the gender equality front, we risk regressing a step backward in terms of protecting vulnerable women – the very group of people this Charter was enacted to protect in the 1960s. We must recognise and support the group of women who had sacrificed the prime of their lives to care for their families and raise their children and, as a result, left themselves in a very vulnerable position.

2016-02-29-T-019,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Divorce is a battle of attrition as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has rightly pointed out. Children are the losers as they bear the brunt of the collateral damage in any fight between father and mother. It is not fair to the children. Some may be more resilient and march on bravely in the face of a newly radicalised family environment but there are many more out there who are left broken, bitter by divorce. In many of the cases I have seen at MPS and at block visits, and I am sure many Members can attest to this, it is the children who need the most help.",6,392,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00392

It was stated that half of Family Court's and 70% of Syariah Court's cases involved families with children and these figures continue to climb.

Wallerstein, who carried out studies on the effects of divorce on the children over a 25-year period, ""Divorce is a life-transforming experience. After divorce, childhood is different. Adolescence is different. Adulthood – with the decision to marry, to have or have not children – is different. Whether the outcome is good or bad, the whole trajectory of an individual's life is profoundly altered by the divorce experience"".",9,395,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00395

Our current law requires parents with children under 21 years of age to attend mediation and counselling after a divorce writ is filed. But the proposed amendment makes it compulsory to attend the programme before filing for divorce; this is welcome. Through this Mandatory Parenting Programme one can only hope that the child's physical and mental needs are taken care of by both parents. The programme would be more fruitful if feuding parents could patch up after these counselling sessions, which should be introduced to those considering divorce.",10,396,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00396

The late Mdm Chan advocated for Marriage Counselling Courts in 1959, this came only to fruition in 1995 with the setting up of the Family Justice Courts.

This is one Bill that has brought by-partisan support from across different parties. It is therefore incumbent upon us to honour and treasure this Charter and timely that we make the necessary amendments so that it protects not only women but their families, and marriages too.

2016-02-29-T-019,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. At the outset, I would like to declare that I am a family lawyer. In my practice, I have assisted many clients in their divorce proceedings. One of the issues that is usually very difficult for couples to deal with is the arrangements in relation to the custody, care and control and access of the children upon divorce. We have often heard stories of how the children become embroiled in their parents' acrimonious battles in Court and become emotional pawns in the situation. The Minister earlier alluded to some examples.",1,420,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00420
2016-02-29-T-019,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),I have also encountered first-hand parties who let their children read their affidavits and those of their soon-to-be former spouse on the pre-text that the children should know what is happening. Or those who make their children write notes or letters to Court to say that they do not want to be with the other parent.,2,421,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00421
2016-02-29-T-019,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In my view, such actions are harmful to the children's mental development in the long run. The negativity which the parents show towards each other can have a traumatic impact on the children and usually, these children are unable to voice out their emotions to the parents. I recall a Family Court Judge sharing in one of the lectures I attended some years back. As adults, when we are unhappy or stressed, most of us can reach out for help, talk about our emotions with our family and friends. However, children may not be able to articulate their emotions as well and may not even have the opportunities to do so. Therefore, the divorce process should be child-centric and protect the interests of the children.",3,422,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00422
2016-02-29-T-019,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I would often advise my clients to try to put aside their grievances when it comes to matters relating to their children and always give paramount interest and consideration to their children. For the parents, this is actually easier said than done. I have come to realise that most times, parties are too caught up with their emotions to be able to think rationally in the situation. They are angry, hurt and sometimes even vengeful. It is important to put them in the right state of mind before they begin their divorce proceedings.",4,423,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00423
2016-02-29-T-019,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Over the years, there have been many developments at the Family Court to gradually introduce mandatory counselling and mediation for parties with young children. Parents are encouraged to resolve the issues on custody, care and control and access as early as possible. I am pleased to see further developments in the form of the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter, in particular the addition of the new section 94A to prescribe a Parenting Programme for appropriate parties before the commencement of divorce proceedings. I believe that the introduction of a Parenting Programme will be useful to remind parents of the impact of divorce on their children and the need to prioritise their children's interests in their decisions.",5,424,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00424
2016-02-29-T-019,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I note that in the proposed section 94A, provisions are made for exemptions from the Parenting Programme. This is clearly necessary as such programmes may not be relevant for divorcing parties who do not have children and there is also some room for the Court to make appropriate orders in certain circumstances, for example, when a case needs to be expedited where there is domestic violence. I would like to seek clarification though on the phrase ""excluded party"" at the proposed section 94A sub-section 3(b) and the group of people who would fall into this category, aside from those without children. I think it is useful to clarify the intent of excluding certain groups from the Parenting Programme, especially if we want to ensure that as many parents as possible are educated about the impact of divorce on their children.",6,425,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00425
2016-02-29-T-019,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The intent of introducing a Parenting Programme is clearly noble. However, for the initiative to be truly successful, the Parenting Programme itself must be effective. In implementing this programme, I hope attention will be given to develop a curriculum that goes to the core of the problem and is going to be useful for the parents. I thank the Minister for earlier giving an insight into some of the items that would be covered in the programme. Such programmes should address the parents' needs, cater to the various family situations and be simple enough to be understood by all.",7,426,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00426

2016-02-29-T-019,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I would like to highlight that there must be sufficient capacity to schedule parties for programmes in a timely manner so that the divorce proceeding is not delayed. If there are insufficient slots, for example, parties would have to wait before they can attend the programme and they may be delayed in filing their divorce papers. This can cause angst and frustration amongst the already stressed and highly emotional couples. Divorce is an agonising process and we should not delay or complicate the procedures unnecessarily.",9,428,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00428

Where children are involved, whether they like it or not, couples will continue to be in a long-term relationship.

It is, therefore, important to have processes that in some way ""heal"" parties to help them cope with the situation.",10,429,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00429
2016-02-29-T-019,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I believe that counselling and mediation are key ""healing"" processes. It is useful to extend the variety of such processes. I note that section 50 also extends to all proceedings under the Women's Charter. These involve disputes between families, between spouses or former spouses, between siblings and between parent and child. Familial relationships cannot be terminated and family members who are in dispute need processes which help to repair their relationships. I, therefore, support the proposal to empower the Court to also direct parties or their children to attend family support programmes and activities in appropriate circumstances.",11,430,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00430

We need to continue building the family justice ecosystem. In particular, for divorce, we need to continue on the existing efforts of developing specialised lawyers who are equipped with appropriate knowledge and skills to handle divorces and other family disputes. Specialised lawyers can promote collaborative divorce, which encourages parties to discuss and resolve their disputes amicably. When parties can resolve matters on their own and avoid litigation, there is a greater chance that the relationship can remain cordial and their children are spared from the acrimony.",12,431,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00431

I acknowledge that while many Singaporean women have made good progress, this has not been uniform across all groups of women.",14,433,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00433
2016-02-29-T-019,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"While the Ministry takes steps to keep pace with societal changes, I believe there is a need to recognise that the majority of women still lag behind their male counterparts, especially financially. A wife is more likely to have given up her career or job advancement, to care for the family. Very often, we still see the traditional dynamics of the woman being the principal care-giver to her children, even when both husband and wife are working. So, post-divorce, such women are financially usually more vulnerable.",15,434,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00434

The Women's Charter was enacted in 1961 with the intent to protect and advance the rights of women and girls in Singapore. It included regulations on the relationship between husband and wife, and the relationship between parents and their children, termination of marriages, division of matrimonial assets and maintenance. The Women's Charter also provides protection against family violence and penalty for offences against women and girls. Several amendments have been made since 1961, with the latest amendment made in 2011 to strengthen the enforcement of maintenance orders, provide improved support to those affected by divorces, as well as address emerging trends on marriages and divorce.",1,438,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00438

Like many who have spoken before me, I think this is a very important step as it does take the interest of the child that is involved in the divorce, at the centre. The Minister has shared that much of the content of this programme is around the care of the child, housing and schools, which are very important. But I do want to ask for more elaboration on the duration of the Mandatory Parenting Programme. The amendment also indicates that the person appointed to conduct the parenting programme will determine whether any person that attends the programme has completed the programme.

The amendment proposed in sections 69 and 113 of the Bill is to allow incapacitated husbands or ex-husbands to claim spousal maintenance from their wife or ex-wives if they are incapacitated during the marriage to the extent that he is unable to work to support himself and at the time of the application for the maintenance is heard.,4,441,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00441
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I feel that this amendment is fair as it recognises the support expected of husband and wife during times of illness and disability. This is in line with the spirit of the Women's Charter, as outlined in the Rights and Duties of Husband and Wife in Part VI, clause 46, where it says that ""Upon the solemnisation of marriage, the husband and the wife shall be mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union and in caring and providing for the children.""",5,442,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00442
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I have personally seen several cases during my MPS where wives have left their husbands after they were diagnosed with serious illnesses like cancer and they were left with no means to support themselves. This amendment, however, does assume that the wife has an income and the means to be able to afford the maintenance. This may or may not always be the case. And as the wife will most likely need to provide for the children as the husband is incapacitated, this may also put a heavy financial strain on her, even if she is working. We must also recognise that many women do make career choices to either slow down their careers or even leave their jobs for some period of time, if not permanently, when they have young children. This does disrupt their career, re-entry to the workforce, as well as their income. The Court, in deciding whether to order the wife to provide maintenance for her husband, I do hope will take into account her financial circumstances and the need to provide for herself and her children.",6,443,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00443
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Regarding protection for women, girls and residents at places of safety, and professionals engaged in protection work, while all of us are talking about the progress that we see in Singapore, I think the Bill recognises the need for protection of vulnerable women and girls. The sad reality is that they do need protection as their abusers are usually their family members.",7,444,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00444
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Based on a study done by PAVE in 2013, the most common form of family violence in Singapore is spousal abuse victims and these victims who are physically or psychologically abused by their spouses made up 72% of all new cases. The study also discovered that while victims of spousal abuse came from all age groups, the majority are females in their 30s and 40s. The study also found that spousal victims and abusers were better educated. As the abusers in these cases are men, they will be, in all probability, considerably physically stronger than them, and, as they are family, they will have also emotional control over the women. Thus, a shelter or safe place which provides for their requisite safety is imperative for them, not just to ensure that they are physically safe, but that they are also given peace of mind to pick up the pieces so that they can continue with their lives. They do need reassurance that their abusers will not be able to locate them when they are having sanctuary in shelters.",8,445,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00445
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The Straits Times news article by Janice Tai published in November 2013 on the study also helped to give some insight on the rise of family violence. I quote  ""The worsening problem of family violence can be seen by the rise in the number of such cases that went to court. In 1995, the Family Court heard 978 such cases. By last year, the figure had more than tripled to 3,200.""",9,446,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00446
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Recognising the realities and the increasing use of social media, the amendments made in sections 177A and 153 seek to protect the identity of vulnerable women and girls and persons in protection work and, hence, ensuring their safety. Section 177A also prohibits the publication or broadcast of any information in the mass and social media that would reveal or is likely to identify the location of the shelter or residential facility or their residents. This will prevent perpetrators of violence from harassing, intimidating or harming the persons residing and working at these places. This amendment does provide for the State to also take action against serious breaches that would compromise the safety of residents and staff. Section 153 is also amended to extend prohibition on the publishing of information which may lead to the identification of women and girls in certain in-camera Court proceedings to also include online media and social media.",10,447,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00447
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"There has been much discussion today around the question, ""Do we still need the Women's Charter?""",11,448,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00448
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"When the Women's Charter was passed in 1961, the intent was to protect the rights of women. We must recognise that, since then, there has been much progress made in Singapore and we have seen strong advancement of women; from education to their participation in the workforce. Some may then argue that there is not a need for the Women's Charter or that this is discriminating against men.",12,449,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00449
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I agree that there has, indeed, been great progress in the advancement of women in Singapore in education, health, employment and income. However, there are still several areas that women lag behind men. Many of our hon Members have touched on this, and this includes salary, labour force participation, especially in the economically productive years, in senior management, in decision-making roles in organisations, including Boards. While we are all seeing a trend in Singapore of men increasingly playing a bigger role in the family and involvement in care giving, in the majority of households, women still play the primary care-giver role.",13,450,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00450
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"In Singapore, there are almost the same numbers of men and women attending university and obtaining degrees. But we still do, however, see many women leaving the workforce to take care of their children and family members. There are still fewer women in senior leadership roles in organisations as compared to men. While we see greater participation in the workforce, and the numbers have been very encouraging especially in the last few years − the female labour force participation rate rose significantly from 51.3% in 2004 to 58.6% in 2014 − but if we actually look at the female labour force participation of women aged 25 years to 39 years, this has dropped significantly as compared to the total number of women and single women labour force participation.",14,451,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00451
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So, it is likely that these women left their work during their prime years in their career to take care of their children and family. We are also seeing greater participation of husbands in the home, as I have shared earlier, and some have even chosen to be stay-at-home parent. However, while this trend will likely increase, for now, women continue to take on a greater role and family caring responsibilities.",15,452,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00452
2016-02-29-T-019,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The Women's Charter is more than just about the relationship between husband and wife and that of between parents and their children, and division of matrimonial assets when marriages fail. There are still vulnerable groups of women and girls that need protection. So, I believe that there is continued relevance of the Women's Charter in Singapore today. The amendments proposed in this Bill are balanced and seek to recognise the spirit of the Women's Charter while addressing the changing realities in society and the family.

2016-02-29-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"With the latest amendments, I find it encouraging and progressive that, amongst other things, the proposed amendments will include allowing for incapacitated men to seek spousal support from their ex-wives. I believe the numbers to be small, though the Ministry does not reveal the figures of those that may be impacted. Moreover, the Court will still take into consideration the financial ability of the woman first before deciding if her ex-spouse is legally entitled to maintenance from his wife. I think this is the right thing to do.",2,455,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00455
2016-02-29-T-019,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Mdm Speaker, today, I would like to speak about two red herrings on this issue. I am mindful that it is still mostly women and their children who need help to recover maintenance/alimony fees from their ex-husbands. Hence, the critics of this Bill who say that we should be more concerned about this larger group rather than the smaller one, I think, missed the point. First, the amendment does not change this level of help. Second, the group may be small, but their cause is no less just.",3,456,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00456

This is triple the number from 2006. One thousand and six hundred of them cited childcare as the main reason for being out of the workforce − more than double the number in 2006.

The gap is still there, but it is steadily narrowing over 30 years. Certainly, nothing wrong nor surprising with these trends. Empirically, the argument is irrefutable. First, there are increasing role reversals. Second, the economics of home care and paid work follow this reversal.

2016-02-29-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In particular, I believe that special consideration should be given to cases of domestic violence. I understand from AWARE that their experience is that the abused spouse is usually the one who wants the divorce whereas the abusive spouse may resist.

The Bill amends the Charter so that spousal maintenance is available to men, but only where they have been incapacitated and are unable to support themselves.

2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would also like to highlight that this idea of a Family Charter, was something our Ministry has looked at as well. It is something, as pointed out by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, that we keep on the table. We have looked at it intently, and as we have mentioned, there are different views on how we should interpret this.",5,496,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00496
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"But what I would like to highlight is this  the emphasis on the family remains. Just because we do not call it a Family Charter does not in itself mean that we are not placing emphasis on the family. For all intents and purposes, the bulk of what we are setting out in the Women's Charter is aimed at supporting families, and moreover, whilst the Act is so named, its provisions are in fact gender-neutral, except in the areas of maintenance – which many Members have raised your views on as well – protection of women and girls, vice, prostitution activities. In other areas of the law, others are also covered. For example, boys are covered under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act and also under Children & Young Persons Act (CYPA).",6,497,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00497
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We noted the points raised and this is something that we will continue to review as time goes by. We have made important changes. The Women's Charter, when it was first launched, was a landmark Charter. Over the years, important changes have been made. This time round, important changes are being made as well.",7,498,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00498
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"While in some areas, we are taking calibrated steps forward, society, like I said, is not static. We will continue to monitor how society evolves, we will continue to consult and we will continue to look at the suggestions and ideas brought up by many Members. We do not preclude future changes.",8,499,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00499
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Let me move on to some of the specific points raised in the debate.,9,500,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00500
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Members have given their support to mandate marriage preparation programme for minor couples. Mr Alex Yam suggested that these young couples also attend a parenting programme. Indeed, the mandatory marriage preparation programme covers aspects of parenting. It also helps the couple to understand how their relationship will evolve when they start a family and have children. If the bride is expecting, grandparents are also invited to join in as extended family support is critical to the soon-to-be young parents.",10,501,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00501
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Dr Lily Neo would be pleased to know that our enhanced marriage support framework will also help young couples to address challenges during their marriage. This includes link-ups to appropriate parenting programmes and support.,11,502,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00502
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Many Members expressed empathy for children caught in the middle of their parents' divorce.,12,503,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00503
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Ms Jessica Tan spoke on the importance of child-centricity, and I really could not agree more. This is why we want to amend the Women's Charter to require parents contemplating divorce to attend the Mandatory Parenting Programme. Dr Lily Neo shared about the negative impact on children and highlighted the need for assistance to ensure that children do not fall through the cracks.",13,504,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00504
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,My Ministry appointed the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies to provide a continuum of care to divorced families. There is a very strong child-centric focus.,14,505,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00505
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would like to thank Ms Rahayu Mahzam for sharing with us her experiences on the realities of what actually happens. Many of us come into contact with such cases as well, either through friends or the residents we meet.",15,506,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00506
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I think it is important that children remain the centre of our efforts. Giving voice to children comes in many ways but we need to be careful because as we all know, sometimes in an acrimonious divorce process, children become part of the game. They are being pitted, back and forth, between the couples. That can be very disturbing and can have a tremendous impact on the children.",16,507,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00507
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"What we want to make sure is that throughout the whole process, the children's interests are looked after. We want to make sure that they can undergo individual counselling. They may also attend an evidence-based programme called ""Children-In-Between"", which equips children with the skills to manage their feelings and develop resilience. Parents are also asked to attend, so that they reinforce the skills learnt by their children. Some of the stories I shared were very much surfaced through some of these processes where the children are encouraged to speak up so they could articulate their concerns and the things that trouble them.",17,508,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00508
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Since the programme started in 2015, close to 150 children and their parents have benefited. The overwhelming majority – about 96% – reported a reduction in stress. But that is not something that we take for granted; it is something that we need to continue to work on.",18,509,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00509
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Ms Jessica Tan asked for some details of the divorce support programmes. I will just very quickly run through how we are approaching it. We have four Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (DSSAs). The Mandatory Parenting Programme will include a couple of things  to make sure that there are considerations on financial challenges involved; housing and living arrangements in a divorce; child custody and child access; and joint agreement on a workable parenting plan.,19,510,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00510
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"There are face-to-face sessions. There are also counselling made available to rebuild the marriage and, as mentioned earlier, the ""Children-in-Between"" programme. There is also a Parenting PACT which is a consultation session for divorced parents with minor children, designed to help parents understand the impact of a divorce on their children, learn co-parenting strategies and so on. There is a whole range of support being brought to bear, before filing for divorce, during the whole process itself and thereafter. We will be quite happy to explore other measures that we can put in place to support families in this process.",20,511,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00511
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Louis Ng suggested that the Mandatory Parenting Programme should be automatically waived for victims of family violence in order to expedite the divorce proceedings and highlighted the particular profile of the families undergoing these difficulties.,21,512,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00512
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,I think there is even greater need for these divorcing parties to be directed to receive help. We have measures in place to minimise the risk to victims of abuse.,22,513,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00513
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Firstly, families facing family violence will attend this programme at the Family Violence Specialist Agencies where the staff are trained to handle cases involving family violence. Secondly, in cases where it is beneficial to the family and child for divorce proceedings to be expedited, section 94A(4) empowers the courts to allow divorce proceedings to continue even when the parent has not completed the programme.",23,514,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00514
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The idea is that while we do recognise the challenges that families face when violence occurs, we also recognise that these families need help and to intervene where we can. We also make sure that clauses are available, steps are available for families to be assisted even when this violence is perpetuated and continues to be perpetuated.",24,515,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00515
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Another area that garnered much interest was spousal maintenance. Members have put forth a wide spectrum of views. Members such as Mr Seah Kian Peng, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and Mr Louis Ng spoke about moving towards a more gender neutral approach. I hear you. I fully understand because we do see instances where there might seem to be a compelling need to move along these grounds while on the other hand, as I have highlighted, there are also other views.",25,516,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00516
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam expressed her concerns against it, reminding us that many women are still vulnerable. Her sentiments echoed a The Straits Times commentary in October last year which was titled ""A Reality Check in Gender Equality"". Let me quote",26,517,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00517
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"""Given the reality – supported by surveys – that the burden of care for children and the elderly still falls largely on the shoulders of women, the current law remains relevant.""",27,518,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00518
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I think attitudes are changing. They are gradually shifting towards greater gender neutrality, but we believe at this stage, it is best to not rush and force the pace.",28,519,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00519
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I also heard concerns about extending maintenance to incapacitated husbands such as those shared by Ms Tin Pei Ling. The scenario of a woman of lesser means struggling to support herself and the children is a big concern. What more if such a woman had to maintain her incapacitated ex-husband. To reiterate, the incapacitated husband must meet all the criteria set out before he can apply for maintenance from the wife.",29,520,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00520
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Even if all these criteria are met, it does not mean that the husband or ex-husband will automatically be entitled to maintenance. Dr Lily Neo expressed concerns for women who may be caught up in these situations where it will be a strain for them to provide maintenance for incapacitated husbands as well. So, the Court will have to consider all circumstances of the case, including the income and earning capacity of the wife or ex-wife, the financial needs of both parties and the needs of the children. This is no different from the considerations for maintenance for wives and ex-wives, where they are also not automatically entitled to maintenance, as highlighted by some of the examples that we have mentioned earlier.",30,521,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00521
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To sum up, while we may review this in future, the proposal to extend maintenance only to incapacitated men is a calibrated measure. It strikes a balance at this stage of our societal development.",31,522,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00522
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As rightly pointed out by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Sun Xueling, there must be a clear priority to better enforce maintenance payments and to improve the process. And indeed, I fully agree with many Members who have cited many examples that you have come across. It is very agonising for an individual to repeatedly go to the Courts because the ex-spouse vindictively does not want to pay up. This is why the way we want to approach this – is to set in place to introduce in the Courts the Maintenance Record Officer which would take place later this year. The purpose of this Officer is to assist the Courts to better assess if a defaulter is incorrigible, and therefore allow the Courts to take firm action against him, if so. Let me assure the House that we are going to do more to stop such irresponsibility.",32,523,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00523
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,We will also constantly and continually explore how to improve the processes and to make it less onerous for all those affected. This is something we recognise and we work closely with the Family Justice Courts on this as well.,33,524,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00524
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Let me now address the issue raised by Dr Lily Neo on upstream measures to prevent sham marriages. All couples marrying under Women's Charter must undergo document verification and make a statutory declaration on matters relating to the intended marriage. Where there are doubts, ROM staff will interview the couple separately and explain the consequences of entering into a marriage of convenience. We have found this useful, intervening at this stage. Also, the Registrar will not issue any marriage licence to the couple unless the Registrar is satisfied that the intended marriage meets the conditions under the Women's Charter.",34,525,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00525
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Louis Ng asked if the decision to void a marriage should be subjected to the judicial process. Marriages are void only when at least one party is successfully charged and deemed guilty by the Courts under section 57C of the Immigration Act for entering into a marriage of convenience. Such cases would have been scrutinised through the judicial process. It is only consistent that such marriages are consequentially and automatically void, given that the act of entering into such a marriage is an offence.",35,526,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00526
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Louis Ng suggested that all persons under 21 years be allowed to apply for a Personal Protection Order (PPO) and Domestic Exclusion Orders (DEO) for themselves against anyone in their household, without the need for parental consent. It would be in a minor's interests to have a reliable adult apply on their behalf. The application may be made by the parent who is not the perpetrator of violence. If the parents or guardians are themselves the violence perpetrators, a relative or any social worker appointed by the Minister, can step in, without the need for consent from the minor's parents or guardians.",36,527,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00527
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Louis Ng also asked about the circumstances in which the Director of Social Welfare can detain vulnerable female minors aged 16 to 21 years old in places of safety. All cases which come to the attention of the Director are thoroughly investigated. A girl will only be admitted to a place of safety if the Director is satisfied it will be in her best interests. For example, if it is unsafe for the girl to remain with her immediate family or if she may engage in morally risky behaviours.",37,528,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00528
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Louis Ng also asked if married minors who have suffered domestic violence can seek refuge at places of safety. Yes, they can seek accommodation and support from crisis shelters.",38,529,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00529
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Alex Yam asked about incidents where the security of places of safety was compromised and measures to protect the residents and professionals. For the safety of its residents, crisis shelters are housed in secured premises with closed-circuit television cameras. Thus far, there have been no serious breaches. There were two instances of disturbances at the shelters known to MSF in the last couple of years. In both instances, the Police took swift action as the shelters had established good networks with them. No one was hurt in both incidents but I do take on-board your concerns.",39,530,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00530
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, our family provides us meaning, hope, support and an anchor in life. The Women's Charter is a piece of legislation with historical significance that seeks to balance the interests of different groups – the rights and protection of spouses, ex-spouses and their children. Members such as Ms Jessica Tan have also reaffirmed its relevance.",40,531,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00531
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We will work closely with stakeholders as well as this House to shape our legislation to better reflect the changing Singapore society. At the same time, notwithstanding legislation, we will make sure that there are programmes in place to support Singaporeans who do have need for help. At the same time, I encourage families and the community to play an active role to support families in need.",41,532,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00532
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Our efforts obviously must not end with the legislative changes.

2016-02-29-T-019,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"Thank you, Madam. Just three quick clarifications for the Minister. I note Minister's point on the mandatory parenting component for minor couples. Will Minister consider extending both programmes for all couples before marriage and not just minor couples?",1,535,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00535
2016-02-29-T-019,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,The second clarification is on the Tribunal for Maintenance. Will the said Tribunal be considered by the Ministry in the near future?,2,536,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00536
2016-02-29-T-019,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"Lastly, I thank the Minister for clarification on safety at crisis shelters but how will this be ensured for those who are under the care of fit persons who do not have the benefit of security measures or CCTV?",3,537,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00537
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, can I seek a clarification on the second question?",1,538,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00538
2016-02-29-T-019,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,The second clarification is on whether a Tribunal for Maintenance will be considered by the Ministry in the near future.,1,539,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00539
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, with regards to the mandatory parenting programme as to whether we should extend it to all couples and not just minor couples, what we are looking at now is just minor couples. We believe that there are counselling, programmes and support made available for all couples who are seeking help or who are looking for support. At this moment, we do not envisage making it mandatory but what we do want to make sure is that the support programmes are in place for those who do need the support. For adult couples, we do encourage them to come forward. We are not at that stage where we plan to make it mandatory for non-minor couples.",1,540,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00540
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regards to Tribunal, that is one possibility but we do believe that the approach that we plan to take in terms of putting in the MRO, working with the Family Justice Courts, would be one way to address this issue. It is very much the responsibility of parents to see through their responsibilities. As we all know, there are those who fail to do it.",2,541,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00541
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I want to highlight again, it is important to remember, that while we do encounter frustrating cases where individuals do not receive their maintenance, there are two scenarios. One, there are fathers who are not able to pay because of the circumstances in which they find themselves in, and I think it is important to remember that, and it is important for us to understand and to check to fully understand the background, and extend the appropriate assistance.",3,542,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00542
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The latter group, which I have less sympathy for, are those who can pay but refuse to pay. Setting up a Tribunal is one approach but we believe that actually the laws are in place. What we intend to do is to use the MRO to work the processes to make sure that it is as expeditious as possible. We will run all the necessary checks, so that we will try to minimise the burden on the women who are affected, and then having the law to come in. That should have a salutary effect on those concerned. We will continue to keep this on watch because we do recognise that it is frustrating and difficult for the women involved and their families.",4,543,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00543
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As for the safety of crisis shelters, we do hear your perspectives. For those who we feel are particularly vulnerable, we would place them in crisis shelters. We do also conduct checks in terms of those families and other safe places we put the children up in. Basically, what we have is a graduated approach to security. For those who do need a much more secured environment, we will make sure that crisis shelters are available for them. While for the others, we have slightly more step-down provision.",5,544,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00544
2016-02-29-T-019,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo,"May I ask the Minister whether he would consider a register to keep track of children from disadvantaged families, from divorces, so that we can keep them on MSF's radar to give them long-term assistance, hopefully, to adulthood, so that they do not get into problems due to their circumstances, and for a better society?",1,545,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00545
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I fully understand the intent that Dr Lily Neo raised in terms of maintaining a register for all children who are caught up in divorce. In fact, if we extend it further, there will be vulnerable children in other scenarios as well whom we should think about tracking. This is something that I have discussed with my colleagues in MSF, especially for troubled youths who have fallen afoul of the law, who have encountered problems, and whether we should track them and subsequently when they are looking at settling down, for example, do we also provide them counselling support, and so on.",1,546,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00546
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As you would realise, with the numbers of divorces taking place and children being affected, to maintain a register of the affected children and to track them over the years, it is quite a heavy responsibility.

To track them and to ensure that they are constantly being provided this support, that is a very different order of magnitude.

That is why we want to make sure that help is available for the concerned minor and that other adults can be brought to bear. Our Ministry can also direct individuals to support them. Where family violence is involved, it can be very emotive. Where the family member is the perpetrator, we do want to make sure other parties are able to advise and help them make the application.",1,553,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00553

Like I said, the key thing is to make sure that the support programmes are in place, that assistance can be provided to children who are affected, and for them to come forward or for their families to come forward.",1,555,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00555
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I do take the Member's perspective that whether this is something that we should track. We are looking at the possibility of tracking individuals who are affected in different ways, not just by divorce but vulnerable in different sense, because there is a long social tail of issues that can happen if the support is not provided and, indeed, whether some of these intervention should be brought to bear even if the individuals do not come forward.",2,556,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00556
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"That is something that we are looking at but at present time, no immediate plans to put them on the register. We do recognise that vulnerable individuals, especially when they are young, do have serious concerns and whether we should play a much more active role on that front. That is something that we are looking at.",3,557,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00557
2016-02-29-T-019,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I have a question  would the Maintenance Record Officer have any enforcement ability? I read that the role of the MRO is to obtain information on parties' financial circumstances to assist the Court in its fact-finding process and also have a standing in Court to tender the information obtained. So, is the ultimate penalty still a warrant of arrest on the defaulter and who then enforces this warrant of arrest?",1,558,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00558
2016-02-29-T-019,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, the MRO is to facilitate the legal process of the Courts and to bring to bear. There is a range of options available. Jail will be one option. Basically, the MRO would be directed by the Court to investigate and to find out the background to the individuals concerned, especially in the cases where they are able to pay. If they are deemed to be able to pay and not actively paying their maintenance, that is when the Courts will enforce some of these measures.",1,559,2016-02-29-T-019-S-00559

2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"Transnational organised crime and terrorism continue to pose a growing threat across the globe. According to international organisations such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and INTERPOL, organised criminal networks are expanding and diversifying their activities. Recent terrorist incidents such as the Paris attacks have also shown how attackers have been able to plan attacks from abroad and cross borders to carry out their activities.",2,570,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00570
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"As a global financial and transport hub, Singapore is a potential target for organised crime and terrorist groups and a possible conduit for their activities.

2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"For example, fingerprints lifted from a crime scene in Singapore can be compared against fingerprint records held by a foreign law enforcement agency to identify potential foreign suspects. Information on the criminal background of an individual also helps investigations, allows law enforcement agencies to identify recalcitrant offenders, and facilitates the detection of suspicious persons at border checkpoints.",5,573,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00573
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"For our law enforcement agencies to ask for and receive such information from our foreign counterparts for the purpose of investigating transnational crime in Singapore, we must be able to reciprocate and share such information in return. This requirement for reciprocity is a long established and internationally accepted principle.",6,574,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00574

2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"For example, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA) enables us to provide a range of assistance to other countries on criminal matters. This was amended in 2014 to simplify the conditions which must be satisfied before mutual legal assistance can be rendered, and expand the range of offences in respect of which mutual legal assistance may be given or received under that Act.",8,576,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00576
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"Our law enforcement agencies also have longstanding arrangements to render assistance to their foreign counterparts at a Police-to-Police level for investigation purposes. This includes the regular exchange of information such as criminal records and relevant identifying information with other law enforcement agencies. This is a common and well established practice among law enforcement agencies around the world. For instance, as a member of INTERPOL, Singapore exchanges information with INTERPOL member countries in accordance with established INTERPOL rules which serve to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the transmitted data. But, in the absence of express legislation, such sharing is heavily circumscribed. For instance, the information generally cannot be adduced as evidence in Court, or used for any other purposes besides investigation.",9,577,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00577
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"MHA therefore proposes to amend the Registration of Criminals Act (RCA) to expressly allow a Singapore -designated authority to share such information with foreign law enforcement agencies, on a reciprocal basis, that is, the foreign agencies must be prepared to share similar information with our agencies on the same terms. The transmission of information will be subject to stringent safeguards.",10,578,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00578

2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"First, the Bill introduces a new section 13I to allow a Singaporean designated authority, namely, the Head of the Criminal Records Office, to share information about the individual that is kept on the criminal register with a foreign law enforcement agency, so long as stringent safeguards relating to the retention, use and destruction of the register information are secured through an undertaking given by the foreign law enforcement agency.",13,581,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00581

2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),What can be shared? These would include information such as the fingerprints and photographs of any person who is convicted of a crime by a court in Singapore. Such a person's conviction in the register must also not have been spent or treated as spent under the RCA.,15,583,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00583
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),What are the safeguards that will be put in place to prevent the wrongful disclosure and abuse of the information?,16,584,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00584
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"First, sharing will only be permitted for certain specified purposes. Under section 13I, register information will only be shared with a foreign law enforcement agency if the information is requested for the purpose of comparing information transmitted and identifying matches for investigation in certain matters or for proceedings in respect of those matters; or for deciding whether to make a request under MACMA or a requisition under the Extradition Act, or for a purpose prescribed under the RCA.",17,585,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00585
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"Second, the foreign law enforcement agency will need to give us an appropriate undertaking in relation to the retention, use and destruction of the register information, in order to assure us that the confidentiality of information shared will be adequately protected. The foreign law enforcement agency must also comply with conditions prescribed for transmission of register information, and any other conditions that the Singapore designated authority may impose in relation to the transmission. For instance, if a foreign authority has breached certain conditions in the previous undertaking, Singapore may impose additional procedures to prevent similar occurrences.",18,586,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00586
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"Third, we will not share the information requested for, if it is contrary to Singapore's public interest, or may prejudice any criminal investigation or criminal proceedings in a Singapore court, or the safety of any person in Singapore.",19,587,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00587
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mdm Speaker, besides facilitating information sharing, the Bill will also strengthen operational procedures for the collection of particulars to be recorded in the Register of Criminals.",20,588,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00588
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"To aid investigations, the RCA currently provides for the taking of registrable particulars, such as fingerprints, and of body samples of a person accused of a crime but only when he is under arrest. The period for which such a person may be detained in custody without a Magistrate's authority cannot exceed 48 hours.",21,589,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00589
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"The Bill amends sections 8 and 13B(1) to allow our law enforcement agencies to take the person's registrable particulars and body samples after the person has been released on bail or personal bond, whether by a court or otherwise.",22,590,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00590
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"This is necessary because there are some situations where law enforcement agencies will not have the opportunity to take these fingerprints and samples within 48 hours after arrest. Such a scenario could arise during mass arrests, or if an arrested person is warded in hospital for up to 48 hours or longer. Under section 68 of the Criminal Procedure Code, police officers are not permitted to detain a person in custody who has been arrested, without a warrant, longer than 48 hours.",23,591,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00591
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"This also aligns the position in Singapore with that in foreign jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, where the Police may register a person while he is on bail if he has not had his fingerprints or samples taken in the course of investigations, or the fingerprints or samples taken are not suitable or of insufficient quality to allow matching comparison or analysis.",24,592,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00592

2016-02-29-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, we can certainly agree about the importance of sharing of information with foreign law enforcement agencies to prevent and solve crimes just as we would value their sharing of information with us. To this end, clause 4 enables a Singapore -designated authority to share with a foreign law enforcement agency, information about an individual recorded on our Register of Criminals.",2,596,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00596
2016-02-29-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I have noted that clause 4 details safeguards that the Singapore -designated authority should adhere to before deciding to release any information to the foreign law enforcement agency. Such safeguards include requiring the foreign agency to give an undertaking in relation to the retention, use and destruction of the register information. The foreign agency must also undertake that information received from Singapore will be kept and maintained using such methods and technologies that will ensure that unauthorised persons cannot access the information, and undertake that the information will not be used for ulterior purposes.",3,597,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00597
2016-02-29-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"It all sounds very good on paper.

2016-02-29-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"According to the proposed section 13I(4)(6) of the Bill, the Government intends to be able to share information with potentially all countries in the world, since it defines ""foreign law enforcement agency"" very broadly. ""Foreign law enforcement agency"" is defined to include agencies in countries that are members of INTERPOL, as well as those that are not. INTERPOL itself consists of 190 member countries, practically all the nations on earth.",5,599,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00599
2016-02-29-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, there is a vast disparity worldwide in the effectiveness of governments, the strength of a country's institutions and state agencies, and levels of corruption.

2016-02-29-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Earlier in the Second Reading speech, the Senior Minister of State referred to INTERPOL rules, but my question is  how do we know whether these countries can actually fulfil these rules that they have signed up to? And will we take their word for it, or will more be done to ascertain for ourselves? Indeed, Madam, according to the proposed section 13I(3), the Government actually foresees that a receiving country may breach an undertaking given, and this is rather worrying.",7,601,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00601
2016-02-29-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, on a related note, the international co-operation envisaged by this Bill will touch on our regional responsibility as a member state of ASEAN. In line with greater ASEAN integration, there have been discussions amongst ASEAN country Ministers about the need for co-operation to combat transnational crime. Transnational crime in ASEAN is understood to refer to drug trafficking, terrorism, economic crimes, human trafficking, money laundering, piracy, weapon smuggling and cybercrime, and since 2015 includes illicit trafficking of wildlife and timber, and people smuggling. Last year, Singapore signed up to the Kuala Lumpur Declaration on Combating Transnational Crime, which calls for a new ASEAN Plan of Action to Combat Transnational Crime and greater information sharing.",8,602,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00602

2016-02-29-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Under the Registration of Criminals Act (RCA), the Police are able to keep records in the Register, persons convicted of any crime specified in the First and Second Schedules of the Act. Particulars, such as the photograph, finger impressions, and conviction records are recorded. The Register of Criminals is useful in Police investigations, especially in the identification of suspects. By having access to fingerprints or DNA of persons that have been convicted of scheduled crimes, the Police may be able to expedite their investigations if they are able to find a match between evidence found as part of their investigations and those on the Register.",2,605,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00605
2016-02-29-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"When the RCA was last amended in 2005, it was amended to help former offenders to reintegrate back into society by allowing those who have criminal records that have been ""spent"" to be deemed to have no record of that conviction if they are able to satisfy a five- year crime-free period. This was a timely and welcomed amendment. Likewise, the proposed amendments to the RCA that are before the House this afternoon are timely and equally important. With the increasing links between countries, we are witnessing unprecedented levels of connectivity in our globalised world. As a result of this increased connectivity, we are also experiencing an increase in transnational crimes across borders.",3,606,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00606
2016-02-29-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Allow me to voice some advantages of this Bill. First, the proposed amendments will facilitate the sharing of information between our Home Team and foreign law enforcement agencies. This will enable us to deal with the scourge of transnational crime and terrorist groups more effectively and expeditiously. Through the proposed amendments in the Registration of Criminal (Amendment) Bill, information that is recorded in the Register of Criminals, such as fingerprints or photographs, can be shared with foreign law enforcement agencies for the prevention, investigation and prosecution of crimes regionally, or possibly, globally.",4,607,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00607
2016-02-29-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"And to prevent any abuse or the wrongful disclosure of the information shared, foreign law enforcement agencies will be required to undertake to protect the confidentiality of the information shared, and to only use the information for crime prevention, criminal investigation or related proceedings. The Singapore designated authority would even have the ability to suspend the transmission of information about an individual if that authority is of the opinion that the foreign law enforcement agency has failed to comply with the undertaking that it had given and does not take steps to rectify the non-compliance. So there are safeguards, Madam.",5,608,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00608
2016-02-29-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Furthermore, our Home Team will also be able to request for reciprocal assistance from law enforcement agencies when investigating and prosecuting criminals in Singapore, through a crime prevention exchange of information arrangement with other foreign law enforcement agencies. This will strengthen Singapore's ability to pursue criminals who operate beyond national boundaries. This is especially important in light of the establishment of the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore in 2014. With the increasingly fast-paced criminal landscape, local and foreign enforcement agencies must ensure that there is a collaborative framework in place to facilitate the timely exchange of vital information and intelligence, so that we are able to deal with transnational crimes quickly and effectively.",6,609,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00609
2016-02-29-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Second, or second advantage, the proposed amendments will also strengthen operational procedures for the registration of criminals in Singapore. At present, the CRO only allows authorised officers to take finger impressions, photographs and body samples of persons who are arrested and are accused of a crime. However, authorised officers are not able to obtain these ""registrable particulars"" or body samples from individuals who have been released on bail or a personal bond but are still under investigation. This may hinder the conduct of a thorough investigation by the Police where a crime has been committed and the Police are conducting their investigations. It bears noting that there are already safeguards which may help ensure that these proposed augmented powers of the Police to obtain ""registrable particulars"" or body samples are not abused.",7,610,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00610
2016-02-29-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"For instance, the RCA already provides that in the event that finger impressions, photographs, registrable particulars, and body samples are taken from a person during an investigation, but the person is acquitted or discharged without a conviction being recorded against him, the authorised officer in-charge of the case shall immediately inform the Registrar of the acquittal or discharge. The Registrar will then be required to destroy the finger impressions, photographs and registrable particulars that were obtained pursuant to the RCA, and to immediately remove the DNA information of that person from the DNA database. However, I have a series of questions here",8,611,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00611
2016-02-29-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),What if investigations cease before acquittal or before the case gets to Court? Or what if there is a long delay in investigations? Or if investigations are put on hold for an unduly long period of time? Should not the registrable particulars and the like be destroyed in these situations also?,9,612,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00612
2016-02-29-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In conclusion, the Bill reflects the new realities of transnational crimes and terrorist groups, and the need for the timely exchange of information between Singapore and foreign law enforcement agencies. Ultimately, a collaborative approach to investigation and information sharing is essential if we want to be able to deal with transnational crimes quickly, decisively and effectively. However, Madam, it is equally important to emphasise that it is also incumbent on the Police and authorities to ensure such private information is not abused or illegitimately utilised. Madam, I support this Bill.",10,613,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00613

Belgian police had, unfortunately, failed to share with their French counterparts about the information that this man was a known radical who had tried to travel to Syria to fight for Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS. The man is still on the run today.",2,615,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00615
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Closer to home, in Indonesia, several militant groups have pledged allegiance to ISIS. In January, at least eight people were killed in an ISIS-perpetrated attack near a Jakarta shopping mall.",3,616,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00616
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The Malaysian authorities have foiled several ISIS-inspired attack plots and arrested several persons involved in ISIS activities. Just last week, the Australian Government indicated that terrorists may be planning attacks in Malaysia and Indonesia. In Singapore, the Internal Security Department recently arrested 27 male Bangladeshi nationals working in Singapore, who were planning to take part in extremist activities in other countries, including Bangladesh, their home country.",4,617,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00617
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"So, given this scenario, the sharing of criminal records, fingerprints and photographs across borders will make it harder for terrorists and criminals to travel under false identities. Cross-border cooperation does not just address concerns over terrorism, but also online commercial crime, money laundering and other transnational crimes.",5,618,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00618
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In Europe, the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) was set up in 2012 to allow courts and law enforcement agencies to obtain criminal records from other EU member states. Since the introduction of ECRIS, 288,000 such requests are made every year across the EU. In the wake of the Paris terror attacks, it was announced in January 2016 that ECRIS will be further expanded to include the fingerprints of non-EU citizens.",6,619,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00619
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Closer to home, also in response to the Paris terror attacks, Malaysia and the American governments signed an agreement in November 2015 to share a database containing the biometric records of about 1.2 million people suspected of terrorism and other serious crimes. The list of suspects will be used by security officials at all entry points in Malaysia as well as across the United States.",7,620,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00620
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Transnational co-operation is a step in the right direction toward the prevention of global crime. I understand that Singapore enjoys a close working relationship with INTERPOL, as said by the Senior Minister of State, and MHA has set up units to facilitate international exchange. For instance, the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO) within the Commercial Affairs Department shares financial intelligence with foreign counterparts if they had signed MOUs, while the Singapore Police Force's International Cooperation Department facilitates co-operation and information exchange with foreign counterparts.",8,621,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00621
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Thus, I would like to clarify with the Senior Minister of State, how would the proposed amendment bill tie in with Singapore's international working arrangements with INTERPOL, and various other platforms which already exist for information exchange on global crimes? How many countries have similar provisions that can share their criminal records with Singapore besides US, UK, Australia and New Zealand, mentioned by the Senior Minister of State earlier on? Does it mean that no other ASEAN countries have a similar profession to share the information with Singapore?",9,622,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00622
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In addition, I would like to request the Senior Minister of State to elaborate more on the safeguards to prevent abuse and to protect the interests of Singaporeans under the amendment Bill. The last thing we want is for a Singaporean with decades-old criminal records of petty crimes, to have his history made known to the immigration officer at an immigration checkpoint of a foreign country, thereby subjecting him to unnecessary body and bag checks.",10,623,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00623
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Therefore, we would like to know when, what and how the criminal records would be shared with other countries. Firstly, when would Singapore share the criminal records with foreign countries? Will the exchange of criminal records be shared on a request-only basis? Secondly what kind of criminal records will be shared with other countries?",11,624,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00624
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Singapore, as mentioned, has focused very much on the rehabilitation and re-integration of offenders into the society. The Yellow Ribbon Project has made much progress in recent years. Therefore I am very glad that the Senior Minister of State has confirmed that criminal records that had been rendered as spent will be not be shared with other countries. But does it mean that all other records, beside those as spent, in the Register of Criminals will be share with other Countries?",12,625,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00625
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"And thirdly, how will the criminal records be shared with other countries? Will it be via a shared platform like the ECRIS? If this is so, we could have a problem of different countries tracking different things, to different degrees and for different lengths of time.",13,626,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00626
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"For example, when the EU adopted ECRIS, it became apparent that Britain hangs on to the most minor convictions for years. As a result, local job-seekers could not apply for ""sensitive"" jobs like teachers and policemen while migrants from other EU countries go to England and apply for these jobs because their countries wipe the slate clean, or did not keep records of low-level offences. Clearly, the ""seriousness"" and treatment of crimes are regarded differently across borders and this constitutes a problem.",14,627,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00627
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),How will foreign law enforcement agencies undertake to protect the confidentiality of information? How do we ensure that the information shared will not be abused for other purposes? What other safeguards are there?,15,628,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00628
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Will Singaporeans be unfairly treated when they work and live in other countries that have access to our criminal records? The implications could be even more acute if Singaporeans are residing in countries with high 99% conviction, or higher, in the Court.",16,629,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00629
2016-02-29-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In conclusion, Madam, I support the Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill to share the criminal records with a foreign law enforcement agency. However, Singaporeans deserve to know in detail what, when and how information is shared with a foreign country to prevent abuse so as not to disadvantage Singaporeans unnecessarily. Thank you.",17,630,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00630
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Christopher de Souza, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Ang Wei Neng for speaking on the Bill. All three have raised a couple of questions which I will seek to address.",1,631,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00631
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, Madam, Mr Ang asked how the RCA amendments would complement existing working arrangements that we currently have with other countries. Let me first set the context for how international co-operation in criminal matters is carried out.",2,632,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00632
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Singapore relies on a combination of formal and informal co-operation channels to exchange information with foreign counterparts.,3,633,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00633
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I had mentioned earlier the Act known as MACMA, or the Mutual Assistance of Criminal Matters Act. This provides a formal channel through which law enforcement agencies render legal assistance to foreign law enforcement agencies with respect to any criminal matter. So for instance, under MACMA you can ask for the collection of evidence, you can ask for search and seizure, freezing of accounts, arrangements for witnesses to be made available to give evidence and so on and so forth.",4,634,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00634
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But beyond the MACMA framework for formal assistance, our law enforcement agencies can also render assistance informally either through INTERPOL, which most countries are members of as Ms Sylvia Lim pointed out, or directly with our foreign counterparts through Police-to-Police contacts.",5,635,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00635
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Currently, any request for register information has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis for public interest. The Bill clarifies that register information can be shared for specified purposes only and this will enable us to act more quickly and more effectively. For instance, register information can be shared to help identify suspects in time-critical investigations. The Bill also expressly allows register information to be shared as a precursor to a request for more formal assistance under MACMA. In other words, the Bill which amends the RCA, will complement the MACMA process and strengthen our fight against transnational crime.",6,636,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00636
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Members also asked about the mechanics of sharing register information with foreign counterparts, so in a sense it addresses partly what Mr Ang has asked, and what Ms Sylvia Lim has asked.",7,637,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00637
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Under the proposed amendments, a foreign law enforcement agency may request for register information for certain purposes specified in the Act, which I have just mentioned earlier. One of which is to compare the register information with information held by the foreign law enforcement agency to identify suspects involved in the investigation of a matter.",8,638,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00638
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Exchange of information can also be made to prevent crime. Depending on the arrangement between Singapore and the foreign law enforcement agency, the Singapore- designated authority, or the head of CRO, may be able to share register information pursuant to the arrangement even in the absence of a specific request for the transmission of that information.",9,639,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00639
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"A Singapore- designated authority may share such information to assist a foreign law enforcement agency in investigating or prosecuting foreign offences, particularly serious criminal or terrorist offences. Even then, register information will be shared on a limited basis and foreign agencies will certainly not get unfettered access to all our data.",10,640,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00640
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"With regard to the transmission of register information in relation to the investigation of a foreign offence or an investigation to prevent the commission of a foreign offence, I should highlight that the Bill provides a definition of what a foreign offence is. A foreign offence is defined to mean an offence against the law of the foreign country, which if the conduct constituting the foreign offence had occurred in Singapore, would amount to an offence against the law of Singapore punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 12 months. And in this way, this ensures that information is not disclosed for non-serious or trivial matters.",11,641,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00641
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,I would also like to assure Mr Ang that the register information to be shared will not include spent criminal records.,12,642,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00642
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Now I come to the nub of Ms Sylvia Lim's and Mr Ang's concerns, which are principally about safeguards to be imposed and the concern about whether our counterparts will adhere to the conditions that they have agreed to and the undertakings they have given and vice versa.",13,643,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00643
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Before I go into the details, I think it is important to recognise the balance that we seek the strike here. On the one hand, we are certainly very concerned about the confidentiality of information, the identifiable information, names, photographs, fingerprints. But, equally of concern is the need for law enforcement agencies around the world to get up to pace in terms of international cooperation. Crime knows no boundaries with the Internet, with travel being so easy, and with borders being relatively porous. Transnational organised crime sometimes leads governments and foreign law enforcement agencies to scuttle around to try to nip out the problem; so co-operation is essential, otherwise we fall behind the curve.",14,644,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00644
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Ang and Ms Sylvia Lim raised challenges and concerns regarding the sharing of information or data on certain shared platforms. Mr Ang mentioned the ECRIS, or the European Criminal Records Information System, and we are mindful of this and are careful to ensure that procedures and infrastructure of all parties concerned protect the confidentiality of the information transmitted. We will certainly not deposit register information on such a shared platform.",15,645,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00645
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We understand the privacy concerns associated with the sharing of information or data with foreign jurisdictions. We would like to assure Members of the House that the Bill will reduce the potential for misuse of information, and Singapore will not take any breach of confidentiality lightly. I earlier highlighted the key safeguards. Now, let me elaborate on the relevant provisions.",16,646,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00646
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, in order to allow the sharing of register information between Singapore and a foreign law enforcement agency, that agency must give us an appropriate undertaking to use the information disclosed only for a specified purpose listed under the Act. Requests that are made in a broad or tenuous manner, or by way of a ""fishing expedition"", will not be acceded to or entertained.",17,647,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00647
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To be clear, we will not accede to any request for information to be disclosed for any purpose that is unrelated to the prevention and combating of crime and terrorism, such as, for instance, employment screening purposes. Foreign law enforcement agencies should also never use our records for such irrelevant purposes. Should they do so or breach any of the terms of the undertaking, there will be consequences, as I will explain shortly.",18,648,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00648
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Members asked whether a past criminal record of petty crime would expose a Singaporean to undue security checks at overseas border checkpoints – I believe Mr Ang did ask that at the end of his speech. The answer is no. A criminal record does not automatically result in enhanced checks at checkpoints. Every country, including us in Singapore, has its own entry requirements to prevent, deter and detect undesirable individuals entering their country. Singaporeans seeking to enter a foreign country must meet the country's entry requirements, which may include holding a valid passport or entry visa. Ultimately, a foreign country retains the right to impose conditions or refuse entry to migrants at the checkpoint.",19,649,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00649
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, the foreign law enforcement agency is also required to undertake to protect the confidentiality of information by ensuring that the information is kept and maintained using methods and technologies that ensure that unauthorised persons cannot access the information. A Singapore- designated authority will be able to refuse further transmission of register information to a foreign agency if the Singapore- designated authority is of the opinion that the foreign law enforcement agency has breached such an undertaking and has not taken steps to rectify the non-compliance.",20,650,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00650
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Third, the foreign law enforcement agency must be able to comply with conditions prescribed for the transmission of register information under the Act, and any other conditions that the Singapore authority may impose specially in relation to the transmission. This includes complying with any request by Singapore to delete or update the records if a criminal conviction has been rendered spent.",21,651,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00651
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,These safeguards will ensure that any exchange of information is limited to countries that ensure the confidentiality of information exchanged and prevent its unauthorised use.,22,652,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00652
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In the course of her speech, Ms Sylvia Lim noted all these safeguards, but her concern was how we will ensure on a practical basis that these safeguards are met. She also mentioned that the membership of INTERPOL covers much of the globe, we are all party to this international co-operation arrangement for law enforcement.",23,653,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00653
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Now, while the Act does appear to allow us to share information with all these countries and more, the reality is that by striking that balance between the need for co-operation and privacy, Singapore will conduct its due diligence in working out arrangements, ensuring undertakings are made, given and also able to be abided by and audited. This is not something that can be done overnight. It involves agencies knowing each other, meeting each other, having lots of discussions about the safeguards that need to be put in place, the software, the systems, the audit mechanisms that need to be ensured, in order to ensure that level of trust to allow us to share information expeditiously. Because sometimes, time is of the essence, criminals will not wait for you, sharing information quickly will help us to deter, prevent and ultimately to solve crime.",24,654,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00654
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I believe Mr Christopher de Souza did ask a question about the taking of photographs and fingerprints of a persons accused of crime. Under the current Act it would be when a person is under arrest. Under this Bill, we seek to expand it to when a person is on bail or when the person is given a personal bond, and I believe Members who have spoken understand the necessity of having this mechanism. But Mr de Souza's concern is what if a person's case has been put into abeyance for some time, or if the trial is particularly long or has been set for a date far into the future, is it fair that the data is kept on the register?",25,655,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00655
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"If we look at section 4 of the Act, section 4 would not be touched. Section 4 states that the Register of Criminals is kept for persons who are convicted of crimes. While the fingerprints and photographs may have been taken at the point of arrest, they will not be recorded on the register. It will only be recorded when the case has been completed or if a person has been convicted.",26,656,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00656
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"If there is a subsequent acquittal, or if the conviction is rendered spent, the record will be deleted. So, I hope that this assures the Member that it will not unduly compromise the persons in Singapore whose trials may take a little longer.",27,657,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00657
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker in conclusion, the threats of transnational crime and terrorism will continue to grow. To be effective against such threats we must have greater cooperation in the information exchange between law enforcement agencies. This Bill will improve Singapore's ability to cooperate with our international partners while ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place.",28,658,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00658
2016-02-29-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,I just have one clarification for the Senior Minister of State. He mentioned in his round-up speech that each request will be assessed carefully and we may need to work with the foreign agency over a period of time to gain confidence in their capacity to fulfil the obligations.,1,659,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00659
2016-02-29-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,I would like him to clarify whether this ongoing process applies also to our ASEAN counterparts or has that already been finalised and it is quite clear that we are confident that we can share information with our ASEAN counterparts without needing to go through this because it has been done earlier.,2,660,2016-02-29-T-020-S-00660
2016-02-29-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, this is an on-going process, our law enforcement agencies are frequently in touch with and cooperate with our ASEAN law enforcement partners.

2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Madam, the first set of amendments pertains to Part One of the CPF Advisory Panel's recommendations. The Government has implemented the Panel's recommendations since January 2016 based on provisions within the current CPF Act. We are now amending the CPF Act to enable the CPF Board to implement these changes more directly.",8,674,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00674

2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"We are amending the CPF Act to make it directly explicit that CPF members aged 55 and above can transfer savings from their CPF accounts, including their Retirement Account, to their spouses if they have set aside the Basic Retirement Sum, or BRS in short.",10,676,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00676
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Previously, members, including those less than 55, would have to set aside the Full Retirement Sum (FRS), which is twice the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), before they could make transfers to their spouses' accounts.",11,677,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00677
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),We agreed with the CPF Advisory Panel to reduce the requirement from the Full Retirement Sum to the Basic Retirement Sum so that more CPF members can make top-ups to their spouses' CPF savings. This flexibility will be useful for spouses who may not have enough CPF savings to join CPF LIFE for reasons such as leaving the workforce earlier to take care of their children.,12,678,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00678
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Both husband and wife can then have their own CPF LIFE plans and more secured retirement income for life.

2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),The importance of mortgage insurance coverage struck close to home when I lost an uncle more than a decade ago. He passed away in a motorcycle accident and did not have any HPS coverage. A sizeable mortgage sum remained outstanding and it was left to my aunt and cousins to commit significant resources to continue making mortgage payments on top of their own commitments.,1,699,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00699
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"At that time, I thought HPS non-coverage was a rare occurrence. But years later, it was heart-breaking to find out that some of my own residents, albeit a small number, found themselves in exactly the same position as my aunt and cousins when their sole breadwinner passes away unexpectedly.",2,700,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00700
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To that end, I wish to acknowledge the compassion shown by CPF and HDB staff to try their best to assist affected families by retrospectively reinstating HPS coverage in certain cases so that the other family members do not face hardship. In my last term, one particular family benefited from CPF's helpfulness and were profuse in their appreciation to me for pursuing the matter, but the appreciation should rightfully go to the agencies concerned.",3,701,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00701
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"According to the CPF, as of 2013, about 70% of all HDB flat owners were covered by the HPS. In 2012, a total of 1,074 claims amounting to $89.8 million were made to HPS policyholders. At the 2014 Committee of Supply debate, I spoke on the HPS, requesting the CPF to require HDB flat owners who are paying for their mortgage in cash to sign up for the HPS as a matter of course. More generally, the cut requested the Government to step up education on the importance of HPS, especially for low- to middle-income households.",4,702,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00702
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Separately, the statistics pointed to an increase in the number of members who had lapsed in their HPS premium payments or who were no longer insurable for medical and other reasons. It was 1.7% and 2% respectively in April 2011 and, by October 2013, the percentages had increased to 2% and 3%.",5,703,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00703
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To this end, I welcome the current amendments to allow co-owners, who could be family members, to help pay for HPS premiums, not just spouses. This should mitigate or reduce the number of lapsed policyholders going forward. However, for greater clarity, can the Minister give the House a primer on the regulations the CPF has in mind in reinstating HPS insurance cover for paid claims when it is not liable to do so?",6,704,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00704
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Improvements to the scheme. While I welcome all the HPS-related amendments, I have three suggestions to make that could help strengthen the HPS.",7,705,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00705
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, covering Singaporeans with pre-existing illnesses. In 2011, the CPF amendment modified the HPS scheme to allow for more portability, so that in the event the homeowner who purchased a new HDB flat was no longer in good health, he would remain insured under the scheme by way of earlier participation. This amendment acknowledges that a member in ill-health could yet be covered so as not to prejudice him or her. With the introduction of MediShield Life by the Government, a seminal change that differentiated it from the old MediShield scheme, was the inclusion of members with pre-existing conditions, albeit with a 30% increase in premiums payable. The philosophical basis of this move was in concert with making Singapore an inclusive society. Similarly, HPS coverage for Singaporeans with pre-existing illnesses will buttress this in.",8,706,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00706
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Government has raised its concerns about such an expansion, specifically on premium affordability in the past, and this is not an irrelevant consideration. However, similar misgivings were overcome in the move from MediShield to MediShield Life. In August 2015, CPF paid out more than at least $400 in HPS rebates to each of the 470,000 Singaporeans and PRs on HPS. This came up to almost $1.9 billion and with yet many thousands of other homeowners receiving less than the $400 but receiving a rebate, nonetheless. The last time such rebates were paid out was in 2006. In between, in 2011, HPS premiums were lowered by an average of 12% for some 80% of HPS members. The remaining 20% were already paying low premiums.",9,707,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00707
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"With these numbers in mind, it would appear that there is some scope to relook at the prospect of covering members in poor health under the HPS. I hope the Board can commit itself to look seriously to cover Singaporeans with pre-existing illnesses.",10,708,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00708
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Secondly, plugging gaps for lapsed policyholders. While the HPS is compulsory for all members who use their CPF to pay for their HDB flats, subject to HDB's approval, members can choose to opt out should they take up a similar mortgage reducing insurance. In 2015, it was made known that 43,610 flat owners had been given permission to do so by the HDB. However, my understanding is that HDB does not monitor these members thereafter, allowing them to theoretically opt out of their mortgage reducing insurance shortly thereafter. In such a case, these households effectively fall through the cracks. Can the Minister confirm if CPF will consider plugging this hole in future and require them to sign up to the HPS in the event their mortgage reducing insurance lapses?",11,709,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00709
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thirdly, reminders. I understand the CPF sends two reminder letters to the policyholder in the event of HPS premium non-payment. In an effort to highlight the importance of this scheme, can I confirm if these notifications are by ordinary post or registered mail? In addition, early reminders to the policyholders of low CPF balances for HPS premiums may be a powerful signalling tool that can prod members to top up their Ordinary Accounts (OA) or, at the very least, seek assistance early, if they have other financial problems.",12,710,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00710
2016-02-29-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In conclusion, when I spoke on raising the awareness of the HPS in the 2014 Committee of Supply debate, the Minister of State replied that the HDB issues a booklet, on the purchase of a property, to educate home buyers of the scheme. With a rising senior citizen population and constant reminders in the press about how Singaporeans do not plan well for retirement, the Ministry should step up its efforts to constantly inform homeowners of the benefits of the scheme every few years through brochures and pamphlets as they service their mortgages, and seriously look at including Singaporeans with pre-existing illnesses to improve the scheme further.

2016-02-29-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I support the proposed amendments to the bill in respect of the Home Protection Scheme (HPS). The HPS is a mortgage-reducing insurance that protects members and their families against losing their homes in the event of death or permanent incapacity before their housing loans are paid up. It is compulsory for any HDB home owner who is using his or her CPF savings to pay the monthly housing loan instalments for his or her HDB flat. The Scheme does not cover private residential properties, executive condominiums (ECs) or privatised Housing and Urban Development Company (HUDC) flats. Buyers can only opt out of the Scheme if they have taken a similar mortgage-reducing insurance policy.",2,713,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00713
2016-02-29-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The Bill seeks to enhance insurance coverage under the HPS. Under the proposed amendments, a CPF member who is insured under the Scheme will now be allowed to make a claim under the Scheme for terminal illness and total permanent disability, even though the member is not incapacitated from ever continuing in any employment. If this is a substantial change, it will represent a departure from the existing ruling under the current Act and it will be a welcomed change as it may provide more flexibility for members who are caught in different situations. I note that the same change is also effected in the same bill for the Dependents' Protection Insurance Scheme.",3,714,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00714
2016-02-29-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"However, it seems to me from a plain reading of the amendment bill that the only situations where a member can make a claim under the Scheme for terminal illness and total permanent disability, even though the member is not incapacitated from ever continuing in any employment are if (1) the member is suffering from terminal illness and is said by a registered medical practitioner to be expected to result in death within 12 months or (2) the member has suffered total or permanent disability of less than two eyes, two limbs or one eye and one limb. The scenarios seem rather limited. May the minister please clarify whether this is what the Bill intended? Does the Bill provide for any other situation and where is this provided in the Bill?",4,715,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00715

I seek the Minister's assurance that the CPF Board will provide clear communication to CPF members for the circumstances which may apply under this proposed amendment.",5,716,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00716
2016-02-29-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),The Bill also seeks to allow a non-spouse member who is a co-owner of a property to pay the premium for the HPS Scheme of the other co-owner. I welcome this change as this recognises the possibility as well as perhaps the increasing occurrence of the situation where co-owners may not be spouses. For example in the case of a flat which is owned by a man and his mother. The change will address the current anomaly in the present Act.,6,717,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00717
2016-02-29-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I refer to the amendment in clause 28(h) of the Bill whereby the Board has the right not to pay under the Scheme where a member was suffering from an illness when he joins the Scheme. May the minister clarify what would be these circumstances where the board may permit a member to join the Scheme even though the Board may be aware of the member suffering from an illness at the time of joining the Scheme?",7,718,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00718

2016-02-29-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The Retirement Sum and the CPF LIFE plan are to meet the objective of giving members a monthly payout for life. Currently, subject to the amount of the CPF balances and the amount that they desire for monthly payouts, CPF Members have to make a choice of CPF LIFE plan − whether it is the LIFE Standard or the LIFE Basic Plan − when they turn 55 years of age. The difference in the CPF LIFE plans is the monthly payouts you would receive and the amount you would bequest to the beneficiaries after you have passed on.",3,725,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00725
2016-02-29-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So, I do welcome this change of not requiring members to make that decision on the choice of the CPF LIFE plan at the age of 55 as this is effectively ten years before their Payout Eligibility Age (PAE) which is currently 65 years. With the amendments, members will now only need to choose their CPF LIFE plan closer to the start of their CPF LIFE payouts, which can be anytime between their Payout Eligibility Age (PEA) or if they choose, up to age 70. Taking a decision closer to the date of the start of payouts will allow members to decide on the plan that best meets their retirement needs at the time.",4,726,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00726
2016-02-29-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"This change, while giving greater flexibility and enabling better decisions to meet retirement needs of members, however, does not address some of the concerns that members have with regard to the PEA. As PEA currently depends on your year of birth, this is not only confusing as to what your PEA is, there is also concern that this will continue to adjust for the subsequent age group of members. This does cause uncertainty for members as PEA determines when you can start receiving your CPF LIFE payouts. This gives a sense that access to CPF payouts are getting further delayed and can only be accessed when you get much older. While I understand the need to make the adjustments to be in line with people living longer and the standard of living, it is also important to give members some certainty.",5,727,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00727

So, it would be good to understand the criteria for changing the PEA and what members can expect in the future for the PEA.",6,728,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00728

So, this is until January this year, was twice the Basic Retirement Sum, so therefore, this change is definitely welcomed because it will help them help their spouses grow their retirement savings, as well as to benefit from the Extra Interest on lower CPF balances.

2016-02-29-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I have personally seen this happened when a family had their policy lapsed and they did not even know that the member had purchased the HPS. When he passed on, they then realised that he actually lapsed on his policy. It is quite sad because they still had to provide for the family and they still had to ensure that that is the time when you need – you are grieving and homeownership is one aspect. You have had that addressed. That gives the remaining family members a peace of mind.",13,735,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00735
2016-02-29-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Medisave – Medisave I think for many Singaporeans is the fund for our and our immediate family's medical and future medical needs  hospitalisation, day surgery and other expenses. It is therefore important and I am glad that this change looks to safeguard members' Medisave monies. Our Ministers shared that there are not many cases. I think it is every case to any person whose Medisave Funds are important is one case too many, as we all know. So, I am glad that this change is being done because what it does is it not only sets aside the penalty framework, it also mandates the recovery of Medisave monies from the Medical Institutions (MI) as well as the Approved Insurers (AI) for those that have been mistakenly deducted as well as refunds for monies from the institutions due to uncompleted medical treatments.",14,736,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00736
2016-02-29-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),The proposed amendments to the CPF Act are welcomed as they will benefit members with greater flexibility and enhance support and protection in the use of their CPF funds to build their retirement adequacy. It does not however address the frustration that members have expressed with regard to the complexity and the changes in the CPF schemes when they do happen. This uncertainty does lead to angst and mistrust of the scheme; and the irony of offering more choice in the usage of members CPF monies is that it adds to the complexity of the scheme.,15,737,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00737
2016-02-29-T-021,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"To achieve simplicity is a very difficult balance but CPF Board must continue to work on this. CPF is and will continue to be an integral part of the retirement adequacy for Singaporeans. The Ministry must continue to find effective channels to communicate and provide more timely and specific information to enable members to better understand the CPF schemes and changes as well as appropriate financial counselling. This will ensure that members have a good understanding and can make informed choices that are best suited for each of their retirement needs. Sir, I support the Bill.",16,738,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00738

2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"First, on the issue of the Home Protection Scheme, I share the sentiments of the Members, that, it is very important that we do whatever we can to help to minimise the risk of losing a home when the homeowner passes away. At the end of the day, it is very hard to keep a family together without a place to stay in. So, in that regard, we are very concerned that on the average every year, we see about 4000 to 5000 policy holders dropping out of the HPS due to various reasons.",2,740,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00740
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"On the part of the MOM and CPF, we are doing what we can to minimise or reduce these cases of lapses. The amendment today we believe will help may be 1,000 to 2,000 CPF members to overcome the inability of the homeowner to pay the premium.",3,741,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00741
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Having said so, we also continue to step-up our efforts to remind and educate the homeowners of the importance of HPS. Mr Pritam Singh asked about cases where we paid the HPS claims even though we are not liable to do so. Here, I would like to give an illustration.",4,742,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00742
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"A policyholder fell sick; seriously ill and was hospitalised at the time when the premium payment was due. As a result, he was not able to take action knowingly or unknowingly, to pay for the premium, and subsequently, he either passed away or suffered permanent disability. So, under such circumstances, CPF could have taken the position that since the policyholder did not pay for the premium, as a result, the policy has lapsed.",5,743,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00743
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"But we think that will be a wrong thing to do because the fact that the policyholder was not able to pay the premium was beyond his control. He was hospitalised at the time of the renewal. So, these are examples whereby the Board has exercised its judgment, knowing that if this is really beyond the control of the policyholder, in fact, we will find a way to pay them rather than to reject the claims.",6,744,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00744
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mr Pritam Singh asked what kinds of serious illnesses would we exclude an application due to pre-existing illnesses. For example, a homeowner who suffers from cancer, kidney failure, or heart disorder and so on, the Board does look at the severity of the illness because if it is too severe and will lead clearly towards terminal illnesses, then I think we would have no choice but to reject such applications. Because at the end of the day, we would have to strike a balance between taking care of as many homeowners as we can and yet at the same time, be fair to the other homeowners, bearing in mind that this is a risk-pooling programme.",7,745,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00745
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mr Pritam Singh also asked whether we can step up our efforts to send early reminders. The answer is yes. In fact today, not only would we remind every new homeowner – when they collect the keys from the HDB – of the importance of HPS, we also make sure that for any case of a lapsed payment, we would follow up with a repeated reminder. Obviously, more can be done; and we will keep doing more.",8,746,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00746
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mr Dennis Tan asked whether we can expand HPS to private housing. Mr Deputy Speaker, HPS' primary focus would be on HDB housing to cover the vast majority of home owners and the mass market. For owners of private properties, our advice to them, is to take care of themselves by purchasing mortgage-reducing insurance in the private market.",9,747,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00747
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mr Tan asked whether we can be more specific with the definition of terminal illnesses and total permanent disability. All these are defined under the CPF Act and I would like to confirm that he is right that terminal illness, by and large refers to a remaining lifespan of less than one year. In the case of total permanent disability, it refers to a loss of two eyes, two limbs or one eye and one limb.",10,748,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00748
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mr Dennis Tan also asked for section (39) regarding premium with interest  this refers to cases where the policyholder did not declare their serious pre-existing illnesses. So, at the time of claim, when it was discovered that the claim was not supportable, we will refund the remaining premium together with interest.",11,749,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00749
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Ms Jessica Tan touched on a few important points. First, regarding the Payout Eligibility Age (PEA). I share her concern that each time, when the PEA is adjusted, it will affect the retirement planning of those CPF members who were affected. And this is the reason why we take the review of PEA very seriously. The last time we made a revision to the PEA was in 2007, when we raised the PEA from the age of 62 to 65. We phased in this increase of 62 to 65 over 10 years.",12,750,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00750
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"It was announced in 2007 and the final adjustment of going up from age 64 to 65 will only take place in 2018, which is about two years from now. I agree with Ms Jessica Tan that this is a very major decision and should we decide to amend the PEA, we should do so by giving policyholders and CPF members enough advance notice.",13,751,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00751
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Let me say this, right now, we are on schedule to raise the PEA to age 65 by 2018. At the same time, I want to highlight to this House that since January this year, CPF members have the option of deferring the start of their CPF payouts from the PEA up to the age of 70. In other words, if a CPF member is in employment and he does not need to start his payouts at the age of 64 now and 65 come 2018, he has the option of deferring the starting of his pay-out up to the age of 70. For every year of deferment, he is expected to receive about 6% more every month permanently from the date of the pay-out.",14,752,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00752
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"We believe that the combination of progressively raising the PEA to age 65 by 2018, coupled with the new flexibility of each member being able to, on a voluntary basis, defer the payout start age to age 70, is about the right combination – providing the kind of flexibility that the members are looking for.",15,753,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00753
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"I also agree with Ms Jessica Tan regarding Medisave claims that are unauthorised or made by mistake. In fact, we are stepping up our efforts and one of our objectives for this amendment is to send a very clear message to medical institutions and approved insurers that we take this seriously. Whenever we discover any case of error, first, we mandate the recovery. And second, with this amendment, CPF Board will have the rights to impose administrative penalties as well.",16,754,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00754
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Last, but not least, Ms Jessica Tan also suggested to step up our communications. Again, I fully agree. In fact, CPF Board is not only going to do more, we are going to do more in a simpler way so that more members out there can understand what is the purpose of CPF, why is it structured this way and what are the changes that are coming along the way to ensure that the CPF system will always be relevant and will always be able to meet their needs better. With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.",17,755,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00755

2016-02-29-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I understand that under the current Act, people with certain pre-existing illnesses are not covered by the Act. This presents a conundrum for members as it is normally compulsory for all members servicing their HDB loans through their CPF accounts. Can the Minister please confirm whether such members will merely be exempted from the scheme without any coverage from the scheme after the amendment?",2,757,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00757
2016-02-29-T-021,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Even if such members are exempted from the scheme, will the Minister consider allowing a special form of coverage under the scheme, perhaps on a case-by-case basis, and even perhaps on a different premium? This will certainly give a better piece of mind to affected members. After all, surely the original intention of the scheme is to provide a piece of mind to all members who have taken loans to pay for their HDB flats. Thank you.",3,758,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00758
2016-02-29-T-021,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in my reply, I thought I did explain that cases which are excluded from this coverage will be homeowners who suffer from severe pre-existing conditions such as cancer, kidney diseases, heart disorders.

In fact, I would like to clarify that HPS is not mandatory for members with severe pre-existing conditions. In other words, we encourage every home owner of HDB flats to come under HPS. We do whatever we can, including this amendment, to help them stay with the HPS. So for those who due to their medical conditions and had their applications rejected, they are excluded from HPS. I hope that answers his questions.",2,760,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00760
2016-02-29-T-021,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, just a brief clarifying question to the hon Minister. I think this question was contained in Mr Pritam Singh's speech which is that for members who are on HPS who fail to make the premium payments and reminder letters are sent to them, are these sent by registered mail or non-registered mail? And if they are sent by normal mail, could the CPF Board give some thought to perhaps sending those reminders by registered mail?",1,761,2016-02-29-T-021-S-00761

CPF Board does have regular communications with our members. For example, for Members who have recently received their CPF statement will see that CPF Board puts in tremendous efforts to provide a one-page summary of the status of all your transactions with the CPF Board.

2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"First, to strengthen prudential safeguards and enhance depositor protection. Currently, a foreign bank can choose to operate in Singapore as a branch or a locally-incorporated subsidiary. A bank branch will rely on support from its head office, which is subject to capital and other requirements imposed by its home regulator on a group basis. In contrast, a locally-incorporated subsidiary will have its own capital, and be subject to MAS' capital and other regulatory requirements.",6,773,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00773
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The Bill will empower MAS to require a foreign bank branch to incorporate all or part of its banking business, where it is in the interest of the public, the bank's depositors, or the domestic financial system. This new regulatory power forms part of the suite of policy measures for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs). This was announced by MAS in April last year. In retail banking in particular, a bank with significant retail presence – defined as having more than 3% of resident non-bank deposits, and more than 150,000 deposit accounts with balances below S$250,000 – will be designated a D-SIB and be required to subsidiarise its retail operations. The subsidiary will then be subject to MAS' own regulatory requirements, based on its risk profile.",7,774,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00774
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The Bill will also empower MAS to impose prudential requirements that cap banks' leverage and ensure that they maintain sufficient liquidity. As I mentioned earlier, MAS has always maintained high standards of prudential regulation and supervision for our banks; in fact, somewhat higher than in most other jurisdictions. Over the years, we have developed a system of regulation that allows well-managed risk-taking and innovation, ensuring the stable and sustainable development of the financial services sector. This Bill will update our rules to reflect new international standards, which MAS has been involved in shaping through its participation in various international financial forums.",8,775,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00775
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The second purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the corporate governance of banks. Effective corporate governance plays a critical role in ensuring robust risk management, decision-making and accountability within banks. The Bill will vest MAS with the power to direct a bank to remove key appointment holders, including its chief executive officer and deputy chief executive officer, if they are found not to be fit and proper. The grounds of removal will be aligned with the criteria for approving their appointments. To enhance MAS' oversight of these appointments, the Bill will require banks to notify MAS as soon as they become aware of any material information which may negatively affect the fitness or propriety of any director or executive officer whose appointment was approved by MAS.",9,776,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00776

This provision was intended to emphasise the fiduciary duty bank directors owed to their bank. However, based on feedback provided by the banks, this provision discourages candidates from taking up bank directorships and more importantly, MAS has also assessed that it does not provide effective oversight over banks' related party transactions (RPTs).",10,777,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00777

Furthermore, MAS will be empowered to direct a bank to remove its external auditors if they have not discharged their statutory duties satisfactorily.",12,779,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00779

This will allow MAS to exercise better oversight of banks' activities at such locations. For example, MAS will be able to require a bank to institute adequate safeguards against money laundering and terrorism financing, before it can commence money-changing and remittance businesses at new locations.",14,781,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00781

It will also allow the parent supervisory authority of a foreign bank or merchant bank to inspect all financial activities of the bank or merchant bank in Singapore, upon MAS' approval. So, the parent based overseas can inspect the financial activities of the bank or merchant bank in Singapore, subject to MAS' approval.

2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In this context, while supporting the Bill, I would like to pose a few clarifying questions and make some suggestions with respect to implementing specific provisions of the Bill.",4,791,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00791
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The Bill imposes new requirements and expanded penalties for engaging in related party transactions that are detrimental to the interests of depositors, including non-exposure transactions. If the MAS uses this power to direct a bank to terminate a transaction with its related party, for example, that act could conceivably result in a financial loss much bigger than the $250,000 fine that is associated with this provision. Such a decision could also inflict reputational damage on the bank.",5,792,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00792
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In relation to this provision – clause 17 – there is a risk that if banks do not clearly understand the guidelines which the MAS will use to exercise its power to terminate transactions or eliminate exposures, this may create a culture of excessive notification and consultation with the MAS at best, or excessive risk-aversion at worst.",6,793,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00793
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The Bill also requires banks to immediately notify MAS of any developments that would adversely and materially affect its financial soundness, reputation and ability to conduct business.",7,794,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00794
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In relation to this provision – clause 34 – there is a risk that if the banks do not clearly understand what needs to be and what does not need to be reported to the MAS, this will create a burden of excessive notification which may raise compliance costs, however slightly. And these compliance costs may end up being passed onto end-consumers.",8,795,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00795
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in respect of these two provisions – clause 17 and clause 34 – I would like to ask if the MAS will provide banks with guidelines that it will use to determine what constitutes a transaction or exposure that could be potentially terminated by the MAS and what constitutes a notifiable material development. Will the MAS, for instance, be publishing a guidance document on how it will operationalise these powers, similar to the guidance published on anti-money laundering and terrorism finance last year and private banking controls in 2014.",9,796,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00796
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Moving onto the next part of my speech, there are certain provisions in the Bill which I do not oppose. Nevertheless, these provisions would give the MAS additional powers over banks and in some cases these powers may lengthen the turnaround time for decisions, limit business flexibility and therefore raise the cost of doing business, however slightly.",10,797,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00797
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Therefore, in the interest of transparency, I would like to pose some questions to better understand – and for the banking community and stakeholders to better understand – the Government's thinking in relation to these issues and to ask what facts prompted the Government to include these provisions in the Bill. This information may be relevant to other national sectors, than just the banking sector.",11,798,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00798
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Clause 46, which inserts a new section 57EA, requires banks, credit and charge card issuers to obtain approval from the MAS for places where they intend to conduct certain businesses.",12,799,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00799
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I would like to ask what facts or trends have prompted the Government to impose a requirement that banks seek the approval of MAS for these decisions, as opposed to just notifying the MAS. It would be helpful for the public to better understand what facts the MAS is detecting about such practices by banking businesses as it may have implications for other sectors of society.",13,800,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00800
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"For instance, is the MAS detecting overly aggressive marketing practices for credit or charge cards that may be fuelling unsustainable over-spending by at-risk families? If so, it would be useful to highlight this. NGOs and VWOs working with at-risk families and at-risk individuals could help to provide feedback to the MAS if they notice such unhealthy card marketing practices on the ground. This could help the MAS to decide which locations are appropriate locations to allow credit or charge card-related or marketing activities, for example.",14,801,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00801
2016-02-29-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The Bill also requires banks to seek MAS approval for changing locations or adding locations for non-banking activities, including money-changing and remittance services, as the Minister observed in his speech earlier. Unlike wealth management products under the Financial Advisers Act with risk of capital loss, money-changing and remittance are considered non-banking activities. Once again, I would like to ask what facts or trends have prompted the Government to impose a requirement that banks seek the approval of MAS for locations choice for these non-banking activities, as opposed to just notifying the MAS. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with that, I support the Bill.",15,802,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00802
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak today. To Mr Leon Perera's point on having cards institutions needing to seek the approval of MAS for conduct of business in certain jurisdictions, I actually support the point because my credit card just had a charge from Azerbaijan and I have no idea how it came forth. So, I do support MAS on putting in more controls on credit cards companies' places of business.",1,803,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00803
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak today on some recent developments in our local business and SME funding landscape. These past few years have seen the rise of new financing arrangements and initiatives, providing businesses with alternatives to obtaining loans from banks or personal contacts. The specific arrangements that I would like to focus on today are the peer-to-peer lending platforms, or P2P platforms for short.",2,804,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00804
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Very briefly, a company that wants to take a loan approaches the platform, which then offers the opportunity to its members. Members can choose to offer as much or as little as they are comfortable lending, within the guidelines of the platform. The platform will then aggregate contributions from many individual lenders into one single large loan to the company.",3,805,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00805
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Such services are growing rapidly globally. According to PwC, the US P2P lending market is expected to grow from US$5.5 billion in loans issued in 2014 to US$150 billion in 2025. Growth in the UK has been similarly explosive, with business P2P lending growing sevenfold from £200 million in 2013 to £1.5 billion in 2015. In Singapore, there are at least 5 such sites, which have collectively raised more than $10 million for their clients in 2015.",4,806,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00806
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"P2P lending is an example of the transformative power of the Internet – the business model simply could not work without fast and efficient communication and the ability to transact with multiple individuals. They benefit both sides. For upcoming businesses, it opens up new channels for funding, given that banks are typically reluctant to lend to companies with a limited track record.",5,807,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00807
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Harnessing the ""wisdom of crowds"", individual lenders offering smaller sums could be better at allocating capital towards future potential, thereby improving the odds of success for the start-ups and SMEs that we need to drive our economy forward. For lenders, such platforms offer a rare chance for them to earn higher returns on their money, typically above 10%, albeit with higher risks.",6,808,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00808
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"However, as with any new financial innovations, this raises concern about the appropriate extent of regulation, in order to both safeguard the financial system and protect the interests of lenders. MAS is currently in the process of drafting the required regulations, and hence the platforms are effectively operating in a regulatory vacuum. We understand, of course, that the speed of innovation can make it challenging for the regulatory authorities to keep up. At the same time, an appropriate regulatory regime is urgently needed to reduce uncertainty and maximise benefits for all parties.",7,809,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00809
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"What are the key elements of an appropriate regulatory framework for P2P lending? If we start from the perspective of risks, P2P lending seems unlikely to be a source of systemic threat to the overall banking system in Singapore, at least for now, giving that they are still small in comparison to commercial banks. The greatest risk therefore falls on the individual lenders, who risk losing all or part of their investment if the loan goes into default before the principal is repaid. How should we protect such individuals without inadvertently introducing moral hazard by creating the impression that such loans are iron-clad and can never go wrong?",8,810,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00810
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),The key piece of regulation should focus on preventing fraud by the platform. We need to ensure that the platforms are legitimate and are not operating pyramid schemes or funnelling funds towards uses other than what the individual lenders signed up for.,9,811,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00811
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"This brings to mind China's Ezubao P2P lending scheme for example, turned out to be a US$7.6 billion Ponzi scheme. On the other hand, we need to ensure that the platforms have systems in place to prevent money laundering. This suggests the need for a licensing regime, to ensure that the proper processes and accountability systems are in place at the platforms. A clear licensing regime helps reduce uncertainty and ambiguity on the part of the platforms. However, given that these companies will often be themselves start-ups, the requirements should not be so onerous as to stifle innovation.",10,812,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00812
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Regulations should not go so far as to eliminate all risk from the transaction, as that would itself create unhealthy behaviours as people chase high interest rates while assuming they will be protected should something go wrong. There is also the need to balance access and protection – if, as has been proposed, we restrict participation to Accredited Investors or Institutions, we would be protecting the average man in the street, but also preventing them from accessing a potentially beneficial asset class. Here, we can take inspiration from the various consumer protection rules already in place across the financial industry, such as ""cooling off periods"" where they can change their minds without penalty. This will hopefully reduce the risk that retail investors might invest in inappropriate products.",11,813,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00813
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"One key area is to ensure that the lenders are able to collectively pursue action should there be a default, just as any institutional creditor would. Each individual share may be too small to find it worthwhile to bear the cost and effort of pursuing a claim – hence, collective instruments for protecting the interests of all lenders need to be put in place. Perhaps we could explore making the platforms pay part of their revenues into a national fund to create an industry body that can help lenders pursue their claims.",12,814,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00814
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"We have also seen that some peer-to-peer lenders in developed countries, such as Zopa in the UK, proactively designate a portion of their funds to provide a form of insurance to safeguard the interests of lenders in the event of a default. By addressing the concerns of potential lenders, this will, in turn, help convince more to participate and accelerate the growth of the industry.",13,815,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00815
2016-02-29-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Like it or not, technological innovation in the financial industry is going to grow, and we should not stand in the way of initiatives that facilitate the creation of good businesses and jobs. Given that economic dark clouds are gathering, it is particularly key to maintain financing channels for SMEs, which are often not a target segment for major banks, as this could serve as a lifeline in tough times. What is important is to make sure the public is well-informed and that the peer-to-peer lenders operate in a regulatory environment that provides clear guidelines without being overly burdensome. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.",14,816,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00816

2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I would, first, address Mr Leon Perera's point about finding the right balance. I fully agree with the Member that there is a need to find a balance between ensuring adequate prudential safeguards and ensuring the competitiveness of the financial sector in Singapore. I hope the Member agrees that we have, in fact, been doing so over the past few years, and we have managed it, I think, better than most other financial jurisdictions, if you look at it. After the financial crisis in 2008, we saw many global financial institutions downsizing their global operations significantly. Singapore has not been spared, but I would say, if you look at the scale of the downsizing at the international level, the impact on Singapore has been relatively contained.",2,818,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00818
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In fact, our financial sector continued to post healthy employment gains in recent years. We have added 3,600 new jobs over the first three quarters of 2015 − 3,600 new jobs on a net basis over the first three quarters of 2015 − which shows that while we have taken a path to find a balance with adequate strong safeguards, I think we also ensure that our financial sector is competitive and able to retain good jobs and generate good jobs for Singaporeans.",3,819,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00819
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the other points that the Member raised, I will address them specifically. On new requirements, he mentioned clauses 17 and 34 on related party transactions and the need for guidelines and the concerns over burden and compliance costs. MAS has been very mindful of ensuring that it does not add unnecessary compliance costs for banks, and that is why I am coming up with this set of amendments. MAS consulted the industry extensively and, where appropriate, had indeed made adjustments to the requirements.",4,820,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00820
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, as I mentioned just now, on the related party transaction provisions, we are not just adding more rules but we have, in fact, repealed an existing provision that makes bank directors jointly and severally liable for the bank losses arising from credit facilities or exposures to their directors and their related parties. So, we have repealed an existing provision which we have assessed to be not so effective. Instead, we have put in place other requirements to ensure and safeguard against related party transactions. MAS will certainly be mindful of implementing this well and providing sufficient transition time to the banks to make sure that they are able to have sufficient time to transit to meet the new requirements.",5,821,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00821
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Perera had suggested having prescribed guidelines or detailed guidelines. MAS will consider this, but it is not always possible to prescribe each and every scenario where there are related party transactions, because there could be many circumstances under which they can happen. So, in some instances, it may be based on principles that are set out and adequate consultation and engagement will be done with the banks to ensure that they are able to implement. That is the same approach we will take with regard to the initiatives or new provisions that Mr Perera had highlighted. He mentioned clause 46 with regard to place of business and concerns that this may raise cost of doing business. He also asked whether there were any trends, in particular, that had sparked off such a new provision.",6,822,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00822
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, the new provisions that had been put in place were not so much in response to any particular new trends that had emerged but really with regard to looking at how MAS can provide better oversight over non-banking businesses conducted by the banks. MAS is looking at how we can do it in a more comprehensive way and to, again, ensure that we maintain our high prudential standards. The Member had suggested that this can be done just through notification. But notification alone may not be sufficient for MAS and will not give MAS the powers to act just on the basis of a notification. Whereas with this amendment, MAS will now have more powers, more ability, to ensure that prudential standards are in place and to also supervise the conduct of non-banking businesses.",7,823,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00823
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"These are new and necessary measures that are needed to ensure that our prudential standards are maintained and held to a high standard. I would also add that many of the new measures that are being proposed are not just being done by MAS alone, but they are also measures that are done internationally. These are not done unilaterally by us, but they are measures that have been discussed in international financial forums which MAS has been active in. MAS has also played an active role in shaping these international standards, which are progressively being implemented in other jurisdictions as well.",8,824,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00824
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Ong Teng Koon had talked about a new area of risk on peer-to-peer lending. It is potentially a benefit as well as an opportunity but, as he highlighted, it is also a new area of risk. I should, at the outset, clarify that P2P activities are not directly within the scope of the Banking Act, which focuses on the regulatory framework for banks involved in the business of taking deposits and lending funds. So, P2P lending may not be directly covered within the scope of the Banking Act. This is an area which is new, and it is a new form of financing globally. Within Singapore it is still at a nascent stage but it is an area which is gaining more interest and attention, and we are certainly paying attention to it.",9,825,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00825
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As the Member had noted, while these platforms add to the diversity of the financial landscape, investors participating in P2P platforms should be aware of the risks, and there are considerable risks involved. These include risks that the crowdfunding proposals may be fraudulent or that the promised returns do not materialise. Also, it is because crowdfunding is commonly used by start-up businesses to raise funds for the initial stages of a business cycle, lenders would also be exposed to the higher failure rates associated with start-ups. So, these are the risks involved in P2P lending.",10,826,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00826
2016-02-29-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The regulatory framework for P2P lending must therefore address both the risks posed by such platforms, and strike a balance between that and allowing for innovation. So, we must strike a balance between investor protection and innovation. And that is why with this balance in mind, MAS had put out a consultation paper that the Member had alluded to. This was done in February last year. It was a consultation paper on securities-based crowdfunding. MAS had proposed to facilitate such securities-based crowdfunding offerings to accredited investors and institutional investors in the first instance; but not to retail investors because they may not fully appreciate the risks involved in P2P lending.",11,827,2016-02-29-T-022-S-00827

The Comptroller of GST currently already has the power to impose Travel Restriction Orders on persons who fail to pay GST owed to the Government.

2016-02-29-T-026,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"As one of the top financial hubs that thrive in the region, it is crucial for the Singapore financial sector workforce to remain relevant, resilient and ready so as to stay ahead of the competition. The financial sector has to ensure that the workforce continues to enhance its competency level, capabilities and professionalism by acquiring work skills in new or developing business areas, or in developing more sophisticated or specialist skill sets. Only then can we effectively stay future-ready to serve markets not just locally, but regionally and globally.",34,903,2016-02-29-T-026-S-00903
2016-02-29-T-026,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Patrick Tay for his suggestions on our financial workforce.

2016-02-29-T-026,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"As I had mentioned just now, Singapore is not spared from these forces and consolidation pressures but the impact on our financial sector has been relatively contained.

In particular, individuals can approach a new one-stop career advisory facility for guidance relating to skills upgrading, and career opportunities in finance and beyond. We are setting up processes and mechanisms to help those, especially the mid-career professionals who are affected. This advisory facility, known as Financial Industry Career Advisory Centre (FiCAC), will be set up in April this year, starting with a focus on the Banking Sector and it will be extended to Insurance and Asset Management sectors in the near future.",7,910,2016-02-29-T-026-S-00910

I did a check – banking is covered in the modules and the curriculum of Polytechnics and Universities, but I agree that the curriculum can be improved. That is why MAS is working with the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to enhance the curriculum of existing banking and finance modules, including having more well-structured internships, at both the Polytechnic and University levels. In particular, our Polytechnic students can look forward to the first Retail Banking Earn and Learn Programme, which will be implemented next year.",10,913,2016-02-29-T-026-S-00913

But, in fact, we need many more Singaporean specialists, in areas like risk management, compliance, wealth management and cyber security. We do need more people to go deeper into these specialist areas. We can do various things to nurture them. We can set up new centres of excellence to deepen capabilities and work with employers to develop meaningful career progression for these specialists.",14,917,2016-02-29-T-026-S-00917

This means doing several things. We will need to pre-emptively identify the key jobs that are evolving and develop structured training pathways for professionals. We must identify new cross-functional competencies that may be needed for finance professionals, new competencies like data analytics and digital banking; new competencies that will help our professionals to be more resilient in the future. All these will support continual learning pathways under SkillsFuture and facilitate more seamless transitions for professionals across different areas of finance.",15,918,2016-02-29-T-026-S-00918

2016-02-29-T-028,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Once a report of a major traffic incident or oil spill is received, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Traffic Police will assess its severity. If traffic diversion is needed, the nearest Traffic Police resources will be mobilised. Traffic diversions are implemented swiftly once the Traffic Police arrives on scene, which is typically within 30 minutes of the report being received. Traffic advisories are immediately disseminated through various radio and online channels, such as the LTA Traffic News radio broadcast, the OneMotoring website, smartphone apps such as MyTransport.sg and LTA's traffic news Twitter account.",1,934,2016-02-29-T-028-S-00934

2016-02-29-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Online commercial crime nearly doubled from 1,929 cases in 2014 to 3,759 cases in 2015. Examples of such crimes include cheating involving e-commerce, credit-for-sex scams and Internet love scams. Police are taking active steps to address this increase. First, Police are stepping up local enforcement efforts. In 2015, Police conducted four island wide enforcement operations targeting online scams and arrested 139 persons. Persons found to be perpetrating an online scam or who knowingly assist foreign syndicates in such criminal activities will be investigated and prosecuted.",1,937,2016-02-29-T-029-S-00937
2016-02-29-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, Police work closely with their foreign counterparts to foil such syndicates. For example, Police received reports of credit-for-sex scams committed by syndicates operating in China last year. As a result of collaboration between SPF and their Chinese counterparts, the Chinese police conducted simultaneous raids and detained 43 members of one such syndicate.",2,938,2016-02-29-T-029-S-00938

2016-02-29-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Fourth, Police have stepped up public education programmes, to raise awareness and prevent the public from falling victim to scams. Online crimes are particularly hard to solve because of the borderless nature of the internet. A significant proportion of online commercial crimes are committed remotely by foreign syndicates. Despite our best efforts in going after the perpetrators in such online commercial crimes, they will find new ways to exploit and prey on the vulnerabilities of potential victims, and hide themselves from law enforcement agencies. Awareness and prevention are therefore critical in addressing the rise in such crimes.",4,940,2016-02-29-T-029-S-00940

2016-02-29-T-029,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Ultimately however, beyond public education and outreach efforts, it is about how we as individuals and families are aware about the threats on the Internet and how vigilant and alert we are.

2016-02-29-T-030,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Finance what actions are taken by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) to protect companies or businesses from being misled or deceived into paying for registration services purportedly rendered by ACRA or its related agencies.,1,944,2016-02-29-T-030-S-00944
2016-02-29-T-030,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority or ACRA is the only statutory body responsible for the registration of companies and businesses in Singapore.,1,945,2016-02-29-T-030-S-00945
2016-02-29-T-030,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"ACRA does not condone any attempt to use its name or a name resembling that of ACRA's to deceive or cause confusion to the public.

Under the ACRA Act, an offender will face a maximum penalty of $10,000 and six-month imprisonment, as well as a further fine of up to $250 per day for a continuing offence after conviction.",2,946,2016-02-29-T-030-S-00946
2016-02-29-T-030,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"While non-Government organisations can collect information from companies through private agreements, there are safeguards against such organisations trying to pass themselves off as Government entities. Letters from government agencies, such as ACRA, have distinct letterheads, with their names and logos. Companies and other business entities are also required to state their name and registration number in all business correspondences. Those who breach this requirement are liable for a maximum fine of $1,000. In the past four years, ACRA has investigated 10 business entities for failing to properly state their name and/or registration number.",3,947,2016-02-29-T-030-S-00947
2016-02-29-T-030,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In addition to having these safeguards in place, companies should exercise vigilance when dealing with any unsolicited letter or email from third parties. First, companies should check the identity of the third party or check with ACRA before engaging third parties. Companies can make use of the free business entity search function on ACRA's website to verify the identity of the third party. Second, companies should peruse carefully all the terms and conditions set out by the third party before entering into any form of agreement. Third, companies should alert ACRA if there are any suspected wrongdoings or misrepresentations by third parties. Where companies become a victim, they should make a police report.",4,948,2016-02-29-T-030-S-00948

Originally meant for a limited period, we announced in November last year that the credits will not expire so long as members continue to use them at least once a year. The $100 ActiveSG credits will be provided to new members who joined after 2015. We do not have any plans to top up the accounts of existing members.",2,951,2016-02-29-T-031-S-00951
2016-02-29-T-031,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Sport Singapore is committed to ensuring that ActiveSG sports facilities and programmes are kept affordable to encourage Singaporeans to lead active lifestyles.

All senior citizens (aged 55 and above) who are ActiveSG members also enjoy special discounted rates for admission to our gyms and swimming pools.",4,953,2016-02-29-T-031-S-00953
2016-02-29-T-032,David Ong,Mr David Ong,asked the Minister for Defence whether the recent enhancement to the NS IPPT system has improved the passing rate of the IPPT test for NSmen on their first attempt.,1,954,2016-02-29-T-032-S-00954
2016-02-29-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The MP has asked for comparisons of results following the change in the IPPT format from its previous five to the current three-station format. I propose to provide the data using results of the 2.4 km run and the sit-ups, as these are the two stations that were common to both formats.",1,955,2016-02-29-T-032-S-00955
2016-02-29-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) have performed better in both these stations after the format was changed. They achieved on average an improvement of 5 sit-ups and ran 16 seconds faster for the 2.4km. Compared to the previous format, the new scoring system encourages NSmen to go all out for each station, to compensate for lower scores in any one station. NSmen can also better focus on their training with fewer stations in the new format. For the push-up station, which is new, NSmen were able to perform above the median number required in each age category. For example, Full-time National Servicemen on average did 49 push-ups, while NSmen aged 34-39 performed an average of 30 push-ups within the minute stipulated. The overall pass rates for all those who took IPPT in the new format varied from 70% to 97%, depending on selected age categories.",2,956,2016-02-29-T-032-S-00956
2016-02-29-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The total number of NSmen who received IPPT monetary awards for achieving the standards for Gold, Silver, and Pass with Incentive has also increased. The proportion of NSmen who received Gold and Silver awards increased by 4% to about 30%, and the proportion of NSmen who received Pass with Incentive awards increased by 9% to about 30%. The results of the new IPPT format are therefore very encouraging and indicate that the change has motivated NSmen to train and perform better. The SAF is confident that more NSmen will show improvement in their IPPT as they become familiar with the new format. The SAF will continue to support NSmen through a variety of IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) programmes and the IPT-in-the-Park initiative to make fitness training more convenient, flexible and effective. Better fitness will ensure that NSmen are better prepared for their operational demands.",3,957,2016-02-29-T-032-S-00957
2016-02-29-T-033,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Manpower what has been the impact of recent CPF changes on the number and amount of CPF top-ups that CPF members can make to (i) their own CPF accounts and (ii) their family members' CPF accounts.,1,958,2016-02-29-T-033-S-00958

Another 227 AEDs will be installed this year at these constituencies. We will progressively extend this to all HDB estates by 2018.",2,1018,2016-02-29-T-046-S-01018
2016-02-29-T-046,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The AED installation will be accompanied by training for residents to be community responders. SCDF has worked with the Ministry of Health and the People's Association to provide CPR and AED training to community responders through the ""Dispatcher Assisted first Responder"" (DARE) programme.

2016-02-29-T-049,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"The Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme was introduced to promote holistic education by reducing the emphasis on examination results and recognising a more diverse range of non-academic talents, achievements and personal qualities. Schools participating in DSA are committed to develop students to their fullest potential in both their studies and areas of talent, and have put in place a range of programmes and support structures to help DSA students balance academic demands and CCA commitments.",1,1032,2016-02-29-T-049-S-01032
2016-02-29-T-049,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Schools help students who face academic challenges, regardless of whether they entered via DSA or not in two broad ways. Firstly, they make efforts to know these students, their learning styles, their strengths and difficulties and what motivates them. Many schools ensure that their DSA students are assigned teacher mentors and class buddies. There are regular discussion sessions with the DSA students and dialogues with parents to better understand the students’ needs. With this knowledge, schools can then provide targeted academic support, structured guidance and adjust their curriculum and programmes to better cater to them.",2,1033,2016-02-29-T-049-S-01033
2016-02-29-T-049,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Secondly, schools monitor these students closely. Schools track the academic performance of DSA students and have regular platforms to discuss whether and what kind of interventions are necessary. Schools also monitor the social-emotional well-being of these students and work in partnership with their parents to ensure that the students are doing well.",3,1034,2016-02-29-T-049-S-01034
2016-02-29-T-049,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Overall, the ""O"" Level performance of students admitted via DSA-Sec is comparable to their non-DSA peers with similar PSLE results.

Vaccinations against measles and diphtheria are compulsory in Singapore. The take up rates for measles and diphtheria vaccinations are high among Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, with coverage in children aged two years maintained at around 95% or higher in the last five years. The high vaccination coverage confers herd immunity and reduces the risk of disease outbreaks. As measles and diphtheria vaccinations are bundled together in the form of combination vaccines with vaccinations on the NCIS for other diseases such as mumps, rubella, whooping cough, polio, and tetanus, herd immunity is achieved for these diseases as well.",1,1038,2016-02-29-T-050-S-01038
2016-02-29-T-050,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH has taken an educational approach to encourage parents to comply with vaccinating their children. The National Immunisation Registry under the Health Promotion Board (HPB) tracks pre-school children, and sends letters to remind parents to bring their children for vaccination if they have not done so. HPB’s School Health Service actively follows up on unvaccinated children in primary schools. This has worked well and resulted in high levels of vaccination coverage among our children.",2,1039,2016-02-29-T-050-S-01039

2016-02-29-T-056,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Today, DPS coverage stops at age 60. The need for DPS is expected to decline as the member approaches retirement. This is because the member’s children are more likely to have attained financial independence and the member would have accumulated more savings to support his dependants in the event of his untimely demise or incapacitation. Extending DPS coverage beyond age 60 will provide longer insurance protection but will also mean much higher premiums because of higher mortality. We will review the DPS age limit periodically, bearing in mind the need to strike a balance between providing insurance protection for the CPF members' dependants and preserving their CPF savings for their own retirement needs.

2016-02-29-T-075,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the progress of HDB's study on implementing reverse mortgages for HDB flats; (b) what are the benefits of this mortgage scheme over the current HDB Lease Buyback Scheme; and (c) whether HDB will consider allowing owners to make use of reverse mortgages on a case-by-case basis especially for those who find this more suited for their needs.,1,1148,2016-02-29-T-075-S-01148
2016-02-29-T-075,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MND has completed its study on reverse mortgages for HDB flats. A reverse mortgage is a loan taken up by a property owner using his property as collateral. However, unlike a conventional mortgage, the borrower does not need to make cash repayment during the loan tenure. He only needs to repay the loan with accumulated interest upon loan termination or death, typically from the sales proceeds of his property. A reverse mortgage thus allows the property owner to unlock some equity while retaining the financial upside from any appreciation in property value.",1,1149,2016-02-29-T-075-S-01149
2016-02-29-T-075,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"A reverse mortgage is a complex financial product with inherent risks. First, as it does not require periodic cash repayments, the loan balance grows with interest. Second, the flat owner has to bear property risks. If the market value of the property becomes less than the outstanding loan, the owners may have to sell the property prematurely to repay the loan, resulting in them having to look for alternative accommodation at an old age.",2,1150,2016-02-29-T-075-S-01150
2016-02-29-T-075,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We note that NTUC Income offered reverse mortgage for HDB flats in 2006. As only 24 households signed up, NTUC Income has since stopped offering the product. The take-up overseas is also not high.",3,1151,2016-02-29-T-075-S-01151
2016-02-29-T-075,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There are various other monetisation options for HDB flat owners today, such as the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS). The LBS is an equity sale scheme where flat owners sell the tail-end lease of their flat to HDB and retain a shorter lease. This enables elderly households to receive a lifelong stream of income to supplement their retirement income. As compared to reverse mortgage, while LBS owners cannot sell their flat in the open market, they do not face any property equity risks. We recently enhanced the LBS in April 2015, and this was well received.",4,1152,2016-02-29-T-075-S-01152
2016-02-29-T-075,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides LBS, elderly flat owners may take up the Silver Housing Bonus if they right-size to a 3-room or smaller flat. They also have other options of subletting either a bedroom or the entire flat, and staying with their family members.",5,1153,2016-02-29-T-075-S-01153
2016-02-29-T-075,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Thus, MND has no plans to introduce reverse mortgage for HDB flats for now. MND will continue to regularly review and adjust our various schemes to meet the needs of our elderly.",6,1154,2016-02-29-T-075-S-01154
2016-02-29-T-076,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for National Development whether he will consider reviewing the property cooling measures by removing the Additional Buyers Stamp Duty (ABSD) for Singaporeans but retaining the ABSD for foreigners.,1,1155,2016-02-29-T-076-S-01155
2016-02-29-T-076,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The property market cooling measures are intended to keep the market stable and sustainable. It is too early to relax the measures now. Doing so could result in a market rebound.,1,1156,2016-02-29-T-076-S-01156
2016-02-29-T-076,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) was introduced to moderate the demand for residential property from investors, non-citizens and corporate entities.

2016-02-29-T-077,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many flats have yet to be announced for upgrading under the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) for each Town Council; and (b) whether HDB is on track to complete the announcement of all eligible flats for HIP by 2018.,1,1158,2016-02-29-T-077-S-01158

2016-02-29-T-077,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB is still working to complete the selection of the remaining HIP-eligible flats by FY2018.

2016-02-29-T-078,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for National Development how many flats are eligible for the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) for each Town Council and whether HDB plans to increase the tempo of this programme.,1,1162,2016-02-29-T-078-S-01162
2016-02-29-T-078,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) was launched in 2007 and will benefit about 200,000 eligible flats. In September 2014, the age criteria for the NRP was extended to include blocks built up to 1995, increasing the number of eligible flats by another 100,000. Thereafter, HDB had informed all Town Councils of the blocks that are eligible for the NRP. The pace of the NRP is dependent on the availability of resources to fund these programmes, and also the ability of the Town Councils to effectively implement and manage these projects on the ground.",1,1163,2016-02-29-T-078-S-01163
2016-02-29-T-079,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) from 2013 to 2015, how many applications have been made by homeless Singaporeans for a flat under (i) HDB's public rental scheme and (ii) HDB's interim rental housing scheme; (b) how many of such applications are successful; and (c) what follow-up measures are being put in place to ensure that unsuccessful applicants have a roof over their heads.",1,1164,2016-02-29-T-079-S-01164
2016-02-29-T-079,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"From 2013 to 2015, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) provided shelter to about 900 individuals and families.

2016-02-29-T-079,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Those who were unsuccessful in their rental flat applications mostly had other housing options when they applied, such as being able to afford a flat or having family support. Some were existing owners, tenants or authorised occupiers of HDB flats, but who were no longer living in their current homes for a variety of reasons, for example, due to family disputes. For those who have no place to stay, MSF will work with the social service agencies to provide temporary shelter while they find alternative accommodation.",2,1166,2016-02-29-T-079-S-01166
2016-02-29-T-079,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB, MSF and the social service agencies also work together to help individuals and families address the underlying causes of their housing instability.
