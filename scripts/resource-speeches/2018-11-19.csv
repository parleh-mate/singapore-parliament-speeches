2018-11-19-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what has been the success rate of tray returns since the programme was launched; and (b) whether there is a need to redesign the tray return collection points through enhancement of the washing area for patrons to return direct to the washing area-cum-collection point for better efficiency and reduce bird-related hygiene issues.,1,10,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00010

2018-11-19-T-001,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what measures are in place for the Ministry to take action against private operators of hawker centres who do not abide by the terms of the operating contract; and (b) what action can be taken against private operators of hawker centres whose actions or lack thereof lead to reputational damage for the Ministry, other government agencies, hawkers and other community stakeholders.",1,13,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00013
2018-11-19-T-001,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry has considered working with NHB's Our Hawker Culture travelling exhibition to better grasp public opinion and tap new ideas on what Singaporeans expect of our hawker centres beyond providing affordable food.,1,14,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00014
2018-11-19-T-001,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources where food supply is required at complexes that are open 24 hours, whether the Ministry has considered more strategic use of vending machines that provide hot food in place of mandating that hawker stalls remain open.",1,15,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00015
2018-11-19-T-001,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether rent and all ancillary charges payable by hawkers in hawker centres operated by not-for-profit social enterprises, such as dishwashing charges, are lower than those in NEA-managed hawker centres; and (b) if not, whether the Government intends to take any corrective action to reduce any additional business costs for the hawkers accordingly.",1,16,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00016

2018-11-19-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thank you. I thank the 13 Members for raising many thoughtful questions on the socially-conscious enterprise hawker centres (SEHCs). I will speak on why we embarked on the Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centre (SEHC) model, how we select operators, and share our views on how the SEHCs are performing. Senior Minister of State Amy Khor will elaborate further on our efforts to refine the SEHC model and better support our hawkers.",1,24,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00024
2018-11-19-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Hawker centres are an integral part of Singapore. They are our community dining rooms – well-loved by Singaporeans from all walks of life. They serve three key social objectives by providing  one, affordable food in a hygienic environment; two, a decent living for our local hawkers; and three, vibrant social spaces to bond our communities. These are good objectives to achieve individually; but together, they compete against one another. So, trade-offs need to be made for an optimal outcome.",2,25,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00025
2018-11-19-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Let me start by recalling that the Government restarted building hawker centres in 2011, after a hiatus of almost 30 years. We were concerned about the lack of affordable dining-out options for Singaporeans at a time when there was a boom in coffeeshops and food courts. Natural market forces were pushing up rents at those private Food and Beverage (F&B) outlets, and consequently food prices. The public was concerned about the rising cost of living. In response to widespread appeals by Singaporeans, we resumed building hawker centres to serve as a ballast to stabilise cooked food prices against the emerging dominance of coffeeshops and food courts.",3,26,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00026
2018-11-19-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government has committed to building 20 new hawker centres by 2027, in new estates or existing ones that are relatively under-served. These will provide about 800 new hawker stalls at significant investment – each hawker centre costs $15m to build. The Government absorbs the building costs and subsidises their on-going maintenance, but does not recover such costs from stall rental.",4,27,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00027
2018-11-19-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We recognise, however, that just by building new hawker centres, we cannot automatically expect them to be viable and sustainable. In the early 1970s, the Government started building hawker centres to resettle street hawkers, so as to improve hygiene and food safety standards. Over time, they became our signature community dining rooms – to this day they enable us to preserve the important culture of eating out together, regardless of our status – rich or poor, young and old.",5,28,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00028
2018-11-19-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over time too, a good number of these first and second generation hawkers, who receive cheap subsidised rentals, only work short hours. Residents in turn feedback that some existing centres do not fully cater to their dining needs. I was at Shunfu Mart Food Centre during a recent Ministerial Community Visit in Bishan East-Thomson Constituency. The hawkers only open for breakfast and lunch; some even just for breakfast. Residents do not have access to affordable food in the evening. This situation reflects a need for the careful balancing act to look after the interests of both hawkers and the community. Ultimately, hawker centres exist to serve Singaporeans. But we also have to be fair to hawkers and safeguard their well-being.",6,29,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00029
2018-11-19-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our social and demographic landscape has changed significantly. Today, the median age of hawkers is about 60 years old. We have about 6,000 cooked food stalls at our 114 hawker centres. More than one third of our hawkers and their assistants will retire in the next 10 years. Being a hawker is physically demanding. Many successful hawkers tell us that they hope their children will not follow in their footsteps. The challenges of the trade deter many young Singaporeans. We have to transform and find ways to make the hawker trade sustainable; or we may end up with hawker centres without hawkers.",7,30,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00030
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"by central kitchens and food delivery services. We must help our hawkers meet these challenges, just like how we try to help our taxi drivers face the wave of challenges from disruptive competition like Uber and Grab.",1,31,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00031
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"To adapt to changing needs and circumstances, it is critical to find new operating models to sustain the hawker trade. This is similar to the role which NTUC Fairprice has played in the supermarket landscape. Over the years, NTUC Fairprice has been innovating and moderating prices of essential groceries, which has catalysed the transformation of the mom-and-pop grocery shops. Over time, as customer profiles change, NTUC Fairprice continues to meet the needs of a wide spectrum of customers, by providing diverse product lines from affordable house brand options to premium brands. Even NTUC Fairprice would not have been sustainable if they only provided affordable alternatives without the attraction of choice for their customers.",2,32,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00032
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"This is why we are trialling the SEHC model for our new hawker centres. We have started at 7 new hawker centres, out of more than 100 managed by NEA. These SEHC operators bring new ideas and inject innovation that hawkers individually or the Government cannot. We are giving opportunity to those with expertise and networks in the F&B industry, to apply themselves to socially oriented purposes. For example, they are able to curate food stalls for quality and variety. They are also able to bring in famous food recipes, and are better placed to run hawker incubation programmes to help sustain the hawker trade. They also innovate to improve footfall and enhance vibrancy of the centres through better marketing and place-making programmes, and not just leave it to chance. As the single operator of each hawker centre, with F&B and management competencies, these SEHC operators can help our hawkers weather the competition from other F&B alternatives and adapt to technological disruptions, better than the hawkers can individually. In time to come, the better SEHCs will develop capabilities to support and sustain the hawker trade that we will appreciate.",3,33,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00033
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"As a reality check, we compare some of these costs with the alternatives like hiring additional hawker assistants, or the consequences of cheap sourcing low quality workers. Fourth, operators are required to reinvest at least 50% of any operating surplus into social benefits for the hawker centres and stallholders.",1,34,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00034
2018-11-19-T-001,,,I am heartened by the recent public discussion on how existing NEA centres are run better than the SEHCs. It is testimony that existing hawker centres under NEA management have done well over the years to meet the needs of their communities and the hawkers. But it is not enough to keep doing things the same way. This is why we have to continue with the SEHC model.,2,35,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00035
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"Several Members asked what makes a successful hawker centre. I believe most of us have patronised our favourite stalls at popular hawker centres, such as at Tiong Bahru or Adam Road. Many such existing centres are well-established in their communities. They have anchor hawkers who draw customers from all over the island. The new hawker centres do not enjoy this advantage, and need time to build up a clientele. Location and connectivity are important factors. New hawker centres at Kampung Admiralty and Our Tampines Hub (OTH), situated at transport nodes and co-located with other public services or amenities, have enjoyed good business. Higher business volume will help stallholders cope with costs.",3,36,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00036
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"On the whole, SEHCs have achieved good outcomes despite the short time they have started operations. Foremost, food prices at SEHCs are affordable and comparable to existing centres. These are generally lower than prices at surrounding coffeeshops and food courts. We cannot force hawkers to sell at cheap prices for all dishes at each stall. Instead, the operators have made available at least one affordable meal option at $3 and below for each stall, and allowed hawkers to determine prices for other dishes. This means that prices are not kept artificially low. Instead, operators work with hawkers to offer a range of food offerings at different price points, so that there are both attractive options that residents are willing to pay for and at the same time affordable options when residents want that. Some hawkers have also chosen to price their dishes low to attract more customers. For example, “Old Times” at the Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre prices all dishes below $3. Indeed, at each SEHC, there are close to 40 affordable options of various kinds of meals from 40 different stalls.",4,37,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00037
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"Secondly, SEHC operators have curated food stalls for quality and variety. They have tapped on their networks of hawkers, and have the expertise to conduct food tasting when letting out stalls. They have also introduced interesting food options such as prawn paste chicken rice and halal tze char, and new dining concepts. This ensures a good variety of food options, which is not always a given in existing hawker centres. Even in popular hawker centres like Tekka, we can find rows of stalls offering similar food because NEA is required to award one vacant stall at a time based on tendered rentals to the highest bidder. NEA does not have a mechanism to curate an attractive collection of food options at each hawker centre, like in the case of the SEHC model. Such an allocation system run by NEA would be complex to execute and be subject to potential audit issues.",5,38,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00038
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"The SEHCs are establishing themselves within their communities and serving the residents well. Ci Yuan Hawker Centre, recently passed its three-year mark. The hawkers are doing well and 97% of them chose to renew their contracts in July this year. At Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre, the renewal rate is similarly high at 96%. SEHCs at Kampung Admiralty and OTH are also doing well with hardly any vacant stalls and a long waiting list of potential hawkers. This is similar to NEA-managed hawker centres, where only 3% of cooked food stalls are vacant.",6,39,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00039
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"SEHC operators have also kept their centres open during breakfast, lunch and dinner – a major request made by the public. In contrast, some existing hawker centres focus on only one or two main meals a day, and some hawkers only work three to four days a week. To ensure vibrancy, SEHC operators have also introduced creative initiatives to increase footfall such as complimentary parking, lucky draw programmes and shuttle bus services for office workers.",7,40,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00040
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"All the SEHCs come with productivity initiatives such as automated tray return systems (ATRS) and centralised dishwashing (CDW). Providing trained and properly supervised cleaners and a more hygienic environment have increased table turnover rates, benefiting both patrons and hawkers. The average tray return rates at SEHCs are much higher than those at our existing hawker centres because of the operators' efforts in implementing the ATRS. It makes the jobs of our cleaners easier and alleviates manpower shortages that our hawkers face in looking for workers to wash dishes. During my walkabout at Shunfu Mart Food Centre, I had noticed an economy bee hoon and nasi lemak stall which had a faded sign advertising to hire a stall assistant. The hawker shared that her children were not interested in helping out at the stall and she had been unable to hire an assistant despite advertising for a long time.",1,41,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00041
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"SEHCs have also managed to attract new entrants to sustain the hawker trade. The median age of hawkers at the seven SEHCs is 43 years old, significantly lower than the median 60 age at our existing centres. This is an encouraging sign and can be attributed to various initiatives introduced by SEHC operators. For example, Timbre's Incubator Programme and OTMH's Train and Place Entrepreneurship Scheme nurture new hawkers. Collectively, the five SEHC operators have trained a total of 38 aspiring hawkers since they started operations. These efforts complement NEA's ongoing incubation stall programme (ISP), which has supported 12 aspiring hawkers to date. Eight of them are still on the programme, while the rest had decided that they were either not suitable for the hawker trade or withdrew due to personal reasons. In addition, the operators have introduced productivity measures such as centralised dishwashing, which allow hawkers to focus on their cooking and reduce the amount of menial tasks they need to do. Taken together, these initiatives reduce the physical burden of being a hawker, and can go a long way to help sustain our hawker trade.",2,42,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00042
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"Nonetheless, the SEHCs will take time to establish themselves. Ci Yuan Hawker Centre, the first SEHC, only started operating three years ago, with the latest at Pasir Ris opening in January. Hawkers at these new centres need time to build up a clientele. Overall, the average monthly stall vacancy at SEHCs, at about 10%, is not exceptionally high and is not a bad result considering that most stalls are new. Many of the hawkers are also new to the trade, and need time to experiment with their recipes and decide if this is the career for them. The centres also need time to build up footfall.",3,43,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00043
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"The market mechanism is working and Government should not intervene unnecessarily, in mandating low or no rental, which could otherwise affect fair competition. Hawkers are entrepreneurs after all. We want to reward successful hawkers to sustain the trade and preserve our beloved hawker heritage. It is natural to have some level of churn as better hawkers replace those who are less suited for the trade. Market forces would lead to a fair distribution of hawker stalls, which ultimately benefits residents. It is inappropriate for Government to subsidise a hawker on the basis that business is poor. This would be unfair to a better performing hawker who thrives on healthy competition. It would also be unfair to other private sector food shop operators located in close vicinity to the centres. The model must therefore ensure that rentals and costs are transparent and fair to hawkers, but cannot subsidise hawkers to the extent that it distorts the workings of the market.",4,44,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00044
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"despite implementation challenges, the SEHC model is generally sound. Food prices are kept affordable with a good variety of high quality options and the majority of hawkers are doing well at the SEHCs. We should not undo these achievements. As with any trials and experiments, we cannot always get it right the first time. We have heard the feedback and will adjust the model to better serve Singaporeans. We will continue with the SEHC model, and improve it so as to serve patrons well and look after the well-being of our hawkers.",1,45,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00045
2018-11-19-T-001,,,"I ask Members to give the model time to adapt, adjust and optimise the outcomes we seek to achieve  first, the availability of affordable food options that does not deny respectable earnings for our hawkers, and at the same time moderates the free market F&B alternatives; second, a decent living for our local hawkers that is sustainable even while providing affordable options; and third, to preserve our hawker centres, where we are proud of our unique vibrant social spaces, as community dining rooms where everyone goes to, where affordable food is also good food.",2,46,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00046

So, we set some key parameters. Let the market work; and when we get feedback, or issues are raised, we will move to address them swiftly and decisively, as we have done in the past month or so.

2018-11-19-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"First, we will better support stallholders to manage costs. My Ministry, together with MTI, conducted a study on the drivers of hawker centre food prices in 2014. We found that the costs of raw materials and manpower made up the bulk of the hawkers' costs at 76%, and not stall rentals which only comprised 12%. It is also shown through studies by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) that hawkers generally price food according to what the market can bear.",5,55,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00055
2018-11-19-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"This is influenced by competition in the vicinity and the demographic profile of customers. Hence, rentals do not directly affect food prices. Nonetheless, for both our existing hawker centres and our new SEHCs or new centres, we have put in place measures to ensure that rentals are fair and not speculative. For existing centres, we have removed the reserve rent and disallowed subletting and assignment. For new centres, we have, in our tender evaluation favoured tenderers who offer lower total rental and operating costs, and prohibit any increases in rentals or operating costs for the duration of the tenancy, as one of our priorities is to safeguard the interests of our hawkers.",6,56,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00056

The median rentals of stalls in comparable existing hawker centres is $1,700 per month, which is comparable to those of the new centres after accounting for the larger stall size, better-designed stalls and amenities at the new centres, and in some cases, the co-location of the new centres, with residential properties as well as other amenities.",7,57,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00057

Additionally, the actual stall rentals at our new centres range from $750 to $3,700 a month. This is in line with rentals of non-subsidised stalls at our comparable existing centres, which range from $640 to $3,900 a month.",8,58,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00058

In fact, they are nowhere near the rentals at these private F&B outlets, which can range from $4,000 to $13,000 a month, before other operating costs. We will continue to monitor and ensure that stall rentals in our new centres are reasonable to enable hawkers to make a decent living.",9,59,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00059

Currently, these grants are only available to hawkers at our existing centres under the PHC format. However, after a few years of operations with the new centres, we recognise that hawkers at the new centres may also need some support in transition as they need time to build up their clientele. These productivity solutions, such as CDW and automated tray return systems (ATRS), are necessary to alleviate our tight manpower situation and help hawkers solve problems like staff shortage. The average tray return rates of our SEHCs are far higher, at about 58%, than those at our existing hawker centres which are at about 25%. But we can do better. First and foremost, patrons should form the habit of returning their trays with the crockery after eating.",3,62,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00062

But as the demand from patrons has not materialised, both hawkers and the operator will recalibrate the arrangement. With the changes made to operating hours, hawkers who do not wish to continue with the 24-hour operations which they had previously signed up for, can do so now. NEA will also ask operators to communicate stall tenancy agreement terms in simple language to ensure that potential stallholders can understand them clearly before they commit to run the hawker stalls.",16,75,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00075

And if there are any operating surplus, the condition is that they have to plough at least 50% of this operating surplus back to benefit the hawker centre, the hawkers or the community. Some of the proposals that have been made by the successful tenderers are, for instance, providing meal vouchers for needy residents or the elderly within the community, or sharing some of this operating surplus with the hawkers in terms of providing discounted meal vouchers or one-for-one meal vouchers, for instance, like Yishun Timbre+ does, to give to the residents so that they can purchase and part of the meal would be funded from the operating surplus.",2,94,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00094

Then, NEA staff oversees the social enterprise company. What my residents have been asking is  why can we not take away all these layers? Why can NEA itself not run the hawker centre, build up its own internal capability?

I think that first of all, this social enterprise hawker centre that the media has been using is a bit of a misnomer. We actually started by saying ""socially-conscious operators"". So, what we are saying is, operators who tender for these hawker centres and run them, there must be a social mission. So, a social enterprise could be one of the operators or interested party to tender for the hawker centres, but not necessarily must be a social enterprise. What we have done is that within the tender conditions, we have ensured that there is a social mission. As I have said earlier, the Minister had also said, there are various safeguards that we have put in place in the tender conditions to ensure that we need the social objectives of the hawker centres that we started building again, in the first place. And that is to ensure that we have affordable food options of a good variety in a clean environment, ensure that our hawkers can make a decent living, and, of course, preserve our hawker culture and ensure the vibrancy of our hawker centres.",1,104,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00104
2018-11-19-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have said a number of times what these are. For instance, we favour operators who offer lower rentals and total operating costs. They cannot raise these rentals and operating costs through the term of the tenancy agreement. As I have said, there is also the requirement to plough back any operating surplus for social benefits to the hawker centres, the hawkers and the community. A good example of a socially-conscious operator would be NFC, which is part of NTUC and is a cooperative. In selecting SEHCs, we also look out for how we can harness their expertise, which is actually the recommendation from the Hawker Centre Public Consultation Panel that we try and leverage the experience of these operators in F&B and in business management, in order to be able to put in place various initiatives and various ideas to ensure and enhance the vibrancy of the hawker centres.",2,105,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00105

The Minister had elaborated in detail, some of the reasons why we need to look at new management model for our new hawker centres. The reasons are because there are inherent challenges in the hawker trade  ageing profile of our hawkers, where our existing hawkers' age profile is 60 years which means within 10 years' time, one third would retire if we do not attract new hawkers into the trade. So, it is renewal; manpower constraints, as well as the evolving needs and tastes of patrons; how do you ensure that what you offer meet the needs and demands of patrons. And also, in existing hawker centres, as the Minister had elaborated, our existing hawker centres have been around for years; they are already established. Many of them have anchor hawkers who are able to pull in the crowd. But on the other hand, you would also note that many existing hawker centres, when you go, you are sometimes not sure whether the stall is open. Only 35% of our hawkers in existing hawker centres open for three meals. Most of them for one or two meals; some only work three to four days. So, does this then meet the needs of our community, especially the newer communities where there are many dual-income families and they need to access food through the day and through the week for three meals.",3,106,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00106

Basically, majority of the SEHC stalls do offer at least one affordable option. But let me say that we only ask that they offer at least one affordable option and we are not asking them to artificially suppress the prices of all their food options. In fact, they can sell all the other food options at different price points, and that is really the concept of a community dining room, where people from all walks of life can come together, share a table and enjoy a meal at different price points. And that will ensure that they will be able to make a decent livelihood. Whichever hawker centre does not have enough of those economical meals, we can talk about it and we can talk to the operators. I have been to many of them and they do offer affordable options, and these are good options.",5,108,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00108

When we started, we identified 13 stalls that we pre-fitted and we offered these to aspiring new hawkers who are not sure if they are interested to join the trade; they are passionate but they are not sure if they can make it. So, we offered these stalls to them, subject to certain conditions, of course. They can rent these pre-fitted stalls for six months at 50% of the assessed market rent, and that is to allow them to try out. It is pre-fitted, so we reduce the initial capital cost.",6,109,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00109

Ten stalls have been taken up and we have a list of applicants now which we are processing to lease out the remaining incubation stalls. This actually complements the Entrepreneurship Programme and the Place and Train Programmes offered by the SEHC operators because many of the operators also offer training and entrepreneurship programmes for new hawkers. In fact, they have actually been relatively successful. Ci Yuan, for instance, trained 16 aspiring hawkers and 10 are still in Ci Yuan Hawker Centre, and they have converted to permanent hawkers and are doing well.

The hawker centres are built to serve the community and one of the needs of the community, as I have said, especially in newer housing estates, is to have access to these food options for the three key meals. If you do not agree to such operating hours, then it would come back to the same thing that in some existing hawker centres, when you go there, they are closed or they are opened for only half a day and it does not serve the needs of the community.

In terms of operating costs, it is also quite similar, and I have also given you a comparison. There will be costs in terms of service and conservancy charges, table cleaning – these are the key ones. For dishwashing, what you see for instance, when you compare, some people will say, ""How come it is much lower in the existing hawker centres?"" That is because of the cost element of dishwashing is often not taken into account in the existing hawker centres since most of the existing centres do not have CDWs. But if you were to take that in, you have to employ somebody for say, $1,500, just to wash dishes, or if the existing hawker centre has a CDW system, then the essential costs are actually quite similar.",2,123,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00123

I believe that the Senior Minister of State said that the higher end of the hawker stall rental range is around $13,000. At about $3.00 or $3.50 a plate, the hawker will need to sell at least 3,000 plates just to cover the rent. If our hawker stalls are to serve the objective of keeping our food prices affordable, will the Ministry consider implementing a cap on the rental to better manage food prices. Even at half that rental, at $5,000, you will still need sell at least 1,500 to 2,000 plates a month just to cover the rental.",1,125,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00125

The range of $4,000 to $13,000 is, based on our survey, the rentals for coffeeshops and food courts, not hawker centres. That is very important. What I said was that the rental of our hawker centres, new hawker centres, is nowhere near to where the rentals are for food courts and coffeeshops which range, based on our survey, from $4,000 to $13,000 net of operating cost. The rentals for our new hawker centres, median rental, is about $2,000 net of operating cost.",1,126,2018-11-19-T-001-S-00126

Just one food option. We are not asking them to sell everything at budget prices. Therefore, they have a range of options.

So, there is already a range of rental indications, and in fact we have removed the reserve rent. Therefore, even for our new hawker centres, when we evaluate the tenders, there are two things that we do. First, we get the professional valuers to assess what a reasonable market rent will be, and they actually make reference to the tendered rents of the existing hawker centres, and we also use that as a guide.

2018-11-19-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for their replies. Two supplementary questions to ask. It is heartening to hear that there are measures that are being taken with regard to self-exclusion and with regard to the caps. This is pertaining to licensed moneylenders. Would it be useful for the Government to consider, perhaps, in light of the fact that the employers are usually the ones who have to suffer the consequences should FDWs default on their licensed moneylending loans, would it be useful to have a practice where the employer's consent needs to be sought before FDWs approach licensed moneylenders for loans. So, in a way, if you look at the self-exclusion for the casinos, for example, I understand that family members can also choose to exclude certain family members; that is the practice. So, my question is, can the authorities consider with the case of licensed moneylenders, for the employer's consent to be sought before the FDW makes that loan with the licensed moneylender?",1,176,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00176
2018-11-19-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The second supplementary question is relating to the issue of unlicensed moneylenders. As far as I understand it right now, it is not an offence to take a loan from an unlicensed moneylender. Am I correct, Senior Minister of State?",2,177,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00177
2018-11-19-T-003,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,That is correct from a borrower's perspective; it is not legal for a moneylender to carry out a business without a licence.,1,178,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00178
2018-11-19-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,"Thank you, Senior Minister of State. With that clarification, Mr Deputy Speaker, what usually happens then, is that perhaps if the FDW makes that loan and she then has her employment terminated by the employer – understandably, when the employer finds out – she returns. As she has committed no crime, the FDW is technicially able to return to the country again and perhaps, this entire cycle is repeated by which the FDW then perpetuates further inconvenience and stress on her new employer. Would the authorities would consider perhaps in such cases, I understand the concept of innocent until proven guilty, but could we have some measure whereby such FDWs are either placed on a watchlist or even barred from returning until this matter can be clarified, to avoid further inconveniences down the road?",1,179,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00179
2018-11-19-T-003,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Would MinLaw or MOM be answering?,1,180,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00180
2018-11-19-T-003,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"MOM is answering. I want to thank Mr Darryl David for the supplementary questions. Let me assure Mr David and Members that while the number of FDWs borrowing from licensed moneylenders has increased, majority of them repaid their loans and the default rate remains low. His first supplementary question is whether if the FDW goes to a licensed moneylender, can the moneylender seek the consent of the employer. We have considered that – the pros and the cons. At present, MOM has not made it mandatory for the FDW to seek consent or for the moneylender to do so. We have also not made it mandatory for the FDWs to disclose their borrowings from licensed moneylenders to their employers, simply because if and when we do so, it may well trigger the FDWs towards taking more drastic actions such as gravitating towards borrowing from the unlicensed moneylenders, just so to avoid telling the employers. So, it is a very delicate balance.",1,181,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00181
2018-11-19-T-003,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The second question on if the FDW goes to unlicensed moneylenders and the employer sends her back, whether we can put her on a watchlist. This is where MOM have said that in support of MinLaw's new measures, we will deter FDWs from borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders. Come next year, we will effect the debarment measure after a period of education and communication with FDWs and also with employers, as well as other stakeholders who could be affected. We will announce the effective date at a later time.",2,182,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00182

2018-11-19-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Can I just ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether MOM is studying why the FDWs are borrowing money during their employment in Singapore? What are the main reasons? If we are not studying it, can I ask whether MOM is willing to conduct this study so that we understand what is the root of the problem is, and then, we can really address it?",1,185,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00185
2018-11-19-T-003,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I want to thank Member Mr Louis Ng for his question. Yes, we have been looking into all the possible reasons. Anecdotal evidences tell us that in certain cases, FDWs borrow from the licensed moneylenders to tide through certain requests from home such as unforeseen medical bills, college fees for their children and so on. They need to borrow this amount of money for a month before they receive their next pay check from the employers. We are thinking through and we will certainly consider mounting a study to understand this a little more.",1,186,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00186
2018-11-19-T-003,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"I would like to highlight that there are a lot of unlicensed moneylenders that pass off as licensed moneylenders; and not to mention FDWs, but even my residents would receive SMSes from unlicensed moneylenders and they just go ahead to borrow money from them. These turn out to be unlicensed. The measure of sending the FDWs back seems very drastic because the FDW may not know. Can we exercise some flexibility – with the consent of the employer, they can actually continue to stay in Singapore?",1,187,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00187
2018-11-19-T-003,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Two parts to the question. First, we will intensify the education efforts to help FDW understand who are the licensed vis-à-vis the unlicensed moneylenders. For employers who wish to continue hiring their FDWs who are debarred for various reasons – maybe because they are pending the arrival of a new FDW – they can certainly put in a request to MOM, and we will look at it on a case-by-case basis.",1,188,2018-11-19-T-003-S-00188

It is marked by big superpower rivalry, rising protectionist sentiment, xenophobia and, in the midst of all this, an ongoing technological digital revolution. As a small country, we have to respond, and we have to respond nimbly in a very volatile global environment, we have to make ourselves relevant to all powers big and small, and we have to enlarge to the maximum extent, the political and economic space for all Singaporeans. To this end, Singapore has worked very hard to make progress on several diplomatic and economic initiatives, and we have redoubled our efforts to support a rules-based world order and also to buttress the international trading system. This year also happened to be the year that Singapore chaired ASEAN, and we had therefore to host a large number of regional and international events. I want to thank all those who have been working so tirelessly over the past year, and especially our staff from the Civil Service, entire government as well as the private sector and of course our fellow Singaporeans.

As well as them, we also had Leaders from the US, Russia, China, India, Japan, ROK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Chile. Twenty Leaders present in Singapore last week. In addition to that, we also had Ms Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the IMF. We sought to strengthen ASEAN's Unity and Centrality and in particular to turn challenges, existential challenges into opportunities. And that is why during this year when we were ASEAN Chair, we focused especially on enhancing ASEAN Centrality, unity and coherence. Second, to accelerate ASEAN's economic integration, and third, on equipping people throughout ASEAN with the skills needed for new jobs in the digital revolution. You can see that actually we have focused very much obviously within Singapore on SkillsFuture  but in fact this is a need in all countries – skills for new jobs in the digital revolution. Furthermore, we have also sought to enhance inter-operability of digital and trading systems within ASEAN.

And, in particular created enormous opportunities for a tiny ‘red dot’ like Singapore. And so, this remains a constant focus for MFA. More specifically, this year under ASEAN we finalised the Model ASEAN Extradition Treaty, and work will soon begin on an ASEAN Extradition Treaty. In addition, the ASEAN Defence Ministers adopted the Guidelines for Air Military Encounters.

Members will appreciate that this is in fact a very sensitive and very difficult issue that we have been grappling with for many years. And not just us because in fact we are not a claimant state, but four ASEAN members are claimant states that have overlapping claims with China. Fortunately, we have witnessed patient, meticulous diplomacy and all the parties involved – China and ASEAN, has been able to lower temperatures, and we have been able to work constructively.

ASEAN Leaders committed to conclude the RCEP in 2019 next year. We emphasised closer economic integration through agreements on the ASEAN Single Window, the ASEAN-wide Self-Certification scheme and the ASEAN E-Commerce scheme.

This was shortly after both countries had announced their intention to commence the process of repatriating a first wave of refugees. I must say that based on my own observations at the camp that the Bangladesh government has actually done a really admirable job of providing humanitarian assistance for a very large number of refugees in a very short order of time. But having said that, having also visited the camps, the current situation is unsustainable. As long as the refugees remain in the camps, and have no jobs and means of livelihood, they will have no future prospects. Therefore, we have to welcome the fact that both Myanmar and Bangladesh are engaged in direct, detailed discussions on making preparations for the commencement of repatriations. This is a critical first step. It is not a complete solution and there are many, many details that still need to be sorted out. But nevertheless we do need to witness the commencement of a process and to make sure it is done in a way that provides for the refugees to return in a safe, secure and dignified way.",10,200,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00200

Myanmar has invited the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management to despatch a needs assessment team to Rakhine State in order to facilitate the repatriation, and ASEAN has agreed to do so. ASEAN stands ready to support efforts by all parties to address the root causes of the situation in the Rakhine State. Fundamentally, race, language, religion continue to remain live issues in our region and indeed across the world.

This bilateral agreement provides for a US$10 billion package, that comprises a local currency swap and a US dollar repurchase agreement to support monetary and financial stability, and to strengthen investor confidence in our region. These agreements reflect our belief that Indonesia's economic fundamentals are strong, and that Indonesia is a large and dynamic market, with many opportunities for Singapore businesses.",23,213,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00213
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Another initiative announced at the Retreat was the ""RISING Fellowship"".

In fact, President Halimah made her first State Visit to Brunei in May 2018 at the invitation of His Majesty the Sultan. Earlier this month, we also welcomed His Royal Highness Crown Prince Billah and a delegation of Bruneian Ministers for the sixth edition of the Young Leaders’ Programme.

2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"This year is, in fact, an especially significant year for Singapore-China relations. It is the 40th anniversary of Mr Deng Xiaoping’s visit to Singapore on 12 November 1978. Both sides have maintained a steady cadence of high-level exchanges. This year, Prime Minister Lee, Deputy Prime Minister Teo and Deputy Prime Minister Tharman have all visited China; whilst on their side, Premier Li Keqiang, Vice President Wang Qishan and Vice Premier Han Zheng have also visited Singapore in recent months.",27,217,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00217
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"We continue to build on our deep and substantive cooperation with China. During Premier Li’s visit last week, we substantially, and I make that point, substantially upgraded the Singapore-China Free Trade Agreement. This will enhance bilateral economic cooperation between China and Singapore. We have also made good progress on all three Government-to-Government projects, the Suzhou Industrial Park, the Tianjin Eco-city and Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI). In fact, there is a new acronym in town. CCI now has a New International Land Sea Trade Corridor (ILSTC). This was formerly called the Southern Transport Corridor. The CCI-ILSTC connects the overland Silk Road Economic Belt with the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. It will enhance infrastructure connectivity and commerce within China, and between China and Southeast Asia. In fact, one of the reasons for the name change, and this suggestion came from China, was to make the point that they are talking about bilateral two-way flow of goods and services between China and Southeast Asia, and obviously we are at the heart of Southeast Asia, and from there, to connect to the rest of the Maritime Silk Road.",28,218,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00218
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Cooperation on the Belt & Road Initiative is a new highlight of our bilateral cooperation. It has progressed well under the four platforms. I will enumerate them. First, infrastructural connectivity. Second, financial connectivity. Third, opportunities for third-party collaboration. And fourth, professional services, including legal and judicial cooperation. There will be much work to pursue in the years to come. We will build on this year’s strong momentum to further enhance our bilateral cooperation with China, including at the provincial level through the latest proposed Singapore-Shanghai Cooperation Council.",29,219,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00219

Several Ministers, including me, have visited the US this year, to meet our counterparts and engage members of Congress.

In a sense, we have no choice but to subscribe to that because we will always be a small, tiny red dot, and our trade volume is more than twice our GDP. So we have no choice but to subscribe and do our best to support multilateralism, a rules-based world order and international trade.

The Pacific Alliance is Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. MERCOSUR and the Pacific Alliance are significant trading blocs in South America. They represent the fifth and eighth largest economies in the world. We are also having on-going and encouraging discussions on the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)-Singapore FTA.

But if we look at what has been achieved this year, we do not need to be pessimistic about its outcome. Even in times of significant geopolitical turbulence, Singapore has built up that very precious asset called ‘trust’. Trusted by our neighbours and by the international community. They trust us because they know we are straight, honest brokers. We are sticklers for international law, a rules-based world order and free trade, and we believe in the sanctity of agreements and contracts.

MFA will work closely with all other ministries and agencies to keep our foreign policy balance sheet in good order. What is important, and this is a point I want to re-emphasise, is that foreign policy begins at home and we do need to maintain broad domestic support for our foreign policy. An effective foreign policy rests on this domestic consensus, a consensus built both within this House, and outside this House with fellow Singaporeans. As we commemorate our Bicentennial next year, 2019, I hope you will continue to work as a Whole-of-Nation, to build a safe, secure and prosperous home for all Singaporeans and our neighbours.

2018-11-19-T-004,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I would like to ask a supplementary question on the humanitarian aspect. May I ask the Minister what is the Ministry's view on the repatriation of the Rohingyas that has been announced to commence in mid-November 2018 and whether from the point of view of ASEAN, enough has been done to ensure that those who return will not face the same threats to their safety as when they first left.",2,234,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00234
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Thank you. We are talking about a current and still evolving situation. As I said earlier, the silver lining, having visited both Bangladesh and Myanmar and having spoken to Prime Minister of Bangladesh and the State Counsellor of Myanmar, is that I can state with a fair amount of confidence that both sides sincerely do want a return of the refugees. The State Counsellor herself has acknowledged that they are residents of Myanmar and that they are entitled to go back. This is a brave position for her to take.",1,235,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00235
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Similarly, Bangladesh, as I said earlier, has done a fantastic job, a really admirable job, in looking after the refugees. But they also know that it is not sustainable and that at some point the refugees need to go back. The key point is this.  it has to be voluntary, it has to be safe and it has to be dignified. I cannot give you a very specific date on which it will actually begin. Because apart from the preparations made by both sides, the refugees themselves have to agree and have to want to go back. Having spoken to some of the refugees, the refugees' key concern is security. Having to risk life and limb to get across to the refugee camps, their question is  will it be safe for me to return? How will my neighbours, the community and the other communities in Rakhine State view their return? They have asked what will be their livelihood, because in the end, nobody wants to be a refugee, everyone wants to get a job, a good job, to be able to support their families. So the point is there are many, many details that need to be sorted out.",2,236,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00236
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The other point I would emphasise is the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) also have to do their part, both in terms of support and presence on the ground but also in building confidence. We should bear in mind that there are extremists on both sides who do not want this problem to be resolved and do not want the refugees to go back early. Because as long as this problem remains unresolved, it is a festering locus for extremism and for the recruitment of future terrorists. Which ultimately threatens not only their immediate neigbourhood but in fact threatens us all, across ASEAN.",3,237,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00237
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"So there are a lot more details that need to be sorted. What I can say now, from my own interactions, is there is sincere goodwill on the part of both Myanmar and Bangladesh. We need the UN to do more. And of course as ASEAN, we will also be willing to step up. And it is ultimately about confidence and trust.",4,238,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00238
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"And the domestic lesson for us here is to understand why we are so focused on making sure inter-ethnic and inter-religious relations are looked after so assiduously.

2018-11-19-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I have one clarification for the Minister concerning our relationship with Indonesia, particularly on the issue of extradition. I believe about a decade ago, the Singapore and Indonesian governments agreed to tie extradition together with some defence cooperation agreements, and, we have noted your update that we have concluded an ASEAN model Extradition Treaty. So, my question is  how will this model treaty affect our position with Indonesia as far as extradition is concerned? Does it mean that the Singapore Government is prepared to proceed on extradition without it being tied to defence cooperation?",1,241,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00241
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"That is a good question, and I thank the Member for asking that. There are actually two separate matters. You have been in House long enough to remember that we had actually agreed with Indonesia on two agreements – Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) and an Extradition Treaty (ET). They were both signed in the presence of the respective leaders, Prime Minister Lee and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia. Those Agreements remain signed but unratified. We will have to wait for the political dynamics within Indonesia as to whether you are going to see any progress on those two bilateral agreements.",1,242,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00242
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"What I referred to was the ASEAN Model Extradition Treaty which in a sense forms a starting base to begin negotiations for an ASEAN Extradition Treaty. This will not be bilateral. This will be regional. Being a lawyer, you know that once it becomes regional, the scope and conditions will be quite different from that of a bilateral treaty. So, I would still keep this on two separate channels.",2,243,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00243
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The important point for the ASEAN Extradition Treaty is that we do want to emphasise the importance of rule of law and interoperability within ASEAN. But I would not conflate the two Extradition Treaties because we are going to keep them separate. The specific terms and conditions will not be the same between the two. As a lawyer you would know, for instance, if you want to extradite someone, you have to show that it is an offence in both sides domestically. Now if you look at a 10 by 10 extradition treaty, you can imagine the permutations and the lowest common multiple will be quite different from what you would have had in a bilateral Extradition Treaty.",3,244,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00244
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, I think suffice to say without getting into details, our position is this – there is a bilateral DCA and bilateral ET which were signed and witnessed by our Leaders, but not yet ratified. We will wait and see what happens with that. That, however, does not mean we should not be able to proceed with negotiations for an ASEAN Extradition Treaty on different terms. I want to emphasise that it is on different terms.",4,245,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00245
2018-11-19-T-004,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Mr Ang Wei Neng.,1,246,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00246
2018-11-19-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. On the issue of refugees, I am glad that the Minister said that ASEAN countries should step up. Could I ask what kinds of specific help, financial or otherwise, other ASEAN countries, other than Myanmar, have pledged to assist to resolve the crisis? And have any countries agreed to take in some of the Rohingya refugees selectively?",1,247,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00247
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Actually, there has been a global outpouring of support for the refugees. And even from Singapore, I think the Member would be aware that at the grassroots level, at the NGO level, there has been fundraising and there has been support extended to the refugees. We have also extended help directly to the refugees in Bangladesh. For instance, the RSAF conveyed a couple of shipments. I believe Senior Minister of State Maliki was there at the handover.",1,248,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00248
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Specifically, within Myanmar itself when they go back – I myself have not visited Rakhine State – but the reports that I have received were that a lot of the homes and the farms were destroyed. Thay actually need to rebuild homes and a means of livelihood. Right now, for instance, I know India and China are helping with constructing pre-fabricated homes. But actually what is important is for the refugees themselves to be able to construct homes of their design and at the standard they are accustomed to.",2,249,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00249
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I know one problem which I have been informed of is that there is a lack of labour within Rakhine State to do rebuilding. Therefore, there has been proposals by the Myanmar government to have a cash-for-work programme so that the refugees will be paid to rebuild and to engage in construction and reconstruction.",3,250,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00250
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"There will be needs. There will be appeals. But actually, my sense of the issue right now is that the primary limiting factor is not money. The primary limiting factor is trust – confidence on the part of refugees and trust, and the ground conditions within Rakhine State itself. So, let us wait and see.",4,251,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00251
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"But we as ASEAN should be prepared to help in whichever way possible. And sometimes just the delivery of humanitarian assistance on the ground and having people on the ground – it is not so much the specifics of what is in the package, but the fact that someone else was there. Someone else was there in goodwill and helping to build trust. This is another point I want to emphasise. You must remember that there are other minorities within Rakhine State. In fact, the indigenous people in Rakhine are the minority in Myanmar. They also need support. They also need to enhance their livelihood. Again, trust requires all communities to be confident and to have a hope that there is a better future. There is a lot more work to be done.",5,252,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00252
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,I just wanted to clairify a little bit on the point that Ms Sylvia Lim raised. Let me just get this thing right. The Defence Cooperation Agreement and the Extradition Treaty that we signed with Indonesia – it was signed by both governments. Let me just state for the record  Singapore is prepared to proceed as and when Indonesia ratifies those two agreements. Let me just state that for the record.,6,253,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00253
2018-11-19-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Thank you, Sir. Can the Minister share what major points of contention were removed in the single Draft Negotiation Text of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea? And in the Minister's opinion, how far is the draft away from being adopted by all the Member states?",1,254,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00254
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Let me be very frank with the Member. Yes, it is true we have arrived at a single Draft Negotiating Text. But let me not raise false hopes that all the issues are simple to resolve. For instance, if you speak to the different claimant states, each of them will stand up and loudly proclaim, ""Those areas are indisputably mine"". In other words, even what is in dispute is disputed. Do you see my point? ""This is indisputably mine"" Then another side picks it up and say, ""No, this is indisputably mine"". You cannot even agree on what areas are in dispute. I am just giving you an example of a very thorny issue.",1,255,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00255
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Other thorny issues  is this a binding agreement? And then there are enough lawyers here who may quickly then ask  is this a legally binding agreement? And then for those of you who are familiar with international law  even if you get a judgment, how will it be enforced? Who will enforce it? So I am just trying to give you a flavour of the enormous challenges which lie ahead.",2,256,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00256
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Nevertheless, China has said that they hope that there will be a first reading of the Negotiating Text next year and they also hope that it can be settled in three years. My own view is that I think that is a very optimistic scenario. But let us not pre-judge the issue. As I said earlier, the fact that patient, meticulous, and constructive diplomacy has at least brought us to this point where the waters of the South China Sea are much calmer is still worth noting. It is still a positive step. But do not ever assume it is going to be an easy or short journey.",3,257,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00257
2018-11-19-T-004,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I thank the Minister for the comprehensive view of MFA's work, I think it is important for us to stand up for multilateralism at a time when nationalism is on the rise everywhere. The question I have relates to some of the issues that arose from the SingHealth enquiry. Do we still have to worry about foreign interference in our local politics? And if so, what could be the best steps our people could take to prepare to deal with that?",1,258,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00258
2018-11-19-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The short answer is yes. Your second question was what steps we need to take. I think the first point is public education and people need to be aware that we will always be a target for campaigns and misinformation campaigns and deliberate online falsehoods. So the first thing is to be aware of it. The second point is to be sceptical of what you receive through all your social media feeds. I remember this very good piece of advice that our former President Dr Tony Tan gave. He said when you receive a message, ask who it is from, second, ask who it will benefit and of course ask if it is accurate or not. I do not want to prejudge other issues which will be brought to this House. But let us get real, there will always be the danger of foreign interference. You will have to take it almost as standard statecraft of the digital age. And if you assume everyone is going to act with restraint, it will be very foolish.",1,259,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00259
2018-11-19-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I would like to join my fellow Members to thank Minister and MFA especially, for all the work they have done to try and resolve the crisis in Rakhine State and in Bangladesh as well. I have three supplementary questions. One, I previously asked Minister whether Singapore will be sending a second consignment of humanitarian aid to the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and the Minister at that point, replied that it is pending further assesment. Now that he has been to the refugee camps, could I ask for an update on whether we will be sending this humanitarian supplies?",1,260,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00260
2018-11-19-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The second is on the repatriation, which I agree should happen, but I am wondering whether once they are back in Rakhine state, whether there are plans to grant them citizenship?

On further consignments of aid, yes, we are prepared to, but I would consider targeting the aid to the refugees when they return. What I saw in the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar; I know you were there, but you were there earlier last year; and according to the people on site, there is a vast difference now. The conditions the refugees are living now are much much better than when they first arrived. You know, I used to be the former Environment Minister, so I notice things like drains, latrines, water supply, food supply, cooking gas and energy – and – actually there has been a lot of work that has been done, especially on the Bangladesh side of it. My greater concern will be when they return; the rebuilding programme and ultimately their livelihoods and making a living.",1,263,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00263

And whether during the ASEAN Leaders Summit, does he sense the political will to conclude the RCEP? And what could be the obstacles there?

I calculated, I took about 36 visits a year so I thank you for your personal support. Actually I should start off with an apology to the House for not mentioning AIPA, the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary meetings which you have hosted, and Speaker has chaired. That has been very important and useful. It has also been particularly eye-opening for the younger Members of Parliament to meet your counterparts from other ASEAN States and more importantly, to see how these issues can paralyse us, can divide us and how difficult. I mean there were some resolutions that you cannot even get onto the agenda, much less agree on a resolution. So, I apologise for not mentioning this. I should have but I want to congratulate and thank all of you who did participate in AIPA and I encourage you to continue participating as it moves on to other destinations as well.",1,269,2018-11-19-T-004-S-00269

In other words, not yet ready to declare conclusion. There are a couple of both negotiating as well as political considerations which have led to the current position where we can report substantial progress but not yet conclusion. On the Member's question as to what are the chances of it being done next year – well, based on the Leaders' pronouncement last week, all of them indicated their support for it to be concluded early 2019. On the Member's next question are there potential derailers, of course there are potential derailers, including the fact that there are several elections next year.

We are in a much stronger fiscal position today. However, building a new line remains a major decision due to the large upfront capital outlay involved. For example, the construction of the Downtown Line cost $21 billion, or close to 5% of our GDP in 2017. This escalation in costs over time is not just due to inflation, but also because we are now building under more challenging conditions, for example, deeper MRT tunnels and stations amidst our increasingly built-up environment.",2,285,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00285

This includes constructing rail infrastructure such as stations, tunnels and tracks, acquiring the first set of operating assets such as trains, performing investigative studies, as well as associated costs such as the cost of land. The RIF may also be used to replace existing operating assets, if such replacement is required to operate the expanded rail network. For example, when we build rail extensions that connect to existing lines, operating assets on the existing lines may need to be replaced to allow both sections to interface properly.",9,292,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00292

The development of a rail line does not end after it is constructed.

Clause 5 distinguishes the use of the RIF from the RSF. The RIF is intended for the expansion of the rail network and the acquisition of the first set of operating assets necessary to enable this expansion. On the other hand, the RSF is intended for the renewal of rail operating assets, such as trains. While the RIF is solely made up of Government subsidies, the RSF comprises a mix of Government subsidies and Licence Charge collected from the rail operators under the New Rail Financing Framework. This distinction reflects the allocation of financial responsibility between taxpayers and commuters – tax dollars will be used to invest in the civil infrastructure and the first set of operating assets. Thereafter, every generation of commuters will need to pay part of the recurrent cost of operating the rail network, including the renewal of operating assets.

2018-11-19-T-010,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, t he MRT and LRT networks are vital transportation arteries that residents of Singapore rely on. Based on statistics released by LTA in 2017, the average combined daily ridership on our rail MRT and LRT networks is approximately 3.3 million per day. This represents a sizeable proportion of daily commute on our public transportation system, and these numbers are expected to rise in the near future when our total rail capacity is further expanded with the opening of new train lines.",1,299,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00299
2018-11-19-T-010,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Since 2016, train operators have gradually transferred their rail assets to the Government under the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF).

2018-11-19-T-010,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In principle, the NRFF should have a positive impact on rail reliability since it increases the onus of preventative maintenance on the network operators. Yet, there have been several high-profile train disruptions in 2017, such as the flooding of the MRT tunnel in Bishan, the Joo Koon train collision, and a series of incidents that affected three train lines on the same day in November 2017.",3,301,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00301

I would also like to inquire if the Ministry has developed a set of financing guidelines for the fund and whether it will be making these guidelines known.",6,304,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00304
2018-11-19-T-010,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The topic of public transport, Sir, is not just a critical one, but it also somewhat an emotive one because it affects everyone in one way or another. While Singapore continues to upgrade and enhance our rail and network system, we need to build in a rubric of checks and balances to ensure that our investments are reaping due returns in the form of enhanced performance and reliability. Has the Government then pre-determined a set of expenditure-performance ratios to measure the returns of capital expenditure from the RIF vis-à-vis the expected improvement in train reliability and performance?",7,305,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00305
2018-11-19-T-010,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Aside from setting up the expenditure-performance ratio, has a set of asset replacement guidelines been drawn-up to ensure that capital equipment is replaced or bought before the need to do so becomes pressing? For example, lifts in public housing estates are generally replaced when they hit the 28-year mark or thereabouts. What is the lifespan of rail assets before they are being replaced and how is the operational lifespan of these assets determined?",8,306,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00306
2018-11-19-T-010,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the coming decade will see several big ticket expenditures in our public transport.

2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The costs for rail infrastructure development have risen sharply over the years.

2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Inflation aside, the real costs for rail development will continue to rise because our rail development now takes place in a highly built-up environment. And as our rail network grows, we will always be renewing some part of the system which will also be costly.",3,311,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00311
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"So, in this light, the Rail Infrastructure Fund is a timely move. We want to avoid raising taxes substantially or borrowing at perhaps unfavourable rates when the time comes to make these investments. Provided that the Government can commit to prudently setting aside this money, the RIF will help us to finance these important infrastructure developments at the lowest possible cost. It is a move that makes our transport finances future-ready.",4,312,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00312
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"However, there are also other challenges involved in ensuring that our transport system is future-ready. Sir, the Government has planned for Singapore's MRT network to reach 360 km long by 2030. This is nearly double that of the present network. The RIF will provide us the financial capability to pay for these important investments, but we must also have the human resource capability to operate and maintain the systems and we must have the public support that commuters and tax payers alike are willing to pay the upkeep of the system.",5,313,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00313
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Let me first touch on the human resource factors. Sir, our rail engineers and transport workers perform a highly skilled and often thankless job under demanding conditions. In 2017, SMRT announced that they were on track to increase their engineering staff strength to 700 engineers by 2020. This followed a 2012 review by SMRT that identified a need to triple the engineering strength to handle the maintenance, renewal and operations of future MRT lines.",6,314,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00314
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Now, tripling your engineering staff strength in just a few years means that the majority of our rail engineers today are relative newcomers in the field. Sir, I do not doubt the training, integrity and commitment of our rail engineers. But experience and expertise does take time to develop, and I think the question is why was the engineering strength in our core public transport operators allowed to remain at levels that are manifestly inadequate to the task?",7,315,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00315
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Let me suggest some reasons. Under the old financing model for public transport, operators had to survive based on profits from the very narrow margin between fare revenue and operating costs. Since there is little that our operators can do to raise the fare revenue side of the box, they had to keep costs down. Maintenance and operations are cost centres, so the pressure naturally fell on engineering to do more and more with less and less.",8,316,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00316
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, this was efficient from a narrow point of view. The old public transport financing model was designed to push operators to minimise costs and, hence, to minimise the fare burden on the public. And because of that we paid relatively little to operate a world-class transport system while the system was new. But we ended up paying for it later through deferred maintenance and poor reliability. And, today, our rail operators are also paying the price. SMRT trains lost $86 million in the Financial Year 2018 because fare revenue simply does not match the operating expenditure required to provide a high quality, reliable system. It is not hard to see the danger in this.",9,317,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00317
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, I think it is important that the Government put the financial model for our train operators on a path for long term stability and sustainability. The Government has already done so with the Bus Contracting Model for our bus operators. A similar contracting model that mitigates fare revenue risks for rail operators, that also gets value for money through competition or benchmarking, may be needed for the rail sector. It is not about rescuing shareholders or private companies. It is about ensuring that our rail operators and their core engineering capabilities have the resources needed to thrive. Of course, we must ensure there are incentives to remain efficient. But the financial model needs long-term stability. A young talented Singaporean must see rail engineering as a viable long-term career where they can make a real difference. With support from the right Government financial and training framework, our public transport operators can build the human resource capabilities for our future rail system needs.",10,318,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00318
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Now, let me touch on the issue of public support for these investments. Planning for our original Mass Rapid Transit system took place in the public eye. Early studies began in the 1960s. The final decision to proceed with a rail-based system was only made in 1982. The high costs of a rail-based system, versus an all-bus system, were the sticking point. I think we are all glad that the Government made the decision to invest in the MRT. But the point is that the public was aware of, and publicly debated, these decisions to spend billions of dollars on rail infrastructure.",11,319,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00319
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Today, I am concerned that we lack a similar level of public engagement and shared responsibility for decision-making in the transport system. The Senior Minister of State for Transport is now chairing the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 public consultation exercise. This is excellent. But I would suggest that we go beyond current efforts. We must continue to involve the public as a co-creator of decisions made in public transport, ranging from investing in MRT lines, to determining the quality of service offered. These decisions have cost implications and the public is ultimately paying the bill.",12,320,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00320
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"This question of public support for our transport system has often been framed as one of commuter satisfaction. But I think that is a narrow definition. If you put huge subsidies into the system and you greatly improve quality, as the Government has done in recent years, then of course the commuter will be satisfied, or at least more satisfied. The taxpayer may not be. But the problem is that today, the commuter may be satisfied without having any idea of the real costs and trade-offs involved in providing a world-class transport system.",13,321,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00321
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, in the Financial Year 2018, the Land Transport Authority spent $1.5 billion dollars on bus service fees and collected only $831 million dollars in fare revenue. For rail, the Minister for Transport said in the Committee of Supply debate this year that $4 billion will be spent to renew the rail system over the next five years. Meanwhile, an NTU study, commissioned by the Public Transport Council, found that our fares were the second lowest among 12 major cities worldwide. Commuters may not realise that their fares are low, because they are only asked to pay today for a relatively small part of the operating costs.",14,322,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00322
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I think the Government must set out a clear long-term vision of how commuters will contribute to the longer term funding and investment decisions for public transport. The Public Transport Council’s introduction of the Network Capacity Factor, which links fares to the relative supply and demand for public transport services, is a good first step. It means that when the public enjoys better connectivity and less crowded rides, they share in the costs of providing these services. But now that the public pays part of these system costs, they must also have a way to say when they have had enough. We do not want to force people to buy business class tickets when what they really want is economy – or premium economy. There are no market forces that would allow commuters to tell us what is the right mix of quality and price in public transport, so the Government has to do more to engage the public to discover this.",15,323,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00323
2018-11-19-T-010,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, I strongly support the Bill. It places the Government on a firm financial footing to continue to provide a world-class public transport system. I hope the Government can assure us that, in addition to financial capacity building, equally strong measures will be taken to build human resource capabilities, and public engagement and support, for our public transport system.",16,324,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00324

After the completion of the re-signalling project, the reliability of the line has improved. So, thank you.",2,326,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00326
2018-11-19-T-010,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),I would like to raise three points today.,3,327,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00327
2018-11-19-T-010,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"First, can LTA share how we determine on the life-span of the key assets and system? If we draw on the lessons over the last decade or so, the key issue is how do we ensure timely upgrades, as well as preventive maintenance. Does LTA determine this life span through international benchmarks? Or through LTA’s internal assessment working with engineering consultancy companies?",4,328,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00328
2018-11-19-T-010,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"If LTA relies on international benchmarks, can LTA share which country and which system did we use for? And when we localise those benchmarks for use locally, do we account for Singapore-specific conditions such as our heat and humidity levels?",5,329,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00329
2018-11-19-T-010,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Secondly, I would like to request that LTA communicate to our people the true cost of the MRT system per trip. With that, I strongly agree with the previous Member's view that our people will need to understand, not just the quality of service, but how much it cost them. In the long run, our spending depends on our citizens' needs and expectations. So, our citizens need to know the true cost of service provision, even though we continue to ensure that fares, after subsidies, remain affordable to the broader public.",6,330,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00330
2018-11-19-T-010,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"For example, in our medical bills, we reflect the true cost, and then we reflect the subsidies, before arriving at the amount that Singaporeans have to pay. That is a good approach to keeping Singaporeans informed. As such, from time to time, through various channels including on the MRT station platforms and trains, we should communicate to our people the true cost of our MRT networks per trip. This cost should include components such as infrastructure investment cost as well as total operating cost. This is important information for our citizens, and I suspect, will shape our discussions in our Chamber over time. I hope we cannot just talk about satisfaction levels, but also whether or not, like the previous Member said, are we over-consuming or under-consuming transportation resources.",7,331,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00331
2018-11-19-T-010,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"And my final point is a technical one. In clause 6 (a), can I check how LTA will ensure that the expenses are charged accurately in the ""Railway Sinking Fund"" and/or ""Rail Infrastructure Fund"" since ""demolition and replacement"" expenses could be for both Funds? I assume that the Sinking Fund is for existing lines and the Infrastructure Fund is for new lines. Demolition and replacement expenses of any rail line is likely to be a major expenditure. When will LTA charge these under Sinking Fund and when will it do so under Infrastructure Fund?",8,332,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00332

This is why we have embarked on an extensive public consultation exercise, as part of developing the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) for 2040. Over the last two months, many Singaporeans have shared their concerns and aspirations. Some have participated in our Focus Group Discussions and LTA is gaining valuable feedback through this process. LTA is also taking the opportunity to share its planning considerations and trade-offs. Please continue to come forward and participate through the LTMP consultation process, so that together, through partnership, we do achieve the best possible outcomes.",3,337,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00337

We are not able to issue receipts for each ride, so we use other ways to communicate the cost and subsidies. Over the next five years, the Government is subsidising $5 billion for bus services, $4 billion for renewal of rail operating assets and $20 billion to expand our rail infrastructure. We will continue to communicate to commuters the cost of providing public transport services.",4,338,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00338

2018-11-19-T-010,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"LTA integrates our transport plan closely with the land use plan and builds new rail lines only when there is a strong use case.

2018-11-19-T-010,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Darryl David also asked how LTA determines when to replace and upgrade key assets and systems in a timely manner. LTA determines the replacement schedule of our rail assets based on the asset design life and the specific asset’s actual condition. This is to take into account variance in life span under Singapore’s operating environment, as Mr Kwek correctly noted. Where necessary, LTA also engages engineering experts to provide third-party opinions. Going forward, LTA is developing the Rail Enterprise Asset Management System, which will integrate asset information and maintenance records across the different systems, so that the health of the various operating assets can be monitored holistically over their respective lifecycles. The system will be equipped with data analytics capabilities to monitor asset performance and identify potential faults before they occur, so that these assets can be repaired or renewed pre-emptively. This shift towards data-driven predictive maintenance and asset renewal will enable sustained rail reliability, while optimising overall lifecycle costs.",9,343,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00343

SMRT has already raised its maintenance headcount by more than 700, as has been noted by Assoc Prof Theseira, since its transition to the New Rail Financing Framework. And Assoc Prof Theseira also correctly noted that it takes time to train and groom our engineers. To attract, develop and retain skilled engineers and technicians for the land transport sector, we are professionalising the rail engineering vocation and have seeded a $12.5 million Public Transport Manpower Development Fund to drive manpower development initiatives. We are also partnering our institutes of higher learning and centralised academies, such as the Singapore Rail Academy, to roll out workforce development programmes.",11,345,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00345

This is so that they can continue to attract engineers to join the industry and to invest to sustain high rail reliability. LTA has just completed transitioning all rail lines to the New Rail Financing Framework this year. Under this model, the Government co-shares the fare revenue risk with the operators. This is a big step towards building financial sustainability that Assoc Prof Theseira spoke about. We will need to evolve our financing model to continue to adapt to the changing operating environment.

This was contentious at the time, it would be one of the most expensive infrastructure projects for our young nation. After 15 years of careful study, the Government committed in 1982 to build the North-South and East-West Lines at a price of $5 billion, close to 15% of Singapore’s GDP at the time. It was a difficult decision but the right one. When these lines started operations in 1987, it opened up new possibilities for Singaporeans to live, work and play.",16,350,2018-11-19-T-010-S-00350

2018-11-19-T-011,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this move to ensure that any Singaporean who seeks justice may obtain it. It is a sign of a compassionate society when we ensure that even those who lack financial means may still be able to afford the ability to protect his or her rights. Access to justice provides all Singaporeans with the same dignity and the same fundamental right to fairness. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this Bill.",16,439,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00439
2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I stand in support of the Bill. Many Members, myself included, have asked for the Director of Legal Aid to be given broader discretion to extend legal aid to those who do not qualify under the means test. I am heartened to see that the Ministry has taken on board our suggestions in allowing the Director general discretion to grant aid if it is just and proper to do so.",1,440,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00440
2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"It was announced just last week that, from next year, a new system set up by the Legal Aid Bureau will help applicants access legal aid more quickly by allowing lawyers to browse and select cases, and legal aid applicants to check the status of their applications.",2,441,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00441
2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"These legislative amendments, coupled with improvements in implementation, are progressive moves towards improving access to justice for the most vulnerable and becoming a more compassionate society.",3,442,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00442

2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Firstly, the Ministry has stated that the qualifying limit for the new means criteria to be set in subsidiary legislation will take into account the latest income data to maintain the number of eligible households. However, if legal costs have increased, access to lawyers may be beyond the reach to a larger number of households. If that is the case, rather than holding the number of eligible households constant, legal aid may need to be extended to a larger number of households.",5,444,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00444
2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"When the Act was amended in 2013, the criteria was relaxed to increase the percentage of qualifying citizens and permanent residents from 17% to 25%. The last large-scale study of legal costs in Singapore was the 2001 Census of The Legal Industry And Profession. The census had suggested that the billable rate of law firms had steadily increased between 1998 and 2000. Is the Ministry tracking the trends in legal costs and the proportion of households for whom legal representation remains inaccessible? Will the Ministry consider increasing the percentage of qualifying citizens and permanent residents?",6,445,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00445
2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Next, currently, an aided person who wishes to appeal a decision must make a new application for legal aid. In the Assigned Solicitor's Guide, the solicitor is advised that they cannot act for an aided person who is looking to appeal a court judgement. There are strict timelines that must be adhered to in an appeal. This is acknowledged in the Assigned Solicitor's Guide, which advises the aided person to file a Notice of Appeal on their own before making a new application for legal aid. However, whether the aided person decides to appeal is likely to depend on whether they are able to obtain further legal aid. In this situation, it is left to the Assigned Solicitor to decide on their own initiative whether to assist the aided person in filing the Notice of Appeal.",7,446,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00446
2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Could the Minister clarify the rationale for subjecting the aided person to another round of means and merits testing to obtain legal aid for the appeal? The means of the aided person might have changed, but I doubt it would have changed significantly for most persons. Admittedly, the merits of the case may need to be considered afresh if it is going to an appeal. An unfavourable decision may cast new light on the merits of the claim. In a favourable decision where the aided person is appealing against the amount awarded, it should be considered whether the sum awarded truly is so unsatisfactory as to warrant an appeal and whether this should be supported with legal aid.",8,447,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00447
2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, given that the claim has gone through an initial round of merits testing, it may not need the in-depth assessment given to a new claim. Again, considering the strict timelines that must be adhered to in an appeal, would the Minister consider an expedited process for assessing whether to extend legal aid to an aided person who wishes to file an appeal?",9,448,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00448
2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Similarly, a new application for legal aid must be made for an aided person to enforce the judgement.",10,449,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00449
2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Could the Minister also clarify the rationale for subjecting the aided person to another full round of means and merits testing to obtain legal aid in enforcing the judgement? The means of an aided person would similarly not have changed much after obtaining the paper judgement from the court. The merits of the case would be further reinforced by the favourable judgement given by the court.,11,450,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00450
2018-11-19-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Having supported an aided person all the way to the point of obtaining a paper judgement, surely, it would be logical for Legal Aid to see the claim all the way through until the aided person obtains the sum claimed which is the entire objective of filing a claim in the first place.",12,451,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00451

2018-11-19-T-011,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the amendments will certainly simplify the criteria for legal aid applications substantially. Instead of considering several components of disposable income and capital, focusing on the main categories of the applicant's per capita income, home annual value, savings and investments will help to expedite the assessment process.",1,454,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00454
2018-11-19-T-011,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"However, the new set of criteria still leaves certain applicants at a disadvantage. For example, an applicant may need to support parents, siblings or other vulnerable family members who do not stay with him under the same roof and thus are not considered during the computation of per capita income. I hope the Ministry will be able to exercise some flexibility for such applicants on a case-by-case basis.",2,455,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00455
2018-11-19-T-011,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to seek clarifications about the role of Central Provident Fund contributions under the new criteria. Will it be considered a component of savings and investments? If so, can it be excluded since the payouts from CPF are not immediate? In addition, if an applicant has a negative net worth, that means his personal liabilities exceed his personal assets, can this be taken into consideration for his application?",3,456,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00456
2018-11-19-T-011,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),May I ask the Minister how many applications were received in the last 10 years and how many were unsuccessful? What were the main reasons for the unsuccessful applications? Can the Ministry provide details of the various categories?,4,457,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00457
2018-11-19-T-011,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Lastly, for applicants rejected for legal aid, can the Ministry consider alternative assistance for them?

2018-11-19-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"A key reform in the Bill is the changes to the means test to be used to assess eligibility for legal aid. I recognise that it is not easy to fix a fair and equitable means test that is totally immune to criticism. The new means criteria of Per Capita Household Income is commendable, as it allows more flexibility in the assessment of means, to take into account the overall income situation of the household and not the applicant's individual situation, which may not be reflective of his/her situation.",8,467,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00467
2018-11-19-T-011,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Let me give you an example. Last month, I filed a Parliamentary Question arising from a case. It concerned a legal aid application made by a father, seeking assistance to be appointed as a deputy of his mentally disabled son. I asked why is it that the father was treated as the applicant as opposed to the son. Ordinarily, his son would have been eligible for legal aid but he cannot apply because he is not mentally capable. The application for deputyship and legal aid was made by the father. The application, afterall, was for the benefit of the son and it was meant to facilitate the care and management of his son. Unfortunately, the father was deemed not eligible for legal aid, as the current means test only looks at his circumstances as an individual and not that of his son.",9,468,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00468

May I clarify  does this operate as an appeal to the Minister by the applicant who has been refused a Grant of Aid by the Director?

I would be grateful for a clarification on the statement. I note that MINLAW has stated that the qualifying limit for the PCHI test will be set such that there will be no material impact on the number of households who are eligible for legal aid. However, there would presumably be some increase in eligible cases given the shift from individual-based criteria to household-based criteria.

2018-11-19-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The types of assistance I mentioned earlier have more or less helped to address concerns about the issue of access to legal aid.

Today, we are debating specifically on the Bill for legal aid and advice that will form an administrative guide for the Legal Aid Bureau, which handles legal aid for civil cases.",4,487,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00487
2018-11-19-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"One of the concerns often raised is the process of means-testing someone before legal aid can be provided by the Legal Aid Bureau. Currently, when applying for legal aid, there are numerous details that must be provided and documents to prepare. This process can be daunting. It also takes time and causes the means testing process to be further delayed. In the Bill currently before us, there are proposals to establish new means criteria, that has been updated and will simplify the application for legal aid. I support the proposal. It is hoped that with this new criteria, the application process can be shortened. I also hope that the criteria that will be established can be scrutinised so that more people can be helped.",5,488,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00488
2018-11-19-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"On this note, another matter that is often raised is the eligibility for legal aid. Having legal troubles is not something one often plans for or expects. So, when one needs to commence action or defend a case in Court, he or she may face difficulties financing the legal costs, even though he or she may be earning a decent income. At the moment, the Legal Aid Bureau is constrained by the Act in its present form and can only provide assistance to those who can fulfil the prescribed criteria. I am, therefore, grateful that amendments have been proposed to allow discretion in granting legal aid to those who may not completely fulfil the prescribed criteria, but nonetheless still require help. Certainly, there should be guidelines for the proper exercise of this discretion. I am hopeful that this discretion will be used judiciously and can benefit more people who may be going through a difficult time in their lives.",6,489,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00489

2018-11-19-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"One of the issues often raised is the means-testing process that is currently in place. The assessment process calls for much information and numerous documents to be provided. This can be overwhelming and daunting for the applicant. At a time when they most need help and are most likely preoccupied with significant matters happening in their lives, the requirement to prepare copious documents before they can get help, adds to the stress. This requirement also often delays the process because the applicant would need to set aside time to look for and prepare the documents. I am, therefore, very pleased to note that the Bill proposes to give the Ministry the flexibility to establish new means criteria to be set out in the subsidiary legislation. I note the Ministry’s efforts in reviewing the means criteria; to update and simplify the criteria. I also note that the plan is to align the means criteria to those commonly used in current social support schemes.",9,492,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00492
2018-11-19-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"While I understand the need for alignment, there are already concerns with the existing means criteria. For example, in determining Per Capita Household Income (PCHI), we have heard some grievances of those who have children or relations living in the same address but not contributing to the household income. Also, in considering the Annual Value (AV) of a property, it would be pertinent to note that there may be people who are residing in a private property not as a luxury but because of their circumstances. These grievances may be adopted if we take the PCHI and AV assessment methods wholesale. Would there be some way of addressing some of these issues head-on and provide for appropriate deductions or exceptions at the outset? I am not suggesting that the assessments are made less rigorous. I believe it is important to check properly and only grant aid to those who truly deserve it. However, if we already know that the applicant may be facing some difficulties, perhaps we could account for these situations, subject to the provision of some basic evidence.",10,493,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00493
2018-11-19-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The other issue that is often raised as a pain-point is the eligibility for legal aid. Could there be adjustments to the limits of the prescribed means test to allow for more to qualify for legal aid? Having legal troubles is not something one often plans for or expects. It is not a habit to set aside savings for legal costs. So, when there is a need to commence an action or defend a case in Court, it is common to hear of situations where the individual is financially stretched and have difficulties financing their legal costs, even though he or she may be earning a decent income. In recent times, there have been calls for more legal assistance to be given to the ""sandwich class"". I appreciate that a line has to be drawn somewhere and we will not be able to help everyone. However, we should endeavour to help as many as possible and we need to look at some measures to be able to address this gap.",11,494,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00494
2018-11-19-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I am, therefore, grateful that there are provisions in this Bill to give the Minister discretion to grant legal aid if it is deemed just and proper. I believe there will be guidelines for the proper exercise of this discretion. I am hopeful that this discretion would allow for more deserving applicants to receive help even though they may not meet all the prescribed means requirements.",12,495,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00495
2018-11-19-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"On a separate note, in the effort to enhance access to justice and close the gaps, I believe one strategy is to encourage and incentivise low bono efforts by lawyers. We have already many lawyers doing pro bono work, but this often comes at a cost to the lawyer’s earnings. I know people joke about how much a lawyer earns but the truth is not all lawyers are mercenary and not all lawyers earn big profits. A law practice is also a business and would have overheads and operational costs, just like a medical practice or other professional services. In fact, the legal fraternity also has to go through industry transformation like other industries in Singapore.",13,496,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00496
2018-11-19-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Bearing this in mind, and considering the need to close some gaps, we may, therefore, want to cast our sights on a more sustainable solution which could be a win-win solution for all. At the Opening of the Legal Year this year, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, proposed a family law assistance scheme. The idea is to develop a low-bono model to increase access to legal services for those in the sandwich class who are embroiled in family disputes. This is a meaningful suggestion which is being looked into. There may also be a further need to incentivise lawyers with Continuing Professional Development (or CPD) points to recognise them for efforts in pro bono as well as low bono work. I hope there would be more support in thinking about and developing such low bono models that could allow for more to benefit from getting proper legal advice and aid, but which could also support the legal sector.",14,497,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00497

2018-11-19-T-011,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"First, clause 3A states empowering the Director of Legal Aid to appoint ""suitable and experienced"" public officers who are not qualified persons under the Legal Professional Act. Can I understand more about how Legal Aid will determine what kind of processes or cases will merit public officers rather than qualified persons? And will it compromise the interest of the aided person in representing his case?",2,500,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00500
2018-11-19-T-011,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Second, clause 5. I note that legal aid is provided to both Singaporeans and PRs. Are all PRs given the same rights as Singapore citizens with regard to legal aid? Or is there another set of tighter criteria necessary for PRs to qualify, such as closer ties to Singaporeans?",3,501,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00501
2018-11-19-T-011,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Third, clause 7(a) allows the Director to exercise this new power instead of a board. Can MinLaw share the rationale of this change? How can we balance achieving this potential increased efficiency with the downside of having the Director being a bottleneck or a single point of failure?",4,502,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00502
2018-11-19-T-011,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Last of all, can MinLaw share about how the LAB assesses financial criteria on who to help, especially on the grounds for discretion? For example, there are some families with higher income than the threshold, but the family relationship may have been strained and money is not allowed, or the family have significant medical expenses or debts.",5,503,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00503
2018-11-19-T-011,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Another point we could look at is the cost of the legal aid to be provided. I mean, say, for example, the sandwiched class. They are two different matters. One is to get the LAB to handle something that costs thousands of dollars of legal fees. It is another thing to ask the sandwiched class to take on a very serious law suit which can go on to tens of thousands of dollars. So, will the cost of the legal aid that is being provided be considered in the discretionary framework?",6,504,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00504

2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the number of legal aid applications. In the past 10 years, LAB had received a total of 97,100 applications approximately. Of these, 88,800, or more than 90%, passed the preliminary means test.",3,509,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00509
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In general, applicants who were unsuccessful had failed the eligibility criteria because they exceeded the disposable income or capital assets limit. Around half of LAB’s cases concern matrimonial matters. Other common cases concern the enforcement of court orders, monetary disputes, and also probate.",4,510,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00510
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me next address the questions about the new means criteria and limits. Mr Henry Kwek asked about the assessment, while Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Murali asked about the qualifying limits and how they would be set. Mr Gan asked whether CPF moneys would be included in the assessment of the applicant’s savings and investment, and Mr Murali also asked whether CPF contributions would be included in the assessment of the applicant’s income. Finally, Mr Murali asked if there is a need for additional resources to be provided to MinLaw to administer the new means criteria.",5,511,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00511
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"MinLaw will adopt the Per Capita Household Income (PCHI) and the Annual Value (AV) of the applicant’s place of residence, savings and investments as the new criteria to replace the current disposable income and disposable capital criteria. The new criteria are simpler and much more aligned with what are commonly used in current social support schemes.",6,512,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00512
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The new means criteria consider the applicant's gross income and assets, instead of his disposable income and disposable capital. We will incorporate most of the permitted deductibles within the current means criteria, such as CPF contributions, when setting the new income limits in the new assessment criteria to minimise the risk that those applicants who were previously eligible would no longer be eligible when we move from disposable income to gross income.",7,513,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00513
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,We will not include the applicant's CPF moneys in the computation of the applicant’s savings and investment. This is also consistent with our existing means test.,8,514,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00514
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The qualifying limit for the new means criteria will be set later in subsidiary legislation, as I said earlier, to take into account the 2018 income data. But it will be set at a level where there will be no material impact on the number of households who will remain eligible for legal aid, and it will be set at a level which would ensure that a similar level of households at present, which is approximately 25%, will be maintained.",9,515,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00515
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Next, we do not anticipate at this point in time a significant spike in the number of cases that come forward, and, hence, my point earlier about the allocation of Government resources. So, it will be managed. My Ministry will allocate the appropriate resources to deal with any increased case load as they arise. But bear in mind also that the amendments do provide for Specialist Legal Executives to come on board to lend support to the giving of advice and also to appear in court for some of these cases. So, that will also ease the load on the LAB.",10,516,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00516
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Gan asked if the use of household income would disadvantage applicants who need to support family members staying in a different household. In other words, what Mr Gan is saying is if I look at only the household income of this individual, it may not give me a full picture because he may be supporting a family member residing in a different household.",11,517,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00517
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We do not consider family members living in a different household in calculating the PCHI because family relationships can be complex and diverse. The situation that Mr Gan cited could well work the other way – where an applicant could be supported by a family member not living in the same household. In other words, he is coming to apply, and based on his PCHI he would qualify, but yet, he is also being supported by a family member living outside of his household. The Government is not privy to the family dynamics in each situation and so, it is best at this stage to use the household income as the best proxy for family support.",12,518,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00518
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Furthermore, this will also be more convenient for applicants, as they will not have to provide information on family members who may not live with them, the extent of their support and the extent of their familial relationship, and why that may be.. So, at present, we will keep to using the per capita household income.",13,519,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00519
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Given these, we will adopt per capita household income as I said, although I would stress that in appropriate cases, we would also be able to consider the scenario that Mr Gan mentioned, where it is just and proper to do so. That is precisely the reason for the framework that we are building into the new amendments, where if it is just and proper, then the Minister may have the discretion to allow aid to be granted. To take the example a bit further, if the applicant is the sole source of support for that family member, and the family member is not a beneficiary of other Government schemes, those are factors that can be taken into account.",14,520,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00520
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Louis Ng had asked whether the Ministry is tracking the legal costs and the proportion of households for whom legal representation remains accessible and whether we would consider increasing the coverage for civil legal aid. Ms Rahayu also asked if there could be adjustments to the limits to allow for more to qualify for legal aid.,15,521,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00521
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I would assure Members that MinLaw regularly reviews the means test for civil legal aid, taking into account legal costs, the cost of living and other factors, to ensure that legal aid remains accessible to Singapore Citizens and also Permanent Residents of limited means who cannot afford their own lawyers.",16,522,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00522
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Legal aid is targeted and given only to those with limited means, as it has to be, because we have limited resources and we need to be prudent about how we allocate them. In the most recent review leading up to this Bill, we had taken into account these factors in deciding to retain the coverage at the present levels. And as I mentioned earlier, at this level, approximately 25% of households are covered.",17,523,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00523
2018-11-19-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Gan asked if we could consider negative net worth as part of the means assessment, if the applicant's debt liabilities exceed his assets. Mr Murali also asked on a related note if we would consider circumstances where families are put into significant expense as a result of intervening events. We do not generally exclude liabilities such as debts when we assess an applicant's means. I think what Mr Gan has in mind is if you are servicing or have taken out a loan which may be secured and where the security value may be below the value of the loan that has been taken, whether that can be taken into account. The reason we do not do that is because the applicant may have secured debt liabilities, for example, a mortgage or a car loan, which is quite common, but may still possess savings or income above the means limits. This may then allow him to afford legal fees. He would not be considered, in that situation, a person of limited means.",18,524,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00524

Mr Murali asked, in particular, what are the circumstances where it would be “just and proper” to grant aid. I think I have given a sense of what that might be in my earlier paragraph. Ms Rahayu also asked if we can consider extenuating circumstances, for example children or relatives staying in the same household but not contributing to the household income, or applicants who stay in private properties due to their circumstances, in our computation of the PCHI or Annual Value.",22,528,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00528

The key words being ""just and proper"". We want to retain that flexibility on a case-by-case basis, because each case will be different; the circumstances that present for each applicant will be different and we want to have the flexibility to be able to assess these factors on a case-by-case basis. When such cases arise, the Minister may authorise any person, and that includes a panel of persons, suitably qualified, to make that assessment.",23,529,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00529

Mr Murali gave some examples and Ms Rahayu as well. We will also consider if family members staying in the same household cannot contribute to the individual’s legal costs. Children are one example; the other would be where the family members living in the same household may be estranged from each other. I just do not want to be taken in my answer to be limiting the circumstances which we consider, so I do stress that it is on a case-by-case basis and looking at the particular facts of each case.",24,530,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00530

Circumstances in such a case, however, which may affect the merits of bringing or resisting an appeal, or in enforcing a judgment, may have changed, and it would be useful to have regard to this in the fresh merits evaluation to ensure that the grant of aid still remains appropriate.",45,551,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00551

LAB is working with other agencies, such as Biglove and Hearts @ Feiyue for applicants with child protection issues. The referral protocols allow LAB to refer applicants who require other social services to these agencies for help. Conversely, the agencies may refer applicants who require legal services to LAB for legal help as well. So, it works both ways.

However, his son continued to use violence against him and during one quarrel, his son pushed him on his chest, causing him to hit his back and fracture his rib. LAB was aware of this and immediately referred him to PAVE, a family violence specialist agency. PAVE worked with the Senior Activity Centre near the applicant's flat to set up a community watch for this individual. PAVE then subsequently also worked with LAB to support the applicant throughout the court process.

For example, if an applicant applies only for assistance in divorce proceedings, but when they come to LAB and LAB officers detect that there might also be family violence involved, then LAB will consider if it would be appropriate for him or her to also commence PPO proceedings or other such measures, and assist with those applications. If the order involves the maintenance of wife and children, we will also inform the applicant how he or she can enforce the order if the other party does not comply with the order.",57,563,2018-11-19-T-011-S-00563

Finally, we also enhanced frameworks that enable Singaporeans to resolve their disputes quickly and cost-effectively, and where possible, as amicably as they possibly can in the circumstances. So, we have built up the infrastructure for mediation to take place; community mediation has been happening for a while.

Today, a person is required under the CDSA to report to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO) when he knows or has reason to believe that any property is linked to criminal conduct or drug dealing, and comes across such information in the course of his work. Such reporting is critical to our ability to enforce against money laundering and other crimes, as law enforcement agencies rely heavily on such intelligence to initiate and support investigations. However, the existing penalties for not doing so are manifestly low, with a maximum fine at only $20,000. Given the sums of money involved in such crimes, this is not sufficient as a deterrent.",14,589,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00589

This is despite the property agent being well aware of his obligations to file the Report through guidelines and checklists issued by the Council for Estate Agencies. For this case, the client had wanted to buy a property at Sentosa Cove. Had the sale gone through, the agent’s commission would have been in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

This means that for a person who is convicted of bringing $100,000 into or out of Singapore without declaring it, the Court has the option to confiscate up to $80,000. This gives the Court greater discretion to impose heavier penalties for CBCRR cases. This will bring our penalties in line with jurisdictions like the United States.",36,611,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00611

2018-11-19-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Next, we will also amend the CDSA to enhance the sharing of financial intelligence with financial intelligence units of overseas jurisdictions. As money laundering offences are often transnational, the exchange of financial intelligence between jurisdictions is critical to support the investigation of these cases. Currently, the law only allows us to exchange intelligence with countries with which we have bilateral arrangements.

In effect, this will allow us to exchange financial intelligence with more than 150 financial intelligence units of overseas jurisdictions which are members of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, thereby tripling the size of our network. We will be able to access more valuable information, while being assured that information shared in return is not abused, through the guidelines that the Egmont Group puts in place for its members.",40,615,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00615

This gives effect to Resolution 2178 (2014) of the Security Council of the United Nations and is also in line with FATF standards.",43,618,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00618
2018-11-19-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Next, we will enhance TSOFA penalties for greater deterrence. Clause 21 inserts a new section 6B into the TSOFA to make a person who abets, conspires or attempts to commit a terrorism financing offence under section 3, 4, 5 or 6 of the Act liable to the same punishment as if the person had committed the offence under the applicable section.",44,619,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00619
2018-11-19-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),These acts are no less egregious than the primary terrorism financing offence and should be punished at the same level to create a clear deterrence against anyone from getting involved. This proposed amendment will align how we peg our terrorism financing penalties with jurisdictions like the United Kingdom and Australia.,45,620,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00620
2018-11-19-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"We will also make amendments with clauses 17, 18 and 19 to protect a person against civil liability when the person complies with TSOFA prohibitions.

We must do all that we can to obviate these risks.",47,622,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00622

2018-11-19-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Bill is also timely. Why? Because the present and rapid advancement of technology has facilitated the exchanging of cash for virtual currency and vice versa. Technology has also enabled transactions and transfers to be done from almost anywhere. For example, someone who does not have an e-payment app could easily ask someone else to help them pay another person in exchange for the money in cash. This would not normally be a problem unless the cash actually came, for instance, from dealing in drugs or other illicit activities. To make matters worse, there could be a cross border element to the crime.",2,626,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00626
2018-11-19-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill expands the scope of the offences pertaining to money laundering and provides a more comprehensive approach to tackling the issue. In particular, clause 4 expands the definition of capital market products, no longer requiring the product to be linked to Singapore. This allows a charging order to be made against more assets.",3,627,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00627
2018-11-19-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Additionally, clause 11 of the Bill creates a new offence for a person to possess or use any property that may be reasonably suspected of being or representing any benefits of drug dealing or benefits from criminal conduct, if the person fails to account satisfactorily how the person came by that property.",4,628,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00628

2018-11-19-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Because people would not be convicted of a crime without fulfilling both the mental element and physical action of the offence, there may be instances where although they were unaware, acts of terrorism are still being financially supported.

2018-11-19-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides expanding the scope of offences, this Bill also makes enforcement and investigation easier under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes Act, or the CDSA, an Act that the Minister alluded to in her speech. How? By facilitating the sharing of information internationally and by making it easier to prove that something is a foreign serious offence or foreign drug offence. This is holistic and should be welcomed. After all, knowledge and information are key assets in winning wars against terror as well as its financing.",11,635,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00635
2018-11-19-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The third way in which this Bill strengthens our response to transnational financial crimes is by enhancing penalties. Firstly, the maximum punishment has increased substantively. For instance, clause 5 changes the maximum penalty for an individual from a fine of $20,000 to a maximum penalty of a fine of $250,000 and/or imprisonment of up to three years. I agree with the enhancements. Why? Because these financial crimes are calculated crimes based on the lucrativeness and perceived benefit of committing a crime. They can be committed across jurisdictions. Therefore, it is imperative that Singapore plays its part by deploying tough laws to deter money laundering and financing of terrorism. As such, would the Minister share with us how the proposed punishment tariffs compare with other jurisdictions and how the punishment tariffs in this Bill were calculated. I believe the Minister talked about how the punishment tariffs were calculated in the Bill. I am asking how they compared to the other jurisdictions.",12,636,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00636
2018-11-19-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, in conclusion, this Bill strengthens our response to transnational financial crimes involving money laundering and terrorism financing. It is timely and needed. Therefore, I support it.",13,637,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00637
2018-11-19-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, in its press release on the Bill on 1 October, the Ministry explained that this Bill seeks to strengthen Singapore's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing frameworks. It was stated that the Bill would enable Singapore to more effectively tackle money laundering and terrorism financing, which are usually more complex and transnational in nature. The Ministry emphasised that there was a need to ensure that our laws remained relevant to the current operating landscape.",1,638,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00638
2018-11-19-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"One gets the sense that this Bill is being tabled because the current laws are deemed somewhat inadequate to deal with the problem of money laundering and terrorism financing. Indeed, the on-going investigations into the 1MDB scandal and the alleged transfers of hundreds of millions of dollars to and from the Singapore bank accounts of Mr Low Taek Jho or Jho Low make uneasy reading. An online financial news portal finews.asia has even described Singapore as, and I quote, ""the banking center at the heart of the scandal"". While the facts are yet to be fully established, this is a reputation we do not want. I thus support moves to strengthen the legal and enforcement machinery to tackle this challenging task.",2,639,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00639
2018-11-19-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To have a further understanding of the need to amend our laws, could the Government share its assessment of the current efficacy of the two Acts in question, namely, the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act or CDSA and the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act (TSOFA)? What has been the rate of reporting, detection and prosecution, and how satisfactory is it?",3,640,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00640
2018-11-19-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Coming back to the Bill now before the House, I note that the Bill focuses much attention on enhancing the penalties for offences. For instance, under clause 5, the maximum fine for not reporting knowledge or suspicion of property suspected to be linked to drug dealing or criminal conduct has gone up from $20,000 to $250,000, an increase of 12.5 times. For offenders who are not individuals, being entities, such as banks and corporations, the fine has gone up to $500,000, an increase of 25 times. Clauses 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 22 and 23 will also impose on entities an additional monetary exposure of being fined an amount of up to two times the value of the benefits of crime.",4,641,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00641
2018-11-19-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, having penalties that sting is certainly necessary, but not a sufficient deterrent by themselves. Such illicit activities will go on unless the chance of being caught is high. Here, the law enforcement agencies face a monumental task. Besides their transnational nature, laundering criminal proceeds and financing terrorism usually involve layers of intermediaries including seemingly innocuous ones like legitimate businesses and charities, making detection especially challenging. Earlier, the Minister also mentioned anonymous digital transfers as yet another obstacle for investigators to overcome today. In this vein, I would like to seek some clarification as to how the Government as a whole is going about improving the likelihood of detection of such activities. Such an endeavour will involve other authorities and agencies besides MHA.",5,642,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00642

The ACIP would specifically work with eight banks and the Association of Banks in Singapore. One year on, how has enhanced a likelihood of detection of such crimes?",6,643,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00643
2018-11-19-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Besides domestic agencies, the sharing of financial intelligence across borders is vital. To this end, I note that clause 6 of the Bill is amending section 41 to enable Ministry to share financial intelligence not just with jurisdictions with which it has bilateral arrangements, but with other jurisdictions which have endorsed the Egmont Charter and Principles for Information Exchange. It would be useful for the Minister to give her assessment on how well the current bilateral arrangements are working, and to elaborate further on the potential of working with countries who have subscribed to the Egmont Documents.",7,644,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00644

Our regulatory framework are current and relatively robust but there may be loopholes. Moreover, money laundering and terrorism funding these days are getting more sophisticated and it may go undetected for sometime.

By then, it may be too late as the monies may have been dissipated by the accused.",12,668,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00668
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),These provisions will have “bite” if assets are frozen at the outset and the confiscation order is then applied against the frozen assets.,13,669,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00669
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"There could also be situations where assets from ill-gotten gains are in Singapore, given that it is a prominent international financial centre, but the perpetrators may not here. Hence, the prosecution, much less convictions are not contemplated. Yet, there is a compelling case to seize and confiscate such monies too.",14,670,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00670
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As the hon Minister mentioned, these activities can have the impact of ""destroying our reputation as a trusted global financial centre”.",15,671,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00671
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I would suggest that we consider having civil seizure and confiscation provisions prior to or in parallel with criminal proceedings.,16,672,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00672
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The Organised Crime Act has such provisions. The Act which was introduced in 2016 allows for confiscation without the need for a criminal conviction where a person carries out a serious offence at the direction of an organised criminal group. Serious offences include the various offences under the CDSA such as assisting to retain, acquiring, possessing or transferring benefits of criminal conduct",17,673,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00673
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"However, the Organised Crime Act, as the name implies, requires the prosecutor to prove that the accused knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that he or she was acting in accordance with the direction of an organised criminal group. Hence, the ambit is fairly narrow. Providing for a wider civil-based freezing and confiscation regime under the CDSA would give the law enforcement agencies more teeth.",18,674,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00674
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As a parallel, the USA has a civil forfeiture regime in place, which allows law enforcement officers to take assets from persons suspected of involvement in crime, without necessarily charging them for wrongdoing.",19,675,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00675
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),Australia also has similar legislation which allows for civil-based recovery. Such civil-based recovery allows restraint and recovery of assets suspected of criminal origins without the necessity of securing a criminal conviction.,20,676,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00676
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The UK has additionally introduced an ""unexplained wealth order"" civil-based regime whereby, independent of a conviction in a criminal court, a person's assets may be seized and confiscated in favour of the government if he or she is unable to explain the disparity between his known sources of wealth and the value of his assets.",21,677,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00677
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The UK Law Commission has recently embarked on a two-year project to review its laws on confiscation to ensure effective recovery of proceeds of crime, which is presently in the pre-consultation stage. The review will focus on whether the present conviction-based confiscation regime is sufficient and what improvements could be made.",22,678,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00678
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Specifically, it is consulting on a proposal whereby a person who is charged in court for an economic crime, is also visited with a “freezing order” of his assets amounting to the same amount that he is alleged to have gained from the economic crime.",23,679,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00679
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"It is typical, in the words of Prof Michael Levi, a very well-known criminology professor, that criminals in such situations often claim that they have spent all their ill-gotten gains on fast women and slow horses. Clearly though, they should not be taken at face value. We should ensure that we have sufficient tools to combat economic crimes – in particular by depriving criminals of their ill-gotten gains. In this regard and in light of the global trends, I have three suggestions",24,680,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00680
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"(a) Providing for an increase in punishment or some punitive measure against the criminal if the confiscation order made against him is not satisfied. There is already a trend in UK of unsatisfied confiscation orders. Such paper judgments cannot deter people from committing economic crimes. What we do not want is for criminals to go to jail at the expense of our people, come out and then connect with the monies that they had stolen later.",25,681,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00681
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"(b) Providing resources to our authorities to “chase” after the assets of criminals in other countries. It should not just stop at invoking MLATs, that is, Mutual Legal Aid Treaties. If necessary, there should be civil actions taken to recover the proceeds.",26,682,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00682
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"(c) At the point of charging a person for an economic crime, if he has unexplained wealth in his name, even though it cannot be specifically traced to the crime in question, the authorities should consider commencing money laundering prosecution in parallel so that the unexplained wealth may be frozen pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. This will allow the confiscation order that may be made subsequently in the event of a conviction to have more “bite”.",27,683,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00683
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In my Parliamentary Question last month on economic crimes, I had asked for the total value of assets misappropriated or gained by offenders who have been convicted for economic crimes in Singapore, in contrast with the total value of assets recovered by the authorities.",28,684,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00684
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The response from the Ministry was that Singapore does not track such data. With respect we should.,29,685,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00685

2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Separately, I would ask how would the confiscation orders work in the context of co-accused persons? Would they be jointly and severally liable in respect of the confiscation order?",31,687,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00687
2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Moving on, in respect of the proposed amendment to allow for exchange of information under an international arrangement, I note from the hon Minister’s speech that this would include the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units.

2018-11-19-T-012,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The confiscation provisions in the Bill specifically focuses on the final D is deprivation. My suggestions are made in the context of focusing also on the first two Ds, that is, getting the authorities to detect the extent of a criminal’s wealth and as well as providing some “teeth” to deter like-minded offenders. As criminals constantly revamp their methods to evade detection and the law, we too must constantly evaluate our means to guard against them or deter such behaviour. I support the Bill, which is in step with in our efforts to ensure that Singapore is not seen as an easy target for criminals.",34,690,2018-11-19-T-012-S-00690

Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked how we are regulating non-profit organisations, businesses and professions, such as law and accountancy. She also asked how Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) is working with the management of mosques to ensure that they do not run afoul of our laws on anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing.

2018-11-19-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"FATF member countries, such as Singapore, go through periodic assessments to assess our compliance with the standards, and whether our measures are effective.

2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill 2018 covers six tax changes. These include a measure announced in the 2018 Budget, as well as five changes arising from periodic reviews of the GST regime to ease business compliance, clarify existing legislation and improve tax administration.",2,744,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00744
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),We sought views from the public on the draft Bill earlier this year. MOF has evaluated all the feedback received and incorporated them where relevant to the draft text of the Bill.,3,745,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00745
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Let me start by highlighting the key amendment that we are making in this Bill, which is the introduction of GST on imported services, which was announced in the Budget this year. This measure will ensure that our GST regime remains fair and resilient in a digital economy, and will take effect from 1 January 2020.",4,746,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00746
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Currently, GST is applicable on services only in instances where the service is supplied in Singapore, essentially when the supplier has an establishment in Singapore. With the digital economy, it has become increasingly common for services to be supplied by overseas suppliers, without the need for the suppliers to establish a presence within Singapore. We welcome this development, as it allows businesses and consumers to have access to services from overseas suppliers readily.",5,747,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00747
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But at the same time, we must ensure that our tax rules are updated, such that both imported and local services are treated on a level playing field and accorded the same GST treatment. This means that GST ought to apply on local consumption of services, irrespective of whether the service is supplied in Singapore or from abroad.",6,748,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00748
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, GST on imported services will be introduced through a Reverse Charge mechanism for business-to-business (B2B) imported services, and an Overseas Vendor Registration regime for business-to-consumer (B2C) imported services. To ensure smooth implementation of the measures, MOF and IRAS have consulted extensively with businesses as well as industry associations. I will explain in greater detail how these measures work.",7,749,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00749
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Normally, GST-registered businesses will charge and collect GST on their supplies of services to customers, and then they will pay the GST collected to IRAS. But GST is not charged by overseas suppliers as they are not registered for GST in Singapore. So we have proposed a Reverse Charge mechanism where local business customers that are GST-registered and purchase services from overseas suppliers will instead be responsible for accounting and paying the GST to IRAS. That is why it is called Reverse Charge because instead of having the supplier account for and pay the GST as it is traditionally done, we are now asking the customer to do so. Examples of B2B imported services include management, IT and payroll services charged by overseas service providers to local business customers.",8,750,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00750
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I should clarify that that the vast majority of local businesses purchasing services from overseas suppliers will not be affected by Reverse Charge. This is because we will not apply Reverse Charge on businesses which can claim full refund of the GST they incur on their purchases, including imported services. So, such businesses need not pay the GST on imported services, only then to claim a full GST refund later. Essentially they are paying and then claiming in full, so really, there is no need to do so, and that is why we are not applying reverse charge on such businesses, and this will avoid unnecessary compliance burden for these businesses. Instead, businesses affected by Reverse Charge are primarily those that are not entitled to full GST refund in the first place, for instance, when they make GST-exempt supplies, and these affected businesses are mainly financial institutions and residential property developers.",9,751,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00751
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, earlier the Reverse Charge was for B2B. On the B2C front, overseas suppliers and electronic marketplace operators will be required to register for GST under our Overseas Vendor Registration, or OVR, regime, and they will have to register if they have a global annual turnover of $1 million or more, and make sales of digital services of at least $100,000 to local consumers, so it is a two-tier criteria. These GST-registered overseas vendors will then charge and collect GST on their sale of digital services to consumers in Singapore, and pay the GST they collect to IRAS. Examples of such B2C imported digital services are video and music streaming services, mobile applications and software.",10,752,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00752
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Reverse Charge and Overseas Vendor Registration are not new, and have already been adopted in several jurisdictions with Value-Added Tax (VAT) or GST regimes, such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Korea. These measures are also consistent with international guidelines for consumption taxes to address the tax challenges of the global economy.",11,753,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00753
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"For B2C services provided to consumers, the scope is targeted and, as mentioned earlier, covers only digital services like video and music streaming services, mobile applications and software. Such digital services form a small share of current consumption expenditure.",12,754,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00754
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Clauses 5-20, 22-29 and 35-41 of the Bill provide for the tax change that I just described, on introducing GST on imported services, with effect from 1 January 2020.",13,755,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00755
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"As mentioned earlier, MOF also regularly reviews and refines the GST regime, and the Bill provides for other changes to existing tax policies and administration. So, let me highlight the key changes.",14,756,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00756
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"First, similar to the amendments introduced in the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2018, which were passed in Parliament last month, we will enhance IRAS’ powers to investigate tax crimes for GST.",15,757,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00757
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Tax offenders and criminal syndicates are employing more sophisticated schemes to defraud the authorities, as I mentioned in my last speech when I passed the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill. And so, enhanced investigative powers are required to more effectively deal with serious tax offenders, as well as acts of obstruction which may hamper IRAS' investigations and prosecution.",16,758,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00758
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The proposed amendments will enhance IRAS' investigative powers, by providing authorised IRAS officers with the power of forced entry; the power to arrest without warrant; and the power to carry out body search; subject to conditions, and I should highlight that investigation officers of other tax authorities such as the UK and US have similar powers to facilitate their investigations.",17,759,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00759
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Similar to the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2018, we will put in place safeguards in the way these enhanced legislative powers are exercised. All these enhanced investigative powers may only be exercised by officers authorised by the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax. These authorised officers will receive training consistent with those in other law enforcement agencies, like the Singapore Customs and the Singapore Police Force.",18,760,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00760
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The amendments will also expand IRAS' power to gather from any person all information relevant to its investigations or the prosecution of offences under the GST Act. Currently, for GST purposes, IRAS may gather information relating to a person’s business transactions only. The amendment will allow IRAS to gather all information as long as it is relevant to the investigation or prosecution. For example, this could include information relating to a person’s income or assets, or information relating to accomplices.",19,761,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00761
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Clauses 3, 33 and 34 of the Bill provide for all of the changes to enhance IRAS’ powers to investigate tax crimes, which I have just described.",20,762,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00762
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The second broad change pertains to the proposed amendment of the GST Act to allow IRAS to share with law enforcement agencies (LEAs) information that may be relevant to the investigation or prosecution of serious crimes. Such crimes are prescribed in the First and Second Schedules to the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act. Likewise, this proposal was introduced in the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2018. And again, other countries, like Australia, Norway, Sweden and the UK, also allow for the disclosure of tax information to LEAs to combat non-tax crimes.",21,763,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00763
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),The information shared is to be disclosed by the Comptroller to the head of an LEA for the purpose of the investigation or prosecution of serious crimes. Unauthorised onward disclosure of such information constitutes an offence. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the changes.,22,764,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00764
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Lastly, we propose to amend the GST Act to strengthen prosecution and deterrence of unauthorised collection of GST. Currently, an offence is committed if a non-GST registered person issues an invoice or receipt with an amount purporting to be GST. Such an offence is currently punishable by a penalty and a fine.",23,765,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00765
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"To further protect consumers and strengthen deterrence against unauthorised collection of GST, the proposed amendment makes unauthorised collection of GST an offence, without reference to the issue of an invoice or a receipt for such collection. This in turn allows the use of alternative evidence, such as sales contracts or service agreements, in proving unauthorised GST collection.",24,766,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00766
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The amendment also introduces a heavier punishment, by way of a custodial sentence, in cases where the offence is committed without reasonable excuse or through negligence. The custodial sentence of not exceeding three years is aligned with existing penalties under the GST Act, which are similarly committed through negligence or without reasonable excuse.",25,767,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00767
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In addition, our proposed amendment will counter unauthorised GST collection by introducing a new offence where a GST-registered person, or a person authorised to collect GST, collects more GST than what is allowed under the GST Act, without reasonable excuse or through negligence. This ensures that GST-registered businesses exercise due responsibility when charging and collecting GST on their supplies made, and also deters the abuse of a company’s GST-registration status. Clauses 30 to 32 of the Bill provides for this change. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.",26,768,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00768

2018-11-19-T-013,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"In general, I am supportive of the amendments, which largely are to impose GST on imported services, and to facilitate and enhance the powers of the IRAS to combat tax evasion and crimes.

2018-11-19-T-013,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Three, what is the number of local entities selling products or services locally or overseas through digital means or e-commerce platforms, which are not GST-registered, but which are charging local GST on their customers?",7,776,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00776
2018-11-19-T-013,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Four, are these areas of concern for the Ministry, and, if so, how does the Ministry intend to address them? How will the Ministry address GST collection, even without evidence of invoices given to the customer, such as through online payments or transfers? Are the above examples of business transactions resulting in any loss of GST revenue?",8,777,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00777
2018-11-19-T-013,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Next, while this round of amendments does not involve differential GST rates, I would like to urge the Ministry to seriously consider imposing differential and higher GST rates, specifically for luxury items and certain other items that can have an impact on social behaviour.",9,778,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00778
2018-11-19-T-013,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"To elaborate, luxury items would include more expensive alcoholic beverages, such as wine that cost more than $1,000 a bottle, and also luxury cars that cost more than $160,000 each, for instance. Would the Ministry consider imposing higher GST rates for such luxury items, where the price tiers and corresponding GST rates can be decided through engaging Singaporeans in focused group discussions and eliciting their views?",10,779,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00779
2018-11-19-T-013,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Besides, we have already imposed differential tax rates for housing, for instance, where residences that cost less than $1 million are charged a 3% Buyer Stamp Duty, while those that cost more than $1 million are charged a 4% Buyer Stamp Duty. Hence, it has been done for housing and can we now extend such differential GST or tax rates to other luxury items, too, such as cars, for instance?",11,780,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00780
2018-11-19-T-013,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"In addition, there are other items, such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, which can have an impact on social behaviour and which can be imposed with differential GST rates. To elaborate, tobacco products, such as packed cigarettes, can be imposed with a GST rate of 10% at the minimum, while cigars, which are usually consumed by the more affluent, can have a higher GST rate of 12%-15%, for instance. Likewise, alcoholic beverages can be imposed with a GST rate of 10% at the minimum, and gradually increased depending on the alcohol content of the beverage.",12,781,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00781
2018-11-19-T-013,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Again, the price tiers and corresponding GST rates for these tobacco products and alcoholic beverages can be decided through engaging Singaporeans in focused group discussions and eliciting their views and suggestions. Tobacco products and alcoholic beverages are not daily necessities, and in order to nurture a healthier lifestyle and a more positive social behaviour, differential GST rates can be imposed so as to encourage individuals to choose alcoholic beverages of lower alcohol content, for instance, and eventually give up smoking because it would simply be too expensive a habit to have.",13,782,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00782
2018-11-19-T-013,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding the questions I have and the suggestions I have made for further amendments in future, I stand in support of the amendments in its current form.",14,783,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00783
2018-11-19-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I stand in support of the Bill. Over the recent years, Singapore's e-commerce industry has been growing steadily. According to some estimates, our e-commerce industry will generate over US$3.7 billion in revenue in 2018 alone, and the market is expected to grow to US$5.4 billion by the year 2025.",1,784,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00784
2018-11-19-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),GST is an important source of revenue for Singapore. The proposed extended coverage to ensure that GST is collected for services purchased overseas serves to ensure that our GST system remains fair and resilient in this digital economy.,2,785,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00785
2018-11-19-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Seventh Schedule of the Bill spells out the types of services that would incur GST. Subsection 2(a)(xi) extends the GST to any advertising service on any intangible media platform, where the Comptroller is satisfied that the advertisement is intended to be substantially promulgated in Singapore.",3,786,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00786
2018-11-19-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Unlike advertising on traditional media platforms, online advertising services offer advertisers the ability to target individuals with specifically tailored messages. Even if the advertiser intended for the advertisements to be substantially promulgated here, it might be hard to prove this if the authorities are only able to see a small subset of the advertisements.",4,787,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00787
2018-11-19-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Programmatic advertising is another key trend in the industry, whereby software is used to buy digital advertisements. For such advertisements, the one making the decision to show the advertisement to the individuals is an algorithm, rather than a person. I would like to better understand how the Ministry intends to investigate and enforce this.",5,788,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00788
2018-11-19-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"The Bill also proposes to tax operators of electronic marketplaces. How would the authority calculate the GST payable if an online marketplace sells a mix of services that both incur and are exempt from GST? If it is based on self-declaration, how would the authorities ensure against under-declaration? I would also like to ask if consultancy or advisory services offered through such online marketplaces would attract GST.",6,789,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00789
2018-11-19-T-013,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, while extending the GST to digital services is important to ensure the resilience of our tax system, but this is only half the equation. Does the Ministry have plans to extend the GST to goods purchased online? With e-commerce posing as a serious disruption to traditional retailers, perhaps the Ministry could consider ensuring a level playing field for local merchants who are required to incorporate GST, as compared to their online competitors who do not need to. Mr Deputy Speaker, with that, I support the Bill.",7,790,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00790
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Sir, the move to impose GST on imported digital services is a step in the right direction. However, it raises a number of important questions.",1,791,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00791
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Digital services are becoming an increasingly central part of our lives. We all use mobile apps multiple times a day. From games to health tracking, to stock market information services, we hardly even notice them anymore. For just mobile apps alone, the market is estimated to be US$77 billion globally in 2017 and poised to grow to US$200 billion in 2020. When you add up all the value of all the digital services, including software, entertainment, online learning and search engines, the total value is mind-boggling.",2,792,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00792
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"At one level, the imposition of GST on overseas providers is a simple matter of levelling the playing field. Currently, Singapore-based providers are at a disadvantage. This is because they have to charge GST while their overseas counterparts do not have to. This is an issue especially for consumers. They may decide to abandon local providers for foreign ones in pursuit of what they think to be a 7% ""discount"". For businesses, most businesses can claim back GST. However, many small businesses may not be registered and, hence, behave essentially like consumers.",3,793,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00793
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"So, the idea, while bold, is fundamentally sound. But the relatively novel nature raises a number of critical questions.",4,794,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00794
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"First, how do we ensure even and effective implementation of this regime?",5,795,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00795
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The threshold for Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) is $1 million of global revenues and $100,000 of Singapore revenues. The $1 million global revenue threshold is very low. The implication is that many small companies will be liable under our regime. In particular, I am concerned about small marketplaces. Marketplaces exist to match buyers and sellers. Their actual revenues may only be a small fraction of the turnover on their site. Will the Ministry review this threshold and adjust it if it is found to create problems? And, if not, will there be a mechanism to review it periodically, and adjust it when expedient?",6,796,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00796
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),The next question has to do with efficiency of the new tax. How much revenue does the Government expect to raise through this tax? We all know that spending on digital services is growing rapidly. But how much of that would fall under this regime and how much taxes would be generated for our national coffers?,7,797,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00797
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"More importantly, what is the cost of monitoring and enforcing compliance? The tax regime will be global. Do IRAS and the other relevant authorities have the capabilities and the capacity? Digital service startups are proliferating, with thousands appearing everday. There could be potentially millions of small GST payers all around the globe. Can IRAS cope?",8,798,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00798
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"How will we inform all the affected companies and marketplaces about their liabilities under our GST regime? How will we monitor that all relevant vendors are complying with this regime? And how will we enforce penalties for non-compliance, given that they have no presence in Singapore? Is there a risk that service providers may thumb their noses at Singapore and they basically say to IRAS ""catch me if you can""?",9,799,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00799
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"A global tax regime of this nature is likely to be complex. Will the revenue raised justify the expenditure on monitoring, collecting and enforcing the tax?",10,800,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00800
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),A related question is on providers abandoning Singapore. Would active enforcement result in some companies simply deciding not to serve Singapore-based consumers? Small and innovative overseas startups may not be willing to invest in the costs of compliance. They may simply decide not to serve a small market like Singapore. This could potentially deprive local companies and consumers of cutting-edge technology.,11,801,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00801
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Under the new rules, Overseas Vendors are required to obtain and maintain at least two pieces of non-conflicting evidence of customers' location  Payment Proxy, Residence Proxy and Access Proxy.",12,802,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00802
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"It is easy to imagine smaller companies saying, ""forget it, Singapore customers are just not worth this trouble"". The General Data Protection Regulation in the EU was seen as onerous. There were stories of businesses that simply turned away EU customers when GDPR was introduced. They felt that compliance was just too cumbersome. And that was for a market for 500 million people!",13,803,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00803
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"One possible consequence is that Singapore-based customers may resort to evasion tactics. They could use VPNs, online credit cards and overseas P O boxes in order to be able to access these services. This opens them to the risk of penalties. The regime states that non-GST registered customers should not provide incorrect or false information to the Overseas Vendors. According to IRAS, ""customer misrepresentation is a serious offence, and offenders may face heavy penalties"". What penalties are envisaged, and how will they be enforced? Unlike people bringing in undeclared goods, there will not be any physical evidence to rely on.",14,804,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00804
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The final question is a familiar one on the impact of such a tax on some consumers. If we are optimists, we could argue that this broadens the tax base. It makes our tax regime more progressive by generating revenue from overseas companies. This would free up additional resources for beneficial programmes. We can reduce other taxes that disproportionately burden lower-income groups that are already under stress.",15,805,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00805
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"However, there is a potential dark side to such a tax. There is increasing concern about a ""digital divide"". Lower income groups are going to be disadvantaged because they lack exposure to the digital world. Some digital services may also act as more affordable substitutes for physical services. For example, online learning and education and even online entertainment. The imposition of GST on such imported digital services could reduce their consumption. It could price children from lower income families out of digital experiences. And such experiences are critical to survive and to thrive in the world of Industry 4.0. Will the Government consider some form of digital GST rebates, particularly for ""virtuous"" digital services, such as online learning and online education?",16,806,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00806
2018-11-19-T-013,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In conclusion, the move to impose GST on imported services is a step in the right direction. As Singapore prepares itself for the new digital economy, I would like to applaud the Government for having the vision and the courage to undertake this bold initiative. I support the Bill.",17,807,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00807

2018-11-19-T-013,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Originally, exemption was given by many governments because of the difficulty of enforcement, as well as the desire to promote online commerce.

Now the pendulum has swung to the other side, which is that the major online commerce companies are threatening the survival of many brick-and-mortar businesses.",4,811,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00811
2018-11-19-T-013,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not suggesting that we ignore the advance of technology.

2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members of Parliament Dr Intan Mokhtar, Mr Melvin Yong, Mr Ong Teng Koon and Mr Henry Kwek for supporting the Bill and also their comments on the Bill. Let me address the questions raised by the Members in four different parts.",1,816,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00816
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First on the design of GST for imported services and how the measures can be effective. Both Mr Ong Teng Koon and Mr Melvin Yong raised questions on how such a regime – GST for imported services – can be effectively implemented. So, let me highlight a few salient aspects of the design of the proposed measure that will enable us to ensure effective implementation.",2,817,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00817
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, Singapore adopts, as Members are aware, a broad-based single rate GST regime with few exemptions. This provides a good foundation for businesses to comply with the new GST rules for imported services without much need to classify and ascertain the applicable GST treatment, as the same GST rate applies to most transactions.",3,818,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00818
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We build on this foundation by learning from the experience of other jurisdictions and consulting extensively with industry players on how rules may be formulated to impose minimal compliance burden. These include the Business Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD, the Singapore Retailers Association and the Association of Banks in Singapore. Here, I would like to thank all stakeholders for providing us with feedback. We will continue to engage businesses as we prepare for implementation from 1 January 2020.",4,819,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00819
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, where possible, we have ensured consistency in our rules with those of other jurisdictions. This eases complaince, promotes effectiveness and provides certainty for the industry. For example, the scope of digital services that is subject to GST as well as the definition of electronic marketplace operators under the Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) regime are generally aligned with that in other jurisdictions.",5,820,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00820
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Third, our rules ensure that we do not impose unnecessary GST liability on businesses. As I mentioned just now, under reverse charge for B2B imported services, we do away with the need for local businesses to account for GST on the services they import if they can already claim a full refund of GST incurred on their purchases. And we put in place a two-tier registration threshold for the OVR regime for B2C imported services, which is based on global annual turnover and sales to Singapore customers. The $1 million global turnover maintains parity with the GST registration threshold of local suppliers, while the $100,000 threshold on sales to Singapore ensures that we bring into the tax net overseas vendors with significant sales to consumers here.",6,821,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00821
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"These features enable us to focus our enforcement of GST for imported services on these overseas vendors. This is also in line with the concern highlighted by Mr Ong Teng Koon on enforcing the system vis a vis the millions of suppliers worldwide. By designing the system as we have, I think it does facilitate enforcement and implementation.",7,822,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00822
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Ong and Mr Melvin Yong also asked how we will enforce compliance for overseas vendors for B2C services. IRAS will make use of various information sources to identify and engage potential registrants as well as to verify the GST reporting by these businesses. Similar to domestic traders, business audits will be conducted by IRAS on a risk-based approach. We already do this for our regular GST regime. So, we will extend this for the OVR as well. IRAS can also use provisions in bilateral tax agreements to obtain information on overseas vendors from other tax jurisdictions. In the event of non-compliance, the existing penalty and enforcement regime under the GST Act will apply. IRAS will raise additional tax assessments, apply penalties and recover the outstanding tax payable directly or through the appointment of agents.",8,823,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00823
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We are not the first country to do this. So, we have learnt from the experiences of many other jurisdictions, including Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, which apply similar penalty regimes to non-resident registrants, as with domestic businesses.",9,824,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00824
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That said, as I highlighted earlier, many of these overseas businesses have experience meeting similar VAT/ GST obligations in other jurisdictions. Many of them are familiar because we are not the first country and they have experience meeting similar GST obligations in other jurisdictions. So, we do not anticipate significant compliance issues. Experience from other jurisdictions show that these multinational businesses are likely to comply to avoid reputational damage.",10,825,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00825
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On Dr Intan's queries, not all digital services consumed in Singapore, be it B2B or B2C, are supplied by GST registered businesses. So, there are non-GST registered suppliers for such services. We do not track the number of these services; they may be small companies or even individual entrepreneurs providing such services on various online platforms. We do not track their numbers. So, Dr Intan asked about such non-GST registered businesses and the concern whether they may charge GST on their sales. That is indeed a concern, and that is why we currently impose penalties and fines on all unauthorised GST collection offences under the GST Act.",11,826,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00826
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In this Bill, we have proposed heavier punishment, including custodial sentence and new offences to further strengthen prosecution and deterence of unauthorised collection of GST. This applies for both local and overseas suppliers.",12,827,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00827
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ultimately, GST is a self-assessed tax. This applies even in the existing GST regime. It is the responsibility of GST-registered businesses to apply the correct GST treatment on their transactions. On the Government's part, we will continue to engage the industry to keep the GST for imported services effective, easy to comply and certain. That way, we make the GST system a resilient one in generating tax revenue to fund public services.",13,828,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00828
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Ong asked how much revenue will we expect to collect from GST on imported services. We expect additional revenue of about $90 million per year. But I should also explain that it is not just about the delta in revenue collection because this move also seeks to defend our current revenue base from being eroded as more and more transactions move online. So, if we were not to do anything, potentially, the revenue base may get more and more eroded and we may be losing more revenue. So, we have to make this move now to defend our current revenue base from being eroded.",14,829,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00829
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Ong made the comment that overseas businesses may decide to stop their sales to Singapore as a result of the tax measure. It may be a concern for some, but I should highlight as I said earlier that, firstly, we are not the first country to impose GST on imported services; other jurisdictions have done so and this is in line with the global movement towards taxation of the digital economy. Secondly, for many businesses, Singapore's appeal to businesses is not premised solely on tax alone. Tax is important but there are many other fundamental attributes such as our high digital penetration, our sophisticated and tech-savvy consumers, our extensive connectivity as well as our robust IT and logistics infrastructure. So, overall, we are still in a very strong position to be a regional e-commerce hub.",15,830,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00830
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Melvin Yong raised queries relating to the taxation of online advertising services and also asked whether consultancy and advisory services will be subject to GST under the new regime. Briefly, the scope of tax under OVR is consistent with current GST rules and how they are applied to local suppliers.",16,831,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00831
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, for online advertising services, whether or not GST is applicable depends on the place of circulation of the advertisement. Under existing rules, media advertisement that is circulated substantially or wholly outside Singapore qualify for zero-rating. Likewise, if provided by overseas suppliers, such advertising services are not subject to GST. So, we are using the current GST rules and if it is zero-rated locally, then when supplied under OVR, it will not be subject to GST.",17,832,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00832
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"By the same logic, for advertisements placed on the Internet, we regard the viewer access is generally global. Such advertisements can qualify for zero-rating, and correspondingly will not be subject to GST under the OVR regime.",18,833,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00833
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For B2C consultancy or advisory services, they will be subject to GST if the services meet the definition of ""digital services"", that is, if the service is supplied over the internet or other electronic network with minimal or no human intervention.",19,834,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00834
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Melvin Yong asked whether there are plans to extend the GST measures to low-value imported goods. Most jurisdictions have in place an import relief threshold for imports of goods via air and post. Imported goods below this threshold will not be subject to GST, so as to facilitate clearance at the border, and to ease administrative costs. In Singapore, I am sure Members are aware, this threshold stands at $400. Below $400, there is no need for GST. Above that, you have to pay GST.",20,835,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00835
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The taxation of low-value goods is a relatively new tax development and we are monitoring international developments on this front. Australia is the first in the world to implement a Vendor Collection regime for overseas suppliers to collect GST on imported goods in July this year. Switzerland and New Zealand, and the EU have indicated plans to do so in 2019 and 2021 respectively. So, again, as we have done for imported services, we first look at what other jurisdictions have done, we study their experiences and then, we learn from these experiences to see what can be done in Singapore. That is what we are doing with regard to the GST measure for low-value imported goods.",21,836,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00836
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Ong Teng Koon shared his concern on a ""digital divide"". That is indeed something that all of us ought to be concerned about. There are several ways we are dealing with this. First, we have in place the permanent GST Voucher scheme that provides annual assistance to citizens. This offsets GST expenses for many Singaporeans, especially retiree and lower income households. We review the GSTV scheme regularly to ensure that there is adequate assistance for the lower income.",22,837,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00837
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, as Singapore becomes more connected, the Government will also do more to ensure digital inclusion and accessibility. There are already many programmes under IMDA which provide lower income households with subsidised broadband and devices and access to the Internet. In addition, the Silver Infocomm Initiative offers affordable IT classes to equip seniors with relevant basic digital skills. And of course, Singaporeans can use their SkillsFuture Credit to offset course fees, including digital courses offered by online platforms.",23,838,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00838
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, Dr Intan proposed introducing differential and higher GST rates on luxury items, as well as items like alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. I understand Dr Intan’s intent. This is not a new suggestion. We have debated this in the House everytime we have a Budget and when we talk about the GST regime. Basically, we agree fully with the objective of having an overall tax and transfer system that is progressive, one where we give more help to those who have less. I think all of us share fully that intent. But we have also seen the experience of other countries with a multi-tiered GST system which introduces immense complexities in trying to define what are regarded as basic essentials and what are to be treated as luxury goods.",24,839,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00839
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In some jurisdictions, attempts at classification have resulted in bizarre outcomes, endless disputes and loopholes that may very well be exploited and end up being counter productive.",25,840,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00840
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, Singapore’s adoption of a broad-based, single-rate GST regime, coupled with the permanent GST Voucher Scheme is a more equitable approach in creating a fair and progressive tax system. We have a broad-based single rate GST but we couple that with a permanent GST Voucher which provides targeted transfers and help at the lower income and retiree households. By doing so, we create a GST system that is progressive, that effectively has lower tax rates for the lower income while those with the highest means pay at the full rate. Besides luxury items, Dr Intan also proposed higher consumption tax rates for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. We are mindful of the negative externalities arising from the consumption of such products, as she has highlighted, and in fact, these are already taken into account by way of excise duties. And so, these duties are reviewed regularly and updated from time to time.",26,841,2018-11-19-T-013-S-00841
2018-11-19-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope I have addressed the question and comments raised by the Members.

They include  Were safety protocols followed by the crew of the Land Rover and the Bionix vehicle during this phase of the exercise? Were the vehicle commander, driver and crew of the Bionix aware of the Land Rover behind them and did they conduct their reversal safely? What was the physical state of exercise participants and did it have an effect on their attention to safety protocols? Was there any mechanical malfunction of vehicles or platforms? Did Safety Officers and Vehicle Commanders perform their responsibilities? The COI and Police investigations will fully examine these and other related questions into the death of CFC Liu. When all the facts have been gathered, my Minister will give Parliament a full account, as we have done previously in this House.",5,857,2018-11-19-T-015-S-00857
2018-11-19-T-015,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Following CFC Liu’s incident, a safety timeout was effected for both local and overseas training by the Army to review our safety systems and ensure that our servicemen can continue to train safely. This included a review of our training doctrines and safety processes, that Members of Parliament (MPs) asked about. Particular attention was paid to the safety management plans for high-risk activities such as live-firing and training which require the use of vehicles and military platforms. Vehicle operators and crew conducted a series of drills to refresh their training, and ensure that they were well-prepared to carry out their assigned tasks. Unit commanders reinforced the importance of safety in training to their soldiers and emphasised the responsibility of every commander and soldier in ensuring not just their own safety, but also of their buddies and those around them. The safety timeout was lifted on 8 November and training has resumed progressively.",6,858,2018-11-19-T-015-S-00858

The troops had been conducting safety rehearsals to refresh their drills before the exercise. During the exercise, the sea was choppy, and affected plans for the conduct of ship-to-shore operations, which was a key highlight of this year’s bilateral exercise with the Australian Defence Force. The safety of our soldiers is of utmost importance to the SAF. The unit adjusted their plans and transferred the forces from ship to shore by helicopter.

Over the past three years, the Army has been deploying more Regulars to supervise and conduct the training of our full-time National Servicemen. The Army is now reviewing the experience level and roles of supervising, conducting and safety officers to further strengthen training and safety outcomes. MINDEF and the SAF will also undertake further reviews to curtail human lapses and mitigate risks associated with training. The SAF is also convening an External Review Panel on Combat Vehicle Safety. This panel will comprise experts outside of the SAF, to have a thorough review of current policies and measures surrounding combat vehicle training safety.",9,861,2018-11-19-T-015-S-00861

In general, we consider individuals as Public Service Workers for the purpose of additional protection under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) if their jobs serve the general public, and not just patrons of a private business or establishment. For example, cleaners in public hospitals and security guards at bus interchanges would be considered as Public Service Workers.

2018-11-19-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The key consideration in the pricing of HDB flats is to keep public housing affordable. That is why new HDB flats are priced substantially below the prices of comparable resale flats.  In particular, the average monthly instalment to income ratio for first-timer families buying new flats in non-mature estates is less than a quarter of applicants’ monthly income. This means that homebuyers will require little or no cash outlay.",1,877,2018-11-19-T-019-S-00877

2018-11-19-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"All HDB buildings are designed to meet the prevailing Fire Code requirements. For HDB residential blocks, each residential unit is designed to be a fire compartment, to prevent the spread of fire to adjacent units. In addition, various measures have been put in place to ensure the fire safety of HDB flats. These include the provision of fire-rated entrance doors, fire-resistant walls and floors, and installing dry/wet rising mains and fire lifts, where required, to facilitate fire-fighting.",1,882,2018-11-19-T-020-S-00882
2018-11-19-T-020,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Under the Fire Code, manual fire alarm systems are not required for standalone residential blocks, be it HDB or private. The Fire Code requires each residential unit to be designed as a fire compartment, and so any outbreak of fire is limited to that affected unit. Hence there is generally no need for an entire block to evacuate in the event of a fire. However, for all buildings where residential uses are mixed with other uses, such as commercial, social-communal and car park use, fire alarm systems will be installed as and when required by the Fire Code.",2,883,2018-11-19-T-020-S-00883

2018-11-19-T-022,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Schools is a major national platform where Singaporeans from all walks of life get to mingle and build friendships. We do not set out to achieve an even distribution of students of different socio-economic backgrounds across schools. This is because it will mean a significant departure from current admission policy, which is based on various admission phases for primary one, and academic results, strengths or aptitudes for secondary school and beyond. Actively intervening to ensure an even spread of students across socio-economic backgrounds will change the bases for admission, quite fundamentally and I am not sure parents and students are ready for that.",1,896,2018-11-19-T-022-S-00896
2018-11-19-T-022,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Notwithstanding, we do not want our schools to become segregated, as it will reduce opportunity for social mixing and weaken Singapore's social fabric. Thus, we try to encourage as much mixing and mingling as possible. We adjusted primary and secondary school registration to ensure primary schools do not become closed circles. For Primary 1 registration, since 2014, 40 places are reserved in Phases 2B and 2C for children without prior connection to the primary school. For secondary schools, starting from the 2019 posting exercise, 20% of places for each course in every secondary school with an affiliated primary school will be reserved for students without affiliation.",2,897,2018-11-19-T-022-S-00897
2018-11-19-T-022,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We are also enhancing the opportunities for mixing and interaction amongst students from diverse backgrounds within and across schools. Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) enable students to work and engage with peers from other schools. We revised the formats of the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and National School Games to encourage combined school teams. For example, the SYF Celebrations 2018 saw the participation of 351 schools, of which 56 engaged in combined school performances. Another way is through outdoor learning. Since its implementation in 2017, the MOE-OBS Challenge Programme enabled about 17,000 Secondary Three students from different schools to come together in mixed school cohorts to experience the outdoors and overcome challenges together.",3,898,2018-11-19-T-022-S-00898

We will continue to provide timely interventions at all levels to students who require more help, such as levelling up programmes in literacy and numeracy skills, and additional after-school support through school-based Student Care Centres. Ultimately, our lower-SES students are not, and will not be worse-off in terms of learning and support provisions at any of our schools, and it remains MOE's duty and mission to ensure that every child is given a strong foundation to do well.",4,899,2018-11-19-T-022-S-00899

2018-11-19-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The development of Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) is one of the recommendations from the Committee on the Future Economy. The ITMs put in place a framework for partnership, bringing together industry stakeholders, including companies, trade associations and chambers (TACs), workers, unions, economic agencies and education institutions, to develop and implement a transformation plan for each of the 23 industries. The ITMs seek to sharpen the competitiveness of companies and industries here, and to enable our workers to deepen skills and increase productivity. In this way, companies and workers can continue to progress and enjoy the fruits of their efforts.",1,901,2018-11-19-T-023-S-00901

The leaders of companies and industries play the critical role of developing the strategies for their companies and industries, and of seeking partnerships, within Singapore and with global partners, to develop deep capabilities. To transform successfully, companies need industry-specific and holistic solutions that span different areas from technology adoption to manpower training. ITMs allow us to work with companies in a coherent way. For example, the Job Redesign Initiative under the Environmental Services ITM helps cleaning and waste management companies adopt automation and digital solutions to improve productivity, and to redesign jobs so that workers can benefit from these changes. The various initiatives reinforce one other – for instance, redesigning jobs and processes, as companies adopt new technologies.",2,902,2018-11-19-T-023-S-00902
2018-11-19-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"As at the end of FY 2017, the Government has committed $1.7 billion to support companies.

But so far, we are glad that companies appreciate the need to change, and many are already taking action to do so. At the economy-wide level, we are seeing good productivity growth – in 2017, we achieved productivity growth of 4.5%. While we cannot attribute all of these to the industry transformation efforts, it is a step in the right direction. More detailed analyses are being done to assess the effectiveness of various initiatives.",4,904,2018-11-19-T-023-S-00904
2018-11-19-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Clearly, as Mr Liang Eng Hwa alludes to, we need to scale up to ensure that even more companies can undertake the transformation effort. There are several initiatives that we are working on. One is to get industry stakeholders to work together to take charge of the transformation. While companies compete to differentiate themselves, they can also cooperate to solve common challenges, and share resources and facilities to achieve scale. Food manufacturers, for instance, can tap on the shared facilities available at the JTC Food Hub @ Senoko, launched in July this year. The Food Hub provides shared spaces, such as an integrated cold room and warehouse, as well as advanced food processing equipment, such as microwave-assisted thermal sterilisers. By sharing resources, each food manufacturer can lower his operating costs. They can also embark on research and development work together, which each alone will find too costly.",5,905,2018-11-19-T-023-S-00905
2018-11-19-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Another way to bring more companies on board is for the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and the various TACs to exercise leadership and bring companies together. For instance, the SBF is working closely with the various industry TACs to look into helping industries digitalise, through its Digitalisation Committee. The Committee has been working with Government agencies, such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA), to implement initiatives in key areas such as e-invoicing, e-commerce, and e-payments.",6,906,2018-11-19-T-023-S-00906
2018-11-19-T-023,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Another example of how we are scaling up to help more companies is in the Logistics sector. Four TACs – the Container Depot and Logistics Association (Singapore) (CDAS), SAAA@Singapore, Singapore Logistics Association (SLA), and Singapore Transport Association (STA) – came together to form the Logistics Alliance as part of the Logistics ITM. The Alliance launched a Transport Integrated Platform (TRIP), which integrated several existing systems into a single digital platform to enable easier tracking of container trucks. This has helped logistics companies to increase productivity and reduce the idling time of their trucks. I look forward to the TACs' continued good work in accelerating transformation.",7,907,2018-11-19-T-023-S-00907

2018-11-19-T-024,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Between July 2016 and December 2017, about 3,200 employees from 48 businesses contributed about 17,000 volunteering hours through BIPS projects. To encourage more businesses to come on board, we will continue to promote the scheme and simplify the claims process. For example, we will provide an option for businesses to claim tax deductions on wages based on a fixed man-hour rate. This will provide greater flexibility to businesses who may find it tedious to compute the pro-rated wages of employees who had volunteered.",2,911,2018-11-19-T-024-S-00911
2018-11-19-T-024,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Ms Anthea Ong asked if similar tax deductions could be given to individuals to encourage volunteerism.

2018-11-19-T-025,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Critically, the conflict has become a breeding ground for terrorist and extremist groups. More recently, the Islamic State has established a foothold in Yemen, which heightens the risks of radicalisation.",2,918,2018-11-19-T-025-S-00918
2018-11-19-T-025,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Alongside the threat of radicalisation, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen generated by the ongoing upheaval is also of serious concern for the international community.

2018-11-19-T-025,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Prolonged fighting will worsen the humanitarian situation and create more security vacuums for terror groups to exploit. Therefore, we strongly encourage the key players involved to work towards a ceasefire and return to the negotiating table to find a political solution. There can be no lasting and durable peace without political negotiations and compromise.",4,920,2018-11-19-T-025-S-00920

For example, the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation, in partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, organised a special fundraising effort at 71 mosques in July 2017 for the affected civilians in Yemen. Islamic Relief Singapore has an ongoing fundraising drive for Islamic Relief’s efforts to distribute food and provide emergency water. In 2016, the Arab Association Singapore partnered with the United Nations Development Programme on the initiative ""Yemen Our Home"", in order to support the rebuilding of infrastructure, skills training, and the empowerment of women in Yemen.

Sector agencies closely monitor industry developments and work with WSG to help companies reskill their workers to meet emerging needs. For example, with MAS's support, WSG and the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) developed the PCP for Consumer Banking to re-skill about 3,000 PMETs over the next two years. This will enable bank employees such as those in bank teller and operational roles to be redeployed to new functions such as digital marketing and relationship management, instead of being retrenched. For the Information and Communication Technology sector, WSG is working with HP Singapore and the Institute of Systems Science (ISS) to re-skill existing employees through the PCP for Data Analysts. This will enable employees, such as those in procurement and sourcing, to use data analytics to improve operations efficiency and stay relevant to their employers.

2018-11-19-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"If the loss is temporary, the validity is subject to the person's condition, and respective third parties' due diligence requirements based on their risk assessment. As such, the Ministry cannot standardise the validity period of medical reports stating temporary loss of mental capacity. HDB, insurance companies under the Life Insurance Association Singapore, and banks under the Association of Banks in Singapore would apply a 6-month validity period.",3,974,2018-11-19-T-035-S-00974
2018-11-19-T-036,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the employment rate for differently-abled persons in the last three years; (b) whether there are statistics on which groups of differently-abled persons are the most affected by unemployment and why; and (c) given the diversity of our society, whether matters affecting differently-abled groups are reported on and considered before a Bill is passed and, if not, whether there is a need for a governmental body to do so.",1,975,2018-11-19-T-036-S-00975
2018-11-19-T-036,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"It was estimated that more than 8,600 persons with disabilities were employed in the private and public sector in 2017. This was an increase of nearly 9% from the figure in 2015. The Ministry of Social and Family Development and the Department of Statistics will also be collecting more information on PWDs through the upcoming population census in 2020 which will provide further information and more accurate data on PWDs. Like many of us, the challenges faced by different persons with disabilities during their journey towards employment could be unique to their circumstances, as this is dependent on the individual’s readiness and their prospective employers’ expectation. To maximise the potential of persons with disabilities and empower them to participate fully in society, we are working closely with employers to help them build inclusive working environments and to redesign jobs for persons with disabilities. For example, the School-to-Work Transition programme aims to support SPED students who are assessed to be work-capable to transition from school to employment. It has helped 120 Special Education students thus far, and will be fully rolled out to Special Education schools by 2019.",1,976,2018-11-19-T-036-S-00976

2018-11-19-T-037,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The management of pigeon-related issues requires a multi-stakeholder approach. This includes government agencies such as AVA and NEA, Town Councils, and members of the public.",1,981,2018-11-19-T-037-S-00981
2018-11-19-T-037,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Restricting the availability of food is one of the most effective ways to reduce pigeon populations. AVA issues advisories to inform residents about the environmental health and hygiene issues caused by feeding pigeons, and also takes enforcement action against pigeon feeders. In tandem, NEA ensures good food waste management in food centres and coffee shops in HDB estates, and enforces against littering offences. Finally, Town Councils maintain the cleanliness of estates. Where appropriate, they also deploy localised bird-deterrent measures such as spikes or nets on the external facades of buildings, to discourage pigeons from roosting.",2,982,2018-11-19-T-037-S-00982
2018-11-19-T-037,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"AVA will continue to test other solutions to manage the pigeon population. For example, AVA has conducted trials at selected locations to study the efficacy of contraceptives to manage the pigeon population. These trials saw some success, but also revealed that the use of contraceptives should still be coupled with other measures such as enforcement and education to ensure a sustained reduction in the pigeon population. AVA will continue to trial the contraceptives at other suitable locations to further assess the effectiveness of this solution.",3,983,2018-11-19-T-037-S-00983
2018-11-19-T-038,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what criteria are used to guide Government funding support for start-ups; (b) how are the investments distributed across various sectors; and (c) how much is invested in deep-tech start-ups.,1,984,2018-11-19-T-038-S-00984

2018-11-19-T-038,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In the early stages, Startup SG Founder provides capital grant to first-time entrepreneurs with innovative business ideas, while Startup SG Tech provides grant support for Proof-of-Concept and Proof-of-Value commercialisation of innovative, proprietary technologies. At this point, the uniqueness of the idea or product will be the main consideration.",3,987,2018-11-19-T-038-S-00987
2018-11-19-T-038,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For startups that are more mature and ready to receive institutional investment, funding support is provided through Startup SG Equity which co-invests with independent third-party investors. The private investors help assess the startup's commercial viability and the strength of its business model and management team. These co-investments cover both general tech and deep tech startups, across a range of sectors and domains such as Advanced Manufacturing & Engineering (AME), Health & Biomedical Sciences (HBMS), Urban Solutions & Sustainability (USS), and Services & Digital Economy (SDE). Between 1 April 2017 and 31 October 2018, the government has co-invested in a total of 62 startups under the Startup SG Equity scheme. The Government’s funding of S$43.8 million for these 62 startups catalysed S$50.3 million of private sector monies from their appointed co-investment partners. Around half of these investments were deployed into deep tech startups, and the rest into general tech startups.",4,988,2018-11-19-T-038-S-00988
2018-11-19-T-038,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At Budget this year, the Government has also announced the NRF-Temasek IP Commercialisation Vehicle, which will co-invest in startups whose business models are underpinned by intellectual property generated from publicly funded research.

2018-11-19-T-038,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Growing a conducive environment for startups goes beyond funding support. Startups also need access to mentorship, talent, local and global networks, co-innovation platforms and infrastructure, in order to build their capabilities and grow. Hence, besides funding, the Government has put in place support to meet the non-financing needs of startups. Under Startup SG Infrastructure, startups have access to spaces that they need to grow, experiment and flourish. The strong network of startups, incubators and venture capitalists at LaunchPad@one-north generates opportunities for collaboration and accelerates the growth of startups. Under Startup SG Accelerator, the Government provides support to incubators and accelerators to take on the role of catalysing growth opportunities for high-potential startups through their programmes, mentorship and provision of resources. The Government also works closely with partners such as the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE), SGInnovate and our universities to support the growth of startups in Singapore.",6,990,2018-11-19-T-038-S-00990
2018-11-19-T-038,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Through these efforts, Singapore’s startup ecosystem is becoming more vibrant. Venture funding activity in Singapore has ramped up, from 80 deals worth US$136.4 million in 2012, to 174 deals worth US$1.37 billion in 2017. The Government will continue our efforts to make sure that we have an enabling, pro-enterprise environment for startups and that Singapore is the place of choice for startups in Asia.",7,991,2018-11-19-T-038-S-00991
2018-11-19-T-039,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry with regard to the trade tensions between China and the United States (a) what are the implications of a lower economic growth forecast for 2019 and what can be done to mitigate it; (b) whether Singapore's exports have decreased over the last few months; (c) which industries are the hardest hit and how can they cope with this difficult period; and (d) whether the plans laid out in the Industry Transformation Maps are affected and require calibration.,1,992,2018-11-19-T-039-S-00992
2018-11-19-T-039,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The impact of the trade tensions on the Singapore economy has been limited thus far. In the first three quarters of 2018, Singapore’s non-oil domestic exports (NODX) grew by 6.2 per cent on a year-on-year basis, with the third quarter of 2018 marking the eighth consecutive quarter of growth in NODX. Notwithstanding this, Singapore’s GDP growth is likely to moderate in 2019 on the back of an expected slowdown in growth in major advanced and regional economies such as the US, China and ASEAN-5 economies, in part due to the ongoing trade tensions.",1,993,2018-11-19-T-039-S-00993
2018-11-19-T-039,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The impact of the trade tensions on the Singapore economy will be felt most in externally-oriented sectors which are plugged into the US-China supply chains, such as the electronics and precision engineering clusters. However, there is potential for businesses to mitigate some of the impact by redirecting their exports of intermediate goods to other markets. In addition, there could be some offsetting effects when US and Chinese importers source more from the ASEAN region, including Singapore.",2,994,2018-11-19-T-039-S-00994
2018-11-19-T-039,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our economic agencies are working closely with businesses to identify any disruptions promptly, and facilitate link-ups with other suppliers and markets to restructure supply chains where necessary.

2018-11-19-T-039,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Government will continue to press on with efforts to help companies build the capabilities that they need to access new markets, on-board cutting-edge technologies, and create good jobs. The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) are dynamic plans that will be updated to respond to changes in the economic environment. The Future Economy Council, comprising tripartite representatives, monitors the progress of our ITMs, and ensures that they continue to be relevant to emerging trends.

2018-11-19-T-040,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Bus Services Reliability Framework (BSRF) which requires buses to adhere strictly to the time schedule has led to the behavior of buses captains deliberately slowing or stopping at bus stops when they are ahead of schedule to avoid incurring penalties; (b) whether the framework can be fine-tuned to improve commuters' experience and not unnecessarily prolonging the bus journeys; and (c) whether long-distance trunk services can be exempted from the BSRF.,1,997,2018-11-19-T-040-S-00997
2018-11-19-T-040,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"We have introduced the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) to improve the punctuality and reliability of bus services. Under the BSRF, bus captains adjust their travelling speeds to maintain consistent headways between buses, so as to minimise bus bunching and improve punctuality and reliability. While speeding up may benefit commuters on the bus, other commuters who arrive at the bus stops based on the scheduled timings will end up missing them and waiting much longer. Nevertheless, LTA works closely with the bus operators to periodically review the schedules, so as to better reflect traffic conditions.",1,998,2018-11-19-T-040-S-00998
2018-11-19-T-040,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Long-distance bus services are more exposed to potential delays due to traffic conditions as well as passenger boarding and alighting activities. Hence, it is even more important that these routes remain under the BSRF to ensure service reliability for commuters.",2,999,2018-11-19-T-040-S-00999
2018-11-19-T-040,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Moving forward, LTA will step up publicity efforts on the BSRF, so that the public can be made aware of the reasons for and benefits of the BSRF.",3,1000,2018-11-19-T-040-S-01000

2018-11-19-T-042,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for mental wellness, polytechnic students are older and may seek help differently from those in secondary schools. The polytechnics equip their students with basic knowledge of mental wellness through curricular and co-curricular programmes. Peer support programmes are also in place to equip student volunteers with active listening and other skills to identify distress signs in their peers. Para-counsellors, or academic staff who have undergone the necessary training, will provide the first-level of support to students. Students who require more help can turn to the professional counsellors in the polytechnics.",3,1006,2018-11-19-T-042-S-01006
2018-11-19-T-042,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The polytechnics also partner external agencies like the Community Health Assessment Team which provides online counselling service.

A Singaporean married couple may need to change home due to changing family needs, such as when they have more children or when their children are growing up. It is in this context that we have an ABSD concession for Singaporean married couples buying a second property.

2018-11-19-T-047,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The Managing Onsite Vehicular Safety (MOVeS) programme helps companies to develop effective traffic management plans and educates them on how to prevent work-related vehicular accidents.,1,1029,2018-11-19-T-047-S-01029
2018-11-19-T-047,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"MOVeS is a relatively new programme introduced in 2017. In 2017, the Ministry piloted the programme for 80 workplaces and increased it to 120 workplaces in 2018. There were more companies that could have benefited, but they declined to participate largely because they felt they already had in-house expertise in vehicular safety. These companies will nonetheless still be subject to MOM inspections. In the event of any accidents, they also remain accountable under the Workplace Safety and Health Act as employers or occupiers.",2,1030,2018-11-19-T-047-S-01030
2018-11-19-T-047,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To improve take-up, we will work with the WSH Council and trade associations (e.g. Singapore Contractors Association Limited, Singapore Logistics Association, and the Container Depot and Logistics Association Singapore) to promote the programme among their members and sub-contractors.",3,1031,2018-11-19-T-047-S-01031
2018-11-19-T-048,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry with the coming into force of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) on 30 December 2018 (a) what will be its near and long-term importance on Singapore's trade and GNP; (b) how can our companies take advantage of the CPTPP; and (c) how does it impact Enterprise Singapore's and Economic Development Board's strategies.,1,1032,2018-11-19-T-048-S-01032
2018-11-19-T-048,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To date, seven countries have ratified the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which will enter into force on 30 December 2018. The CPTPP will expand Singapore’s economic space and promote new sources of growth for trade and investment. Singapore’s total exports and GDP can each potentially increase by up to 0.2% as a result.",1,1033,2018-11-19-T-048-S-01033
2018-11-19-T-048,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The CPTPP will make it easier for our companies to do business in the region. It will boost trade and investment flows and integrate the region into a single manufacturing base and market, allowing Singapore companies to operate more seamlessly across the CPTPP countries. There are a number of opportunities for our businesses. First, Singapore-based goods producers will gain from the substantial elimination of tariffs and non-tariff barriers when exporting to the CPTPP markets. Second, service providers will enjoy preferential market access in a wide range of sectors such as professional services, telecommunications, transport, and energy. Third, investors will benefit from the removal of restrictions on foreign equity, as well as improvements in investment protection. Fourth, enterprises will be able to bid for more government procurement contracts in jurisdictions which were previously closed to foreign companies.",2,1034,2018-11-19-T-048-S-01034
2018-11-19-T-048,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Beyond these direct benefits, the CPTPP also establishes a common set of enforceable rules that address modern trade and investment issues. Specifically, setting rules and standards in new areas such as e-commerce and intellectual property would foster innovation and the creation of new industries. The Agreement also aims to promote inclusive trade, with specific provisions that support small and medium enterprises, including through capacity building activities.",3,1035,2018-11-19-T-048-S-01035
2018-11-19-T-048,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The CPTPP is aligned with the strategies of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, as well as our economic agencies including Enterprise Singapore and the Economic Development Board. The CPTPP provides a platform for Singapore companies to strengthen their export networks and access opportunities overseas, through tariff reductions and ensuring a level playing field across the Asia-Pacific markets. This reinforces our ongoing efforts to enhance Singapore’s connectivity and help our companies grow through internationalisation. With the CPTPP, we will be well-positioned to continue attracting companies from diverse and innovative industries to set up, grow and create new businesses from Singapore. MTI is working with ESG and EDB to increase awareness of the CPTPP and help companies fully utilise its benefits.",4,1036,2018-11-19-T-048-S-01036
2018-11-19-T-049,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon,asked the Minister for Transport whether there are plans to implement express trains in new MRT lines.,1,1037,2018-11-19-T-049-S-01037
2018-11-19-T-049,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Express services can reduce travel time for some commuters, but they will require a separate set of tracks and additional signalling systems. This will mean greater land take, pose operational complexities, and cost taxpayers and commuters significantly more. Sharing tracks for express and non-express services is technically possible, but non-express trains have to be held back at stations to allow express trains to pass. This will have significant adverse impact for commuters on the non-express services.",1,1038,2018-11-19-T-049-S-01038
2018-11-19-T-049,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Existing lines are designed to benefit the maximum number of people along their routes. Retrospectively implementing express services is not feasible. We will need to build parallel tracks very close to existing live tracks, which poses considerable operational risks.",2,1039,2018-11-19-T-049-S-01039
2018-11-19-T-049,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"For new rail lines which are being developed, we did study the feasibility of including express lines. Specifically, we assessed the option of an express service between Jurong East and Changi Airport for the Cross-Island Line (CRL). However, less than 5% of CRL users will see significant time savings of at least 15 minutes. Viewed against the much higher cost and land take needed to build two additional tunnels for the express service, we did not pursue the option.",3,1040,2018-11-19-T-049-S-01040
2018-11-19-T-050,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the trial on enhanced security screening at MRT stations (a) how will the Ministry minimise inconvenience and delays to commuters; and (b) how the preparedness of transport operators be further improved in the face of security threats.,1,1041,2018-11-19-T-050-S-01041
2018-11-19-T-050,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Security screening at MRT stations is not new to commuters. Since 2004, commuters have been subjected to random bag checks at all MRT stations. It is timely to review and update our security measures given that our public transport system has expanded significantly and remains a soft target for perpetrators who wish to do us harm. We are therefore trialling person screening using walk through metal detectors and X-ray machines. The six-month trial is necessary to allow LTA and PTOs to fine-tune the security operations, and develop the capability to step up our response against heightened security threats, when the situation warrants. During this period, commuters at selected stations will be subjected to the new search process.",1,1042,2018-11-19-T-050-S-01042
2018-11-19-T-050,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Security screening will lengthen travel time. This is the balance we have to strike between public safety and efficiency. As commuters become more familiar with the screening process, we expect additional time taken to be kept to a minimum. We have chosen to start the trial over the year-end holiday period so that affected commuters can be sensitised to it before the start of the new year. We are also mindful that there are various groups of commuters whom we need to pay special attention to, including students sitting for their GCE ‘A’ Level examinations, so that help can be rendered if necessary.",2,1043,2018-11-19-T-050-S-01043
2018-11-19-T-050,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Public Transport Security Committee (PTSC) constantly reviews security threats to our public transport network, and calibrates the security measures accordingly, leveraging technology where applicable. LTA and the PTOs conduct regular security and emergency exercises involving 100% checks to test our preparedness and response against security threats. This year, we conducted two exercises, one at Newton MRT station and the other at Holland Village MRT station. The third exercise will be carried out in December at Hougang MRT station. Such exercises are crucial to ensure the security preparedness of our PTOs and relevant agencies, and to help commuters familiarise with security protocols in the event of heightened security.",3,1044,2018-11-19-T-050-S-01044
2018-11-19-T-051,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the status of the Community Mental Health Master Plan launched in 2017; (b) with the need for upstream prevention to promote mental well being, whether research has been done on the effectiveness of mental health education in countries with mandatory mental health literacy programmes in schools; and (c) whether there is a plan to study the impact of mental health on skills, productivity and innovation.",1,1045,2018-11-19-T-051-S-01045
2018-11-19-T-051,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been working with healthcare institutions and professionals to implement the community mental health plan since its launch in 2017. One key emphasis is to make care in the community more accessible for persons with mental health conditions and dementia. As at June 2018, mental health and/or dementia services are available at 10 of our polyclinics. This will increase to 12 polyclinics (or half our polyclinics) by 2021. In addition, 155 General Practitioner (GP) partners have been trained to diagnose and support persons with mental health conditions. These GPs are in turn supported by 19 trained community intervention teams, that enhance care for persons with mental health conditions through allied health services such as counselling.",1,1046,2018-11-19-T-051-S-01046
2018-11-19-T-051,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) has also established a network of 34 community outreach teams, to reach out to persons with depression or dementia. These teams also carry out public education programmes to raise awareness on mental health and dementia conditions. To complement these outreach efforts, we have established six Dementia Friendly Communities (DFC) to create an inclusive and supportive environment for persons with dementia and their caregivers.",2,1047,2018-11-19-T-051-S-01047
2018-11-19-T-051,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I understand that internationally, mandatory mental health school programmes are still in the nascent stage.

For example, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) offers psycho-emotional programmes in schools to promote mental health literacy.",3,1048,2018-11-19-T-051-S-01048
2018-11-19-T-051,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On the impact of mental health conditions on different aspects of life, the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) conducted a study in 2016 to better understand the quality of life of persons with mental health conditions. Persons with mental health conditions surveyed expressed desires for improvement in their psychological well-being, level of independence and social relationships. In particular, a significant number were keen on employment. In the 2017 NCSS Study on Attitudes towards Persons with Mental Health Conditions in Singapore, negative attitudes from co-workers were found to be a major barrier to employing people recovering from mental health conditions. A follow-up study by NCSS found that implementing workplace adjustments, such as increasing work support and supervision, training of supervisors and managers, will facilitate the employment of persons with mental health conditions.",4,1049,2018-11-19-T-051-S-01049

2018-11-19-T-052,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for Health what is the extent of doctors over-servicing patients and what measures are in place to address this.,1,1051,2018-11-19-T-052-S-01051
2018-11-19-T-052,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"It is difficult to accurately assess the prevalence of over-servicing. As an indicator, between 2013 to 2017, complaints of unnecessary or inappropriate treatment lodged with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) averaged 19 each year.",1,1052,2018-11-19-T-052-S-01052
2018-11-19-T-052,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Several measures have been instituted to reduce over-servicing and encourage appropriate care. The Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) has developed a total of 39 guidances to-date on what constitute rational accepted clinical practice, and appropriate investigations and treatments. This include guidances on the appropriate usage of selected high cost medications, treatments and investigations such as indications for the use of PET-CT scans in managing cancer.",2,1053,2018-11-19-T-052-S-01053
2018-11-19-T-052,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The insurance industry has also started implementing measures to discourage over-servicing. Integrated Shield Plan (IP) insurers are developing or enhancing their pre-authorisation frameworks, where insurers would approve the medical treatment and estimated bill sizes prior to the actual procedures. This provides certainty to patients on what can be claimed under their insurance policy, while allowing insurers to assess the medical necessity of the treatment. IP insurers are also required to incorporate a co-payment of 5% or more into new IP riders from 8 March 2018. Co-payment in insurance is a key element that will encourage healthcare providers and policyholders to choose medically necessary and appropriate treatments for the patient's circumstances.",3,1054,2018-11-19-T-052-S-01054

If the resulting RA balance is less than the Full Retirement Sum (FRS), the shortfall may be made up by a transfer from his Ordinary Account (OA) to his RA. The member could choose to withdraw the amount above Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) if he has sufficient property charge or pledge. Should the member need to reserve monies in his OA to service mortgage repayments, a request can be made to the CPF Board to withhold the transfer to RA.",1,1058,2018-11-19-T-053-S-01058
2018-11-19-T-053,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The RA funds earn interest and will eventually be used to provide the member with a stream of income.

2018-11-19-T-053,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Members usually take into account their available OA and cash savings when deciding what HDB flat to purchase. With good planning, most members have sufficient funds to complete the HDB purchase. That said, CPF Board has exercised flexibility in exceptional cases. The Board takes into account member's retirement adequacy and outstanding loan amount in deciding whether an exception can be made. For example, the Board has, upon appeal, allowed CPF members to use their RA savings to pay for their housing, up to the amount that originated from their OA, even if this results in their RA savings dipping below the BRS.",3,1060,2018-11-19-T-053-S-01060

There is no single test to conclusively distinguish a contract of employment from a contract for services. The ability to decide on the hours of work is one of the factors considered. Other factors include whether the worker must use the equipment and tools provided, comply with prescribed procedures, follow a fixed schedule, and carry out the work without getting a replacement etc. Each case has to be evaluated holistically. Any SEP, including hawkers and private-hire car drivers, who thinks that he or she has been wrongly classified should approach MOM so that an appropriate determination can be made.",3,1086,2018-11-19-T-058-S-01086

The vast majority of them prefer self-employment over regular employment because of the increased range of work choices that it affords, greater flexibility and autonomy, as well as an alternative source of income. However, for SEPs who prefer to be an employee, the Ministry and our tripartite partners are working to improve their awareness of job matching schemes.

2018-11-19-T-065,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The decline in our TFR in recent years is in part due to a demographic shift. A relatively large cohort of young Singaporeans, many of whom are children of “baby boomers”, are just entering the peak childbearing ages of 25-39. Many of these “echo baby boomers” are not yet married or have not yet started having children. This is consistent with our survey results, which show that while the vast majority of young Singaporeans want to marry and have children, they often have other life goals as well. Some decide to delay marriage and parenthood, in order to fulfil other aspirations like establishing a career or travelling the world first.1 Whether or not they eventually marry or have children will have a significant impact on our TFR.",2,1123,2018-11-19-T-065-S-01123

This will ensure that car mechanics in Singapore continue to have relevant skills in light of changing technologies.",1,1141,2018-11-19-T-067-S-01141
2018-11-19-T-067,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"SMWA is also planning to enhance local EV diagnostic, repair and maintenance capabilities. This will be achieved through hosting German specialists to train local mechanics, and organising overseas attachment programmes for more advanced training. Workforce Singapore will be providing funding support for this initiative under the Capability Transfer Programme.",2,1142,2018-11-19-T-067-S-01142
2018-11-19-T-067,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology is nascent and mainstream adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is still some time away. In the meantime, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is conducting trials to better understand AV technology and determine the eventual concept of operations for deployment in Singapore. These trials will provide a sense of the scale and type of repair and maintenance services required to inform our longer-term manpower development plans.",3,1143,2018-11-19-T-067-S-01143
2018-11-19-T-068,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee,"asked the Minister for Transport in light of a recent recall of cars over a fault that can increase crash risks (a) whether LTA conducts extra checks on the reliability of vehicles selected for use on the roads, especially for taxis and private hire vehicles; and (b) beyond emission standards, what other checks are conducted on vehicles used for public transport at the point of registration and subsequent use on the roads.",1,1144,2018-11-19-T-068-S-01144

2018-11-19-T-068,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA also requires all in-use vehicles to be inspected regularly at LTA-authorised Inspection Centres to ensure that they are roadworthy. These inspections cover key vehicle components and systems, such as brakes, steering, tyres and exhaust systems. Besides these regular inspections, LTA and the Traffic Police also call up vehicles for ad-hoc inspections to evaluate their safety and roadworthiness. Vehicles which fail these inspections are not allowed to be used on our roads.",2,1146,2018-11-19-T-068-S-01146

It is an offence for motor dealers and importers to not comply with this requirement. LTA’s electronic Vehicle Recall System also allows vehicle owners to check if their vehicles are affected by the recall, as well as the progress of rectification works.",4,1148,2018-11-19-T-068-S-01148
2018-11-19-T-069,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,"asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA supervises the resurfacing of roads each time contractors have dug holes in the roads to install wires, cables and pipes and, if so, what is the reason for poor re-surfacing of the roads after the works are completed.",1,1149,2018-11-19-T-069-S-01149

However, LTA has observed through its regular audit checks and public feedback, cases where contractors did not carry out these reinstatement works in accordance to LTA’s requirements. In such instances, LTA will enforce against these contractors and require them to rectify their reinstatement works. These errant contractors will also be fined up to $500 per infringement and penalised with demerit points. Contractors who chalk up more than 200 demerit points a month will be suspended from carrying out any new works.

2018-11-19-T-071,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,We open new MRT stations when there is sufficient ridership to ensure that the stations will be well-used. This is to balance between improving connectivity and prudent use of taxpayers’ monies.,1,1155,2018-11-19-T-071-S-01155
2018-11-19-T-071,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"While there are some existing residential developments around the Hume station box, they fall short of the ridership threshold to justify the opening of Hume MRT station. However, the upcoming development of the first stage of the Rail Corridor will likely inject additional visitorship to the precinct. LTA is reviewing the ridership projection and business case for opening Hume station. We will announce our decision in due course.",2,1156,2018-11-19-T-071-S-01156

For deaths that result from military training or operations, the compensation amount is doubled that of WICA. On top of this, additional compensation may be granted if there are exceptional circumstances or when the serviceman had rendered service beyond the call of duty. Overall, the total compensation amounts disbursed for incidents arising from training and operations are generally two to four times that of amounts provided under the national compensation framework.",1,1161,2018-11-19-T-073-S-01161

An additional 12% of recent flat buyers used cash to service their loans and took up HPS voluntarily.  Effectively this means that around 92% of recent HDB flat buyers with outstanding loans are covered under the HPS policy, or have voluntarily taken up HPS.",1,1246,2018-11-19-T-087-S-01246

This improvement was made possible through HDB’s efforts to increase the supply of 2-room Flexi flats in non-mature estates, from 320 in 2012 to an average of about 4,000 per year from 2014.
