2018-03-05-T-003-S-00008,2018-03-05-T-003,8,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"There have been many PMEs approaching the Labour Movement for help via our various workplace advisory platforms with a variety of issues from unfair dismissals to breaches of provisions in the Employment Act (EA). However, PMEs with a monthly basic salary of more than $4,500 are not covered under the Act."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00009,2018-03-05-T-003,9,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00010,2018-03-05-T-003,10,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Since April 2017, we have the new Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) as well as the Tripartite Alliance for Disputes Management (TADM) to assist PMEs to a speedier resolution of their disputes. The Employment Claims Tribunal, which came into force on 1 April 2017, has already done away with a salary cap for salary-related claims by employees but the ECT is limited to salary-related claims both contractually and statutorily."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00012,2018-03-05-T-003,12,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The median gross monthly salaries of workers stand at $4,056 in 2016. For Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs), the gross monthly salaries for P-50, or at the 50th percentile, for residents stand at $5,910 as at June 2016."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00014,2018-03-05-T-003,14,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Our Labour Movement has also been challenged with difficult questions concerning various parts of the Employment Act the past few years as it also affects our unions and union members amidst a backdrop of higher number of layoffs in 2016; unfair dismissals; mergers; acquisitions; outsourcing; volatility; and interesting new vehicles involving the sale and transfer of companies/staff.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00015,2018-03-05-T-003,15,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00016,2018-03-05-T-003,16,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Based on cases our Labour Movement has encountered in the past few years, a changing workforce profile, upward movements of median wages as well as a stronger impetus to ensure our employment laws stay relevant, I hope to see three things. First, expansion of the scope of the EA to cover PMEs beyond the current $4,500 limit; second, extension of the Part IV protection to cover non-workman beyond the current $2,500 limit, and, third, enhancements to the existing dispute resolution framework."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00017,2018-03-05-T-003,17,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00018,2018-03-05-T-003,18,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"First, expansion. Despite the last round of EA amendments in April 2014, we have still been receiving feedback/queries from PMEs through various channels such as through our unions/union leaders; TADM; my Meet-the-People sessions; our U PME Centres; our NTUC LawWorks Legal Clinics as well as through my social media platforms such as LinkedIn and Facebook; from aggrieved PMEs whom we were unable to assist as they earned more than $4,500 per month."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00019,2018-03-05-T-003,19,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00020,2018-03-05-T-003,20,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Despite the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act in April 2015 to allow collective representation of PMEs by all unions, in some of our unionised companies, management have occasionally attempted to use this “$4,500 limit” in the EA as a proxy to suggest that the union cannot expand its scope of representation beyond those earning more than this sum. Fortunately, such cases are not aplenty."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00021,2018-03-05-T-003,21,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00022,2018-03-05-T-003,22,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"With rising median wages, including that of PMEs, and PMEs gradually forming the majority of the workforce, there is a need to review this $4,500 cap to ensure the EA serves the majority of the working population."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00023,2018-03-05-T-003,23,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00024,2018-03-05-T-003,24,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"While the intent of the cap is to strike a balance between the rights of employees and to allow companies to manage their labour obligations and costs, the changing profile of our workforce requires a regular review of the scope of coverage of the EA to ensure that these policy tensions are adequately balanced. In fact, whether there is a need to have this “PME versus Rank and File” dichotomy is something we need to review whether now or in the near future. I submit therefore we should remove this $4,500 salary cap completely so that all employees in Singapore can enjoy the basic protection under the Employment Act."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00025,2018-03-05-T-003,25,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00026,2018-03-05-T-003,26,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Second, extension. Part IV of the EA is important as it involves the “hours of work” and determines the scope of those who are entitled to overtime payments. The two current categories of workers entitled to overtime payments are  first, employees who are not a workman, but who is covered under the EA and earns a monthly basic salary of not more than $2,500 and, second, a workman earning a basic monthly salary of not more than $4,500."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00027,2018-03-05-T-003,27,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00028,2018-03-05-T-003,28,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"To keep pace with wage movements, I submit there is a need to review both the $2,500 and $4,500 limits accordingly and raise it to keep pace with rising median wages."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00029,2018-03-05-T-003,29,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00030,2018-03-05-T-003,30,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Moving ahead, I also see a need to address whether the dichotomy between ""workman"" and ""non-workman"" is still tenable and also whether it is also appropriate to consider extending the scope of Part IV to PMEs. This may well be needed as the dichotomy between ""Rank and File"" and ""PME"" workers becomes increasingly blurred but it will require a closer and deeper examination as it will have a significant impact to both workers and employers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00031,2018-03-05-T-003,31,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00032,2018-03-05-T-003,32,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Third, enhancement. As shared earlier, PMEs earning above $4,500 are not protected by provisions in the EA such as section 14 on wrongful/unfair dismissals. By the same token, the ECT does not have jurisdiction to hear wrongful/unfair dismissal cases under the EA. Currently, union members in unionised companies can file a case to the Manpower Minister for such unfair/wrongful dismissal cases. However, as we see more cases of workers, especially PMEs, facing such unfair/wrongful dismissals, it is also imperative that the Employment Claims Act be reviewed and the ECT’s jurisdiction be expanded to cover unfair/wrongful dismissal cases over and above the current salary related claims."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00033,2018-03-05-T-003,33,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00034,2018-03-05-T-003,34,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Another area for enhancement and greater clarity would be the very technical and highly moot provision of section 18A of the EA. In it, an employer has the right to transfer an employee to another employer if the organisation is being restructured. Section 18A allows for the transfer of employees to a new entity. I suggest we should consider amending section 18A to provide greater clarity. The other alternative would be to issue tripartite guidelines or an explicit articulation on what transfers or transactions fall within or outside of section 18A. This is one area that has constantly been tested, challenged and greater clarity would be a boon for union	Workforce Restructuring and Productivitys, employers and legal counsels. Mr Chairman, in Mandarin."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00035,2018-03-05-T-003,35,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  Many professionals, managers, executives or PMEs have approached us for help. They face a lot of work-related problems, including unfair dismissal and also disputes related to the Employment Act. However, as some of these workers' monthly salary is more than $4,500, we are therefore unable to assist them."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00036,2018-03-05-T-003,36,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"In the past few years, the median income has been on the rise and it applies to the PMEs as well. The proportion of PMEs in our workforce has also been increasing."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00037,2018-03-05-T-003,37,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"To meet the needs of the future workforce and the requirements of jobs and work place in the future, I suggest we amend the Employment Act in the following three areas."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00038,2018-03-05-T-003,38,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"First of all, I think we should remove the salary ceiling to cover all workers, including PMEs with monthly salary exceeding $4,500, so that they will all be protected under the Employment Act."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00039,2018-03-05-T-003,39,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"With the rise in median salary, the monthly salary cap of non-manual workers covered under Part 4 of the Employment Act should also increase."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00040,2018-03-05-T-003,40,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Thirdly, the current dispute mediation framework should also be enhanced, for example, to allow the Employment Claims Tribunal to handle unfair dismissal cases."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00041,2018-03-05-T-003,41,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"(In English)  In summary, these three areas are important areas for review to ensure the EA stays relevant and serve the needs of the future workforce, the future of work and the future of workplaces. However, we must bear in mind that the amendments should not compromise the need to preserve effective collective bargaining and bring more workers within the tripartite relationship. We look forward to work with our unions/union leaders and our tripartite partners closely in the process of review and look forward to positive changes to the labour laws in this direction to better protect workers in Singapore."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00042,2018-03-05-T-003,42,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00043,2018-03-05-T-003,43,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"Mr Chairman, currently, PMEs who earn a basic salary of $4,500 or more are not protected under the Employment Act. According to recent employment data, the median gross salary of resident employees is about $4,050 a month. This means that just under half of our resident employees would easily fall under the category of PMEs earning at least $4,500 a month. Yet, they are not protected under our Employment Act."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00044,2018-03-05-T-003,44,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"It is time that our Employment Act is reviewed to ensure more of our workers are protected under it, particularly when retrenchments or employment disputes arise. It would be good to increase the salary cap as there are more Singaporeans and resident employees who are now earning $4,500 a month and where we now also see more PMEs among Singaporeans. Better still, remove the salary cap altogether so that all Singaporean employees, PMEs or otherwise, are protected under the Employment Act."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00045,2018-03-05-T-003,45,Intan Azura Mokhtar,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00046,2018-03-05-T-003,46,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Mr Chairman, Sir, term contract workers make up 10% of our resident workforce. Last year, the Tripartite Standard on Employment of Term Contract Employees was launched. It is a good first step in ensuring better protection of contract workers. When I asked the Parliamentary Question on the compliance mechanisms for the Standard in October last year, Minister Josephine Teo said that in two months, 400 employers, accounting for more than 28,000, or 17%, of all resident term contract workers have adopted the Standard. Could the Minister give an update on how many contract workers are now covered under the Standard?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00047,2018-03-05-T-003,47,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"I have two points to make. First, on compliance. In her reply, Minister Teo said that the Standard relies on self-assessment by companies and engagements with employers based on complaints from employees. I would like to ask the Minister, in the past six months since the Standard was established, how many complaints have been received and what are the outcome of the engagements?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00048,2018-03-05-T-003,48,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,I understand the Ministry’s position to calibrate the compliance to give employers the incentive to adopt the Standard. But there is also the need for the Ministry to do occasional audits to make sure that the Standard is meaningful for contract workers. I believe many public agencies are hiring term contract workers and they should have adopted the Standard. I would like to suggest that the Ministry audit the agencies and survey the contract workers to find out whether the Standard is working and where are the gaps.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00049,2018-03-05-T-003,49,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Second, on the coverage of protection. Currently, the Standard covers pro-rated leave benefits, adequate training and the notice period for early termination or non-renewal. The notice period is the same as the notice period for retrenchment of permanent employees. But what is missing in the Standard for Term Contract Workers is the recommendation of retrenchment benefits. Without this recommendation in the Standard, term contracts remain a risk of being the route for employers to avoid the moral and regulatory pressure of retrenching employees responsibly and fairly."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00050,2018-03-05-T-003,50,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00051,2018-03-05-T-003,51,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"There are three groups of vulnerable employees I will cover in this cut  women, foreign domestic workers and people with disabilities."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00053,2018-03-05-T-003,53,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"First, women. In November 2017, The Straits Times interviewed a 28-year old female lawyer whose former boss repeatedly harassed her. After she rejected him again and again, her boss shifted her work away from legal work to menial tasks. And though she reported her situation to all the appropriate levels of power, she was met with cultural roadblocks  a female senior colleague who told her to stay silent; a founding partner of the firm who brushed it off as ""such things happen when you are a pretty girl""; and a Human Resources Department who advised her ""not to make a fuss""."

Scared for her future career prospects, she chose to inform the firm of her intentions to go to the police. The firm finally dealt with the matter by getting her to sign a non-disclosure agreement prohibiting her from reporting the matter to the police. In exchange, she received a year’s salary and had to leave the firm immediately. The article said nothing further about the boss so for all we know he is still out there harassing his employees."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00059,2018-03-05-T-003,59,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"What is troubling about this story to me is that if a relatively well-resourced and legally trained employee with the support of a well-resourced and legally trained parent felt that helpless in the situation, how much more difficult would it be for an employee with less power and resources to seek help?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00060,2018-03-05-T-003,60,Kuik Shiao-Yin,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00061,2018-03-05-T-003,61,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"Can the Ministry consider two ways of enhancing protection of women from workplace harassment? First, the Tripartite Advisory to Manage Workplace Harassment is useful but there is no awareness about who is actually meeting those guidelines. Can the Ministry consider having a public register that actually tracks which companies are adopting the measures suggested in the Advisory?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00062,2018-03-05-T-003,62,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"Second, because it is usually too complicated, expensive and ultimately pretty awkward to get a court order against a colleague or boss, most victims do not bother with getting a protection order. Some victims also rather not immediately escalate their situation to the police because they are uncertain about the impact on their personal safety and professional reputation."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00063,2018-03-05-T-003,63,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"Harassment victims could benefit from having a safe and trusted third party with institutional authority to help them deal with their situation. Currently, TAFEP is an educational body and the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TDM) and the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) deal with more straightforward claims like salary disputes."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00064,2018-03-05-T-003,64,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Can the Ministry consider empowering either TAFEP or the other two bodies to deal with workplace harassment grievances? Or have its hotline for reporting labour infringements be extended specifically to workplace harassment as well?
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00065,2018-03-05-T-003,65,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"On foreign domestic workers, according to a March 2017 Singapore Law Review article, the MOM’s ""Employer’s Guide"" is a good step. But some of the language used in there is still a bit ambiguous. Right now, words like ""should"" and ""must"" are used interchangeably in the guide. But ""should"" is an aspirational goal whereas ""must"" sounds like an indisputable requirement."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00066,2018-03-05-T-003,66,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"For instance, the guide uses ""should"" for ""your foreign domestic worker should not sleep near any dangerous equipment or structure that could potentially cause hurt or harm to her, and ""You and your foreign domestic worker should mutually agree on which day of the week she should take the rest day"". But uses ""must"" for  ""You must provide your worker with three meals a day"" and ""you must minimally provide your worker with a mattress, pillow and blanket"". But if we believe in workers' safety and workers' rights, then surely our domestic workers must sleep in safe quarters and must mutually agree on their rest days."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00067,2018-03-05-T-003,67,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"So, can the Ministry replace ""should"" with ""must"" in the guide wherever appropriate? This would help lessen public misunderstanding about what is MOM’s tolerance level for abuse that an employer can get away with."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00068,2018-03-05-T-003,68,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"Lastly, on people with disabilities, the Employment Act does not define what unfair dismissal is, leaving room for misunderstanding. People with disabilities have been dismissed without explanation by their employers. Can the Ministry amend the Employment Act to provide a clearer definition of what constitutes an ""unfair"" dismissal and set out legal remedies for unfair dismissals?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00069,2018-03-05-T-003,69,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"Since our workforce is rapidly ageing, acquired disabilities, such as mobility issues and sensory impairments, will become a growing challenge. Some employees also acquire a disability while working for a company."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00070,2018-03-05-T-003,70,Kuik Shiao-Yin,"Currently, there is no requirement for a company to accommodate the employee’s changed situation, such as redesigning a job or offering an alternative role. Can the Ministry require or assist employers to provide reasonable job accommodations for employees who acquire disabilities in the course of their employment so that they may continue in their current role, wherever this is possible or appropriate?"

Yet, many Singaporeans do not know about this good program. Would the Ministry consider working with organizations such as the People’s Association and the NTUC to promote and increase awareness of PCP?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00081,2018-03-05-T-003,81,Desmond Choo,"I am convinced that if the tripartite partners can work together, then the strong productivity growth last year will not be a one-off phenomenon."

I would like to ask the Minister for an update. Can the Minister share on MOM’s treatment of ""Triple Weak"" and ""Triple Strong"" companies? I would also like to know if these efforts have resulted in better outcomes for Singaporeans, in particular, for our PMETs."

For new and special technical fields which our local institutions have not yet produced in the right numbers, would MOM allow firms to recruit more overseas talents in the interim?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00091,2018-03-05-T-003,91,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Mr Chairman, can the Minister provide an update on MOM’s treatment of companies on the ""Triple Weak"" watchlist and of ""Triple Strong"" companies? Have the ""Triple Weak"" companies been able to improve the Singapore Core in their workforce? What improvements have been made in the HR practices of ""Triple Weak"" companies to build the strong Singapore Core? Have these resulted in Singaporean PMETs getting quality roles in organisations and seeing their incomes grow? Have we seen an increase of ""Triple Strong"" companies?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00092,2018-03-05-T-003,92,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"With the improving economic growth this year, are we seeing growth in PMET jobs? More importantly, have Singaporean PMETs been able to qualify for these jobs? What more can be done to raise the number and quality of PMET jobs for Singaporeans?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00093,2018-03-05-T-003,93,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"I am concerned if there continues to be missed match and mismatched of PMETs for the available jobs. Have the various SkillsFuture programmes, like the Career Support Programme (CSP) and Professional Conversion Programme (PCP), been able to address these gaps between jobs and the persons qualifying for these roles? Have businesses supported the PCP and CSP programmes? What progress has been made for local PMETs on these programmes? While there may be suitable job opportunities, are organisations with these PMET roles prepared to leverage on these programmes to work with PMETs to transition into these roles?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00094,2018-03-05-T-003,94,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"While we continue to focus on improving the quality of jobs for local PMETs, we must also recognise that with the pace of change and disruptions brought about with technological advancements, businesses do require new skills. In the short term, we may not have the skills and we are already hearing from businesses challenges in filling these roles. This would mean that we will need to continue to tap on foreign talent. Is there support available for businesses to strengthen the local-foreign manpower complementarity? With a third of our workforce comprising of foreigners, what is being done to raise the quality of foreign workers in Singapore?"

It has been an arduous but positive journey. We have seen the introduction of the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) and the National Jobs Bank in 2014."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00097,2018-03-05-T-003,97,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,There is also greater focus and awareness of the move towards not just fair but progressive workplaces and employment practices by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and our tripartite partners.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00098,2018-03-05-T-003,98,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Anecdotally, the situation has improved when I speak to fellow PMEs. However, I do still hear complaints of two kinds."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00099,2018-03-05-T-003,99,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"First, hiring-of-its-own-kind practices and companies advertising in the Jobs Bank for the sake of advertising and treating the FCF and the Jobs Bank as mere window dressing. This happens not just in big MNCs but also SMEs."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00100,2018-03-05-T-003,100,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Some also share that employment agencies and placement companies are also where some of these malpractices happen. The general concern is over the glaring disproportionate number of foreign PMEs in certain sectors and companies. In some cases, the nationality biasness results in job losses of local PMEs and hiring of foreign PMEs for jobs which local PMEs can fill."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00101,2018-03-05-T-003,101,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"In this regard, I wish to ask MOM to provide an update on how effective has the FCF been in the past three years since implementation in levelling the playing field for our local PMEs and in eradicating ""nationality bias"" discrimination in hiring practices, including by employment and placement agencies."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00102,2018-03-05-T-003,102,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I know the Minister has shared that he has nailed more than 300 companies into what he calls the ""watchlist"" where he sees the ""Triple Weak"". Has there been an improvement since the last time he shared about this ""watchlist"" and can he share what kinds of companies ‒ whether MNCs or SMEs ‒ and from what sectors these companies are from?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00103,2018-03-05-T-003,103,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,I have five concrete suggestions for MOM in respect of what we can do
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00104,2018-03-05-T-003,104,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Suggestion 1 – At present, you are exempted from the Jobs Bank advertising requirement in any of these cases"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00105,2018-03-05-T-003,105,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,1) Your company has 25 or fewer employees;
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00106,2018-03-05-T-003,106,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"2) The job position is paying a fixed monthly salary of $12,000 and above;"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00107,2018-03-05-T-003,107,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,3) The job is to be filled by an intra-corporate transferee (ICTs); and
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00108,2018-03-05-T-003,108,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"4) The job is necessary for short-term contingencies, that is, period of employment in Singapore for not more than one month."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00109,2018-03-05-T-003,109,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Can these areas be reviewed so that one is not easily exempted from the FCF requirements?
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00110,2018-03-05-T-003,110,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Suggestion 2 – Besides executive sanctions and measures, I suggest MOM can also recognise and offer ""carrots"" and recognition to those companies and businesses which demonstrate an exemplary Singaporean Core and a resolute commitment to hire and develop Singaporeans through the Human Capital Partnership programme (HCP)."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00111,2018-03-05-T-003,111,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Suggestion 3 – To encourage building a strong Singaporean Core, companies and organisations which outsource some of their services, such as IT, HR or Accounting and even construction projects, can, within the terms of the tender or contract, not buy from these ""Triple weak"" companies or purchase from companies or organisations which have been recognised by the Human Capital partnership mark. I suggest the public sector, including Government-linked corporations, take the lead and should not procure services or buy from any of these ""Triple Weak"" companies."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00112,2018-03-05-T-003,112,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Suggestion 4 – Over and above existing requirements under the law, there could be tighter regulation and accreditation of employment and placement agencies to weed out biased and unfair hiring-of-its-own-kind practices and ensuring a strong Singaporean Core. By the same token, these agencies, recruitment companies and even company HR departments should not and must not treat the advertising requirement as mere window dressing and their practices closely monitored. Their frontline and placement staff should undergo mandatory training and accreditation to understand the concept of building the Singaporean Core, FCF and the Jobs Bank."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00113,2018-03-05-T-003,113,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Finally, Suggestion 5 – A Tripartite Capability Development Toolkit can also be developed by TAFEP for companies to address capability gaps within their organisations and put best practices in place to achieve HCP outcomes, such as hiring and developing a Strong Singaporean Core."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00114,2018-03-05-T-003,114,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00115,2018-03-05-T-003,115,Chong Kee Hiong,"According to a World Bank report last year, Singapore ranked second in the world for ease of doing business. We want to remain highly attractive to companies around the world to draw their investments which will create jobs for Singaporeans."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00117,2018-03-05-T-003,117,Chong Kee Hiong,"Investors and businesses, whether global or local, want access to global talent. This is especially so in high-tech companies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and robotics, where talents are in short supply and, hence, courted worldwide. We should welcome them because they bring unique value to the local economy."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00118,2018-03-05-T-003,118,Chong Kee Hiong,"At the same time, we must ensure the transfer of expertise and technical know-how from these foreign employees to local employees within specific timeframes. Such transfers are critical if we are to build a strong Singaporean Core and boost local competencies. How to facilitate these transfers is the challenge. Monitoring and regulating the ratio and number of Singaporean staff at certain positions within companies after they have been occupied for a certain number of years by foreign staff is one way. Does the Ministry have a process of tracking such data across industries? Another way is to require companies, in particular, those in critical sectors, to justify and limit the ratio of foreign hires and limit how long they can work here."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00119,2018-03-05-T-003,119,Chong Kee Hiong,We have to strike a balance between meeting their demand for selected foreign employees to work in Singapore and providing Singaporeans with job opportunities.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00120,2018-03-05-T-003,120,Chong Kee Hiong,"The Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) seeks to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly for jobs. I would like to ask the Ministry for updates on the effectiveness of FCF enforcement measures and its compliance success rate. How many employers are currently on the FCF Watchlist and which are the main sectors or industries where infringements occur? Does the Ministry also have the breakdown of the job categories, levels of seniority and salary ranges of jobs which had gone to the foreigners in these cases? What are the main sources and channels of feedback, complaints and whistleblowing? How many Employment Pass applications by errant firms had been rejected by the Ministry in each of the last few years? Having such details will be useful for the Ministry to spot red flags, improve preventive measures and formulate better manpower policies to protect jobs for Singaporeans, as not all errant firms will be captured on the radar of the FCF."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00121,2018-03-05-T-003,121,Chong Kee Hiong,"Would the Ministry also share with us the effectiveness of our National Jobs Bank in helping Singaporeans find jobs? Does the Ministry have some way of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness and usefulness of this portal in ensuring that jobs are actually given to Singaporeans? If not, I would like to suggest that the Ministry consider doing so as soon as possible. Should it be ineffective, we will have to come up with new strategies and ways to connect employers with Singaporean hires."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00122,2018-03-05-T-003,122,Chong Kee Hiong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00123,2018-03-05-T-003,123,Lim Biow Chuan,"Last year, during the COS debate, MOM shared that there were 250 companies on the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) Watchlist. These are companies which have been identified as the Triple Weak companies and which do not adopt fair and progressive employment practices. The companies employ foreign workers at the expense of Singaporean workers and this has created much unhappiness among Singaporeans who have lost their jobs or are employed by companies with a majority of foreigners. Their employment practice has also created much resentment among Singaporeans against foreigners."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00124,2018-03-05-T-003,124,Lim Biow Chuan,"In October 2017, MOM shared that the number of such companies on the FCF Watchlist has gone up to 300 companies."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00125,2018-03-05-T-003,125,Lim Biow Chuan,This is clearly unsatisfactory as it suggests that these companies are not deterred by the punitive action by MOM and are also not bothered about creating more employment for Singaporeans.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00126,2018-03-05-T-003,126,Lim Biow Chuan,"Last month, during a house visit, my resident told me that her company has discriminatory practices in favour of foreigners because of the Managing Director's preference. Despite my request, she did not wish to reveal the name of the company as she was concerned about her own employment. And mind you, she works in HR. My concern is whether there are even more such Triple Weak companies which have discriminatory employment practices against Singaporeans and employ foreigners at the expense of Singapore citizens."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00127,2018-03-05-T-003,127,Lim Biow Chuan,May I ask MOM what other action can the Government take against companies which have been assessed to be Triple Weak companies and are on the FCF Watchlist? Can we consider revoking these companies' work passes or employment passes of the foreigners in their companies?
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00128,2018-03-05-T-003,128,Lim Biow Chuan,"We need to send a strong signal to such companies that if they are not interested in building a Singaporean core and intend to hire mainly foreigners, then they should face the consequences as there is no purpose in allowing such companies to thrive in our business environment because they exist at the expense of the Singaporean Core."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00129,2018-03-05-T-003,129,Lim Biow Chuan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00130,2018-03-05-T-003,130,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Sir, I am aware that the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP) was rolled out late last year. I wish to ask for an update and how successful has it been thus far and how does it benefit our local PMEs."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00131,2018-03-05-T-003,131,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00132,2018-03-05-T-003,132,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I have received feedback from the professional services industry, including the ICT and financial sectors, that the current subvention may not suffice and appear unattractive, considering the wage levels of experts in these sectors. Can MOM consider enhancing this cap on a case-by-case basis based on sector-specific needs?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00133,2018-03-05-T-003,133,Low Thia Khiang,"Chairman, Sir, I am glad to note that the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative is steaming ahead and that more programmes are coming online under the Initiative, such as the ASEAN Leadership Programme to help Singaporean executives understand ASEAN business cultures better."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00134,2018-03-05-T-003,134,Low Thia Khiang,It is important to ensure we cultivate a Singaporean core in leadership positions across the economy. The Capability Transfer Programme is another important initiative to be welcomed because it places Singaporeans at the heart of our economic transformation.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00135,2018-03-05-T-003,135,Low Thia Khiang,The CTP will help to deepen knowledge transfers to Singaporean workers and train up a strong body of highly-skilled and continuous learning local workforce.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00136,2018-03-05-T-003,136,Low Thia Khiang,"In this light, can the Minister elaborate on the outcomes expected from CTP grants and the metrics that would be used to measure the outcomes to make sure the money is well-spent? I am asking this because we have to be careful that CTP is not used to lighten the costs incurred by companies for routine training for their workers. There must be concrete capability development, and this should be measurable."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00137,2018-03-05-T-003,137,Low Thia Khiang,"I understand that CTP offers funding for industry-level projects, such as company-level projects. My concern with funding for company-level projects is that the capability transfer will be limited to benefiting a single company instead of the whole sector. This means that the Government would end up supporting an uncompetitive situation in a sector."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00138,2018-03-05-T-003,138,Low Thia Khiang,"For example, a large company dominating a sector could use CTP to acquire exclusive training for its staff, thereby enhancing its capability and competitive edge against other companies in the sector. Can the Minister give some examples of company-level projects funded by CTP and how the scenario I just described was avoided? How has the Ministry ensure the capability transferred to a company would benefit the sector as a whole?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00139,2018-03-05-T-003,139,Low Thia Khiang,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00140,2018-03-05-T-003,140,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Sir, on the topic of S Pass, I wish to submit that, despite raising the qualifying salaries for S pass to $2,200 and new quotas, I still hear two kinds of complaints."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00141,2018-03-05-T-003,141,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Firstly, the complaint of creative circumvention of this salary requirement by companies."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00142,2018-03-05-T-003,142,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Secondly, although S Pass is for selective strategic skillsets in specific industries, for example, like healthcare where they are welcomed and needed by fellow workers, there are cases where S Pass is issued to employers for workers doing mere administration or office tasks."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00143,2018-03-05-T-003,143,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Thirdly, the median wages of semi-skilled workers have also gone up in the past years. I wish to ask if there are any safeguards to make sure that Singaporeans are not replaced by many of these younger, better educated S Pass holders. Is the scheme too attractive and flexible such that it will be abused?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00144,2018-03-05-T-003,144,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Finally, should the scheme be reviewed, salary ceiling raised or the scheme be eventually done away with altogether?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00145,2018-03-05-T-003,145,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00146,2018-03-05-T-003,146,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,(
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00147,2018-03-05-T-003,147,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"Based on the trend of the Government's manpower policy, businesses need to bring in foreign workers with a higher level of technical proficiency. While they are working, they also need to receive continual training, particularly in an environment characterised by rapid technological advances and industry transformation. However, training requires expenses. As many enterprises are striving hard to transform, I hope the Government could support enterprises to manage these expenditures."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00148,2018-03-05-T-003,148,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"In his speech at the Budget debate, Mr Heng Chee How, Senior Minister of State cum NTUC's Deputy Secretary-General emphasized that as our enterprises transform and upgrade, apart from the local workers, our foreign workers should also not be neglected."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00149,2018-03-05-T-003,149,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"In fact, the Government need not worry too much on how to support skills upgrading of foreign workers. I would like to raise a suggestion  a portion of foreign worker levies collected could be channelled back to the business sector, to help enterprises in training of foreign workers. This suggestion is based on the example of how the Government plans to use carbon tax in this year's Budget. In the first five years of implementing the carbon tax, the government plans to use the tax revenue to provide more grants and support to help enterprises enhance energy efficiency and reduce emissions. In the same way, instead of channelling foreign worker levies into other areas, I would suggest that the government channels a portion of this levy towards training of foreign workers, to uplift the overall skills level of the workforce."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00150,2018-03-05-T-003,150,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"Further, the gig economy is rapidly emerging and has become a trend to be paid attention to. To date the number of self-employed persons has already reached 200,000. Self-employed persons do not have regular employers, but this is precisely why many employers do regard them as a welcome addition to the workforce during the current manpower shortage. This is because companies always have certain projects which need to be managed by people with special expertise or talents. If companies can find people with suitable criteria, and both parties agree to this flexible arrangement where the work is completed within a designated period, everyone would be perfectly happy. Often this is also a more cost-effective solution."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00151,2018-03-05-T-003,151,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"Not long ago, in order to protect the rights of self-employed persons, the government set up a Tripartite Workgroup on Self-employed Persons to identify recommendations. The Minister for Manpower has given his in-principle acceptance of these recommendations. We look forward to having these solutions rolled out as quickly as possible."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00152,2018-03-05-T-003,152,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"Helping to alleviate the worries of these self-employed persons, and building an even stronger and balanced employer-employee relationship, is certainly good news to the business community all round!"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00153,2018-03-05-T-003,153,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00154,2018-03-05-T-003,154,Chong Kee Hiong,"To build a workforce with a strong Singaporean Core, we need Singaporean workers distributed across different sectors and at all levels of seniority and skills. It is important that we have our own local staff with technical competence and core skills for key sectors."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00155,2018-03-05-T-003,155,Chong Kee Hiong,"Unfortunately, there are substantial labour shortages in certain sectors, such as in healthcare, and occupational jobs, such as skilled technicians. These shortages have resulted in dependency on foreign employees which, in turn, sometimes lead to communication difficulties due to cultural and language differences, or where even the hiring of foreigners is not enough to meet demand, we have to contend with long waiting times for repairs. It is clear that hiring foreign employees in certain sectors is not a sustainable solution to labour shortage."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00156,2018-03-05-T-003,156,Chong Kee Hiong,Would the Minister share the details of the local workforce shortages in various sectors? What measures do we have to boost the presence of local hires in these industries?
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00157,2018-03-05-T-003,157,Chong Kee Hiong,"Companies must also restructure these jobs to meet the expectations of new local hires, in terms of pay, number of hours worked and job perception. Companies should consider ways to differentiate themselves from their competition so that they can justify their higher fees and prices, in order to afford higher salaries to attract local employees. In addition, companies can improve work conditions by tapping upon technological innovations to make such jobs either easier or safer, or both."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00158,2018-03-05-T-003,158,Chong Kee Hiong,"The Lean Enterprise Development (LED) Scheme was launched in 2015 to grow a more manpower-lean workforce, help build a strong Singaporean Core and nurture a higher quality workforce. Would the Ministry share an update on the progress of this scheme?"

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00162,2018-03-05-T-003,162,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"The Lean Enterprise Development Scheme (LEDS) which was announced in 2015 is focused on helping businesses innovate and transform to become more manpower-lean and productive. So, with digital disruption, business models are being challenged. And to transform, businesses require a change of mindset and a re-imagination of their business. Can the Minister share how effective LEDS has been in helping companies transform and become more manpower-lean?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00163,2018-03-05-T-003,163,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"It has been reported that over 5,000 companies have tapped on LEDS to transform their business operations and improve productivity. Have these companies been able to restructure jobs to become more attractive for workers? Given our ageing population, have the business transformation efforts made work processes more conducive for matured workers?"

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00165,2018-03-05-T-003,165,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"I spoke in my Budget debate speech on the benefits of businesses tapping on mature workers. Matured workers are a source of business experience, but may have gaps in the new skills required for the jobs available. By making our workplaces more inclusive, businesses can benefit from the inter-generational diversity of their workforce. Given our tight labour market, especially for PMETs roles, it would a shame for us not to tap the potential of this talent base."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00167,2018-03-05-T-003,167,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Chairman, can I take both cuts together?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00168,2018-03-05-T-003,168,,"Yes, please."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00171,2018-03-05-T-003,171,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Moving ahead, I hope to see even better use of the jobseeker, hirer, jobs and skills data in the Jobs Bank to help minimise both the missed matches and mismatches."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00172,2018-03-05-T-003,172,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Second cut. As shared during my Budget debate speech, I am particularly concerned about the three challenges of long-term unemployment, structural unemployment and under-employment. It affects PMEs, mature PMEs, older PMEs and increasingly rank-and-file workers too."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00173,2018-03-05-T-003,173,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I wish to ask MOM what has been done in the past three years to address the above challenges and how effective have the schemes been? In particular, I have three suggestions for MOM to overcome some of these challenges."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00174,2018-03-05-T-003,174,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"First, eradicate ageism and all hints of it. Till today, I still hear anecdotally of age discrimination amongst employers. We have an imminent ageing workforce. Can we do more to get employers to be open in hiring and re-design their work and workplaces to cater to this group, instead of negating hiring them altogether?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00175,2018-03-05-T-003,175,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Second, expand support for employment facilitation and employment for both PMEs and rank-and-file workers. Our citizen unemployment has crept to about 3.3% in 2017. Can the various schemes including the Work Trial and Career Trial be further expanded to cover all groups of workers?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00176,2018-03-05-T-003,176,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The Labour Movement has carried out a detailed survey last year and the survey revealed that there are indeed mismatches of placement, skills and expectations, such as remuneration and job requirement. Of these, the mismatch of expectations between employer and worker is the most common occurrence. By the same token, the type of mismatches differed between different sectors, such as manufacturing sector and services sector. As the types of mismatches differ, the policy interventions must be customised to the needs of the sector."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00177,2018-03-05-T-003,177,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"In addition, the policies need to be dynamic to address the changing and evolving types of mismatches. It is therefore imperative to identify which form of mismatch a job-seeker is affected by and address it early lest it develops into another type of mismatch over time."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00180,2018-03-05-T-003,180,Low Thia Khiang,"Long-term unemployment rose to its highest in 14 years in 2016. In September 2016, three in 10 unemployed resident workers could not find employment after more than six months. The long-term resident unemployment rate rose to 0.8%. This meant that 17,600 workers were jobless for at least 25 weeks. The spike was mainly caused by older workers aged 50 and above and PMETs experiencing extended joblessness."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00181,2018-03-05-T-003,181,Low Thia Khiang,"In September 2017, according to MOM figures, the rate remained at 0.8%. Older workers and PMETs again had lower rates of finding employment within six months than the overall rate."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00182,2018-03-05-T-003,182,Low Thia Khiang,"Economists and the Government have explained the issue as caused by job-skills mismatches. New technologies and economic shifts have made many job functions and skills obsolete. Therefore, it is good that the Government implemented programmes, such as the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) and Place-and-Train (PnT) Programme in the last few years to help workers retrain and re-skill. Despite these programmes, long-term unemployment has remained sticky."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00183,2018-03-05-T-003,183,Low Thia Khiang,"PCP placed 3,300 PMETs in 2017, but only 10% were long-term unemployed workers. PnT placed 1,800 workers, but only 5% were long-term unemployed workers. Why are the programmes not helping enough long-term unemployed workers? What else can we do for the long-term unemployed workers?"

Many initiatives have been undertaken and enhanced, such as the enhanced Professional Conversion Programme, the Attach and Train scheme, and the enhanced Career Support Programme."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00186,2018-03-05-T-003,186,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"I would like to ask the Minister  how effective have MOM’s efforts been in helping locals, particularly mature PMETs and those who have been unemployed for long periods to take on new job opportunities? Will MOM similarly be doing more to help the rank-and-file workers?"

With new schemes such as the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP), it will be helpful to plug the gap in skills sets in certain important fields by supporting the transfer of skills from foreign specialists to fill the talent shortage, eventually to Singaporeans."

We should also identify the success rate of schemes like PCP and CSP in each and every ITM sector by focusing it on a sector by sector."

Conducting focus group discussion could be one way to better understand why certain schemes are less popular before we could tweak the programme for better acceptance. Some other improvements could include mentors to provide support and longer work trial period for better job assessment."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00194,2018-03-05-T-003,194,K Thanaletchimi,"For example, of the 223 Singaporeans from non-healthcare sectors who enrolled into the healthcare conversion programmes between 2009 and 2011, 82% completed their training and were successfully placed into a healthcare job. Among those successfully placed, 92% remained in their jobs after the end of the minimum service period. Can we define the minimum service period – the retention period – to be at least two years, so as to deem PCP as a successful placement?"

For the 8% who left their jobs after their bonds, what are their reasons? Were we able to keep them in the same industry? Or had they left to return to their previous industry? Would we be able to allow longer trial period for individuals to ascertain their job fit for some of the professions?"

Hopefully, this would provide a better return of investment for all parties that have put in efforts and resources to provide training opportunities and for those who had made the job switch. Similarly, we could also examine the causal factor for drop-out rates for ITM sector."

I believe PCPs and CSPs are good steps to build a better skilled and productive workforce. I support this move."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00203,2018-03-05-T-003,203,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Mr Chairman, based on the Tripartite Workgroup Report on self-employed persons (SEP), the share of SEPs is at 8% to 10% of our total resident workforce. Although this is not a large proportion of the workforce, in numbers of persons, this is not insignificant. In 2016, this made up 210,000."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00204,2018-03-05-T-003,204,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"The report had also indicated that the majority of SEPs – 80% of them – prefer self-employment over regular employment, primarily for the autonomy. Digital platforms are making it more attractive for SEPs as they enable direct connections of those who provide services to those who need the services. This enables a sharing economy and potential efficiencies."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00205,2018-03-05-T-003,205,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"The profile of SEPs reflect the changes in our wider workforce. A greater proportion are aged 50 and above. There is also an increase in the share of those with tertiary education and they are also earning more, especially PMET SEPs."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00206,2018-03-05-T-003,206,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"On the part of businesses, digitalisation is also disrupting the way work is done, employment models and how businesses collaborate. Technological advancement is allowing greater flexibility of how and where work is done."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00207,2018-03-05-T-003,207,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Work can now be shared across different persons and people do not need to be in the same time zones or same place to do work. We are already seeing this impacting many industries from healthcare, education, food and many other services."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00208,2018-03-05-T-003,208,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Businesses are not only directly employing their staff in regular employment but procuring relevant services of SEPs, as and when they are required. Hence, we will probably see an increasing trend of SEPs over time."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00209,2018-03-05-T-003,209,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Although SEPs have the potential to earn higher income, they do face irregular income streams, lack of a framework for training and development and do not have health and income protection to manage prolong or sudden illnesses. Can the Ministry share the responses to the Tripartite Workgroup (TWG)'s recommendations to address these challenges?"

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00212,2018-03-05-T-003,212,Ang Hin Kee,The Tripartite Workgroup (TWG) was formed by the Minister for Manpower in 2017 to identify the main challenges faced and to make recommendations. I thank the Minister for inviting me to join the workgroup. We have submitted our recommendations to the Ministry. I look forward to targeted assistance and specific support for our SEPs.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00213,2018-03-05-T-003,213,Ang Hin Kee,"In particular, I would like to draw our attention to a segment of SEPs. In the recent joint graduate employment survey of graduates from NUS, NTU and SMU, results state that more went into freelance work – 2.4% in 2017 compared to 1.7% in 2016. What is the Ministry’s assessment of this small, but growing number?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00214,2018-03-05-T-003,214,Ang Hin Kee,"In another survey conducted by the MOM in 2016, 83% of approximately 200,000 respondents cited freelance work as their preferred choice of employment. However, 17% did not engage in freelance work as a preferred choice. Again, I would like to ask  what is the Ministry's assessment of this segment? Did they fail in their efforts to seek permanent employment?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00215,2018-03-05-T-003,215,Ang Hin Kee,"For working adults who are currently freelancers not as their preferred choice, what are the types of assistance available to help them transit to full-time employment? For school leavers, are we able to strengthen our channels to guide our youths on the appropriate career choice to springboard their aspirations?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00216,2018-03-05-T-003,216,Ang Hin Kee,"I know we have Education and Career Guidance Counsellors (ECGs) in schools, Polytechnics or ITEs and career coaches at Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) and Workforce Singapore (WSG) career centres to provide career guidance. Are these counsellors and coaches familiar with the nature of freelance work? Can they give a fair assessment of the risks involved, compared with permanent employment? Are they equipped with enough information, so as to better guide and advise their clients?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00217,2018-03-05-T-003,217,Ang Hin Kee,"To this end, I would encourage they enhance the support by collaborating with freelance groups to invite experts to mentor, conduct talks to share insights and raise greater awareness on the nature of freelance work."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00218,2018-03-05-T-003,218,Ang Hin Kee,"Finally, I would also like to know how will MOM engage the various Government agencies, industry associations and freelance communities to implement the TWG recommendations."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00220,2018-03-05-T-003,220,Kok Heng Leun,"I work as a freelancer for almost eight years, between 2003 and 2011 in the Arts. Back then, my concern was whether I had enough jobs to ensure my financial survival in the short term. At times, I would be offered part-time work with employer CPF contributions, and that was a bonus, and I felt more secured. But, by and large, the security of benefits, such as CPF provisions was not something I thought much about."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00221,2018-03-05-T-003,221,Kok Heng Leun,"My experience then is similar to what freelancers face today, perhaps an exacerbated level in the gig economy. Because of their relative lack of experience, they can be easily exploited by hirers offering them less pay. To ensure they get a job despite their lack of a portfolio, new entrants resort to undercutting, thereby creating a vicious cycle of decreasing wages. They may take on more jobs than they can handle, endangering their own health and lives in some cases."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00222,2018-03-05-T-003,222,Kok Heng Leun,"In full-time employment, there are legal and contractual obligations enshrining a social compact between employer and employee – employer's CPF contributions, paid sick leave, workplace insurance and other welfare."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00223,2018-03-05-T-003,223,Kok Heng Leun,"But with a freelance engagement, the hirer do not bear such responsibilities. In fact, sometimes there is no agreement signed, no reimbursement for workplace injuries, no assurance of remuneration deadlines. These are purely transactional relationships, where the hirer stands to gain because there is willing labour. This freelance employment model will continue to thrive, because it is highly efficient. It is what the gig economy relies heavily on. As a first step, to ensure a fairer social compact, perhaps the Government can look at mandating hirers, probably starting from the Government agencies, to make contributions to CPF for the freelancers engaged."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00224,2018-03-05-T-003,224,Kok Heng Leun,"The more they come together, the stronger their negotiating power. It allows us to take care not only of ourselves, but of others like us. It goes beyond the transactional, because through a social compact, we see our interdependency, thereby growing stronger as a society."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00227,2018-03-05-T-003,227,Chen Show Mao,"The Ministry has indicated it accepts the tripartite working group's recommendation of a contribute-as-you-earn model for Medisave whereby contribution to the self-employed person's Medisave account of CPF is required as and when a service fee is earned. As the Ministry further studies its implementation, could the Government also look into more ways to encourage gig workers to make further voluntary contributions to their CPF by providing them with strong incentives to do so?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00228,2018-03-05-T-003,228,Chen Show Mao,"There is substantial evidence from public policy efforts that positive actions can be induced through non-compulsory incentive mechanisms. For instance, could a ""default"" be established where CPF deductions, beyond Medisave, initially match those of regular-economy workers with the same job profile, but being non-binding, would permit opting into a lower amount? Alternatively, could gig workers receive information in their CPF statements about typical contributions by regular-economy workers in comparable employment circumstances, to encourage them to follow the ""social norm""?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00229,2018-03-05-T-003,229,Chen Show Mao,"Self-employed persons typically face short-term cash flow needs, which may trump their longer term economic interest in saving for future retirement. Could the Government look into offering incentives for self-employed persons who voluntarily contribute to their Ordinary, Special or Retirement accounts, including favourable tax treatment when they do so?"

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00232,2018-03-05-T-003,232,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"There are various reasons that women may choose not to work or be employed. These reasons range from childcare or elderly care responsibilities to the decision to have a better work life balance and work from home on a flexi-work basis. To what extent does our labour force participation rate data capture the proportion of women who are home-based entrepreneurs or who are on flexi-work scheme? What are some plans that the Ministry have to help and encourage more women to work or be economically active? To what extent have employers implemented flexi-work or work from home schemes to help our women who may wish to have a better work life balance, and what more can we do, as a society and couples better manage their familial and economic responsibilities more equitably; thus reducing the burden of familial responsibilities that rest on more women and reducing the burden of economic responsibilities that rest more on men?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00233,2018-03-05-T-003,233,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"There are increasingly more women who are home-based entrepreneurs due to the work flexibility it provides. How can the Government better support our home-based women entreprenuers? What are some possible schemes or grants that can be made available to them such as ""micro-loons"" or ""seed"" funding, for instance? How else can the Government provide support for this network of home-based women entrepreneurs? Another concern that I have is that women are still not seen as a valuable source of manpower in the workplace."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00234,2018-03-05-T-003,234,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"Looking at the manpower statistics of 2017, more women are earning lower salaries compared to men. The only income brackets where there are more women employees than men of a job where the monthly salaries are less than $1,500. For jobs that pay a monthly salary of at least $1, 500 up to below $11,000, there are consistently more male employees than female employees in every income bracket. I just cannot accept that women are less capable such that they deserve lower salaries or cannot be employed in positions that pay more for which they are given more responsibilities."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00235,2018-03-05-T-003,235,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"I hope the Ministry will look into how employers employ the workers, particularly in ensuring that women are given equal opportunities, equal recognition and equal remuneration for jobs."

Mothers have experienced being treated harshly or assessed unfairly at work due to their pregnancy, and some have been dismissed subsequently upon their return from maternity leave."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00238,2018-03-05-T-003,238,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In the UK, it is unfair dismissal and maternity discrimination if an employer does not allow an employee to return to the same job after maternity leave. The ILO Convention on Maternity Protection sets the international standard in guaranteeing a woman's right to return to the same position or an equivalent position paid at the same rate at the end of her maternity leave."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00239,2018-03-05-T-003,239,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Can the Ministry enhance protections for mothers by giving employees the right to return to their job and prohibit any termination during an employee's pregnancy, maternity leave as well as three months after returning to work from her maternity leave?"

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00241,2018-03-05-T-003,241,Desmond Choo,There are increasing number of Singaporeans who have to take care of both younger children and older parents because of our marriage trends. They will need greater support at the workplace to balance work-life responsibilities. The recent launch of the Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements is a step in the right direction. I would like to ask the Minister how can we further spread and deepen the adoption of FWA.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00242,2018-03-05-T-003,242,Desmond Choo,"With the Tripartite Standard in place, there is an opportunity to accelerate adoption of FWA. Frequently, the inertia of established work processes and schedules causes employers to go beyond part-time work as a FWA option. I would encourage the Ministry to consider giving to our young parents with newly born children, the legislated right to request for flexible work arrangements in the first year of birth of their children. This would encourage employer to review existing structures. Our parents will also feel that they are less of an exception in working towards FWA with their employers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00243,2018-03-05-T-003,243,Desmond Choo,"Understandably, companies, especially the smaller ones might find it difficult to implement. The recent announcement on adjustment in work-life grant is particularly welcomed. Capabilities of the work-life consultants can also be enhanced to look into the process redesign and change management in companies which are really the key issues affecting FWA implementation."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00244,2018-03-05-T-003,244,Desmond Choo,"The other impact of balancing family needs is that our caregivers tend to drop out of the workforce. Our female residents, being the primary caregivers, have a lower workforce participation rate than their male counterparts. They are also the primary care-giver whether for children or their parents. The consequence is less retirement savings due to the drop in CPF contributions during the years that they may have left the workforce to care for their families. How can the Ministry review the CPF cash and retirement sum top-up schemes to help our Singaporean women to be secure in their retirement?"

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00246,2018-03-05-T-003,246,K Thanaletchimi,"Sir, the tripartite partners have recently introduced various Tripartite Standards (TS) for employers to adopt as good employment practices. While 5,219 unique companies have pledged on Fair Employment Practices, only 11.8% have adopted these standards to date."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00247,2018-03-05-T-003,247,K Thanaletchimi,"I urge the Ministry to adopt a more targeted approach in identifying the reason behind the low TS adoption rate. With the Government's role as a facilitator and enabler in the Industry Transformation Programme, can MOM tap on this engagement platform to better understand the concerns of companies? This also allows us to gather targeted feedback from the companies to improve the initiative."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00248,2018-03-05-T-003,248,K Thanaletchimi,"The TS can help address two issues that may arise in any company in today's society – grievance handling and flexible work arrangement. Employers need to have established grievance handling procedures to ensure that employee issues are duly addressed and resolved. MOM can work with training providers to implement online resource platform that allows management, HR and line managers to access the tools on handling employee grievances easily. MOM can also introduce examinable topics that line managers can take periodically to evaluate their standards as a TS adopter."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00249,2018-03-05-T-003,249,K Thanaletchimi,Another challenge is the need for Flexible Work Arrangement (FWA) in the workplace. Successful implementation of FWA can achieve win-win outcome for both employer and employee. MOM and TAFEP can conduct regular dialogue sessions for companies and employees to share how they have benefitted from adopting robust FWA practices. This will encourage more companies to adopt or review their existing FWA Practice.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00250,2018-03-05-T-003,250,K Thanaletchimi,"Currently, TAFEP focuses on incentivising companies to be TS adopters through positive publicity and added resources. I would like to urge the MOM to consider using TS as a set of qualifying criteria for companies to be eligible for various funding supports from MOM. These could include enterprise capability funds and employee support funds such as WordPro, Career Support Programme and Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) etc. This sends a clear message that the Ministry places strong emphasis on Fair Employment Practices."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00251,2018-03-05-T-003,251,K Thanaletchimi,"More should be done to raise public awareness on the TS so that our workforce recognizes the TS adoption watermark as quality-assurance of that company. The MOM can work with human capital partners, tertiary institutions, trade unions and grassroots organisations to spread the stringent qualifying criteria to be a TS Adopter, and to educate the public of its importance."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00252,2018-03-05-T-003,252,K Thanaletchimi,"In conclusion, I am optimistic that employers who adopt TS are also seen as fair and good employers that value every worker."

This is especially so if company policies are not explicit on what constitutes sexual harassment, and what standard of procedures are taken when reports are made."

The guidelines also do not illuminate on sexual harassment in detail. As seen in recent debates around the globe, it can be sometimes ambiguous to perpetrators on what constitutes sexual harassment."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00276,2018-03-05-T-003,276,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I would like to propose that MOM should issue definitive guidelines on workplace harassment. Such guidelines can include clearer definitions of sexual harassment as well as to take into account the concerns I have raised earlier.

Does the Ministry have the gender breakdown for this group that meets the Basic Retirement Sum? Are women as equally represented in this group as men? Is more being done to encourage top-ups and transfers?"

This means that we have a substantial number, most of whom are low-income earners, who will barely have enough for retirement. We have not even included the numbers of those who are not active CPF members. Does the Minister also have the projections for the amount needed each month for an individual in retirement in the next 10, 20 and 30 years? Based on these projections, the Basic Retirement Sum drawdown form what proportion of the total amount needed?"

Studies show that global life expectancy will increase, on average, by two and a half years every decade – or an increase of three months every year or six hours every day. Singapore’s life expectancy is increasing by three and a half years every decade. So, if you were born between the 1960s and 1980s like me, half of us can expect to live for over 90 years. For those born from 2000 onwards, 50% can live beyond 100 years."

I do acknowledge it will be difficult for the tripartite partners to reach a common consensus. Given the circumstances, perhaps MOM can help members to get better returns from the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS)."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00287,2018-03-05-T-003,287,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Chairman, Sir, I have argued in my Budget debate speech that Silver Support pay-outs to needy seniors based on HDB flat type may cause hardship for the seniors as well as send the wrong signals. Seniors who meet the criteria for Silver Support are already means-tested to be requiring cash support to meet their everyday needs. They are rigorously means-tested to have low lifetime wages, live in a HDB flat, not own large properties and have low household support. The HDB flat type is not part of the means-testing. However, seniors who live in larger flats get less payouts though they are just as needy as those who live in smaller flats."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00288,2018-03-05-T-003,288,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"This does not make sense. The seniors who qualify for Silver Support are already means-tested to be needy. The size of the flat that they happen to live in does not make them more or less needy. Many seniors often do not have a choice of which son or daughter to live with, or the size of the flat could be a legacy. Having pay-outs tiered according to flat types seem to signal two things to seniors and their families. One, it is better for a senior to stay with the child with a smaller flat or to live alone. Two, it is better for the family to downgrade to a smaller flat. These signals go against the thrust to get our seniors to age in place. Can the Minister explain the rationale behind the tiered pay-outs?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00289,2018-03-05-T-003,289,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"I also have several questions to address other specific concerns. What is the breakdown of beneficiaries of the Silver Support Scheme by gender? Since the pay-outs started, how many beneficiaries have lost their eligibility for Silver Support and what were the reasons?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00290,2018-03-05-T-003,290,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Minister had said that seniors who did not qualify for Silver Support could appeal for a review of eligibility. How many appeals have been received so far? Out of these, how many were approved? What were the main reasons when the appeals were not approved? On the appeal process, how can a senior make the appeal? What documents or documentation are required for the appeals?"

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00292,2018-03-05-T-003,292,Leon Perera,"Mr Chairman, Sir. When we discussed retirement adequacy, we speak of replacement rates – the ratio of retirement income to pre-retirement earnings."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00293,2018-03-05-T-003,293,Leon Perera,"Nowadays, many PMETs are finding themselves retrenched, being unemployed for stretches of time, and/or having to take pay cuts later in life. As a result, the replacement rate from just CPF LIFE pay-out may increase as a result of their income dropping later in life."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00294,2018-03-05-T-003,294,Leon Perera,"In the case of people who are in this at-risk group, who have already reached a CPF minimum sum, and who can show their income has dropped severely, can MOM consider allowing them on an appeal and for a limited time to contribute a smaller amount in employee CPF so as to free up more cash for their day-to-day needs? That would mean that their CPF does not grow quickly and would get less CPF LIFE pay-outs when they retire, but they will still get their CPF LIFE pay-out generated by the minimum sum. And if their working income has dropped drastically, than their smaller CPF LIFE pay-out in future would still achieve a reasonable replacement rate with less employee CPF paid for some years prior to retirement. I hope MOM will consider this."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00296,2018-03-05-T-003,296,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Chairman, Sir, the gender differentiated premiums for CPF Life compounds the effect of the gender income gap. This gap stands at 18% and has not changed in a decade. It suggests we have hit a structural limit to closing the gap by improving the educational attainment of women. To put it simply, this structural limit is that women’s participation in the workforce tends to follow the M-curve, leaving employment in their 30s and 40s to provide care-giving for children or aged parents."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00297,2018-03-05-T-003,297,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"In general terms, the current gender income gap means that women will have 18% less CPF savings than men when they enrol in CPF LIFE. With the gender differentiated premiums, women will get less income per month from CPF LIFE than men."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00298,2018-03-05-T-003,298,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,The argument for gender differentiated CPF LIFE pay-outs is that it is fair because women as a group live longer than men. The corollary is that a unisex CPF LIFE with the same pay-outs for men and women will make men “cross-subsidise” women for living longer. I do not know why men “cross-subsidising” women so that everyone can have reasonable retirement income until they pass on is so terrible a notion.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00299,2018-03-05-T-003,299,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Let us take a step back and consider this. Women are already disadvantaged by the gender income gap and the unpaid care-giving in the middle of the M-curve. Should not women be given the slight advantage at the end of their lives, just in terms of CPF LIFE pay-outs, for the sacrifices they willingly take up during the most productive phase of their lives?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00300,2018-03-05-T-003,300,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,The other argument for gender differentiated CPF LIFE pay-outs is that it is following the industry norm for annuities. But CPF LIFE is not a commercial product sold by a private insurer. It is a national pension programme that combines commercial standards and the social protection concerns of a progressive Government. The retirement inadequacy of women is a major social protection concern in our ageing society.

More than half of these older family caregivers do the work alone. Many of them are inclining health themselves, as 30% showing symptoms of clinical depression. Despite their frailty, they dedicate up to 60 hours a week in care-giving."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00303,2018-03-05-T-003,303,Kok Heng Leun,"In another MSF survey on informal caregiving, were shown that care-givers experienced substantial stress due to financial stress arising from care-giving. This was especially acute with younger care-givers because of their multiple commitments, this so called ""sandwiched"" care-givers have to work, tend to their children, and care for their elderly parents. If we aspire to be a caring society, then we cannot be negligence towards care-giver. The elderly folks taking care of their spouses, care-givers for the disabled, or the above mentioned ""sandwiched"" care-givers, they deserve our support and our utmost respect."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00304,2018-03-05-T-003,304,Kok Heng Leun,"To help them, one way is to provide tax rebate for families who have members who are care-givers. Another would be through direct allowances with CPF contributions provided to caregivers to defray the loss of incomes due to caregiving and ensure long-term security."

May I ask how far are we from the Ministry‘s target of the number of companies it wants to attract for this grant? What is the sectoral breakdown for the companies which had applied successfully? Does the Ministry have information on the penetration rate for different sectors and why some sectors attract more successful applications than others?

In the course of my community work, I have met a good number of seniors who have expressed interest in working and, yet, despite relevant experience, find themselves stonewalled after employers find out about their age. Sadly, they could only turn to menial jobs that are physically demanding. Is this ageism?"

The elderly tomorrow will be better educated and text savvy. If we do not combat ageism now and start changing how we structure work, everyone will soon lose out, especially as our population ages rapidly. To be clear, this is not to ask for special privilege. Assessment should be based on merit. But what if a senior candidate is denied the chance, not because of his innate ability, but because the work environment, process and job roles were designed against them?"

More importantly is how do we redesign the workplace and work for seniors?

In 2016, the Minister replied to my question on doing the same here that such declarations will not disqualify a candidate from being considered for the job. However, the reality is not so rosy.

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00372,2018-03-05-T-003,372,Zainal Sapari,"Sir, the Progressive Wage Models (PWM) in the cleaning, security and landscaping sectors have helped over 70,000 low-wage workers to become more productive through skills training and earn higher wages. The effects of the PWMs are not one-off. The cleaning and security PWMs were recently enhanced to provide these workers with year-on-year increments in wages."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00373,2018-03-05-T-003,373,Zainal Sapari,"These planned built-in increases in wages will partly address the problem of ""down-waging"" when their contracts are being renewed. It also helps the service providers to manage business cost better when they bid for contracts as the future manpower cost is more predictable."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00374,2018-03-05-T-003,374,Zainal Sapari,"Would MOM look at extending the PWM to more sectors, such as through industry-led or voluntary arrangements?"

Could we review the Employment Act to make it more pro-low wage workers? For example, could the pay for working on the rest day be standardised, regardless whether it is at the request of the employee or employer? Many employers now find ways to pay only the lower rates applicable for work done at employees’ request although it is really them who made the request. Could AWS be made mandatory? Could we explore the possibility for employers to pay the medication cost for outpatient treatment done at company-appointed clinics or Government polyclinics for non-chronic illnesses? My second cut."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00376,2018-03-05-T-003,376,Zainal Sapari,"I would like to raise the issue of rest areas provided by companies for their workers. In the low-wage sectors, such as construction, landscape and security, the workers often find themselves deployed at various sites throughout Singapore. At these places, companies may provide good, proper rest areas for their permanent employees. However, when it comes to the outsourced workers who slog at these sites, they often find that there are no proper rest areas provided to them. Neither are they allowed to share rest areas provided to the permanent employees. These workers also put in effort and hard work into their job duties, and the fruits of their labour often result in a better environment for everyone at the site."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00377,2018-03-05-T-003,377,Zainal Sapari,"These workers deserve the proper dignity of having proper rest areas so that they can carry out their work more productively.

There is currently no such provision. For now, companies must appoint a Risk Management Champion for BizSAFE Level 2. With structured training, we believe that the role of these RMCs can be expanded to serve as WSH representatives."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00384,2018-03-05-T-003,384,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"With more WSH-trained staff on the ground, one area that we can do better moving forward, is to encourage better near-miss reporting, to reduce the occurrence of accidents. A structured and well-participated near-miss reporting regime would help to better identify dangerous work conditions and early interventions can help bring down accident rate."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00385,2018-03-05-T-003,385,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"While it is important to have preventive measures to reduce workplace injuries, it is equally important to help workers return to work in the unfortunate event of an accident. At last year’s COS Debate, I highlighted the need for a support framework, beyond the existing Workplace Injury Compensation Act, to help our injured workers return to work. I am heartened that the tripartite partners launched the Return-To-Work Programme in November 2017."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00386,2018-03-05-T-003,386,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Can MOM provide an update on employers’ participation in near-miss reporting and the RTW Programme? Are there any plans to make participation in these two initiatives mandatory in the years ahead?
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00387,2018-03-05-T-003,387,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Also, the RTW grant is currently restricted to Small and Medium Enterprises, and does not cover cases involving vocational rehabilitation. To promote and deepen the RTW culture, can MOM consider extending the grant to non-SMEs, as well as to cover vocational rehabilitation?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00388,2018-03-05-T-003,388,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"While much of our WSH efforts today focus on workplace safety, physical health and mental well-being seem to have been neglected in our WSH efforts and conversations. With an ageing workforce, workplace health issues will likely become more prevalent in the coming years."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00389,2018-03-05-T-003,389,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Prolonged exposure to health hazards at work may result in work-related illnesses, some of which may even be irreversible. A build-up of stress and fatigue can also lead to distractions, raising the risk of getting injured at work. Occupational health management is, therefore, critical to ensure that our workers are healthy at work and can perform their roles effectively and productively. Beyond workplace safety, are there any upcoming plans by MOM on workplace health issues as part of Total WSH?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00390,2018-03-05-T-003,390,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Just as we have Total Defence, we must endeavour to have Total Workplace Safety and Health."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00391,2018-03-05-T-003,391,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00392,2018-03-05-T-003,392,K Thanaletchimi,"Sir, the basic rights of all working people to a safe and healthy work environment are imperative. Workplaces are generally regarded as safe physical environment by most. However, it is increasingly common for employees to be subjected to abuse or harassment. It can be physical, verbal and even via the Internet. Hence, there is a greater need for awareness and protection against all workplace abuse and harassment."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00393,2018-03-05-T-003,393,K Thanaletchimi,I advocate strongly for all organisations to adopt “Zero” tolerance towards abuse and take firm steps to stamp out errant behaviours. All employees must be informed on the reporting and response procedure for workplace abuse and harassment.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00394,2018-03-05-T-003,394,K Thanaletchimi,"Workplace harassment includes any conduct or behaviour that violates another person’s dignity or create an unfavourable work environment, thereby posing a risk to that person’s safety and health. More can be done to educate employees on how to respond to workplace abuse and harassment. Often, the psychological trauma is neglected, but the long-term effect to overall wellness is no less severe."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00395,2018-03-05-T-003,395,K Thanaletchimi,"For a start, an injury or harm as a result of workplace harassment must be treated with the same level of priority as an injury from a work-related accident. I urge the Minister to make the reporting of workplace abuse and harassment mandatory. It is important to understand the scale of the problem. Collating relevant statistics would allow for in-depth study to identify possible interventions effectively."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00396,2018-03-05-T-003,396,K Thanaletchimi,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00397,2018-03-05-T-003,397,K Thanaletchimi,"Under the POHA Act, even though a range of civil remedies and criminal sanctions is available to better protect people from harassment and related anti-social behaviour, it may not be sufficient to address individual concerns efficiently and cost effectively."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00398,2018-03-05-T-003,398,K Thanaletchimi,"Therefore, I propose to form a mediation body to address such cases efficiently and in a cost-effective manner. This will help to reduce the administrative and financial burden through court proceedings."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00399,2018-03-05-T-003,399,K Thanaletchimi,"It is, indeed, alarming that in recent months, there have been several incidents of online criticism of public service sector staff. I am very concerned about the growing trend of such a campaign as it will inevitably lead to cyber-flaming. Without the benefits of complete information, it is nearly impossible to determine the validity of the claim of either party. Affected employees will be subjected to greater distress and psychological trauma as a result, while the perpetrator gets away scot-free."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00400,2018-03-05-T-003,400,K Thanaletchimi,"The Act needs to be enhanced to address such threats and to protect employees from not just workplace abuse, but from the cyber realm as well. As we put in measures to deter potential physical abuse, we must also look at measures to protect the cyberspace from unfounded attacks. This would also involve public education and, more importantly, how to provide the relevant psychological support for affected staff at the work place."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00401,2018-03-05-T-003,401,,"Mr Kok Heng Leun, could you take your two cuts together?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00402,2018-03-05-T-003,402,,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00403,2018-03-05-T-003,403,Kok Heng Leun,"Over the last year, there have been reports of appalling cases of foreign labour abuse. From over-crowded, unsanitary dormitories, to workers served expired food, to workers forced to accept less than half their promised salaries."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00404,2018-03-05-T-003,404,Kok Heng Leun,"Yet, these are merely the cases that have come to light. In order to come to Singapore to work, many foreign workers have to raise significant sums of money to pay recruitment agencies, making them vulnerable to forced labour and debt bondage."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00405,2018-03-05-T-003,405,Kok Heng Leun,"Therefore even in cases when these workers are underpaid or not paid, or when they experience safety violations, they would rather stay silent, to avoid losing their jobs and, by extension, their ability to repay their debts. To target the root cause of these problems, I would like to ask the Ministry to look into helping these workers to reduce their recruitment costs."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00406,2018-03-05-T-003,406,Kok Heng Leun,"In last year's COS, I have spoken about recruitment approaches in Korea, in which the Ministry has said that they would look into. I would, therefore, like to ask for an update on this issue."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00407,2018-03-05-T-003,407,Kok Heng Leun,"Currently, based on our Fair Consideration Framework before the submission of any employment pass applications, employers are required to advertise the job vacancies on the online Jobs Bank so that there are measures to ensure Singaporeans are considered fairly for these openings. At the same time, the Jobs Bank provides an added benefit of transparency. Job-seekers from Singapore or overseas can access the same vacancies directly without any interference from middlemen or recruitment agencies. Could we, therefore, look into extending this approach to other foreign non-domestic work permit vacancies?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00408,2018-03-05-T-003,408,Kok Heng Leun,"This infrastructure that we already possess with the Jobs Bank can be applied here as a viable ready-made solution. By reducing the burden of recruitment costs, foreign workers will have improved mental health states, thereby increasing their productivity and overall work safety levels. Also, they will not shy away from reporting errant employers who flout workplace safety regulations or unjustly withholding pay."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00409,2018-03-05-T-003,409,Kok Heng Leun,"The second issue of concern I would like to bring up is the non-issuance of contracts to foreign workers. At the moment, foreign workers accept work in Singapore based on their in-principle approval (IPA) which lists their jobs, pay and deductions. Yet, upon arriving in Singapore, many either realise that they have been duped by forged IPAs or that their key employment terms (KET) issued within 14 days of starting work, are not aligned with the IPAs. In fact, this KET does not even need to be signed nor is it an actual employment contract."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00410,2018-03-05-T-003,410,Kok Heng Leun,"As a basic fair employment practice, MOM should mandate that a standardised contract be issued and signed by both parties and submitted to MOM before work permits can be issued. MOM's newly-announced Settling-in Programme for male construction workers could be an opportune time to educate the workers about KETs and employment contracts as well."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00411,2018-03-05-T-003,411,Kok Heng Leun,"We must ensure that our workers are accorded rights and protection against abuse. We should, therefore, do our best to ensure that our foreign workers, often tasked with hard, menial labours to build our roads and homes, are working under humane conditions and never exploited."

Through the work of NTUC's Migrant Workers Centre, we have identified salary-related disputes as one of the most common issues affecting migrant workers. To minimise such disputes, how is MOM encouraging our employers to use electronic payment for their migrant workers' salaries?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00414,2018-03-05-T-003,414,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Migrant workers here often worry about losing their jobs should they raise a complaint with the authorities. To encourage early reporting of salary-related cases, can MOM consider doing some degree of matching between companies submitting new Work Permit applications for fresh workers and migrant workers here who have requested for a change of employers?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00415,2018-03-05-T-003,415,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Today, there are various efforts by different organisations to orientate new migrant workers who arrive in Singapore. Such efforts can be disparate. Does MOM have any plans to synergise these various efforts to holistically orientate and integrate our migrant workers, particularly in their early days in Singapore? A one-stop help centre can also serve to be a valuable resource and avenue of support throughout their stay here while working."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00416,2018-03-05-T-003,416,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Many companies today still focus on quantity, instead of quality, when looking to hire migrant workers. Where possible, employers should leverage the experience of their current migrant workforce, and do more to upskill them. In line with Singapore's overall productivity effort, will MOM introduce new measures to encourage employers to bring in higher-skilled migrant workers? Does MOM have any plans in 2018 to further tighten the in-flow of migrant workers in terms of skills and competencies?"

The only documentation that payments have been made is salary vouchers. However, salary vouchers are easily forged and might not tally with the cash amount paid. When workers lodge complaints and salary vouchers are disputed, it is very difficult for MOM to ascertain where the truth lies."

Fast growth of foreign manpower will increase social tension and weaken our social cohesion. This is why we have to transform our economy to be more innovative, manpower-lean and productive."

Quality of local employment has improved, too. PMET share of the local workforce went up faster in the past three years than the previous three years."

So, grey means 2012 to 2014, and pink means 2015 to 2017. We can see that real income grew faster across all income groups, up from 2.3% to 3.7%. We can also see that wages at P20 and P30 not only grew faster than before but also higher than most income groups."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00444,2018-03-05-T-003,444,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, economic and workforce restructuring is never painless, but we have to do what is necessary. We are certainly in a better shape today. In the past three years, manpower growth has slowed from an average of 4% to 1%, while productivity gain has grown from 0.4% previously to 1.8% over the last three years on average, 1.8% per year over the last three years."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00445,2018-03-05-T-003,445,Lim Swee Say,"Having transformed from a high manpower growth, low productivity gain of 4 + 0.4 = 4.4, or 4% manpower growth and 0.4% productivity growth, to give us 4.4% GDP growth, from 2012-2014, we have transformed to 1 + 1.8 = 2.8 in the last three years. That is, 1% manpower growth and 1.8% growth in productivity, to give us the average of 2.8% growth on GDP. We are now much closer to our future growth strategy of 1 + 2 = 3."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00446,2018-03-05-T-003,446,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, 1 + 2 = 3 is not a rigid formula for future growth but it is a framework to remind us of the need to become more manpower-lean and more productive if we want to ensure that our future growth will be more sustainable."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00447,2018-03-05-T-003,447,Lim Swee Say,"Mr Desmond Choo asked if the productivity growth is sustainable. Sir, we have made good progress but transformation is uneven, not pervasive enough across all sectors. To make transformation and productivity growth more sustainable, we must press on with four key thrusts. And these are  better job growth in our economy; better employment outcomes for our people; better protection for our workers; and lastly, better capabilities in our Singapore Workforce."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00448,2018-03-05-T-003,448,Lim Swee Say,"First, better job growth in our economy. Average net job growth of less than 10,000 a year in past three years was not high enough. We need to bring it up to about 25,000 to 40,000 a year to provide enough jobs for a 3.4 million workforce growing at about 1%."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00449,2018-03-05-T-003,449,Lim Swee Say,"We must also keep improving the quality and attractiveness of jobs to meet the higher aspiration of our people. So, instead of developing Lean Enterprises individually, we need to develop Lean Industry collectively, especially for sectors that are less attractive to locals today. Minister Josephine Teo will elaborate on this."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00450,2018-03-05-T-003,450,Lim Swee Say,"Second, better employment outcomes for our people. Last year, under Adapt and Growth initiative, we helped more than 25,000 jobseekers to secure jobs successfully. Even though resident unemployment rate has declined since June last year, we are still concerned that unemployment in future is likely to be stickier, not due to shortage of jobs but shortage of skills and job-skill mismatch. I think the concern was also shared by Mr Low."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00451,2018-03-05-T-003,451,Lim Swee Say,We have enhanced the national Jobs Bank into an online job portal known as MyCareersFuture. We are also strengthening Adapt and Growth Initiative to minimise missed matches and mismatches. Minister Josephine Teo will elaborate later.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00452,2018-03-05-T-003,452,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, as we make our economy more innovative, we must also keep our workforce inclusive, young and old, high and low in terms of age and skill profile, and for both genders."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00453,2018-03-05-T-003,453,Lim Swee Say,"For our older workers, re-employment age was raised from 65 to 67 last year. Employment rates for mature workers, age 55 to 64 and 65 and over, has continued to improve."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00454,2018-03-05-T-003,454,Lim Swee Say,"We are also actively promoting more companies to make better use of technology to make jobs ESS, Easier Safer and Smarter, for our mature workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00455,2018-03-05-T-003,455,Lim Swee Say,"Mr Zainal Sapari and Dr Intan suggested raising their CPF contribution rates. Mr Heng Chee How suggested to review the need for statutory retirement, and to raise re-employment age further beyond 67."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00456,2018-03-05-T-003,456,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers was set up in 2005. The issues raised by Mr Heng, Mr Zainal Sapari and Dr Intan are important issues. The Tripartite Committee will study them."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00457,2018-03-05-T-003,457,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, for low-wage workers, I agree with Members that we must do more to improve their skills, productivity, careers and wages in a more sustainable manner. We introduced the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) for cleaning in 2014 followed by landscaping and security two years later in 2016. The outcome is positive."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00458,2018-03-05-T-003,458,Lim Swee Say,"A few days ago, I came across a Straits Times article by NUS' economists Kenneth Ler and Ivan Png titled ""Impact of Progressive Wage Model"", and I quote, ""In sum, as a unique kind of ""minimum wage"" policy, the PWM has succeeded in raising wages without apparently reducing employment. More importantly, as a tailored, structured and progressive policy, it provides a wage ladder for low-skilled Singaporean workers, holding out its promise of growing income over time."" Sir, we will make the adoption of PWM more widespread to benefit more workers. Minister of State Sam Tan will elaborate later."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00459,2018-03-05-T-003,459,Lim Swee Say,"Third, better protection for our workers. Our workforce is changing fast. We now have more PMETs, fewer Rank-and-File. This trend will continue."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00460,2018-03-05-T-003,460,Lim Swee Say,"Our employment landscape is changing too. With growth of the platform economy, we can expect to see more freelancers and Self-employed Persons (SEP). We are concerned for them in terms of skills upgrading, fair treatment, loss of income due to injury or illness and savings for healthcare and retirement. Minister Josephine Teo will elaborate on this later."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00461,2018-03-05-T-003,461,Lim Swee Say,"For the vast majority who will still engage in jobs with employer-employee relationship, Mr Patrick Tay and Dr Intan called for a review of the Employment Act (EA). I agree with them."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00462,2018-03-05-T-003,462,Lim Swee Say,"Currently, the Employment Act covers three group of employees. First, all workmen who are manual workers or blue collar workers, including most technicians; second, all non-workmen who are non-manual workers or white collar workers; and lastly, some but not all managers and executives with a salary cap of $4,500. With PMETs making up 56% of local workforce now, going up to 65% by around 2030, it is timely to make a more fundamental change to the coverage of EA."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00463,2018-03-05-T-003,463,Lim Swee Say,"In consultation with the tripartite partners, we have decided to enhance our current EA framework."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00464,2018-03-05-T-003,464,Lim Swee Say,"First, we will remove the salary cap of EA to cover all employees, including all PMETs. I am sure Mr Patrick Tay must be very happy to hear this because he has championing this for many years. The exceptions are public servants, domestic workers and seafarers who are covered separately, such as by other Acts due to their nature of work."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00465,2018-03-05-T-003,465,Lim Swee Say,"All core employee benefits in EA, including annual leave, paid public holidays, paid sick leave and paid hospitalisation leave and other protection, such as timely payment of salary, maternity protection and childcare leave, statutory protection against wrongful dismissal and the right to preserve existing terms and conditions for employment transfer resulting from sale of business and business restructuring, all these will now be extended to all employees. And this will cover an additional 430,000 PMEs."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00466,2018-03-05-T-003,466,Lim Swee Say,Mr Patrick Tay asked for more clarity on the types of transfers within or outside the scope of section 18A about sale of businesses and business restructuring. We agree that more clarity is useful. We will work with tripartite partners to update our guidelines on this.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00467,2018-03-05-T-003,467,Lim Swee Say,"Second, we will extend additional protection on hours of work and overtime payment to more workers. For workmen, the current salary cap of $4,500 already covers more than 99% of workmen. So, there will be no change. But for non-workmen, the current cap of $2,500 will be raised to $2,600 so that this enhancement will extend coverage to half of our workforce. As for overtime pay, the salary cap for non-workmen will be revised upwards, from $2,250 to $2,600. About 100,000 non-workmen will benefit from this increase."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00468,2018-03-05-T-003,468,Lim Swee Say,"The third and final change to the EA concerns dispute resolution relating to salary disputes or wrongful dismissal. Currently, all salary related disputes are mediated at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM). If unresolved, the claims are heard at the Employment of Claims Tribunals (ECT). But wrongful dismissals are adjudicated by MOM, not ECT. We will shift it over to ECT to provide both employers and employee with ""one-stop service"". We will seek Parliament's approval of these amendments to EA later this year for implementation by 1 April next year."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00469,2018-03-05-T-003,469,Lim Swee Say,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh spoke about protection for contract workers, tripartite partners launched the Tripartite Standard on the employment of term contract workers in July last year."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00470,2018-03-05-T-003,470,Lim Swee Say,"For contracts of 14 days or more, the Standard calls for companies to treat contracts renewed within one month from end of previous contract as continuous and cumulative in terms of length of service, for the computation of leave benefits and the notice period for early termination or non-renewal. It also calls for companies to provide training to ensure that their contract workers can perform their roles effectively."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00471,2018-03-05-T-003,471,Lim Swee Say,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked for an update.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00472,2018-03-05-T-003,472,Lim Swee Say,"As of end February, more than 550 employers, covering more than 30,000 term-contract employees have adopted this Standard. So far, we have not received any complaint from any of these contract employers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00473,2018-03-05-T-003,473,Lim Swee Say,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh also suggested that we should conduct audits and surveys, and to include retrenchment benefits in the Standard."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00474,2018-03-05-T-003,474,Lim Swee Say,"Being a new Standard, the focus now of the tripartite partners is to increase the adoption by more employers. So, we will look into the suggestions by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh when we next review the Standard."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00475,2018-03-05-T-003,475,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, another important area of protection for our workers is their safety and health. Through joint efforts of tripartite partners, our Workplace Safety Health (WSH) performance has improved. Fatality rate has dropped to 1.2 last year, the lowest level ever recorded for our workforce. Our next target, under WSH 2028 to be formulated is to bring it down further to below one per 100,000 workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00476,2018-03-05-T-003,476,Lim Swee Say,We are also committed to reduce workplace injuries as well as to enhance workplace health by embracing a mindset of Total Workplace Health and Safety. Minister of State Sam Tan will elaborate later.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00477,2018-03-05-T-003,477,Lim Swee Say,"Last but not least, our fourth and probably one of the most critical challenges is to ensure that slower growth of our Singapore Workforce will not become the bottleneck in the future growth of our Singapore Economy. Today, Singapore Workforce of 3.4 million is made up of 2.3 million locals, two-thirds of the total workforce; and 1.1 million foreigners, one-third of our total workforce. So, ""two-thirds"" local plus ""one-third"" foreign give us ""one"" Singapore Workforce."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00478,2018-03-05-T-003,478,Lim Swee Say,"With slower manpower growth into the future, we need to maximise the potential of our two-thirds local and our one-third foreign so that together, we can maximise the potential of our Total Singapore Workforce. We must strive for two-thirds plus one-third, is not just equal to one, but greater than one."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00479,2018-03-05-T-003,479,Lim Swee Say,"First, we must not allow two-thirds plus one-third to be less than one, and this could happen if unfair employers discriminate against our local workers. To prevent this from happening, we are pro-business but only to those businesses who are pro-worker."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00480,2018-03-05-T-003,480,Lim Swee Say,"We have identified 500 companies so far. They have the pre-conceived ideas that our local PMETs are either unable or unwilling to do the job. So, they write them off without even considering them fairly. We therefore put them on our Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) Watchlist. Their Employment Pass (EP) applications are subjected to additional scrutiny. This is to eradicate ""nationality bias"" as described by Mr Patrick Tay."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00481,2018-03-05-T-003,481,Lim Swee Say,"In response to Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Chong Kee Hiong, these companies on our Watchlist come from various sectors, including employment agencies and placement companies."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00482,2018-03-05-T-003,482,Lim Swee Say,"Mr Patrick Tay, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Chong Kee Hiong, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Assoc Prof Faishal Ibrahim asked for an update."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00483,2018-03-05-T-003,483,Lim Swee Say,"Since we started in February 2016, a total of 1,900 EP applications have been withheld or rejected by MOM or withdrawn by the companies. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) worked with them to improve their HR practices. Workforce Singapore (WSG) NTUC-e2i and IHLs worked with them to recruit fresh graduates and our mid-career local PMETs. As a result, more than 2,200 Singaporean PMETs were hired by these companies."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00484,2018-03-05-T-003,484,Lim Swee Say,"One of these companies is an IT services firm with more than 1,000 PMET employees. It was placed on Watchlist in February 2016. The company worked with TAFEP and IMDA to attract and retain locals, and hired about 200 more Singaporeans. After exiting from the Watchlist, this company continues to adopt fairer and more progressive HR practices. And indeed, these are win-win outcomes for both the business and the workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00485,2018-03-05-T-003,485,Lim Swee Say,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00486,2018-03-05-T-003,486,Lim Swee Say,"Another example, a private wealth management company with 80 PMET employees used to hire mostly foreign PMETs to serve mostly expatriate clients. It was placed on the Watchlist in February 2016."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00487,2018-03-05-T-003,487,Lim Swee Say,"Since then, it has re-positioned to serve both local and expatriate clients, and they hired 30 Singaporean wealth managers and PMETs, trained them here as well as overseas. After being removed from the Watchlist, the company continues to hire and develop more of our local wealth managers and PMETs to grow their business. Again, another case of win-win outcomes."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00488,2018-03-05-T-003,488,Lim Swee Say,"So far, 150 companies out of the 500 companies have improved their HR practices and exited from the Watchlist. Of the remaining 350 companies, 60 of them have not been cooperative and showed no sign of improvement. We have curtailed their work pass privileges  no new EP applications, no renewal of existing EPs, until they adopt fair HR practices."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00489,2018-03-05-T-003,489,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, we will continue to fight this win-lose mindset of ""two-third plus one-third less than one"", because it results in a waste of our precious human capital."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00490,2018-03-05-T-003,490,Lim Swee Say,"Second, for ""two-third plus one-third, greater than one"", we will make ""two-third local"" better and strengthen our local core."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00491,2018-03-05-T-003,491,Lim Swee Say,"I agree with Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Lim Biow Chuan. We will continue to enhance employment and employability of Singaporean PMETs. We will create more jobs of the future for them through Industry Transformation. We will create more skills of the future in them through the SkillsFuture movement, and we will create more careers of the future with them through the Adapt and Grow initiative."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00492,2018-03-05-T-003,492,Lim Swee Say,"To ensure fair access to more jobs and better jobs, we will strengthen the Fair Consideration Framework further, as suggested by Mr Patrick Tay. We will expand the requirement to advertise jobs on the national Jobs Bank before EP application to cover more employers, not just those with more than 25 employees, but also those with at least 10 employees."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00493,2018-03-05-T-003,493,Lim Swee Say,"At the same time, it will also cover more jobs with salary of up to $12,000 as of today, to jobs with salary of up to $15,000. This will take effect from 1 July this year. Sir, thirdly, for ""two-third plus one-third, greater than one"", we will make the ""one-third foreign"" better, a point made by Ms Jessica Tan."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00494,2018-03-05-T-003,494,Lim Swee Say,"As we moderate the intake of foreign manpower especially foreign professionals, employers say they cannot find enough locals who have the skills and are willing to do the jobs. They say this has slowed down their pace of business transformation and growth."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00495,2018-03-05-T-003,495,Lim Swee Say,"They feel our foreign manpower policy is too tight. To them, MOM is not pro-business enough."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00496,2018-03-05-T-003,496,Lim Swee Say,"But on the other hand, we hear ground feedback that there are still too many foreigners, too much competition here for jobs with our locals. They feel that our foreign manpower policy is too loose. So, to them, MOM is not pro-worker enough."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00497,2018-03-05-T-003,497,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, the policy objective of MOM is to strike a fine and dynamic balance between the two. Open enough to be pro-business to support business growth, and yet, at the same time, tight enough to be pro-worker to enhance local employment growth."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00498,2018-03-05-T-003,498,Lim Swee Say,"We therefore stay open to the intake of foreign professionals, but continue to tighten the criteria for EP. We did that in 2014 and 2017. This is to calibrate the growth of EP holders and enhance their overall quality both at the same time."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00499,2018-03-05-T-003,499,Lim Swee Say,"Assoc Prof Faishal Ibrahim asks for the outcomes. In the past three years, on average, we approved about 50,000 new EPs every year. But at the same time, about the same number of EPs were not renewed, and the growth of EPs therefore slowed to an average of 3,000 a year in the past three years."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00500,2018-03-05-T-003,500,Lim Swee Say,"This is significantly lower than the peak of 32,000 in one year, in 2011."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00501,2018-03-05-T-003,501,Lim Swee Say,"On the whole, local share of net growth in PMET employment improved from an average of 68% in the previous three years – 2012 to 2014 – to an average of 78%. So, from 68% went up to 78% in the past three years."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00502,2018-03-05-T-003,502,Lim Swee Say,"Out of every 10 net increase in PMET jobs in the last three years, seven to eight of them went to our local PMETs. Sectors where locals accounted for a large majority of the net growth in PMET employment include professional services, infocomm, healthcare, financial and insurance."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00503,2018-03-05-T-003,503,Lim Swee Say,"In short, we were able to draw on foreign professionals to help meet the manpower needs of the industry, while at the same time strengthen our local core. By working together, complementing each other more and competing with each other less, our Singapore workforce of ""two-third local and one-third foreign"" will be able to support a faster pace of industry transformation for us to compete better globally for better investments and jobs."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00504,2018-03-05-T-003,504,Lim Swee Say,"Mr Lee Yi Shyan asked for flexibility for employers to hire foreign PMETs, especially those with skills in great shortage in Singapore. Sir, let me clarify that the tightening of EP criteria should not be an issue for most foreign professionals with skills in great demand globally and in short supply locally. These include, for example AI, data analytics, advanced manufacturing, digital services."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00505,2018-03-05-T-003,505,Lim Swee Say,"These are the expertise often cited in the media by various business groups. Such professionals would command a salary premium and should be able to meet our EP criteria – in terms of salary, qualification and experience."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00506,2018-03-05-T-003,506,Lim Swee Say,"With the exception of those on our FCF Watchlist, as long as the employing companies have complied with our FCF in giving fair consideration to our local PMETs, they should generally be able to obtain approval for work pass applications for such specialists in short supply globally and in critical shortage locally."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00507,2018-03-05-T-003,507,Lim Swee Say,"In the exceptional situation where the EP applicants with the skillsets much needed here and yet are not able to meet our EP criteria, we do allow sector agencies to exercise some flexibility but only in a highly selective manner. On the condition that there is indeed a shortage of such skills here and that these foreign professionals are needed to help speed up our industry transformation and growth."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00508,2018-03-05-T-003,508,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, so on balance, our manpower policy is both pro-business and pro-worker. It is designed to improve the quality of both our local and foreign workforces in Singapore, and enhance the complementarity with each other."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00509,2018-03-05-T-003,509,Lim Swee Say,"This is so that we can meet the manpower needs of businesses for them to transform and grow and the career aspiration of our people for them to adapt and grow. Guided by this policy objective, we will introduce further changes to make “one-third foreign” even better."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00510,2018-03-05-T-003,510,Lim Swee Say,"For the S Pass holders who are mid-level skilled foreigners, their minimum qualifying salary was last updated in 2013. I agree with Mr Patrick Tay that it is timely to review. We will increase entry level salary by $200 up from $2,200 to $2,400."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00511,2018-03-05-T-003,511,Lim Swee Say,"As per current practice, those with more years of experience will need to meet higher salary thresholds. To allow companies more time to adjust, the increase will be done in two steps  $100 from January next year and next $100 from January 2020. We will also provide a transition period for existing S Pass holders."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00512,2018-03-05-T-003,512,Lim Swee Say,"For Work Permit Holders, there will be no further tightening for now, hence no change to dependency ratio ceiling (DRC) and levy. As pointed out by Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Thomas Chua, our focus is to enhance quality and productivity of these foreign workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00513,2018-03-05-T-003,513,Lim Swee Say,"Work permit holders at basic skill level (R2) from non-traditional sources and PRC, they are now allowed to work here for maximum of 10 years. Those with higher skills (R1) in Services and Manufacturing are allowed to stay here for up to 18 years, and 22 years if they work in Construction, Process and Marine Shipyard."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00514,2018-03-05-T-003,514,Lim Swee Say,"In response to feedback from the industry, we will extend the maximum period of employment by another four years. So, for those on 10 years, will now go to 14 years. Those on 18 years to 22 years; and from 22 years to 26 years. This will apply to all sectors, and for both R1 and R2 to take effect from 1 May this year."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00515,2018-03-05-T-003,515,Lim Swee Say,"We will also give employers more pathways to improve the quality of their foreign workers. Besides skills certification, those who are more experienced with higher salary can also be upgraded from R2 to R1 pass. This is currently allowed for Construction, Process and Services sectors. We will now extend it to Manufacturing and Marine Shipyard sectors."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00516,2018-03-05-T-003,516,Lim Swee Say,We believe this will be helpful to companies that want to hire and retain their better work permit holders. It will take effect from 1 September this year.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00517,2018-03-05-T-003,517,Lim Swee Say,"Fourth, for ""two-third plus one-third, greater than one"", we need to make the ""plus"" better. To recognise and spread the adoption of progressive HR practices, we launched the Human Capital Partnership (HCP) Programme in February last year."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00518,2018-03-05-T-003,518,Lim Swee Say,"One hundred and thirty-four HC Partners are now on board. They are from various sectors ranging from MNCs to SMEs. Together, they employ over 140,000 locals."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00519,2018-03-05-T-003,519,Lim Swee Say,"Mr Patrick Tay, Ms Jessica Tan and Assoc Prof Faishal Ibrahim asked for an update on HCP. Sir, HCP companies believe in transforming HR into HC – Human Resource into Human Capital. Not consumption of Human Resource but investment in Human Capital, turning HR into their most precious capital."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00520,2018-03-05-T-003,520,Lim Swee Say,"First, they have strong local core at all levels. Collectively, local PMETs account for about 90% of total PMET workforce in these companies. Not just more than 90% at the entry to middle level, but also more than 80% at the senior to top levels."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00521,2018-03-05-T-003,521,Lim Swee Say,"Second, their workforce is highly inclusive. Jobs are redesigned to be less physically demanding for the older workers. Flexible work arrangements are offered to allow those with care responsibility at home to share job; and for employees to go on sabbaticals and pursue new opportunities within the company when they return; to pursue part-time studies to upgrade themselves; or to enable retired employees to return to work on part-time basis."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00522,2018-03-05-T-003,522,Lim Swee Say,"Third, HCP companies believe strongly in strengthening local-foreign complementarity. They transfer skills from foreign experts to our local workforce and build up local core in their senior management team."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00523,2018-03-05-T-003,523,Lim Swee Say,"One HC Partner which left a deep impression on me is Keystone Cable. Keystone Cable is a local SME with 140 employees. It is a maker of power and control cables with a strong foothold in the region. The plant is located in Senoko, not easy to attract locals. In fact, it has to work doubly hard to compete with MNCs for talent."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00524,2018-03-05-T-003,524,Lim Swee Say,"But as a flexible and nimble SME, it embraces the mindset of human capital development. Starting off as a delivery driver, Mr Jimmy Wong is now a Sales Executive. He brought in $1 million worth of sales in just six months in his new job. He is now being groomed to take on clients in overseas markets. The company was able to attract 20% more job applications last year. But what is even more impressive is that 100% of those they offered jobs to accepted their offers!"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00525,2018-03-05-T-003,525,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, we will keep growing the HCP community as suggested by Mr Patrick Tay. We will also promote adoption of tripartite standards, as reminded by Ms Thanaletchimi."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00526,2018-03-05-T-003,526,Lim Swee Say,"Fifth and last, we must strengthen the synergy between ""two-third local"" and ""one-third foreign"" so that the outcome will not be ""equal to one"", but ""greater than one""."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00527,2018-03-05-T-003,527,Lim Swee Say,"Globally, there is big concern that technology will take away many jobs. Yet, we see an amazing race to embrace technology. China is the world’s number one user of industrial robots today."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00528,2018-03-05-T-003,528,Lim Swee Say,"Globally, there is a big concern that foreigners will take away jobs from the locals. Yet, more countries are opening up even more to attract foreigners with the skills and expertise to offer, including China and Japan."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00529,2018-03-05-T-003,529,Lim Swee Say,"This reminded me of the story of two men walking in jungle. A tiger was catching up on them. One of them squatted down to tighten his shoe lace, the other asked ""what are you trying to do?"""
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00530,2018-03-05-T-003,530,Lim Swee Say,"He said ""I am tightening the shoe lace""."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00533,2018-03-05-T-003,533,Lim Swee Say,"""You mean you can run faster than a tiger?"""
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00534,2018-03-05-T-003,534,Lim Swee Say,"""No, of course not. But all I need to do is out-run you."""
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00535,2018-03-05-T-003,535,Lim Swee Say,"Now, in the global village, it is not possible to out-run technology, but we can out-run the competition. Those running slower will see more jobs being destroyed by technology. Those who run faster can create new jobs with technology more than the loss of existing jobs to technology. This explains why China is running fast with robots, and Japan is not slow too."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00536,2018-03-05-T-003,536,Lim Swee Say,"With the help of robots and AI, Honda Motor, Canon and Pioneer are bringing production of car components, car navigation system, digital camera back to Japan. So ""Made-in-Japan” is making a comeback, but this time with the help of not just robots, but intelligent robots and human co-workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00537,2018-03-05-T-003,537,Lim Swee Say,"With the world out there running fast, just imagine, what if one day, a ""cheaper"" China becomes better by using technology faster than us. A ""better"" Japan becomes cheaper also by using technology faster than us."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00539,2018-03-05-T-003,539,Lim Swee Say,"Now, if this happens, they would become cheaper, better and faster than Singapore. What future will we have then?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00540,2018-03-05-T-003,540,Lim Swee Say,"So, Singapore must run fast too. In fact, the faster, the better, and we are. We are running fast in Advanced Manufacturing. At Bedok Industrial Estate, my constituency, Panasonic is building a Smart Factory there. It will have machines fitted with sensors inter-connected to work with each other. Operations will be more manpower-lean and the local workers will be retrained to take on new and better jobs, such as robot coordinators."

It is working with industry to push through ground-breaking initiatives – blockchain, quantum computing, Big Data, AI and so on. In fact, we move so fast that today, Singapore is one of the top global fintech hubs alongside London, New York and Silicon Valley."

In the 1980s, when I was still a young man, we became an Intelligent Island through national computerisation, office automation and computer integrated manufacturing.

However, to truly succeed in becoming a pervasively innovative economy and society, we need to do much more. We need to speed up the development and transfer of new and better global capabilities to our local workforce, a point made by Mr Chong Kee Hiong, not just in high tech, high profile and high impact sectors, but in as many sectors as possible, and as quickly as possible. This is why we are piloting the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP) because the potential scope for transfer and development of new capabilities is limited only by our focus and determination."

In Precision Engineering, smartphones are getting bigger but flatter and lighter. Hence, our local industry needs to use softer alloy and fit in more chips and components. Companies need to use high speed, high precision machines to prevent cracking and warping. Local engineers and technicians are also required to have new skills to advise on product design and materials selection."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00560,2018-03-05-T-003,560,Lim Swee Say,"To grow Singapore's market share in a global industry that is growing very fast, the Singapore Aircargo Agents Association (SAAA), the Changi Airport Group (CAG), CAAS and the industry, they want to work together to bring in IATA certified trainers from UK and Dubai to train a group of local specialists here, who will then be able to multiply this capability by training other locals. In total, we aim for up to 25 companies, up from the 10 currently to 25, to be able to obtain IATA certification. So, here is another example of capability transfer."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00562,2018-03-05-T-003,562,Lim Swee Say,"Sir, CTP is also relevant to domestic sector. For example, in lift maintenance, the current approach is wait for the lift to break down, then repair, then wait for the lift to break down again. A better approach actually is to make all our lifts in Singapore into ""smart lifts"", using predictive data analytics and maintenance, to shift from corrective maintenance, which means waiting for failure; to preventive maintenance before failure, which is being done by many companies today; to predictive maintenance, or reduce the probability of failure. So, predict what is likely to happen before it happens."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00566,2018-03-05-T-003,566,Lim Swee Say,"Furniture manufacturing is another example. Not many of us know that our local furnishing industry is an S$6 billion industry with over 1,900 companies. Manufacturing facilities here focus mainly on made-to-order furniture. Today, we can design and make furniture using three-axis Computer Numeric Control (CNC) machines. I asked them what does it mean by ""three-axis"", they said these machines can move left, right, up, down, front and back."

To upgrade our local industry to 4.0, we will help them to bring the 5-axis CNC machines where the tools can twist and turn, cut in different directions, to create contour and more complex shapes. So, this will also make the jobs of the craftsmen ESS!"

Market for hybrid cars grew by 200% in the last two years, from 6,000 a year to 20,000 last year. New capabilities are needed for the repair and maintenance of these hybrid cars, no longer just changing the oil filter, checking and replacing battery, lights and brakes, but have to handle a completely different system – carry out a battery load test, high voltage cable inspection, front motor test, hybrid transmission test and so on."

To achieve real transfer of capability, project duration is mostly in months and years, not days and weeks. Specialists have to do more than just training, but also coaching and working alongside our local workers; be their trainer, mentor and guide. Costs can often be the obstacles, especially for local enterprises."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00600,2018-03-05-T-003,600,Lim Swee Say,"First, shi shi zao ying xiong (heroes are borned out of circumstances). The rapid development of technology and innovation is inevitable and cannot be stopped. If we refuse to make changes or are slow to adapt, we will definitely be eliminated."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00601,2018-03-05-T-003,601,Lim Swee Say,"People say that it is better to suffer for the short term than to endure pain for the long term. To continue with our development, we must master new technology, transform quickly and strengthen our competitiveness."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00602,2018-03-05-T-003,602,Lim Swee Say,"With determination, we have achieved significant results. The economy has turned around, productivity has gone up, unemployment rate has gone down and wages are growing. This is something that we have achieved by working together."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00603,2018-03-05-T-003,603,Lim Swee Say,"But we cannot be complacent. Economic transformation is like rowing a boat against the current, if we do not move forward, we will be pushed backwards."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00604,2018-03-05-T-003,604,Lim Swee Say,"Our second strategy is ying xiong zao shi shi (heroes create the right circumstances for themselves). As we strengthen our economic competitiveness, we must also optimise our unique strengths and advantages, as well as strengthen the cohesiveness of our workforce. This is critical."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00605,2018-03-05-T-003,605,Lim Swee Say,"We must ensure that the benefits and opportunities brought about by the future economy benefit every segment of our society, regardless of age, level of skills and income. We must pay special attention to older and lower-income workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00606,2018-03-05-T-003,606,Lim Swee Say,"We must also help workers with young children and aged parents, so that they can look after their families while advancing their careers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00607,2018-03-05-T-003,607,Lim Swee Say,"We must also learn from others and overcome our shortcomings, ensure that locals and foreign workers can work better together and benefit from each other. We should not be competing against each other within the country but against competitors overseas, in order to achieve better economic growth and better employment opportunities for Singaporeans."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00608,2018-03-05-T-003,608,Lim Swee Say,"For some countries, just strengthening their economic competitiveness is considered a success, but for Singapore, we have to strengthen our competitiveness as well as the cohesiveness of our workforce. To us, that is what success is really about."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00609,2018-03-05-T-003,609,Lim Swee Say,"There are two types of pathways in this world  easy paths and difficult paths. Some countries choose the easy path because it is easier and they can travel faster, but eventually, instead of reaching their destination, they reach a dead end."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00610,2018-03-05-T-003,610,Lim Swee Say,"What we have chosen is not an easy path. We know that in transformation and upgrading, there are no shortcuts. Although the path is not easy, but as long as our tripartite partners work together and help our workers, we will be able to move ahead of others. When we reach the destination, it is definitely not a dead e but a brand new wide horizon."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00611,2018-03-05-T-003,611,Lim Swee Say,"Therefore, let us continue to forge ahead together on this difficult path with a common belief, as one economy, as one society, as one country. Only then, can we ensure that Singapore continues to maintain a special place in ASEAN, in Asia, in the world. And only then, can we ensure that our workers have better jobs, better wages, safe and happy homes; that each generation will be better than the last, and lives continue to improve."

Together with our tripartite partners at the national and sector levels, we have to do our best to transform across all sectors, for our economy to transform and grow, pervasively, as One Singapore Unlimited."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00614,2018-03-05-T-003,614,Lim Swee Say,"We also have to do our best to create better jobs, better skills for everyone to adapt and grow inclusively as One Singapore United. Advances in technology will destroy many old jobs globally and here in Singapore. But if we do more together to build new and better capability faster than our competitors, we can move ahead and stay ahead. To make every enterprise a better enterprise, every job a better job and every worker a better worker. Together, we can strive for innovative, inclusive and sustainable growth for everyone."

At the same time, businesses may need to redesign jobs to support an ageing workforce or be more attractive to local jobseekers, who now have higher aspirations."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00618,2018-03-05-T-003,618,Josephine Teo,"MOM together with several sector lead agencies are helping businesses transform through the Lean Enterprise Development (LED) Scheme. Ms Jessica Tan asked about its effectiveness. Since its launch in October 2015, we have built up good momentum. We have helped about 6,700 companies, which is three times the number a year ago. They come from all sectors and are of all sizes."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00619,2018-03-05-T-003,619,Josephine Teo,"One interesting project was undertaken by the Gratify Group, a company which owns many different F&B brands. The owner, Frank Lau, wanted to make sure that his company's expansion plans would not be held back as a result of a lack of manpower. Hence, when conceptualising its new brand which is called ""Omoomodon"", he set himself a challenge that every outlet must be able to operate with just three staff per shift, when most similar concepts needed at least five staff per shift."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00620,2018-03-05-T-003,620,Josephine Teo,"In the F&B business, what Frank wanted was certainly a tall order. Please pardon the pun. But Frank believed that he needed to push the boundaries to have any chance of scaling the business in a sustainable way. He engaged the Singapore Productivity Centre to re-design his workflow and processes. They started with the menu, with food preparation very much in mind. They studied operational flows at many food outlets and collected data on time-consuming tasks. The end result included a central kitchen, self-service ordering and payment and optimised kitchen designs. Staff were also crossed-trained to prepare food and attend to customers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00621,2018-03-05-T-003,621,Josephine Teo,"The improved job scope resulted in better pay and higher retention. Salaries offered by Omoomodon are on average 15% higher than market rate, there is lower attrition as workers are more motivated to stay. Thanks to these measures, manpower required for each new outlet was reduced by up to 60%."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00622,2018-03-05-T-003,622,Josephine Teo,"This example shows how transformation is possible. The LED Scheme supports all of the firms. It provides a ""one-stop"" service for businesses, especially SMEs, to access schemes offered by different Government agencies, without having to figure out where and who to approach for what."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00623,2018-03-05-T-003,623,Josephine Teo,"However, not all transformations need customised solutions like Frank did. Many businesses will benefit just adopting ready-to-go productivity solutions. For example, the Smart Management & Tracking System (SMTS). Using RFID technology to manage, track and audit assets to reduce stock taking time, the companies can enjoy much productivity improvement. It is useful for nearly all businesses in manufacturing and retail."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00624,2018-03-05-T-003,624,Josephine Teo,"There are now more than 40 ready-to-go solutions pre-approved by Government agencies such as SPRING Singapore, A*STAR and IMDA. These ready-to-go solutions have been tried and tested, so there is no need for businesses to worry about ineffective solutions, or fly-by-night vendors."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00625,2018-03-05-T-003,625,Josephine Teo,"Through the LED Scheme, we aim to make technology and innovation pervasive, not only at the enterprise level, but also at the industry level to quicken the pace of transformation, and not just in one or two sectors but across all 23 ITM sectors."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00626,2018-03-05-T-003,626,Josephine Teo,"For instance, under the Lean Hotel Initiative, 16 hotels came together to collectively identify gaps and design industry solutions. In just four months, the hotels had achieved productivity savings of between 4.5% and 28%, without having to compromise service quality."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00627,2018-03-05-T-003,627,Josephine Teo,"We also plan to go beyond the ITMs to non-ITM sectors, and are in discussions with several industries such as furniture, farms, lifts and escalators to support their transformation."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00628,2018-03-05-T-003,628,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, as businesses transform and jobs become better, so too must workers adapt. This is how we can achieve better employment outcomes. As mentioned by Minister Lim, the Adapt and Grow initiative helped place more than 25,000 jobseekers into new jobs and careers in 2017, about 20% more than in 2016."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00629,2018-03-05-T-003,629,Josephine Teo,"Broadly speaking, we aim to help both missed matches − where employer and jobseekers have not found each other, and mismatches − where there are skills or wage gaps that make it hard for the jobseeker to secure a job."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00630,2018-03-05-T-003,630,Josephine Teo,"Of the 25,000 jobseekers placed, about 60% involved missed matches. The jobseekers were job-ready but somehow missed finding the right employers. Workforce Singapore and NTUC-e2i helped them to find a match."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00631,2018-03-05-T-003,631,Josephine Teo,Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked for an update on our efforts to strengthen job matching through the national Jobs Bank. We are transforming Jobs Bank into a new platform called MyCareersFuture.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00632,2018-03-05-T-003,632,Josephine Teo,"MyCareersFuture will have new features to help jobseekers and employers find better matches. It will have intelligent job matching, and can recommend jobs to jobseekers that would best fit their skill sets. It will also highlight jobs that are supported by Adapt and Grow programmes such as the Professional Conversion Programmes, to help bridge job and skill mismatches."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00633,2018-03-05-T-003,633,Josephine Teo,MyCareersFuture has been up and running since 2 January this year and the portal will be officially launched in the second quarter this year.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00634,2018-03-05-T-003,634,Josephine Teo,"Besides reducing missed matches, we helped to close skills or wage mismatches. Of the 25,000 jobseekers placed, 40% involved jobseekers with some form of mismatch. This proportion has grown significantly from just 25% in 2016."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00635,2018-03-05-T-003,635,Josephine Teo,"Placements of mismatch cases doubled from about 5,000 in 2016 to about 10,000 in 2017. This reflects our more intensive efforts to address mismatches. As our economy restructures, job-skills mismatch will be a growing challenge. They can be very unsettling for individuals who have lost their jobs or are at risk of retrenchment. This is why our key focus has been to step up support for jobseekers with skills or wage mismatches, because they need more help. Last year, we strengthened support under the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) and Career Support Programme (CSP)."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00636,2018-03-05-T-003,636,Josephine Teo,"Assoc Prof Faishal Ibrahim, Mr Low Thia Kiang and Dr Intan asked how effective MOM’s efforts have been in helping the long–term unemployed, older workers and mature workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00637,2018-03-05-T-003,637,Josephine Teo,"If Members recall, the CSP provides a wage subsidy that helps to close the gap between what PMET jobseekers expect and what employers are prepared to offer."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00638,2018-03-05-T-003,638,Josephine Teo,"With the enhanced wage support under CSP, placements have quadrupled from about 260 in 2016 to over 1,100 in 2017. Among the CSP placements, more than 80% were long-term unemployed. The retention rate of those placed has been encouraging. Within 12 months of placement, about 70% of those placed in 2015 and 2016 have remained in employment."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00639,2018-03-05-T-003,639,Josephine Teo,"Besides CSP, we also raised the salary support caps of PCPs. PCP placements in 2017 were almost three times that in 2016. In particular, the proportion of mature PMETs, especially those who are 50 years old and above, has more than doubled."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00640,2018-03-05-T-003,640,Josephine Teo,"Similarly, the proportion placed in mid-level jobs paying $4,000 or more has also doubled. Ms K Thanaletchimi would be happy to know that overall drop-out rates for PCPs are low − more than nine in 10 participants complete the programmes."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00641,2018-03-05-T-003,641,Josephine Teo,"Even in the healthcare sector which has a longer training period for PCPs, almost nine in 10 have successfully completed the programmes. For the minority who drop out, most have personal reasons, or find it challenging to adapt."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00642,2018-03-05-T-003,642,Josephine Teo,"We have worked with MOH to reduce the duration of some PCPs, such as nursing, without compromising the quality of training. More importantly, we need to strike a balance between stringent criteria and processes to screen individuals, and giving jobseekers sufficient opportunities to start new careers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00643,2018-03-05-T-003,643,Josephine Teo,"One person who has started a new career is Mr Soon Sie Chye who is 44 years old. After graduating with a degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from Loughborough University, Sie Chye spent the early part of his career working as an engineer. More than 10 years ago, he made a career switch to join the banking sector, where he had a fruitful career, leading back office teams in different banks."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00644,2018-03-05-T-003,644,Josephine Teo,"However, he always had a lifelong dream to set up his own business. In 2014, he took the plunge, but in less than two years the venture failed, and he became unemployed for more than a year. It was a challenging and stressful period as he just had a newborn. During this period, the family had to depend on wife's income and their savings, while he soldiered on in his job search."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00645,2018-03-05-T-003,645,Josephine Teo,"Sie Chye came across South Island Aquarium, a company specialising in imports and exports of aquatic plants and ornamental fish. Although he had to take a pay-cut, Sie Chye was keen on the role as he felt the company had good potential and was excited by its expansion plans. The company was also keen to tap on his MNC and management experience."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00646,2018-03-05-T-003,646,Josephine Teo,"To better prepare for his role as a Business Manager, Sie Chye was enrolled in the PCP for International Trading Executives. This is a one-year programme to bridge skills gaps in supply chain, trade finance and e-commerce. He is now five months into the PCP."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00647,2018-03-05-T-003,647,Josephine Teo,"Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about the long term unemployment situation. In fact, Sie Chye is one of the more than 6,600 individuals previously unemployed for at least six months, which is the definition of long-term unemployed, who found a job through the Adapt and Grow initiative."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00648,2018-03-05-T-003,648,Josephine Teo,"This is a 25% increase in the number of long-term unemployed placed compared to 2016. They account for close to 50% of unemployed jobseekers placed through Adapt and Grow when all the different programmes are combined. Realistically, not all of the long-term unemployed jobseekers will succeed in the new jobs that we help match them to."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00649,2018-03-05-T-003,649,Josephine Teo,"But we are prepared to take some risk, through support programmes, to help them get on their feet. Otherwise, we risk the pool of long-term unemployed getting bigger and their families falling deeper into difficulties."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00650,2018-03-05-T-003,650,Josephine Teo,"Today, with a growing economy and these programmes in place, the long term unemployment rate for local PMETs has improved from 0.9% in 2016 to 0.7% in 2017. However, compared to a few years ago, the resident long-term unemployment rate remains slightly elevated. But, it is not at its highest, contrary to what Mr Low Thia Kiang thinks."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00651,2018-03-05-T-003,651,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00652,2018-03-05-T-003,652,Josephine Teo,"Nevertheless, we believe there is still much more to do. Besides helping those already unemployed, like Sie Chye, we are also helping those at risk of displacement."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00653,2018-03-05-T-003,653,Josephine Teo,"One such example is Mr Vincent See. Vincent had spent majority of his career performing IT support in the hospitality sector. However, when he saw his company restructuring to cut costs, he thought he should make plans. Although worried that he could not adapt at his age – he is 51 years old – Vincent also saw an opportunity to learn something new."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00654,2018-03-05-T-003,654,Josephine Teo,"Given the strong growth of e-commerce, he saw logistics as a growth sector and signed up for the Attach and Train programme for Logistics Executives."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00655,2018-03-05-T-003,655,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00656,2018-03-05-T-003,656,Josephine Teo,"Unlike the usual PCPs, the Attach and Train programme does not guarantee a job at the start. This is because some sectors or employers are growing but are not yet ready to hire more. But rather than to wait, the programme helps jobseekers like Vincent build up their CV to be ready for a new career when the opportunities come."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00657,2018-03-05-T-003,657,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00658,2018-03-05-T-003,658,Josephine Teo,"Vincent is currently six months into the Attach and Train programme with ST Logistics. The company has been suitably impressed by him and is also ready to hire. Although Vincent’s training attachment will only end this June, ST Logistics has already offered him full-time employment."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00659,2018-03-05-T-003,659,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00660,2018-03-05-T-003,660,Josephine Teo,"Vincent is one of 13,000 mature jobseekers helped through Adapt and Grow in 2017. He is also a very good example of how the Government can help a mature worker who has taken proactive steps to overcome his fears, to find a new career in a growth sector."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00661,2018-03-05-T-003,661,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00662,2018-03-05-T-003,662,Josephine Teo,"These mature workers account for about half of all placements under Adapt and Grow. About half of them, like Vincent, are 50 years old and above. We now have over 100 PCPs in more than 30 sectors – helping both displaced PMETs as well as those like Vincent who are at risk of displacement."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00663,2018-03-05-T-003,663,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00664,2018-03-05-T-003,664,Josephine Teo,"Last year, MOM announced stepped-up efforts to place local PMETs in five growth sectors with good potential for PMET jobs, namely  infocomm and media, professional services, finance and insurance, wholesale trade and healthcare."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00665,2018-03-05-T-003,665,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00666,2018-03-05-T-003,666,Josephine Teo,We have generated positive momentum. Placements in these five sectors accounted for about 50% of all PMET mismatch placements in the second half of 2017. About 50% were mature local PMETs.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00667,2018-03-05-T-003,667,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00668,2018-03-05-T-003,668,Josephine Teo,"Through this effort, we have gained new insights into how we can support the manpower needs of companies that are growing and transforming. The key is to engage the companies early, before they have firmed up their plans. By doing so, it is more likely that their existing employees can be a part of the company’s future, instead of being just part of the past."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00669,2018-03-05-T-003,669,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00670,2018-03-05-T-003,670,Josephine Teo,"Our model of PCPs will therefore evolve. We no longer wait till workers are unemployed or retrenched to reach out to them. Instead, we work with companies ahead of time to put in place re-deployment PCPs such as in Consumer Banking, where existing staff are re-trained and re-deployed."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00671,2018-03-05-T-003,671,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00672,2018-03-05-T-003,672,Josephine Teo,"As the banks transform their frontline services, hundreds of bank tellers and cashiers are adapting to do digital marketing, data analysis and product development. These staff can avoid painful retrenchment, and at the same time help their employers meet their new manpower needs. In 2018, we expect more placements to come from such re-deployment PCPs."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00673,2018-03-05-T-003,673,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00674,2018-03-05-T-003,674,Josephine Teo,"Our Adapt and Grow efforts are not only targeted at PMETs. A sizeable proportion, about 40%, placed under Adapt and Grow are Rank-and-File workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00675,2018-03-05-T-003,675,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00676,2018-03-05-T-003,676,Josephine Teo,"Similar to PCPs for PMETs, we also have Place and Train programmes for Rank-and-File workers to re-skill to take on new roles. More than 2,000 workers were placed under such programmes in 2017, representing a more than 50% increase from 2016."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00677,2018-03-05-T-003,677,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00678,2018-03-05-T-003,678,Josephine Teo,"We have also piloted the Work Trial scheme in 2016. This scheme is targeted at jobseekers who are job-ready, but are not sure about the specific jobs. It could also be that the jobseeker and prospective employers are unsure about each other."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00679,2018-03-05-T-003,679,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00680,2018-03-05-T-003,680,Josephine Teo,"Through Work Trial, they have up to three months to assess each other, with Government bearing the cost. In 2017, the number of jobseekers placed through Work Trial has increased five times, from about 100 to 500."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00682,2018-03-05-T-003,682,Josephine Teo,"One of them is Mr Muhd Sahfari. Sahfari left his previous job as a sales manager in an IT solutions company as he felt the environment was not quite suited for him. However, he was still keen on a sales position as he enjoys interacting with people."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00684,2018-03-05-T-003,684,Josephine Teo,"He found out that Crosstrack was hiring a sales manager. In case you are wondering, Crosstrack is a start-up which provides an online marketplace to allow customers to source for the most suitable courier for their delivery jobs. Unlike his previous sales jobs which were focused on direct sales, Crosstrack’s requirement of a sales manager includes operations management and liaising with delivery drivers. Sahfari was therefore apprehensive. He thought to himself could he could cope with the additional workload, and does a tech start-up offer sufficient job security? Therefore, he decided to sign up for Work Trial, before committing on a permanent basis."

Not only did he enjoy the dynamic nature of a start-up, he also picked up new IT skills. Crosstrack saw that he had the right aptitude and attitude, and employed him on a permanent basis when the Work Trial ended."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00743,2018-03-05-T-003,743,Josephine Teo,"All the increase in the number of SEPs came from those who did self-employed work as their main jobs, rather than as secondary sources of income."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00745,2018-03-05-T-003,745,Josephine Teo,"Such SEPs are referred to as ""primary SEPs"" because they depend on self-employment primarily for their livelihoods. Primary SEPs are also the group we are most interested in. Primary SEPs now constitute 8.4% of our resident workforce, still well within the range of 8% to 10% observed over the last decade."

By age, more than half of the primary SEPs are 50 and above; less than 10% are below 30. The age distribution in 2017 remains largely the same as 2016."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00751,2018-03-05-T-003,751,Josephine Teo,The most recent survey also showed a notable increase in the number of primary SEPs who said they preferred regular employment over self-employment. This group rose from 19% in 2016 to 23% in 2017.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00752,2018-03-05-T-003,752,Josephine Teo,"In other words, about one in five primary SEPs prefer to be in a regular job. However, they tend to be older and have lower educational qualifications. We are very keen to help them and Mr Ang Hin Kee asked how."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00754,2018-03-05-T-003,754,Josephine Teo,"The first is to improve SEPs' awareness of job matching schemes available and encourage them to come forward to the career centres run by Workforce Singapore (WSG) and NTUC Employment and Employability Institute (e2i). Our existing schemes, as well as the new Career Trial programme that I spoke about can also help. Certainly, we should help career counsellors and coaches become more aware of these efforts so that they can provide the right advice."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00756,2018-03-05-T-003,756,Josephine Teo,"But these efforts will need such SEPs to become active jobseekers. At present, more than 80% of them say they have not been looking for a regular job actively, even though they prefer it over self-employment."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00760,2018-03-05-T-003,760,Josephine Teo,"To recap, the Tripartite Workgroup (TWG) noted in its report that although the SEPs were very diverse, there were four common challenges they faced. First, payment-related disputes; second, loss of income due to prolonged illness or injury; third, lack of CPF savings for healthcare and retirement; and fourth, lack of occupation-specific competency frameworks."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00761,2018-03-05-T-003,761,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00762,2018-03-05-T-003,762,Josephine Teo,"Mr Thomas Chua, Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Ang Hin Kee asked about MOM's response. We are grateful to the TWG members who include Mr Ang, for your well-considered and balanced recommendations. They were very constructive. The Government accepts all seven recommendations and will find ways to fully implement them. Let me share our plans."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00763,2018-03-05-T-003,763,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00764,2018-03-05-T-003,764,Josephine Teo,"First, payment-related disputes. Some observers have suggested mandating written contracts for all SEPs to minimise payment disputes. The TWG considered this but finds it impractical. This is because buyers of SEPs' services include micro-SMEs and even individual households, such as for private home tuition. Some purchases are of very small value"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00765,2018-03-05-T-003,765,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00766,2018-03-05-T-003,766,Josephine Teo,"Instead, today we formally launch the Tripartite Standard on Contracting with SEPs. This was developed with tripartite partners in line with the TWG's recommendations. It is an agreed benchmark which SEPs should encourage buyers to adopt. SEPs will be able to identify and contract with progressive service buyers who adopt the standard. Buyers who adopt the standard need to discuss and agree clearly with the SEPs terms of engagement, such as the range of services to be delivered, project timelines and milestones, payment schedules. These will have to be set out in writing."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00767,2018-03-05-T-003,767,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00768,2018-03-05-T-003,768,Josephine Teo,"The standard is a good start to make clear the working arrangements between businesses and SEPs. Over time, the standard will help shape contracting norms and entrench best practices."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00769,2018-03-05-T-003,769,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00770,2018-03-05-T-003,770,Josephine Teo,"But, even with written agreements, disputes could potentially still arise. For SEPs with sector agencies, we encourage them to continue to approach their sector agencies. These sector agencies would be in a better position to help resolve disputes. For instance, LTA facilitates mediation of disputes between taxi operators and taxi drivers. LTA is best suited for this role because apart from being familiar with issues in the industry, it has convening power as the regulator of both taxi operators and taxi drivers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00771,2018-03-05-T-003,771,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00772,2018-03-05-T-003,772,Josephine Teo,"For other SEPs, from September last year, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) started piloting voluntary mediation when they have payment disputes with businesses. With immediate effect, TADM will extend voluntary mediation services to all SEPs who have payment disputes with businesses."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00773,2018-03-05-T-003,773,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00774,2018-03-05-T-003,774,Josephine Teo,"Additionally, the TWG recommended that a prolonged medical leave (PML) insurance product be developed to mitigate the SEPs' loss of income during prolonged injury or illness."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00775,2018-03-05-T-003,775,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00776,2018-03-05-T-003,776,Josephine Teo,"Today, some SEPs buy additional riders on top of their private insurance plans to provide for this. However, there is a lack of an affordable standalone PML insurance product today. This means that SEPs have no alternative if they do not wish to buy the main insurance product. It is only available as a rider."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00777,2018-03-05-T-003,777,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00778,2018-03-05-T-003,778,Josephine Teo,"Observers and SEPs have also asked if service buyers should be made to buy insurance for SEPs, just as businesses buy work injury insurance for their employees. However, unlike a regular employee, most SEPs contract with multiple service buyers. It will not be possible to determine precisely how much coverage each service buyer should provide for the SEP."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00779,2018-03-05-T-003,779,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00780,2018-03-05-T-003,780,Josephine Teo,We will therefore take a practical approach of making the insurance product available for SEPs to purchase for their own protection. I am encouraged that NTUC Income is keen to develop a PML insurance product that will fulfil the TWG's recommendations. Other insurance companies may also step forward to offer such insurance.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00781,2018-03-05-T-003,781,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00782,2018-03-05-T-003,782,Josephine Teo,Let me now address the question of whether all SEPs should be compelled to have this type of insurance.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00783,2018-03-05-T-003,783,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00784,2018-03-05-T-003,784,Josephine Teo,"SEPs are a diverse group. They can be found in numerous occupations, many of which have low-risk of injury, such as real estate agents. SEPs themselves have varying health conditions. We therefore agree with TWG that the purchase of PML insurance should largely be kept voluntary."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00785,2018-03-05-T-003,785,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00786,2018-03-05-T-003,786,Josephine Teo,"That said, we want to encourage widespread adoption of insurance by SEPs in some higher-risk occupations, as they are most in need of such protection. Making insurance coverage the norm for SEPs in these occupations would make clear to the buyers of their services that the insurance costs would be priced into their fees. This is only fair."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00787,2018-03-05-T-003,787,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00788,2018-03-05-T-003,788,Josephine Teo,"As a start, we have identified two occupational groups in which to promote PML insurance coverage."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00789,2018-03-05-T-003,789,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00790,2018-03-05-T-003,790,Josephine Teo,"The first group is sports coaches and instructors. Collectively, MOE schools are major buyers of their services. MOE has agreed in-principle to help shape a new norm by contracting only with self-employed coaches and instructors who have such PML insurance coverage. SEP coaches and instructors may then price the cost of PML insurance coverage into their bids for MOE's work or projects."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00791,2018-03-05-T-003,791,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00792,2018-03-05-T-003,792,Josephine Teo,"Another occupational group which will benefit from PML insurance are taxi drivers and private hire car drivers. The individual buyers of their services are really the commuters, and there are many. But there are significant intermediaries like the taxi operators and matching platforms like Grab and Uber."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00793,2018-03-05-T-003,793,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00794,2018-03-05-T-003,794,Josephine Teo,"MOM and LTA will study how to ensure that active taxi and private hire car drivers also have PML insurance coverage, together with these intermediaries, the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA)."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00795,2018-03-05-T-003,795,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00796,2018-03-05-T-003,796,Josephine Teo,"Together, sport coaches, taxi and private hire car drivers comprise about 30% of all SEPs. In consultation with relevant stakeholders, MOM will also work closely with MOE and LTA on the way forward to promote PML insurance coverage as a norm, starting with these two occupational groups. The aim is to have a viable plan and for a PML insurance product to be available in 2019."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00800,2018-03-05-T-003,800,Josephine Teo,CPF is the cornerstone of our social security system. CPF schemes are not limited to regular employees. SEPs can also make use of CPF to save for their healthcare and retirement needs.

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00804,2018-03-05-T-003,804,Josephine Teo,"Even though Medisave contributions are mandatory today, about one in four SEPs have not been keeping up with their Medisave contributions. The question is  why?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00805,2018-03-05-T-003,805,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00806,2018-03-05-T-003,806,Josephine Teo,"Well, this is because SEPs are given up to 12 months from the time income is assessed to make their Medisave contributions. A key challenge is that they may not set enough cash on a regular basis. So when the time comes to make that lump sum contribution to their Medisave accounts, they find it difficult to do so."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00807,2018-03-05-T-003,807,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00808,2018-03-05-T-003,808,Josephine Teo,"Without sufficient Medisave contributions, these SEPs may not be able to pay for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses or keep up with their MediShield Life premiums. They will face a longer-term risk of not being able to pay for their healthcare in old age. So we are very concerned about them."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00810,2018-03-05-T-003,810,Josephine Teo,"It will be easier for them to make smaller, but more regular contributions as they receive the earnings. So this is why the Government agrees to study how to implement the TWG's recommendation for a CAYE model for SEPs' Medisave contributions."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00812,2018-03-05-T-003,812,Josephine Teo,"This means that a Medisave contribution is required as and when a service fee is earned, similar to employees today who pay CPF when they receive their monthly salaries. The service buyer or intermediary who contracts with the SEP will deduct and transmit the Medisave contribution to the SEP's Medisave account whenever they pay the SEP."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00814,2018-03-05-T-003,814,Josephine Teo,"There is no change to the SEP's obligation to make the Medisave contribution, and for the time being, neither will we require SEPs to contribute to their Special Account to build up their retirement savings. While this is an important issue, this matter should be reviewed only after we have effectively addressed the problem of SEPs defaulting on their Medisave contributions."

The individual hirer of a private home tutor, for example, will not be in a position to help the SEP make his Medisave contribution."

But CAYE will not be straightforward to roll out. We will have to work through implementation issues, such as the correct amount of Medisave contributions to deduct in each transaction."

Government Procurement Entities aim to start a pilot by 2020 which will allow us to work through the implementation issues for CAYE and help smoothen its subsequent implementation in the private sector. We will provide more details when ready. In the meantime, we welcome companies to continue their voluntary Medisave contributions for their SEPs."

To date, 15 of the 23 priority sectors have launched Skills Frameworks that support the sector's industry transformation. These Skills Frameworks provide key information on sector, career pathways, occupations/job roles, and the skills required for these occupations/job roles. They also list the training programmes that individuals or employers can tap. The information in these Skills Frameworks will be relevant to both employees, as well as SEPs in those sectors."

For example, the NTA, under the leadership of Mr Ang Hin Kee, saw that foundational digital skills, as well as familiarity with digital applications – such as Parking.sg and mobile payment apps – would benefit its members in their day-to-day work. They also knew the course schedule had to cater to taxi drivers' unique work schedules."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00832,2018-03-05-T-003,832,Josephine Teo,"NTA worked closely with one of the SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG)'s appointed training providers and SSG to customise the SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace programme for NTA members. SSG also provides course fee subsidies for the programme to keep the cost affordable for the drivers. If I understand correctly, they pay about $50 for each course."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00833,2018-03-05-T-003,833,Josephine Teo,SEP associations can strengthen support to help their members make their SEP careers more sustainable. The Government and the tripartite partners are keen to work with more SEP associations on this front.

They are the Tripartite Standard on Contracting with SEPs, which we just launched; the extension of voluntary mediation services by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management to cover SEPs; and the support of the tripartite partners for SEP associations to develop occupation-specific competency framework so that SEPs can remain relevant."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00839,2018-03-05-T-003,839,Josephine Teo,"Another three recommendations will be implemented in 2019 or 2020. They are to make available a Prolonged Medical Leave insurance (PML) product. To promote PML insurance coverage as a norm, starting with two occupational groups – sports coaches and instructors, as well as taxi and private hire care drivers. And to start a pilot programme where the Government, as a service buyer, will implement Contribute As You Earn (CAYE) for the Medisave obligations for its self-employed contractors."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00841,2018-03-05-T-003,841,Josephine Teo,The recommendation to introduce CAYE for other service buyers will require further study. The Government will focus on selected occupations where there are significant intermediaries or where there are large corporate service buyers we can work with.

In terms of full-time employment, we are ranked sixth, compared to 35 OECD countries."

In 2014, the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) was introduced. Employees who experience workplace harassment should seek help promptly, including for attacks on employees in cyberspace, as raised by Ms Thanaletchimi. They can report such incidents to MOM, as well as to Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), which Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin suggested. They can also seek civil remedies directly through the courts, or report serious cases to the Police."

Legislating mandatory reporting by employers, as suggested by Ms Thanaletchimi, will close off this avenue for such employees and discourage them from raising the matter with anyone. This is not helpful to them."

I think he did so during the debate on the Budget, and the study said that gender pay gap ""has remained at around 18% to 19%"" from 2006 to 2016. Unfortunately, the study did not make an apple-to-apple comparison as it included both full-time and part-time employed residents. More women than men worked part-time to meet their family and care-giving responsibilities and naturally earned less."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00861,2018-03-05-T-003,861,Josephine Teo,MOM's Comprehensive Labour Force Survey allows us to look at only full-time employed residents and compare salaries of men and women in similar occupational groups. The data shows that a gender pay gap of 11.8% in 2017 still exists. But this is a significant improvement from 20% 10 years ago. There was also broad-based improvement across most occupational groups.

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00863,2018-03-05-T-003,863,Josephine Teo,"The remaining pay gap can be attributed to the fact that women are more likely to exit the workforce, or have intermittent patterns of work, for reasons, such as childcare and sometimes caring for the elderly. If and when they return to the workforce, as a result, they also have to catch up with their male counterparts."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00865,2018-03-05-T-003,865,Josephine Teo,"The same reason probably explains why more men than women achieve retirement adequacy. In 2017, 66% of active male members and 53% of active female members turning 55 met their CPF Basic Retirement Sum (BRS). So, 66% for the active male CPF members, and 53% for the active female CPF members."

In 2007, the median retirement savings for women at age 55 were about 60% of median balances at age 55 for men. By 2017, 10 years on, this ratio has improved to 74%. And we expect the gap to further narrow over time."

This enhancement comes on top of the Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements launched last year which now covers some 250,000 employees. The Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs which I launched a few days ago during PMO’s COS debate; and, thirdly, the very significant expansion of pre-school places which the Government is fully committed to."

For the older cohorts of women who still did not manage to save enough for retirement, we have introduced a number of measures to help. In 2016, we made it easier for members to transfer CPF savings to their spouses’ account by lowering the minimum threshold they must meet, from the Full Retirement Sum to the Basic Retirement Sum."

Our CPF system serves Singaporeans well in supporting our three basic needs, namely, housing, healthcare and retirement. Today, six in 10 active CPF members turning age 55 have at least the Basic Retirement Sum in their Retirement Accounts. By 2020, we expect this proportion to increase to 70% and even more over time."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00883,2018-03-05-T-003,883,Josephine Teo,"To help CPF members save more for their retirement, we stepped up efforts to encourage members to top-up their own or their loved ones’ CPF accounts. In 2017, over 61,000 members received about $1 billion in cash top-ups to their Special or Retirement Accounts. In addition, over 35,000 members received about $1 billion in CPF transfers. Forty percent of these members who received cash top-ups, CPF transfers or both, had less than Basic Retirement Sum. In other words, these top-ups and transfers were very useful to them."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00885,2018-03-05-T-003,885,Josephine Teo,"We have also enhanced the Workfare Income Supplement and introduced Silver Support to provide additional retirement support to lower-income Singaporeans. Today, about 152,000 seniors qualify for Silver Support. They constitute about 30% of the population of seniors aged 65 and above. I am pleased to share with Members that about two-thirds of the Silver Support recipients are women. I think this shows very clearly that we are not averse to helping those who need more help and that, of course, includes women, especially those of the previous generation who did not have as much of a runway to build up their retirement savings."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00887,2018-03-05-T-003,887,Josephine Teo,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked if the pay-outs can be the same, regardless of flat types. Although all Silver Support recipients are already means tested, the degree of family support they enjoy is not the same. The purpose of Silver Support is to top-up and to help those who perhaps do not have as strong family support and also because they accumulated too little during their productive years. So, housing type is not a perfect proxy for family support, but it is an uncomplicated indicator. Singaporeans with exceptional circumstances can appeal to be eligible for Silver Support or to receive higher pay-outs. The appeals will be seriously considered."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00889,2018-03-05-T-003,889,Josephine Teo,"Since the scheme started in July 2016, about 10,000 appeals had been received. About half were approved because of the appellant's changed circumstances. This is why it is also not so meaningful to look only at those who drop out from Silver Support because there are also those who qualify. There are those who did not qualify in the past but then subsequently qualify. So, there are people who used to get it but no longer get it because the assessment is updated regularly and they no longer meet the eligibility criteria. But there are also people who did not meet the criteria in the past, but then subsequently were able to. The important thing is that about 30% of seniors above the age of 65 continue to receive Silver Support."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00891,2018-03-05-T-003,891,Josephine Teo,Mr Leon Perera asked about giving CPF members flexibility with their mandatory CPF contributions. I understand his point of view. But I should emphasise that the primary purpose of CPF is to save for our retirement.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00892,2018-03-05-T-003,892,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00893,2018-03-05-T-003,893,Josephine Teo,"Today, while the CPF system is enabling more Singaporeans to have adequate savings in retirement, there are still groups that we want to help build up retirement adequacy. For example, as pointed out by Members like Dr Intan Mokhtar and Mr Zainal Sapari, low-wage workers and older workers continue to need help."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00894,2018-03-05-T-003,894,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00895,2018-03-05-T-003,895,Josephine Teo,"Besides the schemes that I have described earlier, we have also tightened rules on CPF withdrawals for everyone, precisely to ensure that retirement savings continue to be steadily built up and are not depleted. For those who have built up substantial CPF savings, we are helping them grow those savings in better ways, which I will talk about later. It will, therefore, be incongruent with our current focus to start loosening up, whether in terms of the rules on withdrawal or contributions. Let us stay focused on the task at hand, safeguard and grow our CPF savings so that all Singaporeans can have better peace of mind in retirement, for as long as they live."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00896,2018-03-05-T-003,896,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00897,2018-03-05-T-003,897,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, Mr Zainal Sapari expressed concerns that some CPF members who invest through the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) might not fully understand the risks and costs involved. So their painstakingly built-up retirement savings may be lost."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00898,2018-03-05-T-003,898,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00899,2018-03-05-T-003,899,Josephine Teo,"Currently, there are two ways for members to grow their CPF savings. For those who have no appetite for risk, they can earn risk-free interest on their CPF savings. Those who have an appetite for risk may choose to invest their monies through CPFIS."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00900,2018-03-05-T-003,900,Josephine Teo,"However, a member who is willing to take risk may not have the knowledge to invest. Based on a poll commissioned on behalf of the CPF Advisory Panel in 2015, more than half of the CPFIS investors considered themselves to have ""limited"" investment knowledge but it did not prevent them from taking those investments."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00901,2018-03-05-T-003,901,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00902,2018-03-05-T-003,902,Josephine Teo,"CPF members should exercise caution when investing their CPF savings. Over a two-year period between October 2014 and September 2016, 29% of members who invested their Ordinary Account (OA) savings made cumulative total losses. Another 22% achieved cumulative profit that is less than or just equal to the OA interest rate of 2.5% per annum. In other words, slightly more than half of the members with a CPFIS-OA account did not do better through their own investments than if they simply left their CPF balances alone to earn a risk-free interest rate."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00904,2018-03-05-T-003,904,Josephine Teo,We have been studying the feasibility of a third option for this group of members and the scheme is called the Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS). This LRIS is targeted at CPF members who have an appetite for risk but neither the knowledge nor time to invest. We are aiming for something low cost. We want to take advantage of the longer time horizon available to CPF members to earn better upside investment gains.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00905,2018-03-05-T-003,905,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00906,2018-03-05-T-003,906,Josephine Teo,"Yet, the product should also provide some assurance against downside risks. Members can well imagine that such a scheme is not easy to design and will require further study. In the meantime, we will make three enhancements to better cater CPFIS to members with an appetite for risk, and have both the knowledge and time to invest."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00907,2018-03-05-T-003,907,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00908,2018-03-05-T-003,908,Josephine Teo,"First, we will introduce a self-awareness questionnaire (SAQ) that will be available to all CPF members. This questionnaire will provide feedback to the member on his level of basic financial knowledge and remind him of the different options available to him to grow his CPF savings, such as CPF interest rates or the upcoming LRIS."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00909,2018-03-05-T-003,909,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00910,2018-03-05-T-003,910,Josephine Teo,"But regardless of the feedback, members can still decide whether or not to invest through the CPFIS. The questionnaire will be part of the process of opening a CPFIS account from 1 October this year. Members who already have a CPFIS account are not required to take the questionnaire but are strongly encouraged to do so."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00911,2018-03-05-T-003,911,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00912,2018-03-05-T-003,912,Josephine Teo,"The second enhancement is to disallow sales charges for products that are offered under the CPFIS. Currently, financial advisors can receive a sales charge of up to 3% of the transacted amount when members use their CPF to purchase unit trusts and investment-linked insurance policies."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00913,2018-03-05-T-003,913,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00914,2018-03-05-T-003,914,Josephine Teo,"This sales charge has an unintended consequence that is detrimental to CPF members' interests. It encourages financial advisors to sell products to earn more commissions which causes the members to ""churn"" their investments. Buy sell, buy sell. Each time, there is a sales charge."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00915,2018-03-05-T-003,915,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00916,2018-03-05-T-003,916,Josephine Teo,"Our target group of CPFIS members will generally not need to rely heavily on financial advisors to decide which investment products to purchase. They can already directly buy unit trusts on online platforms, such as FundSupermart, Navigator and POEMS for zero sales charge. Therefore, the sales charge adds another layer of cost that reduces the member’s investment returns."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00917,2018-03-05-T-003,917,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00918,2018-03-05-T-003,918,Josephine Teo,By removing the sales charge financial advisors no longer have an incentive to push products. This also reduces the cost of investing for CPFIS members and will better align the investment behaviour to members who have time and knowledge.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00919,2018-03-05-T-003,919,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00920,2018-03-05-T-003,920,Josephine Teo,"The third enhancement is to reduce the maximum wrap fees charged for CPFIS investments such that wrap fees cover only the cost to maintain wrap accounts. For Members' information, currently, some CPF members set up a wrap account on investment platforms. Financial advisors can charge an annual wrap fee of up to 1% of the amount of funds that they manage in the wrap accounts. The wrap fee covers advisory services and the costs to maintain the wrap account."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00921,2018-03-05-T-003,921,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00922,2018-03-05-T-003,922,Josephine Teo,"We are not opposed to wrap accounts as they are generally considered to bring convenience to investors. Again, the targeted members for CPFIS are not expected to rely on advisory services that are usually included in the wrap fees."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00923,2018-03-05-T-003,923,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00924,2018-03-05-T-003,924,Josephine Teo,We will therefore lower the cap on annual wrap fees to 0.4% of the total amount managed. This is similar to the fees charged by online investment platforms in the cash market. We will review the cap on wrap fees from time to time as the investment landscape evolves.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00925,2018-03-05-T-003,925,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00926,2018-03-05-T-003,926,Josephine Teo,"We are mindful that these enhancements may affect the financial advisory industry which will no longer be able to impose the sales charge on new CPFIS investments and will have to charge only lower wrap fees on wrap accounts. However, we do not expect this impact to be too substantial."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00928,2018-03-05-T-003,928,Josephine Teo,"Currently, the Life Insurance Association estimates that about 15% of premiums from new insurance business came from CPFIS products while the remaining 85% of premiums came from the cash market. Nonetheless, to give the industry adequate time to adjust, we will implement these fee changes in two steps"

We are taking active steps to help Singaporeans move into better jobs and secure better employment outcomes, even as the economy restructures. The women in our workforce have made progress and will get more help to stay in employment. Our self-employed persons and CPF members will also enjoy better protection. MOM will continue to improve our schemes and programmes to ensure that we have an inclusive workforce and progressive workplaces. We have our work cut out for us and we look forward to Members' support."

The employment outcomes of our older workers have improved over the years. The employment rate of older residents aged 55 to 64 has increased from 64% in 2012 to 67% in 2017."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00945,2018-03-05-T-003,945,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00946,2018-03-05-T-003,946,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Our older worker employment rate is higher than countries such as Australia, Korea, the US and the UK. In fact, compared to the 35 OECD countries, Singapore would be ranked among the top 10."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00948,2018-03-05-T-003,948,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"The unemployment rate of older residents has also remained low at below 3% over the last five years. This is comparable to the overall unemployment rate. This means that the vast majority of older residents in the labour force who want to find a job, can find a job. And for those who need assistance to find a job, we will continue to help them through the Adapt and Grow initiative."

First, we raised the re-employment age from 65 to 67 in July 2017. We are heartened to see that both employers and workers have embraced the re-employment concept and our older workers have benefitted."

In the past, two younger employees were needed to transport linen to the laundromat. To do this, they have to push trolleys manually, carrying up to 100kg of linen, up a steep slope and across an open-air carpark. Because of her age, this was a task that Mdm Toh could not do. The hotel then decided to tap on WorkPro to introduce motorised trolleys and train older workers like Mdm Toh to operate them. As a result, Mdm Toh is now able to take on a new task previously too strenuous for her. This has also led to a wage increase for her."

This will also support the growing pool of older Singaporean workers."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-00974,2018-03-05-T-003,974,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Tripartite partners share these concerns too and have been working hard and taking measures to address them. We all agree that what we should all do is to work towards a workplace culture where our older workers feel valued, and companies think about the needs of older workers when they put in place policies and practices."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00975,2018-03-05-T-003,975,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"In fact, employers are recognising the benefits of having age-friendly and inclusive workplace practices. According to a 2016 survey by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), seven in 10 employers are willing to redesign job scopes to accommodate older workers. Still, there is room for improvement."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00976,2018-03-05-T-003,976,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"So, I am happy to say that the tripartite partners have developed a Tripartite Standard on Age-friendly Workplace Practices. This Tripartite Standard will promote inclusive workplaces that meet the specific needs of older workers. More details will be shared later, when the Standard is launched next month."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00977,2018-03-05-T-003,977,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"As we continue to encourage inclusive behaviour, we will also take action against discriminatory practices. Sir, there is no place for age discrimination in our workplaces."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00978,2018-03-05-T-003,978,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"To counter any age discrimination in our workplaces, TAFEP looks into all age-discrimination complaints. And MOM will not hesitate to take enforcement actions against errant employers who discriminate against older workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00979,2018-03-05-T-003,979,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Now, let me now talk about our support for low-wage workers. Sir, this Government pays particular attention to low-wage workers. We strive to uplift their wages, enhance their employment conditions, and improve their lives even as they work hard and make an honest living. We do this in two ways. First, through broad-based efforts and second, through additional support for specific sectors."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00980,2018-03-05-T-003,980,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Let me talk about the broad-based efforts. The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is a key pillar of our support for low-wage workers. As a permanent scheme, it helps low-wage workers build up their retirement savings and meet their daily needs as they work."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00981,2018-03-05-T-003,981,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Since WIS started in 2007, a total of $5.5 billion has been paid to about 830,000 recipients, of which, $3.7 billion went to their CPF, for their retirement; $1.8 billion was given to them in cash, to supplement their income."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00982,2018-03-05-T-003,982,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Besides supplementing their income, Workfare Training Support (WTS) gives them opportunities to up-skill and re-skill to improve their employability. Since 2010, more than 270,000 low-wage workers have tapped on WTS to upskill and reskill. And more than $280 million was used to support such training efforts."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00983,2018-03-05-T-003,983,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Zainal Sapari pointed out that some of our low-wage workers remain vulnerable and may face unfavourable working conditions. We fully share his concerns.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00984,2018-03-05-T-003,984,Sam Tan Chin Siong,MOM and CPF Board are aware of this. We have stepped up public education and enforcement efforts through the WorkRight initiative. WorkRight ensures that low-wage workers are aware of and not denied their employment rights.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00985,2018-03-05-T-003,985,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Today, eight in 10 employers inspected were found to have complied with the Employment Act and CPF Act. This is an increase from seven in 10 in 2012. So, we see a gradual improvement."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00986,2018-03-05-T-003,986,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"We take firm actions, including prosecution, against errant employers. Therefore, I urge Members to inform MOM if they come across workers who are denied their statutory employment rights."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00987,2018-03-05-T-003,987,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"For specific sectors, we also take a more targeted approach. In particular, the tripartite partners have implemented mandatory Progressive Wage Model (PWM) in the cleaning, security and landscaping sectors."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00988,2018-03-05-T-003,988,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Through the PWM, over 70,000 resident workers have benefited from better wages and better career progression. Real wage growth of workers in PWM sectors have exceeded resident median income growth for the past five years. Now, workers in these sectors also now have clear progression pathways that commensurate with their skills and competencies."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00989,2018-03-05-T-003,989,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Let me further share the progress in each of our PWM sectors in greater detail.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00990,2018-03-05-T-003,990,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"For the cleaning sector, the PWM was announced in 2012 and came into effect in 2014, and we have seen positive results over the years. From 2011 to 2016, the real median gross wages of full-time resident cleaners grew by about 5.7% per annum."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00991,2018-03-05-T-003,991,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"We enhanced the Cleaning PWM in December 2016 to increase their wages further. More than 41,000 cleaners can benefit from an increase in the PWM basic wages, between 3.4% and 4.6% per annum, for six years, from July 2017 onwards. And from 2020, cleaners will also enjoy a mandatory annual bonus equivalent to at least two weeks of monthly basic wages."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00992,2018-03-05-T-003,992,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Similarly, we have seen good progress for security officers. Since the PWM was launched in 2014 and implemented in 2016, the real median gross wage of full-time resident security guards grew by 6.4% per annum from 2011 to 2016."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00993,2018-03-05-T-003,993,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"The tripartite partners worked together to further enhance the security PWM in November 2017. Over 34,000 resident security officers can now look forward to higher PWM basic wage increases each year, between 4.1% and to 5.7%, for six years, from 1 January 2019."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00994,2018-03-05-T-003,994,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"To transform the industry, the tripartite partners took a decisive step to improve the working hours of our security officers. From 1 January 2021, MOM will no longer grant overtime exemption for the security industry. This will reduce their current overtime hours from as high as 95 hours a month, to not more than the statutory limit of 72 hours. And to become more manpower-lean and productive, the industry is committed to adopt greater use of technology."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00995,2018-03-05-T-003,995,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"And with these measures in place, workers will stand to benefit from having higher wages and shorter working hours. This is something that we really want to do for our security officers to modernise the industry and also to professionalise their career."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00996,2018-03-05-T-003,996,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Finally, for the landscape sector, the real median gross wage of full-time resident landscape maintenance workers has increased by 3% per annum from 2011 to 2016. And we continue to work on improving their wages and working conditions."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00997,2018-03-05-T-003,997,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"With the cleaning and security PWM enhanced in 2016 and 2017 respectively, the tripartite partners will review and enhance the landscape PWM this year. More details will be announced by the Tripartite Cluster for Landscape Industry (TCL) after tripartite negotiations have concluded."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00998,2018-03-05-T-003,998,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Sir, through tripartite efforts, both our broad-based measures and sectoral efforts have improved the lives of our low-wage workers. The wages and employment conditions for low-wage workers across the board have improved over time."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-00999,2018-03-05-T-003,999,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Over the past five years from 2012 to 2017, the real income growth at the 20th percentile of full-time employed citizens grew by 4.3% per annum, faster than at the median of 3.9% per annum. And for working hours, not only did their income increase, they also worked shorter hours. Resident low-wage workers worked fewer hours per week, from 49 hours in 2012 to 46 hours in 2017. On job security, there was also greater job security for low-wage workers. More workers were placed on permanent contracts and the number of casual on-call workers has decreased."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01000,2018-03-05-T-003,1000,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Even so, the work does not stop for us. In MOM, we will continue to work with the tripartite workers to support sustainable wage increases through the PWM and raise employment standards through best sourcing."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01001,2018-03-05-T-003,1001,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Given the good progress in the three PWM sectors, we want to see further adoption of PWM in other sectors. The PWM can benefit workers beyond low-wage workers, to other rank-and-file workers as well."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01002,2018-03-05-T-003,1002,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"As a start, lift firms and unions are working with BCA to introduce a voluntary PWM for lift technicians. This is especially useful with a growing demand for lift technicians in Singapore. MOM will support them in this effort. More details will be announced by the industry when ready."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01003,2018-03-05-T-003,1003,Sam Tan Chin Siong,MOM also stands ready to support tripartite partners to develop and adopt PWM voluntarily for other sectors.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01004,2018-03-05-T-003,1004,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Second, the Government will further safeguard the basic employment rights of outsourced workers in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors. Today, employment law criteria are already part of the professional accreditation and grading frameworks, for the cleaning and security sectors respectively. We will take a further step to introduce employment law criteria for the landscape sector."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01005,2018-03-05-T-003,1005,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Starting this year, the NParks will introduce employment law criteria in the Landscape Company Register (LCR). Going forward, employers in these three outsourced sectors stand to lose their eligibility to bid for Government contracts, if they contravene employment-related offences."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01006,2018-03-05-T-003,1006,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Additionally, from January 2019 onwards, the Government will only procure from companies with consistent track records in their employment and professional standards. We will require cleaning, security and landscape companies to have two consecutive accreditation status, good grading and LCR status respectively. More details will be shared with the respective industries in the coming weeks."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01007,2018-03-05-T-003,1007,Sam Tan Chin Siong,This means that companies in these three PWM sectors must treat their workers fairly in order to qualify for Government contracts.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01008,2018-03-05-T-003,1008,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Through this measure, the Government is taking the lead. The Labour Movement and the PWM tripartite committees led by Mr Zainal Sapari will urge more businesses to follow suit. Mr Zainal is the champion for low-wage workers. And I hope more businesses will heed the call and adopt similar best sourcing practices."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01009,2018-03-05-T-003,1009,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"The tripartite partners will also continue to find ways to improve the employment conditions of workers in these PWM sectors. To this end, the PWM tripartite committees should study further measures, such as Mr Zainal Sapari's proposal to mandate rest areas in these outsourced sectors."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01010,2018-03-05-T-003,1010,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mr Zainal has also asked to compel employers to pay for outpatient treatment for low-wage workers. However, our worry is this. By doing so may inadvertently affect the employability of workers with poorer health. So, this is the very group of vulnerable workers that tripartite workers are trying to help. We do not want to introduce something that may inadvertently create implications for them which will impact their employment opportunities."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01011,2018-03-05-T-003,1011,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Sir, let me recap our schemes. Under our CPF system, employers are already required to contribute to their employees' Medisave. At the same time, the Government makes additional Medisave contribution to low-wage workers via schemes such as WIS."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01012,2018-03-05-T-003,1012,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"And we have our 3Ms, meaning Medisave, MediShield Life and Medifund and other significant Government subsidies through schemes such as the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). No Singaporean will be denied access to healthcare because of their inability to pay."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01013,2018-03-05-T-003,1013,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mr Zainal also called for mandatory Annual Wage Supplement (AWS) for low-wage workers. Under our existing Flexible and Performance-based wage systems, a worker's total annual wage package is made up of three components  monthly fixed component; monthly variable component and annual variable component where the AWS is part of the annual variable component."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01014,2018-03-05-T-003,1014,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"This design of monthly fixed, monthly variable and annual variable components varies widely across industries, companies and even occupations. As such, the consensus of the tripartite partners is to give employers and unions the flexibility to negotiate their total annual wage package, including AWS, and not mandate the structure of the wage payments."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01015,2018-03-05-T-003,1015,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01016,2018-03-05-T-003,1016,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Sir, I have spoken about our efforts to support older workers and low-wage workers. Our initiatives will particularly help the group of older low-wage workers. For example, they receive higher WIS pay-outs and benefit more from the PWM."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01017,2018-03-05-T-003,1017,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Besides supporting older and low-wage workers, we should ensure that our workplaces are inclusive for all. Not only should we make every worker a better worker, every job a better job, we should also do our best to make every workplace a better workplace. A better and more inclusive workplace, has no room for discrimination, on account of gender, race or mental condition."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01018,2018-03-05-T-003,1018,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01019,2018-03-05-T-003,1019,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"And I thank Dr Intan, Mr Muhamad Faisal, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and Ms Tin Pei Ling for raising this point."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01020,2018-03-05-T-003,1020,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01021,2018-03-05-T-003,1021,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"To this end, all employers should embrace fair and merit-based employment as stipulated in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices. MOM will also take appropriate enforcement actions against employers found to have engaged in unfair employment practices. At the same time, we should make our workplace more accommodating towards persons with disabilities, as pointed out by Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01022,2018-03-05-T-003,1022,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01023,2018-03-05-T-003,1023,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"The Government support employers in this aspect. For example, the Open Door Programme (ODP) provides funding support to employers who hire persons with disabilities and re-design jobs for them."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01024,2018-03-05-T-003,1024,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01025,2018-03-05-T-003,1025,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mr Melvin Yong, Mr Kok Heng Leun and Mr Louis Ng asked about protections and measures in place for our migrant workforce, including electronic payment of salary, employment contract and recruitment practices. We are fully committed to protecting the well-being of our foreign workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01026,2018-03-05-T-003,1026,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01027,2018-03-05-T-003,1027,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"There are laws and policies for areas including salary payment and local employment agency fees. By law, foreign workers are to be issued the Key Employment Terms (KETs) within 14 days of arrival. The KETs state clearly the employment terms including working hours, leave benefits and the salary amount. It is an offence under our law for employers to reduce the salary from what is stated in the In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter without the worker’s written consent."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01028,2018-03-05-T-003,1028,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01029,2018-03-05-T-003,1029,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"To limit financial burden on workers, local employment agencies are also prohibited from charging foreign workers recruitment fees more than one month of their salary per year of service."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01030,2018-03-05-T-003,1030,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01031,2018-03-05-T-003,1031,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"We also ensure that foreign workers know their rights and responsibilities, and we assist them proactively when they need help. We work with our partners, for example, the Migrant Workers Centre (MWC), to educate both workers and employers on the benefits of salary e-payment. The MWC also assists foreign workers with valid salary claims to seek employment."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01032,2018-03-05-T-003,1032,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01033,2018-03-05-T-003,1033,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Finally, Mr Melvin Yong has spoken on Workplace Safety and Health. Ten years ago, we set ourselves a “WSH 2018” target of reducing the workplace fatality injury rate from 2.8 per 100,000 workers in 2008 to 1.8 by 2018. I am happy to report that we have made significant progress, thanks to efforts from tripartite partners, WSH professionals and workers. Our workplace fatality rate dropped to 1.2 last year. As mentioned by Minister Lim Swee Say just now, this is the lowest rate recorded for the whole workforce. But we should not be complacent. We are still lagging behind other countries with a workplace fatality rate of less than one."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01034,2018-03-05-T-003,1034,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01035,2018-03-05-T-003,1035,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"We can do more. Over the next 10 years, we must aspire to provide our workers with workplaces that are among the safest and healthiest in the world. To do so, we need new breakthroughs in our strategy. We should chart out a comprehensive plan for WSH development over the next 10 years. To do this, I am pleased to announce that we will convene a new WSH2028 Tripartite Strategy Committee or WSH2028 Committee in short."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01036,2018-03-05-T-003,1036,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01037,2018-03-05-T-003,1037,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"This Committee will comprise leaders from industry, unions and key players in the WSH landscape and it will consult widely in the course of its work. It will be chaired by Mr John Ng, CEO of Singapore LNG Corporation, who is also a WSH Council member."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01038,2018-03-05-T-003,1038,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01039,2018-03-05-T-003,1039,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Mr Melvin Yong has given good ideas on how to improve our WSH programmes, such as near-miss reporting, WSH representatives in companies and many others. The WSH2028 Committee will study all these suggestions."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01040,2018-03-05-T-003,1040,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01041,2018-03-05-T-003,1041,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"While the WSH2028 Committee will formulate specific recommendations, I will now want to take this opportunity to sketch out broad areas that the Committee will look in."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01042,2018-03-05-T-003,1042,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01043,2018-03-05-T-003,1043,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"First, we will find ways to strengthen WSH ownership among companies and workers. This means being self-motivated to improve WSH. The Committee will study how we can influence everyone from C-suite executives to rank-and-file workers to being more committed to WSH."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01044,2018-03-05-T-003,1044,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01045,2018-03-05-T-003,1045,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Second, we should increase integration of workplace safety with workplace health as part of the Total WSH. Improving both workplace safety and workplace health is important because they reinforce each other. We will study further ways to help companies detect and reduce both safety and health risks."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01046,2018-03-05-T-003,1046,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01047,2018-03-05-T-003,1047,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Third, we need to deepen WSH capabilities of companies and workers, such as by raising competencies of WSH professionals and improving quality of WSH training providers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01048,2018-03-05-T-003,1048,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01049,2018-03-05-T-003,1049,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Fourth, we want to strengthen partnerships with different stakeholders to promote and reinforce positive WSH behaviour. This includes having insurers price premiums more accurately based on claims history by companies and technology companies providing solutions to detect risky work situations. Hospitals reintegrating injured workers as part of the Return-to-Work programme."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01050,2018-03-05-T-003,1050,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01051,2018-03-05-T-003,1051,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Lastly, the Committee will review the regulatory regime to ensure that it remains effective without excessive burden on compliant companies. The Committee will consider ideas such as differentiating our enforcement approach based on firms’ or companies' past track records. The WSH2028 Committee will start work in April and intends to complete its report in a year’s time."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01052,2018-03-05-T-003,1052,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01053,2018-03-05-T-003,1053,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"In conclusion, Mr Chairman, I have outlined the key efforts of MOM in supporting older and low-wage workers, and promoting inclusive, safe and healthy workplaces. Through our tripartite efforts, we have made encouraging progress in these areas plus as we always say we are not satisfied with what the progress has been and we always look for new areas for improvements."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01054,2018-03-05-T-003,1054,Sam Tan Chin Siong,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01055,2018-03-05-T-003,1055,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"So, we will press on with our efforts to make Singapore a great workplace for our workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01056,2018-03-05-T-003,1056,,Clarifications? Mr Kok Heng Leun.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01057,2018-03-05-T-003,1057,Kok Heng Leun,"I would like to thank the Second Minister for the reply on the SEPs. I am glad to hear that MOM is looking for the insurance for prolonged medical leave. I would like to speak on behalf of a lot of the dance community who goes to school and Community Centres to teach. They are quite a lot of times susceptible to injuries. So, I hope that this group can be included in it."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01058,2018-03-05-T-003,1058,Kok Heng Leun,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01059,2018-03-05-T-003,1059,Kok Heng Leun,"Secondly, also the stage technicians who would work both indoors and outdoors in events. There is a lot of possibility of casualties during the process. And I hope that it can also be included."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01060,2018-03-05-T-003,1060,Kok Heng Leun,

Previously, with regards to my questions, the Ministry had agreed to check on how the Koreans have been recruiting the foreign workers. I would like to have an update on whether that was followed through, and if so, what was the outcome?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01062,2018-03-05-T-003,1062,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, I would like to thank the Member for sharing his concerns about the dance community as well as the stage technicians. We will certainly be very keen to get in touch with the associations that they belong to and to explore ways in which we can promote the adoption of long medical leave insurance as a norm for their occupation."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01063,2018-03-05-T-003,1063,Sam Tan Chin Siong,"I thank the Member for his enquiry on the status of South Korea's recruitment system. MOM has studied the South Korean system. Essentially, under the South Korean model, the Government becomes the Employment Agent for foreign workers. Based on our experience, I do not think this will be practical for the Singapore situation. We have far greater proportion of foreign workers in Singapore. One third or 1.1 million of our workers are foreign workers."

After very thorough studies, we do not think the South Korean model is something that can be adopted in Singapore effectively."

Under the South Korean system, the Government can do something to protect the interest of the foreign workers in South Korea, it does not have the jurisdictions to do something at the source country."

We ask them to pay attention on the treatment to their foreign workers within their own source country."

Secondly, whether the agencies like e2i and WDA, would focus more on service of this long-term unemployed workers who seek help because there was feedback that they had visited these agencies for several times but remain unemployed."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01077,2018-03-05-T-003,1077,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, the long-term unemployed includes those who are PMETs as well as Rank-and-File. They are also of various age groups. To Mr Low's question about whether they get help from WSG as well as NTUC e2i, the answer is yes. I shared that last year we helped 6,600 of them. For those persons who are helped, I think the help to them was real and not imagined. As for profile in other sense, I am not sure exactly, what Mr Low is seeking but if he lets me know, we will try and find out and share with him."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01078,2018-03-05-T-003,1078,Ang Hin Kee,"A question for the Second Minister. We are, of course, concerned that many aspiring young people want to be freelancers, especially those, who want to be private hired drivers or taxi drivers. But moving forward with the advent of things like autonomous vehicles, there may be a danger that some of them may enter into a career whereby they may be misplaced."

They include those that he highlighted such as media freelancers. They also include people who have taken up work like private hire car driving."

If they are doing it as a primary livelihood, then we are of course more interested in whether this is their preferred model of work. If they are doing it as a secondary form of employment, it is something that they decided to take on to earn an additional stream of income, we do not have any issues with that."

So, this is something that we can follow up on."

This is why we have very comprehensive legislation to protect the workers' rights. The Minister has mentioned earlier in his speech about making an amendment to the Employment Act. We also have a slew of many other programmes like Adapt and Grow, PCP, CSP, WIS and all that. The sole purpose is to provide a wide range of programmes and assistance to help our local workers to adapt and grow, and then also to develop, so that they will be able to secure a better job security and employment prospect. I share totally with Mr Low's point that local workers are always the core interest of the Government."

Otherwise, the ideal situation described by Minister Lim Swee Say of ""two-third plus one-third, is greater than one"" would not happen. If we treat our local workers better than foreign workers, then we will see the situation of ""two-third plus one-third is less than one"". This is not the situation that we would like to see."

At the Second Reading of the Employment Claims Bill in August 2016, I suggested to the Ministry that we have one tribunal to handle salary claims, unfair dismissal as well as discrimination. So I am happy to hear and I welcome Minister's announcement that we are going to have a one-stop Dispute Resolution Centre to handle salary claims and unfair dismissal."

The Minister of State Sam Tan correctly mentioned just now that MOM looks into cases of complaints of discrimination against, for example, older workers."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01094,2018-03-05-T-003,1094,Lim Swee Say,"Mr Chairman, basically the disputes provided for under the Employment Act are what MOM can handle. When Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) was set up, it was set up to handle only salary-related claims. Even so, the tripartite partners decided that we will go on voluntary mediation for disputes which are not salary related. In other words, we currently do not have the legal rights to mediate non-salary related claims, but we did it on the basis whereby we asked the employers/employees are they prepared to do so on a voluntary basis."

For those wrongful dismissal disputes which are covered under EA, they will all be transferred to the ECT, so that is the next step. All salary-related and wrongful dismissal disputes, which were covered under the Employment Act, will now be transferred to ECT entirely."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-01101,2018-03-05-T-003,1101,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Mr Chairman, Minister Teo had shared with regard to the comprehensive Labour Force Survey that was done regarding the gender pay gap. Could I ask a clarification  it is troubling to hear that there is still an 11.8% gap, although there has been improvements. But the Minister did share that some of the causes were relating to women stepping out of the workforce and then returning to the workforce. I do hope that MOM will work with the employers, if they are returning back to the workforce and they are doing value of the job, and they do have the competencies for the job, they should not be penalised. They should be paid the same value of that job, and it should be performance-based rather than how long you have been in the job or whether you have taken time out of the workforce."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01102,2018-03-05-T-003,1102,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, I thank the Member, Ms Jessica Tan, for giving me an opportunity to say a little bit more about how we look at the data. I asked to look at the data within the public sector and it was quite interesting. For a particular scheme of service, in fact, the median pay of the female officers was higher than the males. So, I wondered why. And as it turns out, the composition of the females and the males in the workforce also matters a great deal. It turns out that the nature of the work performed by females in the public sector lends themselves to earning higher pay."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01103,2018-03-05-T-003,1103,Josephine Teo,
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01104,2018-03-05-T-003,1104,Josephine Teo,"What I would say is this  when we look at the gender pay gap, whether it is numbers compiled by ValuePenguin or whether it is even based on our comprehensive Labour Force Survey, we should not take it at face value. The fact that more women might have exited the workforce and, as a result, in terms of cumulative length of service, is perhaps not as high, that contribute to the gender pay gap. Composition of the male workforce and the female workforce, and what kinds of work is being done, also matter."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-01106,2018-03-05-T-003,1106,Josephine Teo,"If we dug deeper and looked at the gender pay gap within occupations, and then controlled for years of service, I half suspect that the gap is not going to look as high as it does. But having said that, putting all of those things aside, it is still the right thing to do for us to enable as many women as possible to stay in the workforce, give them a chance to grow their careers, and not to have to choose between family and work. That is the right thing to do to enable them to fulfil all of their aspirations for work and family, and we will press on to do that."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-01108,2018-03-05-T-003,1108,Josephine Teo,"Also, if you look at the whole slew of measures that can be taken, by far, the one that perhaps will make the most difference is the availability of flexible work arrangements because the reality of their lives are that, at home, there will still be responsibilities to be shared. Even if they have a spouse, a partner, who is willing and able to chip in, very often, exigencies require them to take time out. How do we best enable persons with care-giving responsibilities, not just women, to remain active in the workforce? That must be the thrust of our efforts."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01109,2018-03-05-T-003,1109,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"Mr Chairman, I would like to address this to the Second Minister. My question is similar to the hon Member Ms Jessica Tan; it is about the gender pay gap. It is heartening to know that, if you look at the public sector, the gap is probably not as much as 11.8% that the Minister shared earlier. But are there plans to address this gender pay gap and further reduce it, especially in the private sector and especially those in the senior management positions. Because I shared the data in my speech earlier that, specifically, for those who are earning more than $11,000 a month, the number of male employees is twice that of female employees? If we can try and reduce, bring that difference further in the senior management positions that would be good."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01110,2018-03-05-T-003,1110,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, as I had explained, it is not entirely clear to me that there are, in fact, very significant gender pay gaps, after you have controlled for occupation and for years of service. The best thing that we can do is go back to what will enable the women to make progress in their careers, which is not to exit and the way in which to do it is to make flexible work arrangements available to them."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-01112,2018-03-05-T-003,1112,Josephine Teo,"I should just make a small point. I looked at the public sector data and it was quite interesting. Certainly, among the super-scale officers, there is no difference between the male and female officers. For the other grades, as I had mentioned, sometimes it has to do with the composition, what kinds of work they are doing. I hope that addresses the Member's question."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-01115,2018-03-05-T-003,1115,K Thanaletchimi,"The second question is on workplace abuse and harassment. I just wish to know Second Minister Josephine Teo's take on what she feels about having a Tripartite Standards of managing workplace abuse and harassment rather than having it subsumed under the Grievance Handling or Grievance Management Tripartite Standards. This is to give more clarity to employers on how exactly to manage situations like that, rather than making it more a general statement under the Grievance Handling Tripartite Standards."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01116,2018-03-05-T-003,1116,Lim Swee Say,"Mr Chairman, my answer is a quick one. For CTP, funding support is only for the private sector organisations, not for public sector."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01117,2018-03-05-T-003,1117,K Thanaletchimi,That means does it apply to the healthcare sector because it is like quasi-government.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01118,2018-03-05-T-003,1118,Lim Swee Say,"The healthcare sector, I think, for the hospitals, you are not considered Government, right?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01119,2018-03-05-T-003,1119,K Thanaletchimi,It is quasi.
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01120,2018-03-05-T-003,1120,Lim Swee Say,"Exactly. So long as you are a private sector organisation, you can apply."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01121,2018-03-05-T-003,1121,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, I have to address Ms Thanaletchimi's question. I should say that these interventions can evolve over time. We will take the suggestion and we will look at it. If there is a good reason for us to have a separate Tripartite Standard, yes, I think so, but let us take a look at it."

But I cannot imagine why in the private sector, the employers would not figure that they should reward according to talent. If there are specific instances where someone has been discriminated against, I will be very interested to find out."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-01126,2018-03-05-T-003,1126,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"I have two clarifications. Regarding her statement that Silver Support pay-outs using flat sizes is an uncomplicated way to measure household support, that is reasonable. The first question is I am wondering whether the cutting up of the pay-outs in the four tiers, 1- and 2-room flats is $750 and all the way to 5-room flats, it becomes $300. Is this too fine a banding, and creating, therefore, a kind of complicated picture of household support that is much more complicated than what is on the ground?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01127,2018-03-05-T-003,1127,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"For one, 1-room and 2-room flats can be combined with 3-room flats. I think a lot of seniors who are caught up in that kind of situation where they need our support from Silver Support. Living in those flats would be quite similar."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-01129,2018-03-05-T-003,1129,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"The second question that I have is regarding the appeal process. The Second Minister said that it is an uncomplicated measure, yes. But there could be complicated life situations that the seniors face due to support issues from household members. They might be living in 5-room flats and they might be making an appeal for eligibility. Could they also make an appeal in terms of the quantum?"
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01130,2018-03-05-T-003,1130,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, the answer to the latter question is, yes, they can appeal for either the quantum or eligibility. Both types of appeals are seriously looked into. I accept the fact that regardless of housing type, people can have complicated family arrangements. There have cases where we have reviewed and drawn the conclusion that they are worthy of higher support from the Silver Support. So, that can be done."

I thought I should also respond to Minister's shoelace story to share with Members of this House that if you do see a wild animal, it is best not to run. Best to stay still."
2018-03-05-T-003-S-01138,2018-03-05-T-003,1138,Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, to the question on Maternity Protection, our women should feel secure that they can remain in work even when they get pregnant. Our laws provide sufficient protection against dismissal during pregnancy as well as Maternity Leave. We do get referrals to look into cases and we will take the errant employers to task. If Mr Louis Ng is aware of specific cases, we will certainly look into them."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-01140,2018-03-05-T-003,1140,Josephine Teo,"It does not always require for us to sign on the ILO's Convention. We are party to the declaration that the ILO has and we have very long standing partnership with the ILO. But all of the ILO Conventions are very binary in nature. You sign on to one Convention you must accept every single clause that is specified in the Convention. The difficulty is that, sometimes, we are party to other treaties or agreements that would make it very difficult for us to adhere so strictly to all of the items specified. As a country that values very strongly our commitment whenever we sign on these international conventions, we do not take them lightly."

2018-03-05-T-003-S-01142,2018-03-05-T-003,1142,Josephine Teo,But let me assure the Member that the laws in Singapore already provide adequate protection to women who become pregnant as well as when they are on Maternity Leave.

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01161,2018-03-05-T-004,1161,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Mr Chairman, I beg to move, ""That the total sum to be allocated for Head K of the Estimates be reduced by $100""."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01162,2018-03-05-T-004,1162,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Sir, I want to first thank the educators, families and students who have given me input on what they think are important to the future of education in Singapore."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01163,2018-03-05-T-004,1163,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"On changes gone right, the most significant move that MOE has made in recent years is its bold decision to rope in SkillsFuture and adopt developing the capabilities of adult learners under its belt. Institutions of Higher Learning (IHLs) are now chartered to embark on aggressive continued education and skills training for the adult workforce. The messaging and measures by the two Education Ministers on skills mastery, applied learning and broader school and IHL admission criteria, are necessary in a landscape that has over-indulged in the academic paper chase."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01164,2018-03-05-T-004,1164,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"However, Sir, the relentless changes to the education and employment landscapes remain. Technology and product and service life cycles and shelf lives get shorter. Anything that can be repeated and learnt by machines will be replaced by machines. Futurists such as Ray Kurzweil predict that soon, a computer that cost US$1,000 will possess the cognitive capability of a human being by 2029."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01165,2018-03-05-T-004,1165,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"On key education trends  the writing is on the wall. Just as in business, rapid changes are sweeping through the education landscape. Google ""key education trends"" and you will find at least 90% of the search results reflect key trends in the realm of technology − virtual reality, augmented reality even mixed reality, cloud technology, learning analytics, coding and the Internet of Things (IoT). Other trends include the move from Pedagogy (child-focused teaching approaches), to Andragogy (the study of teaching adults), to Heutagogy (self-directed learning); and from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math), to develop critical thinking and more creative approaches to problem solving. I would like to seek the Ministers' responses to my following questions."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01166,2018-03-05-T-004,1166,Denise Phua Lay Peng,How has MOE kept pace with these new education trends that are the outcome of rapid technological and economic disruptions?
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01167,2018-03-05-T-004,1167,Denise Phua Lay Peng,How has the work of the Council for Future Economy and Industry Transformation Maps affect the shape of education for students and educators?
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01168,2018-03-05-T-004,1168,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"The 21st Century Competency Model drawn up by MOE has been developed quite some time ago, more than a decade. When was the last time this has been reviewed and how do the prevailing work by the Future Economy Council and Smart Nation changed the curriculum creation, development and assessment in schools and IHLs?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01169,2018-03-05-T-004,1169,Denise Phua Lay Peng,What is the state of the SkillsFuture movement and what else can be done to urge Singaporeans to take even greater ownership and action to be ready for further disruptions in the labour market?
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01170,2018-03-05-T-004,1170,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"As all of the IHLs aggressively embark on CET, directed by MOE, the potential overlapping and unnecessary competition are bound to emerge. How will MOE prevent this and instead enhance the synergy that can arise?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01171,2018-03-05-T-004,1171,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Would Government even consider renaming the MOE as the Ministry for Life-Long Learning to put the emphasis on lifelong and self-directed learning and remove barriers to learning for all citizens?
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01172,2018-03-05-T-004,1172,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"On the role of educators in the future world  the pervasiveness of mobile device such as smartphones, smart-watches and tablets has already overtaken desktop browsing. M-learning, instead of e-learning, enables learners to access content even more freely. Educators will need the technical and pedagogical support to integrate M-learning in their curricula."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01173,2018-03-05-T-004,1173,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"As a consultant told me, the role of educators is to think carefully now about the things that they typically do."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01174,2018-03-05-T-004,1174,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Can Minister update this house on how aware and prepared are our educators in their changing role in this new world of education? What proportion of them are still in the mode of repeating lectures or rehearsing for high-stake exams? How have we equipped our educators to take on the role of designers of quality learning experiences, curators of content available online, creators of content and coaches of their students in matters of life?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01175,2018-03-05-T-004,1175,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Should there be an Industry Transformation Map as well for the educators to build the capability and deep skills of educators to keep pace with the needs of 21st century learners? How do educators of the future address skills deficits in the workforce and if that is getting increasingly unpredictable, how do we prepare the students to acquire more learning agility to face the future?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01176,2018-03-05-T-004,1176,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"On equal access to opportunities for all students  much has been spoken at last week's Budget debate on inequality and/or inequity amongst citizens from low-income households versus others who are more affluent. Whilst it is true that it is hard to ensure equality in life outcomes, it is certainly possible for Government to do even more to ensure equal access to opportunities in learning and exposures that will further one's future-readiness."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01177,2018-03-05-T-004,1177,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"The money and meals provided in the EduSave and Meals programme in Budget 2018 are appreciated. But we need to also update and articulate the changing nature of the gaps in today's setting. Holiday and/or enrichment programmes of children from more affluent backgrounds, for instance, have now moved from speech, drama and music lessons to the 21st century's coding, robotics, 3-D printing bootcamps and the like."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01178,2018-03-05-T-004,1178,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"A concern that has been raised globally is that of Digital Equity. As mobile devices become the gateways to learning and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) programmes allow students to use their own devices in a classroom, there must be found a way by which learners from all socio-economic backgrounds have access to learning devices in schools up to IHLs. Can MOE please provide an update on what has been done in this aspect of digital equity?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01179,2018-03-05-T-004,1179,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"On existing hot-button issues such as over-emphasis on high-stake exams and tuition  and what of the existing hot-buttons of over-emphasis on high-stake exams and the tuition syndrome? It is not uncommon to tease parents whose children are taking the PSLE, that they themselves are also taking the PSLE. It is not uncommon to still hear parents who are highly anxious and highly strung as they report that their children are taking the GCEs. The tuition industry is still a booming industry because doing well in high-stakes exams is still the ultimate aim of many parents and teachers of especially Primary school and Secondary school education."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01180,2018-03-05-T-004,1180,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Teachers also have learnt to ""teach to test"". I know of a young girl who is talented in singing and speech and drama but who is taking an Electrical Engineering Course in the ITE. She achieved a score of 14 in her N(A) exams with 2As and 4Bs but only qualify for the DPP which does not have any options in Performing or Creative Arts in the ITE or the Polytechnic. She will spend her next two years in an engineering course in the hope that she can obtain a Higher-NITEC certificate so that she can apply for Laselle or NAFA. She would have qualified, her mum says, if she had done better in her academics."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01181,2018-03-05-T-004,1181,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Her mother wrote to me, ""Ms Phua, I am sharing this, in the hope that it serves as an opportunity, to point our education system to areas where we can do differently, to better cater to a wider spectrum of needs, as the time and tide has changed. Although MOE has acknowledged Howard Gardner's work on multiple intelligences, our school system still leans toward our traditional definition of academic excellence""."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01182,2018-03-05-T-004,1182,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"If we have improved in dealing with these hot buttons, why do many parents and students still fret incessantly over them? Could it be that it is insufficient to simply tweak the system through changes such as PSLE banding instead of T-scores, by allowing subject combinations instead of removing the labels of Express, NA and NT and Special Schools? Are we merely re-arranging the chairs on the deck and not making deep enough changes? In this age of disruptions, do we dare proactively disrupt our current education systems by slaying some of the sacred cows that we inherited from the proverbial third Industrial Revolution when we are already in the fourth?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01183,2018-03-05-T-004,1183,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"One sacred cow is of course the PSLE, a practice we have inherited for decades. I have many times in this House shared on how we need to remove this structural thorn in the flesh of the system. There are highly respected education systems globally which do not sort students at the age of 12. I recall what a very dedicated MOE mainstream educator told me, and I quote, ""Ms Phua, I know there are a lot of things to consider before we can abolish PSLE. But the fact of the matter is − if you ask a teacher if he or she would teach a differently in a class if there is no PSLE, I am quite sure the answer is a yes. There is just not enough time and room to develop the skills they need to survive in the future world – skills like creativity, flexibility, 21st century competencies that MOE has been advocating. We need more time to look into non-examinable subjects such as inquiry, discovering and development of strengths of our students""."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01184,2018-03-05-T-004,1184,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Last year, at the COS, I spoke about Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, and his partner's intent to start the YunGu School − a 15-year through train system up to high school. I do not believe my reference was acknowledged or addressed. I had been stalking the online media of YunGu School and it has been inspiring so far − with a strong values base and a good balance in IT, other STEAM subjects. I have the great confidence that Singapore can design an even more superior localised model. Do we dare pilot a through-train school of the future and if good enough, scale it?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01185,2018-03-05-T-004,1185,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Past designers of the Singapore education system have often prided themselves in taking an evolutionary instead of a revolutionary approach. But in a time such as this, we must have the dare to go beyond tweaking our school system or we will end up taking one step forward and two steps backward in preparing an education model that befits the future."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01186,2018-03-05-T-004,1186,Denise Phua Lay Peng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01187,2018-03-05-T-004,1187,Zainal Sapari,"Mr Chairman, the future of our children depends on what we are willing to do for education today. We want to prepare our students to lead productive and successful lives once they leave the education system and enter the realm of working life. Given the rapid changes around us, we may not know exactly what lies ahead for our students in the future, and at best, we can only try to ascertain what skillset they might need by looking at current trends. Our graduating students must compete in an increasingly borderless world for the best jobs, and hence, they will need to be nimble, flexible and dynamic, and ready to recognise and respond swiftly to emerging trends that call for new solutions − many of which moved into attempts into technological innovation."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01188,2018-03-05-T-004,1188,Zainal Sapari,The students of today are adept at incorporating new technologies into their lives. I believe that we should tap into these new inclinations of our students and imbibe skills which would continue to make our labour force competitive to employers.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01189,2018-03-05-T-004,1189,Zainal Sapari,I would like to ask the Minister what are some of the fundamental shifts in pedagogy and curriculum is MOE looking into to prepare our students for the future? Because I believe Education is the key for us to be ready for the future.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01190,2018-03-05-T-004,1190,Zainal Sapari,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01191,2018-03-05-T-004,1191,Foo Mee Har,"Chairman, there is much to admire about the Singapore education system. Singaporean students consistently achieve top rankings in various international benchmarking exercises such as the PISA test in Maths, Science and Reading. Yet, it is just as common to hear dissatisfaction from many quarters, about this supposedly high-achieving education system of producing stressed-out, book-smart and exam-focused students, who can do with more creativity, life skills, critical thinking and interpersonal skills. Parents often feel trapped, together with their kids, in a desperate six-year race to safeguard their children's destinies by the tender age of 12 years old."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01192,2018-03-05-T-004,1192,Foo Mee Har,"Policy makers have acknowledged the need for change. Steps are being taken to adjust the PSLE system, provide multiple pathways and applied learning in schools, internships and aptitude-based admissions to Institutes of Higher Learning. However, so far steps taken are merely incremental. The question is, what more needs to be done to keep Singapore ahead of the game in a new era of global talent?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01193,2018-03-05-T-004,1193,Foo Mee Har,"With Industry 4.0, we need to move faster and bolder, and continue to make education a strategic advantage to stay ahead globally. The successful reinvention of our educational system depends on transforming pedagogy and redesigning learning tasks. How can we spend less time in high-stake exams preparations and more time in the joy of learning? How can we spend less time memorising facts and concepts and more time applying these to solve real-life problems? How can we nurture creative thinking, manage complex problems through collaboration and expose our students to a diversity of cultures, languages and practices in order to prepare them to be truly global citizens?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01194,2018-03-05-T-004,1194,Foo Mee Har,"I believe our education system may prove to be Singapore's greatest strategic asset. We are blessed with highly-engaged parents, well-trained educators, and generously-funded education institutions. We are well-poised to take the lead and make the necessary transformations to position Singaporeans strongly in the new economy, by making education a key pillar of our economic transformation efforts."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01195,2018-03-05-T-004,1195,Foo Mee Har,"Chairman, I would like to ask the Minister, what steps MOE is taking to transform our education system to strongly position our future generations for Industry 4.0?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01196,2018-03-05-T-004,1196,Foo Mee Har,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01197,2018-03-05-T-004,1197,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"Chairman, there are much needed and significant moves in the pre-school sector which have placed greater importance on quality early childhood education for our children. More anchor operators and partner operators have been approved, MOE has come on-board pre-school education with the setting up of MOE Kindergartens and the Government is setting up the National Institute of Early Development (NIEC)."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01198,2018-03-05-T-004,1198,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"With these moves, there is also a need to raise the quality of early childhood educators. While the NIEC will help to set benchmarks for standards of teaching and learning in the early childhood sector, early childhood educators must also be convinced that their professions are valued."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01199,2018-03-05-T-004,1199,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"First, salaries for early childhood educators must increase and be made comparable to that of professionals from other sectors. Second, career pathways need to be made clear and attainable for early childhood educators who seek to pursue pre-school teaching as a career. Third, sufficient recognition, rewards and incentives must also be made available for pre-school educators, similar to how such recognition, rewards and incentives are available to mainstream Primary and Secondary school teachers. In addition, there ought to be opportunities for pre-school educators to be seconded to lower Primary school levels, such as Primary 1 and 2, and vice versa."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01200,2018-03-05-T-004,1200,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"We could probably pilot this with our MOE Kindergarten teachers first. This experience will help both our pre-school and lower Primary school educators better understand the transition required of our students as they progress from pre-school to Primary school. This will facilitate the planning of programmes as well as teaching and learning strategies at both the pre-school and lower Primary school levels, that can help make the transition easier for our children. On top of that, it will also help our educators identify children who may be facing learning challenges to be identified earlier and proper intervention can then be rendered."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01201,2018-03-05-T-004,1201,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"I would propose for faculty members of NIEC to not just be academics with little or no experience in the early childhood sector or in teaching. While theoretical and academic underpinnings are important, practical and grounded experience are equally important, if not more, particularly in dealing with young children and impressionable minds. I would propose for faculty members of NIEC to be appointed from among senior and experienced early childhood practitioners as well as academics from the sector. I would also propose for NIEC to consider running programmes that can equip stay-at-home mothers or fathers and grandparents or retirees with the requisite knowledge and skills to be caregivers to young children, whether to fulfil familial responsibilities or as a career option. Sufficient support and a conducive learning environment at home is equally important in providing quality early childhood education and development for our children."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01202,2018-03-05-T-004,1202,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"While we strive to close the gaps in the provision of early childhood education in our pre-schools, we also need to help parents and grandparents create the same supportive and conducive environment at home for our children that can facilitate their learning and growth."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01203,2018-03-05-T-004,1203,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"For the stay-at-home mothers or fathers and retirees who are trained as caregivers to young children, they can also be considered as teaching assistants or edu-carers in our MOE kindergartens or other pre-school centres, to support our pre-school educators."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01204,2018-03-05-T-004,1204,Intan Azura Mokhtar,

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01206,2018-03-05-T-004,1206,Seah Kian Peng,"Similarly, in 2013, then-Minister for Education envisaged what every Singapore child should achieve in 10 years of basic education, where deliberate shifts are made away from academic grades towards providing opportunities for students through diverse and real-world learning experiences to discover their interests and talents, develop life skills, and find joy in learning because if the real world when they grow up is going to get more VUCA, then all the rigours in academia will not save them."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01207,2018-03-05-T-004,1207,Seah Kian Peng,A 2015 survey done jointly by The Straits Times and research company Nexus Link found a staggering seven in 10 parents of children from pre-school to Secondary levels sending them to tuition classes.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01208,2018-03-05-T-004,1208,Seah Kian Peng,"All in all, they spent $1.1 billion a year on tuition, according to the national Household Expenditure Survey released in 2014. I am sure this number would be even higher now."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01209,2018-03-05-T-004,1209,Seah Kian Peng,"So, I wish to ask the Minister to  Firstly, provide an update on the Ministry's efforts to set students on a holistic learning trajectory, and how they are bearing fruit, as a mid-point check. Secondly, review tuition cost expenditures, which disadvantages and pressurises students of lower socio-economic backgrounds. And, finally, take the lead and provide solid data that there is no link between tuition and better performance, to dispel the herd mentality of many parents."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01211,2018-03-05-T-004,1211,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, the topics on building an innovative workforce and caring society have been discussed extensively in this House over the years. Many Members have proposed and suggested measures and steps to be taken to achieve these two objectives."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01212,2018-03-05-T-004,1212,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, in order for our society to strive towards these goals, it is vital to create a system as well as ambience that allows and, more importantly, facilitates individuals to realise and maximise their potentials."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01213,2018-03-05-T-004,1213,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,One of the most effective ways to do so is through our education system. I would like to repeat my call to introduce the teaching psychology in our Secondary school which I have made twice in this Chamber.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01214,2018-03-05-T-004,1214,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Psychology, in its broadest term, is the study of the human mind and behaviour. It has many disciplines – personality, cognitive behaviour, social perception, to name some."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01215,2018-03-05-T-004,1215,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Individuals who have acquired a knowledge of psychology will most likely be able to recognise their own strengths and weaknesses and also of those people around them. By knowing personal strengths and weaknesses, individuals will be better equipped to work on maximising their potential, and this will result in a boosted self-esteem and confidence. Naturally, the persons who are motivated will be the ones who try to innovate and think out of the box."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01216,2018-03-05-T-004,1216,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Being aware of others through the learning of psychology will contribute positively towards our ongoing effort in developing a more caring and gracious society. A person who is aware of the existence of different personalities and perspectives will be able to better apply acceptance and tolerance and respect these differences. These are very important values to embrace in making our society more caring and gracious.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01217,2018-03-05-T-004,1217,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, learning of the human mind and behaviour should be done at an appropriate learning stage of a child. According to Jean Piaget, a world renowned French psychologist, children between the ages of 11 years old and older, which he termed as the formational/operational stage, are able to use logic to solve problems, view the world around them and plan for the future."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01218,2018-03-05-T-004,1218,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Hence, I would like to urge the Ministry to consider conducting a study to assess the feasibility to introduce psychology in Secondary school as a component of the Science subject."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01220,2018-03-05-T-004,1220,Leon Perera,"Mr Chairman, Sir, from my recent exchange with the hon Senior Minister of State Dr Puthucheary on Members of Parliament speaking in schools, and from information subsequently obtained, I am not 100% sure, but it would seem that Government officeholders and grassroots advisers (GRAs) can go into MOE schools to officiate at events, hold dialogues on national issues and interact with students. But MPs in their MP capacity cannot. The Senior Minister of State did not confirm this directly. I would like to ask MOE to now confirm if this is, indeed, correct."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01221,2018-03-05-T-004,1221,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01222,2018-03-05-T-004,1222,Leon Perera,"That exchange was headlined in some media outlets as if I was advocating partisan politics in schools whereas the Government wants to keep politics out of schools. That is incorrect. What I am arguing for is that we should balance up the exposure that students already have to PAP MPs wearing their GRA or Ministerial hats. The key phrase in what I said is ""both sides"". Our students should be able to hear from and talk with Members of Parliament who are not from the ruling Party. Why? For two reasons."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01223,2018-03-05-T-004,1223,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01224,2018-03-05-T-004,1224,Leon Perera,"Firstly, students should not be exposed to only one set of perspectives on national issues. Students should be able to hear first-hand in their schools the perspectives of duly elected non-PAP Members of Parliament on issues of the day, be it our ageing society, public finance or social policies. It is not an adequate response to this to say that students can access views on the Internet. Exposing students to only one set of views from speakers in schools is unhealthy for the development of their critical faculties and their ability to see both sides of an issue. They should be able to pose questions and dialogue with elected public figures, both PAP and non-PAP."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01225,2018-03-05-T-004,1225,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01226,2018-03-05-T-004,1226,Leon Perera,"Secondly, this blocks students from understanding the role played by elected MPs other than those from the PAP in our legislative process. MPs from all parties play a role in our legislative process that is enshrined in the Constitution which our students study in schools. Students should have the opportunity to hear directly from non-PAP Members of this House about their experience on the role they play in the national institution of Parliament and in the legislative work it undertakes."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01227,2018-03-05-T-004,1227,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01228,2018-03-05-T-004,1228,Leon Perera,"Surely, it cannot be argued that Ministers and GRAs are, by definition, non-political when they talk to students but non-PAP MPs are, by definition, political. The same strictures on speech and behaviour can be applied to both groups when they go into schools. I believe that both groups should be allowed into schools but not to canvass for a Party, not to engage in partisan discussion, not to wear Party symbols, and so on, that is, to be consistent with Education (Schools) Regulations, section 111."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01230,2018-03-05-T-004,1230,Leon Perera,"I know that non-PAP MPs can go into schools in their personal professional capacity. Indeed, I have done that before. But in that capacity, they cannot have dialogues about their role in the legislative process, whereas it would seem that PAP MPs can, wearing their Ministerial or GRA hats."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01231,2018-03-05-T-004,1231,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01232,2018-03-05-T-004,1232,Leon Perera,"I have a second question. It appears that in the past, MPs could go into schools in their MP capacity. There are public references online to MPs having officiated at school events in the past as MPs. I am told that there are many plaques in schools recording that a certain MP opened a particular school facility. In former PAP MP Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee's memoirs, he writes on page 18, and I quote, ""I have made this call on many of the schools I spoke at during those early years as MP""."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01234,2018-03-05-T-004,1234,Leon Perera,"I noted that on at least two schools' websites that prior to 2011 or thereabouts schools would acknowledge MPs but, after that, the schools referred only to Grassroots Advisers. Would the MOE confirm that this change was indeed made in 2011 and why was this change made at that time?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01235,2018-03-05-T-004,1235,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01236,2018-03-05-T-004,1236,Leon Perera,"In conclusion, Sir, firstly, would MOE consider allowing all MPs, including Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) into schools to be able to share their perspectives on public affairs in their role in the legislative process as MPs, all subject to the same strictures on speech and behaviour to keep out partisan politics? And, secondly, can MOE clarify when was the apparently longstanding policy to allow MPs into schools changed and why was it changed at that time?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01237,2018-03-05-T-004,1237,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01238,2018-03-05-T-004,1238,Leon Perera,"Mr Chairman, Sir, we can pin labels that say ""PAP is by definition okay""; ""non-PAP is by definition partisan and hence not"". But does that serve the best interest of our students who will become the citizens of tomorrow? Let us not make this a conversation about labels. That is a circular argument. Let us make this a conversation about what is best for our students."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01239,2018-03-05-T-004,1239,,"Mr Ang Wei Neng, you can take your two cuts together, please."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01241,2018-03-05-T-004,1241,Ang Wei Neng,"Chairman, values are best taught through experiences. Thus, I applaud getting students to volunteer in a community through the Values in Action Programmes."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01242,2018-03-05-T-004,1242,Ang Wei Neng,"Many schools send their students overseas to do volunteer work and it is an eye-opener for many students when they visit the villages of neighbouring countries. However, could schools also explore with VWOs in the school vicinity so as to directly serve their community? Schools could work with grassroots organisations to identify problems in the community and help to solve them. I hope MOE could dedicate more resources in this respect. Maybe even work with MSF to come up with a joint registry of VWOs which is open to volunteers from the schools. Next cut."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01243,2018-03-05-T-004,1243,Ang Wei Neng,"Many students cringe when they attend National Education (NE) classes which could be known as different names in different schools but have similar results. Many feel that it is propaganda. The only good thing, in the eyes of the students, is that there is no examination."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01244,2018-03-05-T-004,1244,Ang Wei Neng,"However, it is important that our students appreciate the sweat, blood and hardship of our pioneers in the early days of nation-building, and understand and feel proud of how Singapore has transformed from the Third-World to First."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01245,2018-03-05-T-004,1245,Ang Wei Neng,"Some schools have tried to make NE more interesting. For example, Evergreen Secondary School has just been given facilities for NE sharing and teaching, including an NE learning centre, political leadership corridors, movers and shakers' gallery. Students can follow any trail by downloading an app. And this is an example of a school-based effort. But how do we as a whole make any class more interesting and relevant?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01246,2018-03-05-T-004,1246,Ang Wei Neng,"Perhaps, MOE could consider using contemporary issues to reflect the reality, constraints and limitations of being a small country. For instance, the detention of nine Terrex infantry vehicles by the Hong Kong government could be used a case study to reflect how Singapore could react in a crisis. Another possibility is to create milestone experiences where youths can feel proud to be a Singaporean. For example, we could have activities to celebrate the issuing of pink IC to our 15-year-olds."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01257,2018-03-05-T-004,1257,Chen Show Mao,"Sir, the Budget speaks of plans for economic development to focus on regional cooperation in ASEAN. Many Members have spoken of the importance of our region to our future. I agree with them. Actually, our region is not only important to our future, but also to our past, to our sense of who we are and where we are rooted in the world. Can we take the opportunity to complement these efforts in economic development with an increased focus in our school curriculum on teaching Bahasa Melayu? It is our National language and a regional language. Could we help those students who do not otherwise learn Malay in school attain some basic level of proficiency?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01258,2018-03-05-T-004,1258,Chen Show Mao,"I know our children who do not otherwise learn Malay have a lot to do already in school, including learning English, Chinese or Tamil to ever higher levels of proficiency. Many Members have spoken of the importance of that, and they are right. But Bahasa Melayu is our National language. I believe it would be to the good if all our children could learn it to some basic level of conversational fluency. Such learning will be good for the cognitive and intellectual development of our children. It will also protect and preserve our multiculturalism and promote national integration and a sense of identity."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01259,2018-03-05-T-004,1259,Chen Show Mao,"We currently have conversational third language programmes for Malay at the Primary school level as enrichment, but not part of the regular curriculum. As learning languages is best done when young, could the Ministry look into making the conversational third language programme part of the syllabus for our Primary school students who do not otherwise learn our National language? Perhaps, included as part of the regular curriculum for every Primary school student, but without the pressure of examinations?"

However, with the backdrop of the rapidly disruptive economy and employment market, I am concerned that this special population would still be left behind unless we put in more strategic focus and priority."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01262,2018-03-05-T-004,1262,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Many students with special needs fall off the cliff after completing their formal schooling at age 18 or 21. Unlike their typical peers, SkillsFuture does not quite cater to them yet. But advances like artificial intelligence will not only replace low-skilled jobs but also some tasks performed in higher-skilled jobs. How can MOE ensure that persons with special needs can continue to learn and upgrade their academic, vocational and life skills throughout their lives? How have MCI and the Smart Nation Initiative specifically support the special needs community in terms of curriculum development, delivery and assessment and nurture both students and staff?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01263,2018-03-05-T-004,1263,Denise Phua Lay Peng,I propose a Lifelong Learning Masterplan be developed and implemented to empower and equip young and adult learners with special needs to be future-ready.

I was told the story of Mary, not her real name, who is now 17 years old. Her mother wrote, ""We discovered Mary was musical from Primary 3. She was in the school choir and competed in international choir competitions, winning awards with the school. Also, a strong member of the speech and drama group. She was diagnosed with ADHD and struggled in school with inconsistent learning support for her education needs. From the Express stream, she switched to the Normal Academic (NA) and, finding difficulty coping socially, she then also developed clinical depression. Despite that, she pressed on with the family, spent much less time in music, passed her GCE N(A) examinations and scored an aggregate of 14 ‒ not good enough to qualify for LASALLE or NAFA because she did not have an ""O"" level certificate. Mary is now in the ITE’s DPP Electrical Engineering programme for eligible ""N"" level students because the programme does not have options in performing or creative arts. She will spend the next two years in an engineering course of no interest to her, in the hope that she can get a NITEC certification in two years so that she can apply for LASALLE or NAFA."" Sir, her mother wrote to me, not to complain, but to share to ask if better support could have been given to students with diverse needs and talents like Mary; and if there are other better options for young people like her."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01265,2018-03-05-T-004,1265,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Mary’s case is not isolated. A highly-talented visually-impaired young pianist and composer, Adelyn, also faced the same dilemma."

A respected psychologist consultant in the private sector who consults for the MOE actually is in grief when countless appeals that he made to exempt his child from Mother Tongue were rejected unless she fails in all subjects. This is notwithstanding the fact that she is diagnosed to have dyspraxia and other learning challenges. Learning is a big struggle and the family is awaiting for the 12 years of compulsory education to be over and is seriously contemplating other options for their life, after Primary 6. But what of others who are not able to afford other options?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01267,2018-03-05-T-004,1267,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Sir, the current support model in mainstream schools appears to be inadequate and needs a rethinking in terms of the support framework and resources. When I comb through online on what is available in Singapore and compare them to some of the other better models ‒ not all are better, but some are better ‒ there is a stark difference in the depth and quality, quantity of resources available to support learners with special needs in the mainstream classroom."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01268,2018-03-05-T-004,1268,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"I, therefore, seek the Minister’s update on what is the existing support model, the adequacy level and the optimal support level that can be provided for students with special needs within (a) Primary schools; (b) Secondary schools; (c) IHLs, such as the ITEs, Polytechnics and the Universities."

Many issues were raised that relate to how the quality of SPED schools can be further enhanced so that the stigma could be removed and every SPED school is and perceived as a school of choice for students who are better off in this specialist setting. The work of the CE Committee, I believe, is not over, and I ask MOE to continue to look at enhancing SPED schools in this 4th Industrial Revolution that Singapore is in."

They have potential and can contribute to society, if given a fair chance and the appropriate training and support. They say, it takes a village to raise a child.

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01275,2018-03-05-T-004,1275,Cheng Li Hui,"DSP educators gave feedback that once a week with the children is insufficient for those who need more intervention. Another teacher said that she has three special needs kids out of 24 in her pre-school class. It would be good if pre-schools who are willing to take in kids with special needs can have additional funding and training. Can we expect future enhancements to existing schemes and also for these programmes to be available in MOE kindergartens, if there is not any now?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01276,2018-03-05-T-004,1276,Cheng Li Hui,There are allied educators in Primary school. Is it time to work out something so that some of these children can have a seamless transition from pre-school to Primary as well?

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01278,2018-03-05-T-004,1278,Low Thia Khiang,"Mr Chairman, Sir, I understand that MOE has been retooling the education system to shift the unhealthy focus on academic competition to emphasise holistic education and the love of learning."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01279,2018-03-05-T-004,1279,Low Thia Khiang,"But a culture of ""academic results focus"" has already set in among the parents. We cannot blame the parents because they want to give the best to their children. They learned the culture from the old focus on academic competition, believing in the old paradigm of good grades and a linear path from elite Primary schools to the top Universities."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01280,2018-03-05-T-004,1280,Low Thia Khiang,"When they are faced with globalisation and technological disruptions, they become even more anxious about making sure their children get the best start in life. When MOE rightly sought to improve pre-school education by setting up MOE kindergartens, some parents saw this as a new first stop to academic success."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01281,2018-03-05-T-004,1281,Low Thia Khiang,"It was reported that a study conducted by OECD to look at the connection between well-being and Pisa test achievement found Singapore students have higher levels of anxiety, compared to the OECD average. For example, 76% of Singapore students reported feeling very anxious for a test even if they were well-prepared, compared to the OECD average of 55%. The students involved in the study were mostly Secondary 4 students. I hope the MOE could do a study to see whether this kind of anxiety is also affecting Primary school children and even children in pre-school, so that we can learn how to mitigate the problem."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01282,2018-03-05-T-004,1282,Low Thia Khiang,"MOE should not stop to complete the transformation of the system despite these die-hard habits. It will take time to change such an entrenched culture. Meanwhile, MOE could also look into communicating and educating parents on the many pathways to success in the new economy, so as to lessen their anxiety and, thus, lessen the transfer of the anxiety to their children."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01284,2018-03-05-T-004,1284,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Chairman, Sir, there are a few fundamental tenets of a child's education which I believe most of us, if not all, will subscribe to. First, always be prepared to try something new ‒ push the envelope, break new ground, do something we have never done. Who knows ‒ it might turn out that you will enjoy the new adventure, arise to a fresh challenge? Second, fail at something. Being always or even often successful is no good to a young child. Learn to lose and be gracious in defeat. But also learn from losing. Pick up, dust off, try again, be stronger and better the next time round. This also teaches resilience. Third, we have to work as a team. No man is an island, and no one functions in silos. Our children have to be able to work and play with each other and to support, complement, encourage and cheer each other on. They have to learn to come together to make a cohesive team, a team which would be stronger than the sum of its parts. Fourth, hard work. Nothing ever comes without hard work. It takes a lot of hard work to become good at anything, and even more hard work to remain good and stay ahead of the competition. There are no short cuts."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01286,2018-03-05-T-004,1286,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"These are all simple basic values, but the foundation and cornerstone for bringing up women and men of tomorrow, the leaders of our next generation. I believe, Sir, that all of these are best taught, not in the classroom, but on the playing field. And I am quite sure most of this House would, I hope, agree with that. Very often, a child's first encounter with sports, especially team sports, would be in school when they first enrolled for their Primary education. Schools, therefore, play a crucial role in being the first mover in introducing sports into our children's lives. And should there be sufficient interest and sufficient talent demonstrated, the school invariably would also take the additional active role of identifying and eventually nurturing that talent. Sports, therefore, offer an educational platform for our children which cannot be easily replicated."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01290,2018-03-05-T-004,1290,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Do schools in Singapore have sufficient breadth, in terms of the variety and range of sports offered? This is important because not every child can afford or have an opportunity to be exposed to sports outside of school. How is anyone going to know if he or she can be good at sport if they have no opportunity to try that sport? So, the initial formative years in their Primary school would be crucial. For instance, not offering, say, hockey or badminton as a school CCA option would quite likely mean that the child might never be exposed to that sport. This, in turn, then limits the selection base from which a young budding talent might be identified and, in turn, then, subsequently, limits the base from which national athletes could be selected."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01292,2018-03-05-T-004,1292,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"From a resourcing perspective, I understand that it would, of course, not be possible for every school to offer every sport. But could more be done to enhance the range of options available? Could, for example, a central body be set up, like the CCAB, which can then administer and offer sporting options which may not be quite so popular, quite so mainstream, and, therefore, not available in many of the schools?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01293,2018-03-05-T-004,1293,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Alternatively, is the Ministry of Education (MOE) working with Sport SG or Active SG in promoting sporting options to our school children and make sports more accessible? The MOE website indicates that students who are keen on activity which may not be offered by the school could seek the school's approval to set up that activity. How often has this been done and in any event, is it realistic?"

This is all good. I would like to ask the Minister what percentage of schools have adopted the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme since 2011 to date. Also, how much more are students paying for these healthy meals on average and are we making sure students from low-income households can afford the meals?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01296,2018-03-05-T-004,1296,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Recently, there has been some public discussion about mealtimes as more schools move to single sessions. Parents are concerned that the children are eating late lunches in the mid-afternoon and not having enough time to eat snacks during recess time due to the scheduling of classes. While nutritionists say that there are no set hours for children to have their meals, they also advise that children should have three main meals and two to three snacks at regular hours. They should be eating every three hours."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01297,2018-03-05-T-004,1297,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"I understand that MOE leaves the schools to decide on their daily schedules. Nevertheless, MOE could reassure the public by conducting a survey of all schools on their meal and snack scheduling, and provide an advisory for regular recess and lunch breaks to ensure students would never go hungry during the school day."

I am concerned about with the rising living costs, how they will impact our students from low socio-economic families. In spite of the subsidies, bursaries, scholarships and grants, there are some students who will still fall through the cracks. The distractions of part-time work and social problems at home may prevent them from focusing on their studies. This results in a vicious cycle where the poor cannot do well in school and they are unable to break out of the poverty cycle."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01300,2018-03-05-T-004,1300,Lim Wee Kiak,I would like to request the Minister to further enhance the current schemes available to support the aspirations of students from lower socio-economic families. How are they given equal access to opportunities for all students regardless of their family and income backgrounds? How much resources are allocated to these schemes and how many beneficiaries are there per year?

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01303,2018-03-05-T-004,1303,Sylvia Lim,"Some governments, notably the UK, have developed a dashboard of social mobility indicators based on a life-cycle framework. The objective is to make life chances more equal at the critical points for social mobility such as  early childhood development, school readiness at age five, Secondary school attainment, opportunities for tertiary education and getting into and on in the labour market."

I am glad to see the announcement in Budget 2018 to cover more meals for Secondary school students under the School Meals Programme. Under the current scheme, Primary school pupils receive subsidies of $2 per meal for seven times a week while Secondary school students will receive subsidies of $2.50 a meal; $2.50 would seem insufficient for Secondary school students."

However, it will take time for the effects to be felt on the ground, including other policy measures like Subject-Based Banding to increase the porosity in our schools. However, we do not think that removing the PSLE is the way to go. The PSLE remains a useful checkpoint at the end of Primary school to help us determine each child’s academic strengths where they lie. This guides the child to a suitable academic programme in Secondary school – one that would best fit his learning needs."

Removing the PSLE and having a through-train will only transfer the stress on parents and students elsewhere, such as to the Primary 1 registration, where if I can paraphrase Ms Foo Mee Har in her words, it would then be a 10-15 years' race to safeguard the child's interest.

Psychology, however, is an abstract discipline, not an age appropriate subject at Secondary school. A better broader approach to fulfil the same intent is to focus on 21st century competencies in our curriculum, create more space for informal learning, learning through play and encourage opportunities for character building – in the classroom, outside the classroom, in the CCAs including our enhanced Outdoor Education.

Consider Israel  I visited Israel and looked at their talent development and innovation eco-system. It has a strong disposition in this area but overall it has big averages. If we use PISA as one indicator, Israeli students underperform the OECD average."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01362,2018-03-05-T-004,1362,Ng Chee Meng,"There is also a significant education outcomes gap between the average and the top Israeli students. We do not want this in Singapore. Here, we have high averages, where our students regardless of socio-economic status, outperform most of their peers in different countries. Rather, we will improve our education system by building on our existing strengths, even as we explore new possibilities. Let us not throw out the baby with the bath water. As such, on top of strong academic foundations and sound values, we want to get our students to move beyond the classroom and apply their knowledge in the real world. This will help nurture our next generation of ""change-makers""."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01363,2018-03-05-T-004,1363,Ng Chee Meng,"Our students must be able to connect their ""Head"" knowledge to their ""Hands"" and create value. And their ""Hands"" must also be connected to their ""Hearts"" – so that they contribute their knowledge and skills to the betterment of society. Education must go beyond the classroom and academic grades. This is key."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01367,2018-03-05-T-004,1367,Ng Chee Meng,"But, first, let me tell you a ""Story of Two Cars"". I met two 10-year-old boys at a community event some time ago. They wanted to show me their toy car. I thought to myself initially what was this about? But when I saw the car, I got interested. You see, the car was not any sexy toy. It was very plain, made up of cardboard – the boys took some of their mother's shoe boxes, cut off the top and bottom and fashioned a flat chassis. They then got a set of wheels, mounted them on together with some rudimentary drive train and wired the system up. Then, they applied what they had learnt about energy in their Science class; they put on top of the chassis miniature solar panels and made their own solar powered car. And it worked brilliantly. Their eyes sparkled when they talked to me on that Saturday morning as they showed me their solar toy car. This car is made out of pure fun, pure curiosity. These boys, all of 10 years old, applied what they had learnt in Science class to build their own toy – impressive!"

This car was built by a team of Singapore Polytechnic students taking part in the 2017 World Solar Challenge. They competed against 39 other teams from all over the world, including Cambridge University and Stanford University. They took 20 months to make that car. Using a high tech carbon fibre-reinforced composite body. The top speed of this solar car is 100 km/hour, built by 18- to 20-year-old boys. The team had a difficult race. They met with rough weather, an accident and unfortunately did not finish within the deadline."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01377,2018-03-05-T-004,1377,Ng Chee Meng,"What is Applied Learning? It is a mode of learning – for all students; not just a separate track for vocational students. Students learn by applying and by doing. They learn beyond the classroom. They see for themselves how they can apply what they have learnt to the real world. And from all the interactions I had with students, I see them enjoying learning. They are self-motivated or become self-motivated. These are powerful learning experiences. They stick for life, driving lifelong learning."

His team has to bring their robot to the Science Centre's Maker Faire. And he had to practise public speaking and he says it is not his forte. He had to explain his robot to each visitor interested in his robot! In his words, he said, ""These are things I cannot learn in a classroom"". This is the value of applied learning in real life."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01418,2018-03-05-T-004,1418,Ng Chee Meng,"In order to cultivate creativity from young, MOE is now promoting Applied Learning in our schools. Our students already have solid an academic foundation; but we do not want them to be only able to ""talk about strategies on paper"" and become nerds who only know how to talk but not how to do. They must know how to convert knowledge into power and use it in real life. Only by applying intelligently what you have learnt can you create infinite possibilities with finite knowledge."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01419,2018-03-05-T-004,1419,Ng Chee Meng,"I will share an example. Students of Yuan Qing Secondary School are learning to write xinyao  (新谣) in the Chinese class. Through song writing, their language ability will improve and they can also appreciate the beauty of the language better."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01420,2018-03-05-T-004,1420,Ng Chee Meng,"Once student, Guo Zifeng, wrote a song, ""My Mother"". The lyrics is very touching and the melody beautiful, expressing his love and gratitude to his mother. The song won an award in the 2017 Xinyao Singing and Writing Competition."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01422,2018-03-05-T-004,1422,Ng Chee Meng,"Hence, we introduced various programmes in our schools to instil good values in our students. We teach them to be centred on the right morals. This has been our education principle all along."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01423,2018-03-05-T-004,1423,Ng Chee Meng,Applied learning should not be confined to a particular subject and the classroom. We hope parents can do the same in daily life to give our children more space and time for applied learning and instil right values in them. Parents can work together with the school and create a better future for our children.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01424,2018-03-05-T-004,1424,Ng Chee Meng,"(In English)  I will now move on to connecting the ""Hands"" and the ""Heart"". It is critical that we equip our children with the right values, and develop in them a heart for others. Without the right moral compass, talented individuals can do more harm to society than good and that will be tragic."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01425,2018-03-05-T-004,1425,Ng Chee Meng,"Just like knowledge, values cannot remain simply in the ""head"". They must be acted out, applied to the real world."

During my visit, I met a Primary 6 student. Her name is Zer Jynn. She showed me a pair of chopsticks that she and her team designed for people with weaker muscular control, such as our elderly."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01427,2018-03-05-T-004,1427,Ng Chee Meng,"Zer Jynn explained that she and her team had first thought of a catch-and-release mechanism to allow users to use the chopsticks with minimal strength. And she built this model, nothing fancy, using simple materials – chopsticks, a straw, a spring and a masking tape. And in this model, she designed something to help the elderly grab food. She experimented several times, until she was satisfied with the catch-and-release function. With this design, she went on to 3D-print a plastic prototype, with the help of her teachers."

However, she is not satisfied with the plastic prototype as it did not work as well as her initial prototype. You see, she has probably reversed the hinge. But I have given her some possibilities and she told me she will work to improve her prototype. She is a Primary 6 girl."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01430,2018-03-05-T-004,1430,Ng Chee Meng,"And Zer Jynn is not alone. Her schoolmates in the Teck Whye Primary iDesign Club have built learning aids for their peers with dyslexia, and other prototypes to improve the quality of life for the physically disabled or the elderly."

A good example is Bulan Bahasa – the Malay Language Month. I worked with Minister Masagos on this. The community hosts activities, such as writing workshops and story-telling, that broaden students' exposure to language and culture. Students, in turn, contribute to the community. They set up activity booths for the public. They also take on the roles of Rakan Bahasa, or ""Friends of the Language"", to serve as museum guides at the Malay Heritage Centre."

NIEC will offer a range of quality programmes to prepare those who aspire to join the Early Childhood (EC) sector with a good foundation for a career as an EC professional.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01447,2018-03-05-T-004,1447,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01448,2018-03-05-T-004,1448,Ng Chee Meng,I would like to reassure Dr Intan that EC training today is already delivered with a heavy emphasis on practical skills. Most faculty are experienced practitioners in the preschool sector. It will be no different in NIEC.

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01450,2018-03-05-T-004,1450,Ng Chee Meng,"Separately, MOE has facilitated professional exchanges between MK educators and also Primary school teachers. They help develop mutual understanding, which smoothens the transition from kindergarten to Primary 1."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01452,2018-03-05-T-004,1452,Ng Chee Meng,"MOE is also committed to providing quality and affordable education to all Singapore citizens, regardless of their financial circumstances. Our education today is heavily subsidised at all levels. Ms Denise Phua mentioned Digital Equity, as learning is done more online."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01454,2018-03-05-T-004,1454,Ng Chee Meng,"This year, we will be rolling out the Student Learning Space (SLS) to all students. SLS will provide high-quality, curriculum-aligned learning resources and online learning tools for students. This will drive self-directed learning which can take place anytime, anywhere and, hopefully, reduce the reliance contribution as well."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01455,2018-03-05-T-004,1455,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01456,2018-03-05-T-004,1456,Ng Chee Meng,"MOE has provided funding to schools, which can be used to subsidise students from less advantaged backgrounds, for them to purchase mobile learning devices."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01457,2018-03-05-T-004,1457,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01458,2018-03-05-T-004,1458,Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Edwin Tong and quite a few others in the Budget debate asked about Edusave contributions. We will increase the annual Edusave contributions from 2019. With this increase, students can participate in more activities, such as creative writing programmes and learning journeys, to broaden their learning experiences. The Government also provides a range of financial assistance schemes to assist those who are in need. Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Ms Cheng Li Hui asked about this."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01459,2018-03-05-T-004,1459,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01460,2018-03-05-T-004,1460,Ng Chee Meng,"At the Primary to Pre-University levels, Singaporean students who need assistance can tap on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS). We will do more for students from lower-income families by enhancing the MOE FAS. We will raise the income criteria for the Gross Household Income per month from $2,500 to $2,750; as well as the per capita household income per month from $625 to $690. We will increase the annual bursary quantum for Pre-University students from $750 to $900. We will provide 10 meals for Secondary school students under the School Meals Programme, an increase from the seven we provide currently. This is in answer to Assoc Prof Daniel Goh. We will also increase the income eligibility criteria for the Edusave Merit Bursary and Independent School Bursary."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01462,2018-03-05-T-004,1462,Ng Chee Meng,"Overall, with these enhancements, the various financial assistance schemes will cost the Government close to $100 million per year, and benefit around 90,000 students in total."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01464,2018-03-05-T-004,1464,Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Chairman, I have said what MOE, our schools and teachers are committed to doing. But let me emphasise that we cannot do this alone. We need the whole nation to move with us towards holistic education, and parents play a most important role."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01465,2018-03-05-T-004,1465,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01466,2018-03-05-T-004,1466,Ng Chee Meng,"I strongly urge all parents to give our children the time – for their minds to imagine; space – for them to experiment and learn to embrace and take risks; opportunities – to learn from failing, trying, relearning and trying until they succeed."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01467,2018-03-05-T-004,1467,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01468,2018-03-05-T-004,1468,Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Chairman, let me conclude, with a story. I visited Assumption English School last July to open their upgraded school site. The opening ceremony was a most unusual one, hinged on robots programmed by their students – part of an ALP. I was invited to participate in a robot race on stage, to move the robots, in order to switch on a ray of bright-coloured lights to mark the official opening of the school. The robots were powered solely by wind, and controlled by an iPad. My engineering mind straightaway went into a thinking mode and I thought these robots could fail easily and, when they fail to function, the bulbs will not light up, and the failure will be significant, in front of the whole school, a hall full of parents, students, MOE senior officials."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01469,2018-03-05-T-004,1469,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01470,2018-03-05-T-004,1470,Ng Chee Meng,"After the ceremony, I congratulated the then principal, Mrs Mabel Leong, and I quietly asked her ""What would you have done if the robots did not work? What was the backup?"" She told me quietly, too, ""Minister, there is no back up."" She said that if the robots did not work despite all their planning and efforts, she would have simply stood up, apologised to me and sought my understanding to skip the segment. In spite of the risks, she decided to keep the robot segment. I suspect because she is proud of her students and it showcased her students pride and their learning. I must tell you, I smiled the widest smile in an entire week, knowing what Mable was doing."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01471,2018-03-05-T-004,1471,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01472,2018-03-05-T-004,1472,Ng Chee Meng,"Our principals and schools are moving in the right direction. More of them are taking calculated risks, for their students to have the time and space for experimentation, to try, fail, try again, even in front of a Minister!"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01473,2018-03-05-T-004,1473,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01474,2018-03-05-T-004,1474,Ng Chee Meng,"Seeing how the schools and educators are changing, I sincerely urge all parents to join us in creating similar opportunities for our children."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01475,2018-03-05-T-004,1475,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01476,2018-03-05-T-004,1476,Ng Chee Meng,"The results of such opportunities may not be immediately apparent. But the true test for all of us, is not any single examination. It is the test of life. It is such opportunities that will benefit our children for a lifetime – much more than cramping their free time with excessive tuition."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01477,2018-03-05-T-004,1477,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01478,2018-03-05-T-004,1478,Ng Chee Meng,"I hope all parents will encourage their children when they participate in their schools' ALPs, Outdoor Education Programme, Values-in-Action activities. Engage them in conversation over their Applied Learning experiences, share in their successes and setbacks. Share in their joys, empathise with their failings. Create more of such learning experiences for them in the classroom and outside the classroom."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01479,2018-03-05-T-004,1479,Ng Chee Meng,

They will acquire the skills and values to thrive in the future. A brighter future of greater fulfilment awaits them. [Applause.]"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01481,2018-03-05-T-004,1481,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, our education system is evolving. To prepare each of our students for the future, MOE has to be prepared to do different things, and to do things differently."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01482,2018-03-05-T-004,1482,Janil Puthucheary,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01483,2018-03-05-T-004,1483,Janil Puthucheary,"I thank Ms Denise Phua and Miss Cheng Li Hui for their encouragement as we continue with our efforts to support our students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). Some of this expertise did not traditionally reside with MOE. Decades ago, we tried something different – we partnered with Voluntary Welfare Organisations who had deep expertise in SEN support. And as both sides learnt from each other, these partnerships evolved to strengthen support for our students. One good example of this is our relationship with AWWA, with whom we work on different service models. The partnership extends to mainstream schools, where AWWA provides training and consultation services to our educators, supporting students with physical and visual impairments."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01484,2018-03-05-T-004,1484,Janil Puthucheary,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01485,2018-03-05-T-004,1485,Janil Puthucheary,"Today, 80% of our students with SEN are enrolled in mainstream schools. I say that again to make sure we are all clear – 80% of our students with SEN are enrolled in mainstream schools. They are supported not just by allied educators, but also by educational psychologists, and suitable intervention programmes, including those provided by organisations, such as AWWA."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01486,2018-03-05-T-004,1486,Janil Puthucheary,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01487,2018-03-05-T-004,1487,Janil Puthucheary,"As our students move on to the post-Secondary space, they are supported by SEN Support Offices in each of our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). To prepare for entry into the workforce, students with SEN can participate in SG Enable's IHL Internship Programme, as well as the RISE mentoring scheme."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01489,2018-03-05-T-004,1489,Janil Puthucheary,"We are also looking ahead and constantly seeking ways to better support our students to realise their potential. There are different ways to do this, including the suggestion of an Academy for those with special needs and all who support them. For now, MOE takes a targeted approach. We are enhancing our professional development for our staff, and are also looking at how to better support students with SEN at key transition points, like when they enter schools."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01490,2018-03-05-T-004,1490,Janil Puthucheary,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01491,2018-03-05-T-004,1491,Janil Puthucheary,"Strong partnership between MOE and the community has also enabled the sector to make significant improvements. Over the past year, MOE has worked with our Government-funded SPED schools to ensure the smooth implementation of compulsory education for children with moderate to severe special needs. We are confident that students who can benefit from such specialised support will receive quality education in these schools."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01492,2018-03-05-T-004,1492,Janil Puthucheary,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01493,2018-03-05-T-004,1493,Janil Puthucheary,"Yet, as Ms Phua has pointed out, our efforts must go beyond legislation. MOE and our partners must continue to look for ways to do better, to deliver affordable, quality Speciaised Education for our students."

They reached out to the private sector for job opportunities; they updated their curriculum, so that the students could start their job training in their last years within the school. The S2W programme has seen positive outcomes, and we are working with MSF and SG Enable to scale it up."

Our SkillsFuture Credit course directory is continually updated with new courses. We also have a SkillsFuture Study Award for Persons with Disabilities to recognise those who demonstrate resilience and perseverance in pursuing lifelong learning.

The DSP programme, together with EIPIC, is organised my MSF and I need to defer to them to talk about those interventions. But there are three MKs that offer the DSP programme and we will study how we can do that better."

Each school also has a group of teachers who have undergone certificate level training in special needs at NIE. These are known teachers trained in special needs."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01502,2018-03-05-T-004,1502,Janil Puthucheary,"On top of that, there is at least one Allied Educator for Learning and Behavioural Support (LBS) for looking at the behavioural needs rather than educational needs in every Primary school. We are recruiting more of these Allied Educators LBS and our target is to ensure all Primary schools will have a baseline provision of two and 95% of Secondary schools will be given a baseline provision of at least one AEDLBS."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01506,2018-03-05-T-004,1506,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, MOE recognises that we have to be open to doing NE differently. We must empower our students to discover what being Singaporean means to them personally − not because the syllabus or a textbook says so, but because they themselves know so through a process of discovery and the creation of a strong sense of their own identity."

Our recommendations centre on nurturing a sense of belonging to our country and community, a sense of Singapore's realities and challenges, and a sense of shared hope and aspirations as a nation."

This will enable our students' shared appreciation for the ever-evolving Singapore story."

This is already happening, is already done in subjects like Social Studies, History and Geography. Students undertake learning journeys, they come to Parliament to visit and witness Parliamentary debates. Their learning is well-supported by educators."

This includes exploring the rationale behind policy decisions, and the pros and cons of alternatives. In General Paper lessons, students consider different perspectives and learn to differentiate between fact and opinion. One of the NE Review Committee's recommendations is for students to discuss contemporary issues on a more regular basis and not just during the subject periods that I have just mentioned."

When I visited the school, I saw students have lively discussions on their own on issues relevant to Singapore, such as the environment, a car-lite society, technology and future jobs. The school is looking to deepen this practice in their Character and Citizenship Education periods, so that students have the time and space to explore their convictions and reflect upon such issues."

They may not even agree with their teachers, but we do want to ensure that there is space for respectful conversations and that we nurture in our students open-mindedness, respect for each other, and that they develop the skills for critical thinking."

Their 15-year-old students receive their NRICs in a special school ceremony that emphasises that despite their different backgrounds, these 15 year-olds must stand together and understand the shared privileges and responsibilities of being Singaporean. We look forward to more of such cohort or school-based experiences meaningful and available for our students."

Sir, I provided those words not as a label but as an explanation of what he was asking for. Perhaps, I may need to expand upon why I believe that is an apt explanation for what he is asking for."

There is no obstruction to him doing so. What he is asking for, is for him to be allowed to attend any partisan political capacity. There is a difference. He seems to believe that he has previously attended in a non-partisan political capacity, but I am assuming that the reason he is asking to attend in a partisan capacity, because he is assuming that everybody else attends only in a political partisan capacity. This is a level of hubris that is really quite remarkable. If he can attend in a non-partisan, non-political way, I think the assumption should be, in good faith that other people can do as well."

That is not so. What he is asking for is a fundamental shift that we bring partisan political debates by elected Members of Parliament into the schools. That is not what we do currently, and so it would be inappropriate for an invitation to be extended to him in his capacity as a member of a political party and as a Member of Parliament."

As such, I hope the Ministry will consider further expanding the PFP beyond 800 students. I note from a Straits Times report that the PFP has been beneficial in helping students adjust to life at Polytechnic, with some graduates outperforming their ""O"" level peers as well. Perhaps the Polytechnics may wish to offer the option to other students who may have qualified for the admission to Polytechnic, but need extra help."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01586,2018-03-05-T-004,1586,Ang Wei Neng,"Chairman, many ITE students and graduates are good with their hands, and less brilliant in paper-and-pen examinations. Singapore is far behind some parts of the world in nurturing technical skills. For example, in the UK, apprenticeship programmes offer work-based learning which can lead to a bachelor's degree or master's degree."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01587,2018-03-05-T-004,1587,Ang Wei Neng,"In Germany, its vocational training programmes cater to 60% of the country's young people. These dual-training programmes are a mix of theory and hands-on training in areas like advanced Manufacturing, IT, Banking and Hospitality. Trainees do not pay for the training. In fact, they are paid for the time they take for the training. As a result of this programme, the youth jobless rate in Germany is very low."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01588,2018-03-05-T-004,1588,Ang Wei Neng,"Similarly, in Finland, more than 50% of the Finnish youth apply for technical and vocational education in training. So, like Mr Edwin Tong, I would like MOE to give an update on the Work-Learn Technical Diploma, as well as the Work-Study Degree programme."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01589,2018-03-05-T-004,1589,Ang Wei Neng,"The next cut. The rapid development of technology has benefitted lives and also disrupted lives at the same time. Many skills sets learnt during an undergraduate course a decade ago can turn obsolete in just one year. Gone are the days where a graduate degree can last for life. We need to relearn, re-tool, re-energise throughout our working lives. What roles do our oldest public Universities like NUS and NTU play in promoting lifelong learning? Are these IHLs adequately funded to provide courses for lifelong learning?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01590,2018-03-05-T-004,1590,Ang Wei Neng,"Currently, NUS has a School of Continuing and Lifelong Learning offering Bachelor of Technology programmes specialised certificate courses and courses for Executives and Professionals. NUS Alumni can study up to a maximum of two modules over a three-year period until 2020, and the first year of study is free."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01591,2018-03-05-T-004,1591,Ang Wei Neng,"Similarly, NTU runs a College of Professional and Continuing Education, where alumni are entitled to 20% discount on courses. What has the take-up rate been like? How do IHLs ensure the courses offered are relevant to emerging trends and future needs? How are they working with industrial players to ensure that courses are useful and future-ready?"

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01595,2018-03-05-T-004,1595,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"May I propose that employers who are keen to be part of the SkillsFuture movement actively advertise the positions within their organisations in which they are able to support programs, such as the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn or the SkillsFuture Study Award? Probably a separate category can be set up to help Singaporeans navigate MySkillsFuture or SkillsConnect portals and identify employers who are keen to support them in such SkillsFuture programmes, beyond just the usual job vacancies that employers have within their respective organisations. This will facilitate job searches by Singaporeans and help them identify employers who are supportive of skills training among their employees."

Singapore’s inclusion in such studies would not have been possible without the Ministry's progressive efforts and support."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01609,2018-03-05-T-004,1609,Randolph Tan,"By highlighting potential gaps in policy, the findings from such surveys are useful for guiding early intervention strategies. In addition, the information they provide can improve the efficiency with which intervention is applied."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01610,2018-03-05-T-004,1610,Randolph Tan,"In particular, the survey on adult skills conducted under the PIAAC study had found that among the 34 economies surveyed, Singapore ranked first for the use of ICT skills at work. Singapore’s corresponding rankings for numeracy skills and reading skills are also high, at sixth and seventh respectively."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01611,2018-03-05-T-004,1611,Randolph Tan,"Sir, at the same time, Singapore workers also have some of the strongest relationships between proficiency in literacy, numeracy and wages among the countries in the study. What this implies is that workers who have skills deficiencies could be expected to perform significantly poorer in the labour market."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01612,2018-03-05-T-004,1612,Randolph Tan,"This raises some specific areas of concern. My interpretation of the results of the PIAAC survey is that the proportion of workers in Singapore who may be at risk of skills deficiency is not insignificant. While the results of surveys much be looked at in perspective, the areas of concern they point to in Singapore’s case, suggest that lack of basic literacy and ICT skills appears to affect skills performance in other areas – so, there is a significant knock-on effect. This could imply those without foundation in literacy and ICT skills will not be able to make further progress in the labour market."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01613,2018-03-05-T-004,1613,Randolph Tan,"I would like to ask the Minister how this challenge is addressed in the national skills training framework. In particular, the same study shows much more variability in skills among Singapore workers than those in the other countries in the survey, with our older workers clearly performing poorer compared to their younger counterparts. This higher variance in skills proficiency suggests that training has to be much more carefully tailored to individual needs. How is this dealt with?	This is particularly relevant in the learning of our Mother Tongue Languages. For instance, the teaching of the Malay Language does not just belong to the  Cikgu  or the parents. It also involves the Malay community coming together to deepen our students' sense of their own culture and rich heritage. The Perkasa Warisan Camp designed for our Primary 4 students is one such initiative. Allow me to elaborate more about the camp in Malay."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01616,2018-03-05-T-004,1616,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Government has increased its spending in education and lifelong learning in this year's Budget. Singapore's ageing population and declining birth rate will directly affect the structure of our workforce in the future. In view of the constraints of our small population, we have always championed the idea of everyone contributing towards one's best, and that everyone could get to use one's value and talent fully. Therefore, I fully support increasing our investments into education, and giving greater attention to raise the quality of our human resources so that our economy will continue to develop and prosper."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01617,2018-03-05-T-004,1617,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"Trade associations are willing to play an active part in this long-term plan to develop human resources. Our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) provide one of the key sources of business talents. The training and curriculum in the IHLs should match the actual needs of the business community. In view of this, if trade associations could collaborate closely with IHLs to educate our students in accordance with the practical needs of the businesses, it would be an arrangement that produces many benefits."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01618,2018-03-05-T-004,1618,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"From what I know, in the aspect of curriculum planning, some institutions would seek views and feedback from the business community or the relevant trade associations. Such beneficial interaction is meaningful. Moving forward, we hope that the interaction between IHLs and trade associations will not be confined to merely consultation. In operationalising and implementing these training programmes, trade associations should also be invited to participate, particularly those which are willing and with the capabilities to do so."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01619,2018-03-05-T-004,1619,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"I would like to take this opportunity to ask Minister, in the event when there are gaps between the needs of businesses and the training received in the IHLs, how could the two parties come together to address these gaps?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01620,2018-03-05-T-004,1620,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"The ability of our economy to sustain its growth is due partly to the business community and the government-linked companies having sufficient top-rated talents. Taking this year's Budget as an example, the Government introduced the National Investment Returns (NIR) framework in 2008. The NIR contributed $15.9 billion to the Government's revenues this year, far exceeding the $7 billion it contributed in FY 2009. It has become the government's largest revenue source, outstripping the corporate income tax, personal income tax, and GST."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01621,2018-03-05-T-004,1621,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"Much of the NIR, which is based on the national reserves, has come from GIC and Temasek Holdings. The country's investment depends on high-quality talent, they possess global perspectives, rich industry experiences, and understand deeply global economic developments. The fact that the NIR exceeds other tax revenues reflects the importance of high-end talent to our economy. In this regard, SCCCI has implemented many initiatives to study market developments in China, and encouraging businesses across all sectors to broaden their vision. High-end talent can help businesses and industries to innovate and grow. In the long term, this will help contribute more towards our corporate income taxes."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01622,2018-03-05-T-004,1622,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"Therefore, I suggest we undertake education with a broader perspective, and give more emphasis to the development of high-quality human resources, so as to promote the future development of our economy and businesses."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01624,2018-03-05-T-004,1624,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"Chairman, the Government is encouraging our workforce and students to focus on short-term skills-based courses, instead of longer term broad programmes. This is the appropriate move. However, for some sectors, there is still considerable work needed get the SkillsFuture and Continuing Education short-term skills-based courses up and running. This is because the industry in those sectors may need more time to determine on the industry's future requirements. As such, would the Government consider delaying the decision to cut funding for post-graduate programs until the eco-system of short-term skills-based courses is more matured in those sectors?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01625,2018-03-05-T-004,1625,Cheng Li Hui,"Chairman, with changing economy and technological disruptions, it is important for adult learners to continue to reskill and upskill themselves to face the needs of our future economy. Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have been ramping up their delivery of Continuing Education and Training (CET), by providing short training courses for adults to acquire the right skills that can be applied in their respective jobs."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01626,2018-03-05-T-004,1626,Cheng Li Hui,More industry-relevant modular courses have also been introduced to provide both undergraduates and post-graduates to learn new skills and develop deeper skills.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01627,2018-03-05-T-004,1627,Cheng Li Hui,"Beyond clearly skills-based and industry relevant courses, it is also important to continue support for postgraduate programmes like Masters programmes since they cater to a different group of Singaporeans who might prefer a more structured approach to training. Minister Ong had mentioned that MOE was going to review the funding for such post-graduate programmes. I would like to ask the outcome of the review."

I am glad our Autonomous Universities are following suit to keep up with the demand. These bite-sized courses are good for our busy individuals who are keen to upgrade and upskill themselves but do not have the time or resources for full-time post-graduate courses. The prestige and reputation of the Autonomous Universities will give students further assurance of the effectiveness and legitimacy of the course materials and assessment methods."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01630,2018-03-05-T-004,1630,Lim Wee Kiak,"Nevertheless, while the main goal of these micro-credentials is to encourage and recognise the mastery of specific skills, many individuals still aspire to attain formal post-graduate qualification."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01631,2018-03-05-T-004,1631,Lim Wee Kiak,"Will the Ministry expand the scheme and allow employees to eventually attain full qualifications from various micro-courses? For example, students who achieve sufficient micro-credentials in business administration topics could convert them into full credits and transfer them into a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration. According to Converge, a digital magazine by the Center for Digital Education, which is a national research and advisory institute specialising in higher education technology trends, policy and funding, this are what universities in America are working on."

2018-03-05-T-004-S-01700,2018-03-05-T-004,1700,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01701,2018-03-05-T-004,1701,Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Zainal Sapari said that education model and techniques must be updated to reflect the changing needs of industry and the real world. That is why what our children are going through today at IHLs is vastly different from what we, as parents, went through when we were students – vastly different."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01702,2018-03-05-T-004,1702,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01703,2018-03-05-T-004,1703,Ong Ye Kung,"IHLs can no longer merely be places to listen to lectures. Schools and IHLs must also be places where students make friends, build networks, seek mentorship, gain exposure to different cultures, discover what they want to do, and even find lifelong partners – but only at IHLs, not the schools."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01704,2018-03-05-T-004,1704,Ong Ye Kung,"In short, as Mr Edwin Tong pointed out, learning must become experiential. Knowledge no longer carries the same premium it used to because technology has made knowledge very accessible. What is highly valued today is how someone applies knowledge in real life – in other words, what is valued is skills. That comes with experience and practice."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01705,2018-03-05-T-004,1705,Ong Ye Kung,That is why all of our IHLs are introducing more experiential learning into their curriculum.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01706,2018-03-05-T-004,1706,Ong Ye Kung,"Today, industry attachments have become the norm, and practically all Polytechnic students are required to go through them. At the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), industry attachments are in fact an integral part of education, and last for up to a year."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01707,2018-03-05-T-004,1707,Ong Ye Kung,"Internship is at one end of the spectrum of industry experience in IHLs. At the other end of the spectrum, which Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about, is various work-study programmes. For example, we have 76 Earn and Learn Programmes training over 1,700 students so far."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01708,2018-03-05-T-004,1708,Ong Ye Kung,"The Autonomous Universities (AUs) have also started offering SkillsFuture Work-Study Degree Programmes in areas such as information security, business and analytics, software engineering, and finance. So far, close to 90 students have enrolled in such programmes. The number is not big, but the number will grow, and the number of courses being offered will also grow."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01709,2018-03-05-T-004,1709,Ong Ye Kung,"We also announced the launch of the ITE Work-Learn Technical Diploma in four sectors late last year. A couple of Members asked for an update. Interest in the programme is strong. ITE received more than 300 applications for the 180 places available. Each course is at least 1.3 times, or 30%, oversubscribed. The technical courses are particularly popular, such as Marine and Offshore Engineering and Mechanical and Electrical Services Supervision."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01710,2018-03-05-T-004,1710,Ong Ye Kung,ITE is engaging various industries and plans to roll out another 10 new ITE Technical Diploma programmes in the next two years.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01711,2018-03-05-T-004,1711,Ong Ye Kung,"So, to Mr Thomas Chua's question on how do we bridge the gap between industry need and education, I call upon industries to participate directly in education. Our new programmes are bringing industries into the IHLs, and IHLs into the industries. Whether it is IHLs or industry, both can initiate the discussion."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01712,2018-03-05-T-004,1712,Ong Ye Kung,"There is also greater recognition of the importance of overseas exposure, because our young will very likely grow up to have to work in global industries and international environments."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01713,2018-03-05-T-004,1713,Ong Ye Kung,"Today, around two-thirds of all AU students do at least one overseas stint, in the form of academic exchanges, overseas internships or entrepreneurship experiences, or short project-based trips."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01714,2018-03-05-T-004,1714,Ong Ye Kung,"The Singapore Management University (SMU) and Singapore University of technology and Design (SUTD) are also focusing on exposing students to Southeast Asian countries, which form Singapore's immediate economic hinterland."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01715,2018-03-05-T-004,1715,Ong Ye Kung,"In particular, overseas entrepreneurship programmes, where students are attached to start-ups in the United States, Europe and Asia, are being ramped up rapidly in our AUs."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01716,2018-03-05-T-004,1716,Ong Ye Kung,"Start-up incubators, such as BLOCK71 and the Hangar at National University of Singapore (NUS), NTUitive at the National Technological University (NTU), as well as Pollinate, jointly set up by Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic, are all buzzing with activities."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01717,2018-03-05-T-004,1717,Ong Ye Kung,"Experiential learning also involves learning knowledge and skills that are contemporary, relevant, and hands-on."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01718,2018-03-05-T-004,1718,Ong Ye Kung,"At NUS, there is a strong emphasis on data science and Information Technology (IT). All students, whether you are learning Literature, Arts, History, Science or Engineering, must take compulsory modules on either quantitative reasoning or computational thinking. These are the foundational skills to coding and data analytics."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01719,2018-03-05-T-004,1719,Ong Ye Kung,"NTU too has announced that it will make courses in digital literacy compulsory for all students. SUTD made a similar move last week. This is a significant shift in IHL curriculum, and it has taken off across the board."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01720,2018-03-05-T-004,1720,Ong Ye Kung,"I visited our local engineering company, HOPE Technik, recently."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01721,2018-03-05-T-004,1721,Ong Ye Kung,"Members will know them for building the Red Rhinos for our Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). They are also building robots, autonomous vehicles and exoskeletons for many international customers."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01722,2018-03-05-T-004,1722,Ong Ye Kung,"When I asked how we can improve the education of engineers, one of the founders, Mr Peter Ho, an NUS alumnus, said that engineering students should learn how to weld. He said knowing welding means you can do prototyping, and that makes you a better engineer."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01723,2018-03-05-T-004,1723,Ong Ye Kung,"I think there is a lot of wisdom in that comment. It reflects a growing need to incorporate innovation and creativity into our curriculum. That is Applied Learning right there, as Minister Ng Chee Meng spoke about. I am not sure if in time our engineering students will all learn welding, but they do learn 3D printing today. And perhaps all engineering students should learn prototyping."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01724,2018-03-05-T-004,1724,Ong Ye Kung,"Let me now talk about how we can better support our students to discover their interests and aptitudes. The practice of IHLs today frontloading education and packing a lot of stuff into the first few years, is most stark in our Polytechnics, where students are funnelled into occupation-specific courses right from the start. Over time, courses also proliferated as employers wanted graduates with specialised skills, and wanted them fast."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01725,2018-03-05-T-004,1725,Ong Ye Kung,"But it is daunting and confusing for our young students, who at the age 16 or 17, have to choose amongst 230 courses. Most of them hardly know what work life is like, much less the work nature in these specific jobs."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01726,2018-03-05-T-004,1726,Ong Ye Kung,"As IHLs transform into centres for lifelong learning, this approach will change."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01727,2018-03-05-T-004,1727,Ong Ye Kung,"First, we will have more Common Entry Programmes (CEPs) at the Polytechnics, which Mr Seah Kian Peng asked about."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01728,2018-03-05-T-004,1728,Ong Ye Kung,"While there is always a small group of students who are very clear about what they want to do from a very young age, the majority of students will be in a self-discovery mode when entering Polytechnics. They may have an idea that they like engineering, IT, or social science, but find it too early to pick a course that is specific to an occupation."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01729,2018-03-05-T-004,1729,Ong Ye Kung,"For these students, therefore, I agree with Mr Seah Kian Peng that giving them more time to explore their interests will help; even an extra six months or one year is going to help."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01730,2018-03-05-T-004,1730,Ong Ye Kung,"Thus, from 2019, Polytechnics will offer more CEPs. CEPs comprise foundational modules common to a particular cluster of discipline, and students get to sample all of them and explore their interests."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01731,2018-03-05-T-004,1731,Ong Ye Kung,"Today, all Polytechnics already offer an Engineering CEP, and they will introduce two more CEPs – one in Business, and the second one in Information and Digital Technologies – two clusters. From next year, we expect the two new CEPs to account for 30% of these cluster intakes."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01732,2018-03-05-T-004,1732,Ong Ye Kung,"To illustrate, for a student in the Information and Digital Technologies cluster, he will take foundational courses in Computing Mathematics, Introduction to Programming and Networking Fundamentals in his first year. From his second year, he then decides on his specialisation. That will give them more time."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01733,2018-03-05-T-004,1733,Ong Ye Kung,"Second, we will also streamline Polytechnic courses. Over-specificity puts students at greater risk of being displaced when the industry changes. It can also stifle the versatility of students. By streamlining the course choices for students, we increase the career options for graduates."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01734,2018-03-05-T-004,1734,Ong Ye Kung,"Polytechnics will therefore reduce the number of courses by about 20% over the next two to three years, largely by streamlining and merging courses – we are consciously trading depth for more breadth and versatility. Let me emphasise, we are streamlining and reducing the number of courses to give students broader exposure – there is no fall in Polytechnic intake due to this change."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01735,2018-03-05-T-004,1735,Ong Ye Kung,"Third, strengthen Education and Career Guidance (ECG). The two changes I just spoke about need to be supplemented with a stronger and more systemic effort to guide students."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01736,2018-03-05-T-004,1736,Ong Ye Kung,"This has to start in Secondary schools, to help students get a broad sense of where their interests and strengths lie. This is where Applied Learning will really help. Typically, this falls into one of the following four domains – science and technology, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), social sciences and humanities, or the creative arts."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01737,2018-03-05-T-004,1737,Ong Ye Kung,"In the IHLs, the process will continue, to first expose students to knowledge and skills within their chosen cluster of disciplines, and then to help them identity their specialisation later on."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01738,2018-03-05-T-004,1738,Ong Ye Kung,"Towards the tail end of their IHL education, they will undergo industry attachment – like a capstone – to reaffirm their interest in their chosen career."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01739,2018-03-05-T-004,1739,Ong Ye Kung,"This is a systemic, self-discovery approach for students, which we will roll out to all the IHLs in the coming year."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01740,2018-03-05-T-004,1740,Ong Ye Kung,Stronger ECG ensures that more students can navigate the multiple education pathways available and choose the one most suitable for them. One such pathway is the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) which Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01741,2018-03-05-T-004,1741,Ong Ye Kung,"To give Members some background – today, Polytechnics mostly admit students who graduated with ""O"" Level certificates. They also take in a small group of students who graduated with Normal (Academic), or N(A), certificates."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01742,2018-03-05-T-004,1742,Ong Ye Kung,"These students from the N(A) stream did well for their ""N"" Level examinations, and are given a chance to go directly to the Polytechnics. We started the PFP in 2013 and the first batch just graduated in 2017."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01743,2018-03-05-T-004,1743,Ong Ye Kung,"The outcomes have been very encouraging, and maybe even surprising to some. Typically, 25% of every cohort score a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.5 and above. But for PFP students, 35% achieved it – 35% compared to 25% on average. The norm is that 55% of each cohort score GPA 3.0 and above, but 70% of PFP students achieved it. Dropout rates for PFP students are also much lower than average."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01744,2018-03-05-T-004,1744,Ong Ye Kung,How did they do so well? I asked the Polytechnic principals. They said being offered PFP greatly motivated the N(A) students. I also believe that it has something to do with the students' strong interest in the Polytechnic path that they chose.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01745,2018-03-05-T-004,1745,Ong Ye Kung,"There is an important lesson in education policy here. Given the right encouragement and a chance to prove themselves, especially in an area that they enjoy doing, the students will do their best and will have a good chance of doing well. This inner drive outweighs all the tuition and all the close supervision that is given to the students."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01746,2018-03-05-T-004,1746,Ong Ye Kung,"Today, PFP is open to students from the ""N"" Level stream who score an aggregate of 11 points and below. Given the success of the programme, we will expand it and extend it to students from the ""N"" Level stream with an aggregate score of 12 points and below. With this change, the number of students accepted every year will increase from about 1,200 today to 1,500."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01747,2018-03-05-T-004,1747,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked about aptitude-based admissions. Today, our IHLs' admission processes consider factors beyond academic accomplishments, to recognise students who have already discovered their interests and aptitudes. NUS just announced that it will give bonus points for first choice applications, to encourage students to pursue their interests and I really commend them for that."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01748,2018-03-05-T-004,1748,Ong Ye Kung,"However, this approach is not without problems. Polytechnic principals told me that since I announced and implemented that, they have been receiving many more appeals from students and parents. This is expected, and I thank the IHLs for looking at every single appeal carefully."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01749,2018-03-05-T-004,1749,Ong Ye Kung,"What students and parents need to understand is that passion and aptitude need to be demonstrated and is not declared, and that has to come through during the admission process."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01750,2018-03-05-T-004,1750,Ong Ye Kung,"For example, during my time, if a child likes airplanes, he would know every model of airplanes. He would go to Changi Airport as a past-time to see airplanes take off and land. And he would have the DVD of ""Top Gun"" and would have watched it 20 times."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01751,2018-03-05-T-004,1751,Ong Ye Kung,"This interest is demonstrated, and you cannot hide it. For example, since young, I have loved art and I spent all my time doodling – and I meant really all my time and I used to have a lot of work to show for it."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01752,2018-03-05-T-004,1752,Ong Ye Kung,"So, last year, we set the aptitude-based admissions target for the IHLs at 15% of their intake cohorts. The institutions have made good strides but they have not fully used the quota, so I will leave the target at 15% for now."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01753,2018-03-05-T-004,1753,Ong Ye Kung,"However, there is scope for us to do more at ITE. Ideally, admission to vocational training pathways should predominantly be aptitude-based. There are practical constraints, such as course capacity or the industries' ability to absorb these graduates – but where possible, we want every student to enter a vocation of his liking."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01754,2018-03-05-T-004,1754,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01755,2018-03-05-T-004,1755,Ong Ye Kung,"ITE will embark on a review of its admission system, to rely more on assessing students’ aptitude through interviews and review of portfolios. The revised system will be implemented in stages from the 2019 admissions cycle, starting with selected courses in the Business, Hospitality, and ICT sectors."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01756,2018-03-05-T-004,1756,Ong Ye Kung,"I also note Ms Denise Phua's two examples of students he ""N"" Level stream who like art but were unable to get into LaSalle or NAFA, and that is because they require a minimum of ""O"" Level certificates. We will review that. After all, we have PFP programme that allow students from the ""N"" Level stream to go to a Diploma programme in Polytechnics. So, we will review that, and thank you for the feedback."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01757,2018-03-05-T-004,1757,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01758,2018-03-05-T-004,1758,Ong Ye Kung,"Next, let me talk about deepening what we learn, through lifelong learning. Ms Foo Mee Har asked about the status and future plans of SkillsFuture. It is a long-term movement. I thank Deputy Prime Minister Tharman for his assessment that we are a third there; actually, I think it is more like a quarter."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01759,2018-03-05-T-004,1759,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01760,2018-03-05-T-004,1760,Ong Ye Kung,"SkillsFuture is not just the SkillsFuture Credit as we all know. Neither is it just about getting IHLs to deliver training programmes for adults. It requires a transformation of the education system as we know it; it requires our young to uncover their interests and passions and commit to learning their whole life; it requires employers, private training providers, and IHLs to all do their part for lifelong learning; it requires society to celebrate and recognise a broad range of achievements and success."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01761,2018-03-05-T-004,1761,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01762,2018-03-05-T-004,1762,Ong Ye Kung,"The IHLs can play a bigger role in our future plans for SkillsFuture. They have studied the Industry Transformation Maps, gotten feedback from industry partners, and have launched around 800 industry-relevant modular courses since October last year."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01763,2018-03-05-T-004,1763,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01764,2018-03-05-T-004,1764,Ong Ye Kung,"They are collectively known as the SkillsFuture Series, and cover a wide range of disciplines. ICT is a key focus of the IHLs. It is a rich area. I think there is value for each IHL to contribute. And there will be some overlap, but I do not think it is a problem so long as the demand is strong. And over time, each IHL will find its niche and the landscape will settle."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01765,2018-03-05-T-004,1765,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01766,2018-03-05-T-004,1766,Ong Ye Kung,"These courses are funded at up to 70% upfront, so that fees are significantly lower. Many will be structured as Professional Conversion Programmes, where funding will be even more generous."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01767,2018-03-05-T-004,1767,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01768,2018-03-05-T-004,1768,Ong Ye Kung,"As of February this year, more than 4,900 adult learners have enrolled in SkillsFuture Series courses. So, it is not too bad. The IHLs will develop more modular courses in the coming year, and sharpen their focus to meet industry's evolving needs."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01769,2018-03-05-T-004,1769,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01770,2018-03-05-T-004,1770,Ong Ye Kung,"By 2020, we expect to have increased the annual funding of IHL lifelong learning programmes by $100 million, up from about $210 million per year today."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01771,2018-03-05-T-004,1771,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01772,2018-03-05-T-004,1772,Ong Ye Kung,"As the IHLs roll out more modular courses, the AUs will re-package certain courses to create pathways that lead to smaller qualifications – often referred to as ""micro-credentials"". These micro-credentials comprise only modules targeted at developing expertise for work, and as Dr Lim Wee Kiak said, can be useful in providing a milestone for adult learners to aim towards and which employers can recognise."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01773,2018-03-05-T-004,1773,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01774,2018-03-05-T-004,1774,Ong Ye Kung,"However, we should be careful not to let such micro-credentials become a new arms race to collect credentials. IHLs should instead focus on imparting skills and knowledge needed by industry, and package them into a nice bundle that represents a meaningful upgrading of skills and know-how. Learners too, should focus on picking up what is necessary for their work and for their careers."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01775,2018-03-05-T-004,1775,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01776,2018-03-05-T-004,1776,Ong Ye Kung,"Our AUs will progressively roll out more of such micro-credentials in the coming years, and subject them to the market test."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01777,2018-03-05-T-004,1777,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01778,2018-03-05-T-004,1778,Ong Ye Kung,"As we step up support for SkillsFuture Series courses, we also reviewed the way we fund Postgraduate by Coursework programmes at our universities, namely Master's by Coursework and Postgraduate Diplomas. Mr Henry Kwek and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked for an update on the review."

Hence, from 2019, for the majority of MOE-funded Postgraduate by Coursework programmes, the subsidy level for Permanent Residents will be adjusted slightly downwards, while that for international students will be discontinued. However, there will be no change in the subsidy level for Singaporeans. This will free up around $25 million in budget each year, which will be re-channelled to support modular courses at our IHLs for our local workforce."

Mr Ang Wei Neng is right that gone are the days where a degree can last someone a lifetime. NUS is blazing the trail in this regard."

The response was overwhelming, and alumni started to attend classes side by side with young undergraduates. Encouraged by the good response, NUS is expanding it into a programme called NUS Lifelong Learners, or L3."

It will help their students build their careers and learn for life during this period. This gives new meaning to the word ""alumni"". I am sure this change in mindset will spread to all IHLs."

It is natural for parents to want to bring them up impeccably – from the night feeds when they are babies, helping them with homework when they are in Primary school, taking leave when they are taking PSLE, attending Open Houses at the IHLs with them, interviewing their boyfriends and girlfriends.

We must now foster human ingenuity and resilience so that our children can thrive in a future we cannot yet discern.

Today, 91% of our Primary schools offer the Conversational Malay Programme or similar school-based programmes. This equips our students with some grounding of the Malay language so that they can pick up the language more easily should they need it for economic or other reasons in their adult lives. Making it compulsory for all Primary students may not be feasible with a number of competing demands on our students’ attention. The current model where the learning of a third language is encouraged but remains optional is a balanced approach."

The school’s Learning for Life Programme is Environmental Education, and they partner with an industry partner, Greenpac, which is a big advocate for green practices to teach the students grow and harvest their own vegetables using a hydroponics system. The students benefitted tremendously from this partnership as life cycles of plants, a topic in the Primary 3 Science syllabus, came to life. This is what Applied Learning is all about, where our students learn by doing and experience the real-world application of sustainable farming. As their Values-In-Action project, the students further collaborated with the Residents’ Committee to share their harvest with the community. They also got the canteen vendors to cook the vegetables for the whole school to savour the vegetables of their labour during recess. These are small but important steps in guiding our students to care for others and contribute to the community within their means."

However, as the Malay saying goes, ""Sedikit-sedikit, lama-lama jadi bukit, sehari selembar benang, lama-lama menjadi kain"", meaning a little effort in time makes a hill, and a thread woven becomes a cloth.

First, our schools are instrumental in providing a nurturing environment for students to learn and explore their MTLs. With the support of the three Mother Tongue Language Promotion Committees and Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism, local arts and cultural groups, media as well as grassroots organisations, our schools have been incorporating various creative ways to express the languages, including xinyao, comic writing, radio drama writing, community tours and even games, in their teaching of MTLs."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01858,2018-03-05-T-004,1858,Low Yen Ling,"For example, teachers in Jing Shan Primary School developed a platform called ""Story Village"" that lets students improve their Chinese through interactive games and interesting stories. The more proficient learners can even help their friends learn the language by creating new game software in Chinese."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01859,2018-03-05-T-004,1859,Low Yen Ling,"Through such innovative MTL teaching, we hope that the learning of MTLs becomes a part of the students' everyday life. MTL is not just a subject, it is a live language. As Minister Ng has mentioned, real-life application can help make the MTLs come alive. Hence, we seek to cultivate students’ interest to continue learning and using their MTLs by ensuring that MTL learning is engaging and relevant."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01860,2018-03-05-T-004,1860,Low Yen Ling,"Second, we hope to create a vibrant and supportive environment for MTL learning beyond schools. We encourage parents to use the MTL with their children. This can involve day-to-day activities such as watching a show or movie, listening to songs or reading a book in their MTL with the children. We will also provide parents with various resources to support their teaching of MTL to their children."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01861,2018-03-05-T-004,1861,Low Yen Ling,"One example is the Annual Mother Tongue Language Symposium (MTLS), which brings together many experts and specialists to share tips and resources with parents on the teaching of MTLs. Last year, more than 15,000 parents, educators and students participated in and benefitted from this symposium. In addition, parents can use the interactive iMTL portal with their children at home, to help and guide their children to learn and practise MTLs at their own pace."

Our local arts and cultural groups, media as well as grassroots organisations can also provide rich contexts to excite our students to use their MTLs. For example, the Indian Heritage Centre worked with the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee to develop a Discovery Kit that lets students practise the language as they explore the centre."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01864,2018-03-05-T-004,1864,Low Yen Ling,"Like the learning of many skills today – Members have heard from the Ministers, the Senior Minister of State, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary – the learning of our MTLs does not stop after we leave school. As adults, we can also build on the foundation we received in school and continue to build on our language proficiency later in life and throughout life. There are now 190 MTL-related SkillsFuture Credit courses supporting lifelong MTL learning. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce Institute of Business will also be introducing Business Chinese programmes in Community Centres for easy access by adult learners."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01865,2018-03-05-T-004,1865,Low Yen Ling,"Besides strengthening our proficiency in MTLs, what are the other work-relevant skills that we need to develop to face and thrive in the future economy? This is really what the SkillsFuture is all about. And Members have heard Minister Ong Ye Kung talking about it earlier."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01866,2018-03-05-T-004,1866,Low Yen Ling,"I agree with Assoc Prof Randolph Tan that literacy and ICT skills are critical skills for our workforce. This is why our WSQ framework includes Workplace Literacy and Numeracy as well as International Computing Driving Licence courses. ICT is also the top area of training that is supported by SkillsFuture Credit. Over 6,000 Singaporeans have picked up useful IT skills under the SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace initiative, such as using e-payment platforms, using social media and even starting an e-business."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01867,2018-03-05-T-004,1867,Low Yen Ling,"Dr Intan asked about the impact of the SkillsFuture movement. Awareness of the SkillsFuture movement among Singaporeans has improved from 45% in January 2016 to 70% in December last year. According to the WSQ Outcomes Evaluation Survey 2016, 90% of respondents indicated that their WSQ training has helped them work more effectively and more efficiently, and 72% found that it had facilitated their job search. More than 1,700 Polytechnic and ITE graduates have participated in the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme and more than 2,400 Singaporeans have been awarded the SkillsFuture Study Awards."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01868,2018-03-05-T-004,1868,Low Yen Ling,"Nonetheless, some Singaporeans may need help to navigate the training landscape, as Dr Intan has pointed out. Our schools and our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have strengthened their Education and Career Guidance efforts to help students better appreciate the strengths and passions that they possess, and also better understand the available education and career opportunities. To help Singaporeans make informed decisions, SSG publishes key information, such as the Private Education Institution (PEI) Graduate Employment Survey and trainees' ratings on the course quality and outcomes of SSG-supported courses. This information transparency spurs the PEIs to keep their programmes industry-relevant and graduates' skills employable."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01869,2018-03-05-T-004,1869,Low Yen Ling,"To encourage and facilitate our people's training journey, we have tailored and personalised the MySkillsFuture portal to meet individual training needs. This portal allows users to access industry information and search for jobs and training opportunities according to their interests. On this website, we also highlight exemplary employers who are avid supporters of staff training. In the two months following its launch, the portal has attracted more than 1.9 million page views, with more than 270,000 users having logged in. Come later part of this year, Singaporeans can look forward to a customised SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme portal that shows available places and participating employers."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01870,2018-03-05-T-004,1870,Low Yen Ling,"To broaden our public outreach, we have partnered our five Community Development Councils to introduce SkillsFuture Advice workshops to help Singaporeans understand work trends and workplace skills needed. Ms Evangeline Boo is one of the 4,600 Singaporeans who have benefitted from this move. Through the SkillsFuture Advice workshop, she became more aware of her own training needs. She now actively uses the MySkillsFuture portal to search for leadership and management courses to improve her work as a director."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01871,2018-03-05-T-004,1871,Low Yen Ling,"As Minister Ong had mentioned, we will continue to expand the learning options for Singaporeans and that includes working with IHLs to introduce more courses for adult learners."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01872,2018-03-05-T-004,1872,Low Yen Ling,"Part of this will involve resourcing IHLs with the best talents, local and foreign, for teaching and research. Mr Seah Kian Peng asked about the local representation in our Autonomous Universities (AUs). Our AUs are national institutions and it is certainly important that they continue to have a strong Singaporean Core who understand our local issues well. We have introduced the Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent Scheme in 2015 and awarded 77 scholarships to aspiring Singaporean academics so far."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01873,2018-03-05-T-004,1873,Low Yen Ling,"Together with our parents and partners, we will continue to strive to equip and empower Singaporeans in their lifelong learning journey ahead so that we can all gear up to seize the opportunities in the future."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01874,2018-03-05-T-004,1874,,We have some time for clarifications. Ms Denise Phua.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01875,2018-03-05-T-004,1875,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"I have some questions. To the Senior Minister of State, who could have been distracted by Member Leon Perera's suggestion to have Members of Parliament help conduct political education in schools, but this is not about that. You did not respond specifically to my recommendation to strengthen and further resource the existing support model for students with special needs in mainstream schools from Primary to Secondary to IHLs. The feedback is that the resources are insufficient and the model is quite inadequate. So, I seek your consideration for that."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01876,2018-03-05-T-004,1876,Denise Phua Lay Peng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01877,2018-03-05-T-004,1877,Denise Phua Lay Peng,The second clarification is also my second time request for a Special Education (SPED) Academy to place more strategic priority and focus so that we can create lifelong learners as well out of the special needs population. Just like NUS adopts its alumni now and see their students or look at their graduates over a 20-year timeframe. I wonder if we could do the same for SPED.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01878,2018-03-05-T-004,1878,Denise Phua Lay Peng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01879,2018-03-05-T-004,1879,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"The next clarification is addressed to the two Ministers. It sounds like MOE has got its act altogether and that you have covered all grounds. I was just wondering in the future that is constantly disrupted and most times unpredictable, how do you navigate a space like this, how to ensure more learner agility amongst our students and even more self-directed learning from a very young age."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01880,2018-03-05-T-004,1880,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank Ms Phua for the follow-up questions. Indeed, we want to strengthen support but the question is how. I think Ms Phua and many others will appreciate that the SPED space is not homogenous, with very varied challenges, very varied needs. When I describe things like the structures that we have or the 80% of students with special education needs in our mainstream schools, that is not a model. That is not a target. That is an outcome of the approach that we are taking. We currently have a space with a wide variety of service delivery models and a wide variety of structures. So, we have to take a little bit of a step back and have a sense that there really is no clear single answer about a single best model."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01881,2018-03-05-T-004,1881,Janil Puthucheary,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01882,2018-03-05-T-004,1882,Janil Puthucheary,"But there are some common challenges that we need to address in terms of strengthening our support. The biggest single challenge actually is professional capability. So, when we look at what we are doing now in our schools, the mainstream schools, the MOE-funded SPED schools, our VWO partners, the biggest single challenge is to not just have enough of the professionals but actually deepen the capabilities of those professionals. That is the biggest single focus of the work that we are doing. So, the answer to her first question is yes."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01883,2018-03-05-T-004,1883,Janil Puthucheary,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01884,2018-03-05-T-004,1884,Janil Puthucheary,"To the SPED Academy, it is something that we will seriously study, we are quite open to improving and updating and refreshing how we do the different models of SPED delivery. There is no single model of SPED delivery and we are quite open to studying further models."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01885,2018-03-05-T-004,1885,Ng Chee Meng,"I thank Ms Denise Phua for her questions. As a system we remain open-minded, as open-minded as possible, not to be blind-sided by different trends that may surface. Some trends would be relevant, some trends may fade. But we examine it in totality. Structurally, we do reviews in MOE periodically across all different subjects and we do benchmarking with renowned institutions around the world and we also go on study visits."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01886,2018-03-05-T-004,1886,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01887,2018-03-05-T-004,1887,Ng Chee Meng,"For example, I went to Australia. My staff actually asked me, ""What you would like to learn in Australia?"" I wanted to look at outdoor education and how it would strengthen a perceived weakness in our own system. So, we look at different systems to learn new things. We also have research and development arms set up in NIE and MOE. These research entities plug into the world institutions where they do research on pedagogical updates, heutagogical or andragogical updates. We are always trying to keep at the forefront of developments. But always, as I said earlier, remembering to customise it to our Singapore context."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01888,2018-03-05-T-004,1888,Ong Ye Kung,"Chairman, a short reply to Ms Denise Phua because she asked the Ministers. The short answer is help the students find what they love to do. If it is something they love to do, they will be self-directed and they will learn their whole life. That is we are focussing on."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01889,2018-03-05-T-004,1889,Seah Kian Peng,"Chairman, just two short clarifications. The first is addressed to Minister Ng Chee Meng. In my cut, I talked about Ministry's views or actions over the burgeoning expenditure on tuition and how I feel this disadvantages students of lower socio-economic background. So, I would like Minister's response to that. What can we do to address that?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01890,2018-03-05-T-004,1890,Seah Kian Peng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01891,2018-03-05-T-004,1891,Seah Kian Peng,"The second clarification is directed to Senior Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling. The composition of local academics in context sensitive faculties in our local universities. What is the Ministry's views towards this? Is there a need, is there a deliberate attempt to increase this composition, or this number?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01892,2018-03-05-T-004,1892,,Minister Ng.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01893,2018-03-05-T-004,1893,Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the clarification. To assist our students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, this is always a work-in-progress. We will do our best but it will never be an ending where we will be happy with it."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01894,2018-03-05-T-004,1894,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01895,2018-03-05-T-004,1895,Ng Chee Meng,"You can see from the different programmes that we have started. MOE Kindergartens (MKs) is a key example. When we started the kindergartens, we wanted to address these disadvantages, and bring disadvantaged students to as equal a starting line as possible. In MKs, we reserve one-third of our places for children from the lower socio-economic backgrounds. We provide the different financial schemes. I have said in my speech the different levelling up of criteria, including for Edusave."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01896,2018-03-05-T-004,1896,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01897,2018-03-05-T-004,1897,Ng Chee Meng,"We also, in our schools, pay very, very high attention to learning support programmes for students coming into our Primary schools at Primary 1. If they are slower, whether in the languages, in English or in Mathematics, we have different programmes to support them in Primary 1 and Primary 2, and we extend it all the way to Primary 6 if required. Most of the kids do well and they graduate from these support programmes by the time they are at Primary 3."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01898,2018-03-05-T-004,1898,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01899,2018-03-05-T-004,1899,Ng Chee Meng,We also have designed after school areas. It is almost like a relax area where a Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) person or teacher stays back to supervise them. They get to hang out in a cool room where there is play but only after they have done their homework parts.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01900,2018-03-05-T-004,1900,Ng Chee Meng,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01901,2018-03-05-T-004,1901,Ng Chee Meng,"I have my own experience through the family support services where we also partner with Family Service Centres (FSCs). Children from lower socio-economic status backgrounds may not have a conducive home environment. We partner the community services to make sure that they are well looked after and well supervised so that they are not distracted. But there are ground realities that we have to cope with – family circumstances, even family abuse. All these are difficult, entrenched problems that we face. Our teachers even tell me sometimes that they wake up earlier in the morning, and go to the flat of the students to bring them to school."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01902,2018-03-05-T-004,1902,,May I request that the Ministers keep their replies short as well.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01903,2018-03-05-T-004,1903,Ong Ye Kung,"Yes, I will. Today, for faculty, both tenured and non-tenured, the split between local and foreign faculties is about 50-50. If you look at University leaders – Deans and above – it is about 70% Singaporeans, 30% foreigners. Quite in line with Minister Lim Swee Say's ""two-third plus one-third, more than one""."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01904,2018-03-05-T-004,1904,Ong Ye Kung,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01905,2018-03-05-T-004,1905,Ong Ye Kung,"But on your question, I fully agree with you, all our Universities are national universities. They must understand local issues, Singapore's and our region's challenges and they must understand the context of Singapore. Faculty who understand the context of Singapore can be locals, and can be foreigners. So long as they understand the context, they do research and teaching that is within that context, we welcome them. Having said that, we do want to develop local scholars that will rise up through the ranks and they are Singaporeans, and they do meaningful local research, that is why we have the Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent (START) programme."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01906,2018-03-05-T-004,1906,,Mr Leon Perera.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01907,2018-03-05-T-004,1907,Leon Perera,"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Senior Minister of State Dr Puthucheary for responding to my cut. I just have four clarification questions."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01908,2018-03-05-T-004,1908,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01909,2018-03-05-T-004,1909,Leon Perera,"Firstly, can the hon Senior Minister of State confirm that Ministers and Grassroots Advisors (GRAs) can actually officially attend events in schools and interact with students? He did not directly reply to me; so, again, I would just like to ask him if he could directly reply to confirm that point."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01910,2018-03-05-T-004,1910,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01911,2018-03-05-T-004,1911,Leon Perera,"Secondly, is it the case that in the past, Members of Parliament could attend events in schools in their MP capacity. I cited some facts that would seem to suggest that is the case but I am not sure, so I am not making any assertion, I am just posing a question. Was it the case in the past that MPs could attend events in schools in their MP capacity and if so, why was that then not deemed to be partisan politics?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01912,2018-03-05-T-004,1912,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01913,2018-03-05-T-004,1913,Leon Perera,"The third question linked to the first two, if that was the case, then when was this policy changed, and why was it changed at the time it was changed?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01914,2018-03-05-T-004,1914,Leon Perera,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01915,2018-03-05-T-004,1915,Leon Perera,"Lastly, I am just going to take another crack at this. If Ministers and GRAs can attend events in schools and interact with students, as Ministers and GRAs, following a certain set of rules and that is not deemed to be partisan, why cannot Members of this House from other parties and also NMPs similarly interact with students following exactly the same rules? Why would the one set of interactions be deemed to be inherently and by definition non-partisan, the other inherently and by definition partisan?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01916,2018-03-05-T-004,1916,,Senior Minister of State.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01917,2018-03-05-T-004,1917,Janil Puthucheary,"May I begin by asking Mr Perera for a little bit of clarity from his initial cut. Has he attended a school and interacted with students? If so, in what capacity?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01918,2018-03-05-T-004,1918,Leon Perera,"Yes, I did. I alluded to that in my cut speech. I attended one event in my private sector capacity. And in that capacity, I only spoke about one aspect of my private sector work, did not touch on anything to do with my role as a Member of Parliament or perspectives on current affairs, public matters and so on."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01919,2018-03-05-T-004,1919,Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Perera is clear that he is able to separate out his partisan political views from attending and interacting with people in other capacities. So, that is the answer to Question 4. Anybody can attend the school; it has got to be a question of what capacity you attend in, and that drives your behaviour in the school."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01920,2018-03-05-T-004,1920,Janil Puthucheary,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01921,2018-03-05-T-004,1921,Janil Puthucheary,"All kinds of people can have political views. People who drive buses, people who prepare our food, our teachers. But you have to be very clear about the role in which one attends and interacts with students. So, that answers your fourth question. And that is the basis for the first question. People do attend, and they do so in a very clear capacity that is non-partisan in nature."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01922,2018-03-05-T-004,1922,Janil Puthucheary,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01923,2018-03-05-T-004,1923,Janil Puthucheary,"In the past, the policy was the same. So, the specific instance that he referred to, I believe, does not actually specify the capacity in which the person was speaking at the school or meeting the school. It was those years in his capacity as an MP. So, my reading of the exact same text that he has quoted is that what was referenced was the time in years that he had spent as an MP, not that he was attending the school in his capacity as an MP. I think that point is really quite clear if one reads the text properly and is not seeking a derived meaning from it. Have I answered Mr Perera's question?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01924,2018-03-05-T-004,1924,,"Mr Perera, I have to call Miss Cheng Li Hui first."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01925,2018-03-05-T-004,1925,Cheng Li Hui,"Question for the Minister. Will MOE Kindergarten be taking in and have more progress for mild to moderate special needs children? It is sometimes hard for parents of special needs children to find pre-schools that are willing to take in their children. For example, we have some special needs children in my PCF centres in Tampines, but they are no longer Tampines residents. They have moved out but when they moved to a new estate, they have problems finding another pre-school who are willing to take in their children. Since MK is extending to more estates, can MK play a bigger role in this?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01926,2018-03-05-T-004,1926,Cheng Li Hui,"After checking with some teachers, they say that MK does not have enough special needs programmes as well. So, can you just clarify on this?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01927,2018-03-05-T-004,1927,Cheng Li Hui,
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01928,2018-03-05-T-004,1928,Cheng Li Hui,"I also have another question that is a bit more for ECDA and MSF, but it is about pre-schools. Can there be more funding and training for teachers who care for and teach special needs children? Because they have some problems in terms of the timing, as the core curriculum is only four hours but the DSP programme comes in during the four hours and take the children out for one hour. The teachers feel that they can actually do that after-hours."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01929,2018-03-05-T-004,1929,Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Chairman, the short answer is, yes, we have some capability to support special needs children in MK, but these are very nascent. We will develop more support programmes and we will be building towards that."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01930,2018-03-05-T-004,1930,,"Mr Leon Perera, do you want to clarify?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01931,2018-03-05-T-004,1931,Leon Perera,Yes.
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01932,2018-03-05-T-004,1932,,"Okay. He has already answered. So, unless it is a new point. We do not want to go into a debate on this issue."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01933,2018-03-05-T-004,1933,Leon Perera,"bsolutely, yes. Just to clarify the answer that the hon Senior Minister of State gave. I have come across websites of schools which have chronologies of past events where the events describe a Member of Parliament (MP) attending in their MP capacity before 2011 or thereabouts, and the grassroots adviser attending after 2011 or so. So, in the context of this sort of information, I would just like to confirm again ‒ and this is really my last point ‒ is it the case that that has always been the policy that MPs cannot attend in their MP capacity and only in their grassroots adviser capacity?"
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01934,2018-03-05-T-004,1934,Janil Puthucheary,"That is correct. There is no change. When I go to visit SAFRA, which I have done recently, on the banner, it said that ""Visit by Dr Janil Puthucheary"". I was not there in my medical capacity."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01935,2018-03-05-T-004,1935,Intan Azura Mokhtar,"Chairman, I would like to address this to the Minister for Education (Schools). I am happy to know that the Applied Learning Programme will be rolled out to all our Primary schools. Can I clarify that together with that, there will also be a review of the textbooks and activity books used in the Primary schools because at this point in time, as a parent, I can share with you feedback that there is too much repetitive learning and rote learning in our activity books and worksheets given to students? So, in order to ensure that there is applied learning done in schools, I think there should be a lot more practice where the skills are learnt in a contextual manner."
2018-03-05-T-004-S-01936,2018-03-05-T-004,1936,Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Chairman, yes, curriculum and textbooks are reviewed periodically in MOE. We will continue with this process to make sure our teaching materials are properly updated."

Mr Chairman, Nelson Mandela once said that education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. So, on behalf of all my colleagues here, I would like to thank the entire MOE team ‒ the support staff must be somewhere around in the building ‒ for helping us to change the world for the better for all of our students, families and professionals. Thank you so much, and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment."

Examples include the industry digital plans launched for the logistics and retail sectors in 2017, while at the SME level, the SME digital tech hub and solutions for SMEs have been set-up."

Perhaps we can also learn on what more can be done to help our SMEs go digital? Besides the logistics and retail, what other sectors will be considered for digital transformation?"

The Act aims to strengthen our nation’s cybersecurity defences, especially those involving critical information infrastructure.

Mr Chairman, please allow me to continue my speech in Malay."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01970,2018-03-05-T-005,1970,Zaqy Mohamad,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Digital skills have become a fundamental and important asset in today’s economy and for the future. Many careers and businesses depend not only on digital technology but also relevant skills like data analysis, in order to compete."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01971,2018-03-05-T-005,1971,Zaqy Mohamad,"Without digital knowledge and skills, career progression will be hampered and the way businesses are done will also be limited. We have no other choice, and must undergo this transformation to survive in the future."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01972,2018-03-05-T-005,1972,Zaqy Mohamad,"In the business world, we saw a trend of more Malay entrepreneurs moving to online platforms to conduct their business as well as grow their companies, not only for the local market but also regionally and globally."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01973,2018-03-05-T-005,1973,Zaqy Mohamad,"However, much more can be done for them to progress and be identified as a regional and global player."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01974,2018-03-05-T-005,1974,Zaqy Mohamad,"The same goes for businessmen in areas such as F&B, retail and logistics who need to utilize digital technology and data analysis skills."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01975,2018-03-05-T-005,1975,Zaqy Mohamad,"Such digital skills, at least at the basic level, must be acquired by workers at all levels, including professionals. This is also important for those who are entering the workforce, regardless of industry. Every job, be it technicians or professionals, needs digital skills in order to perform their roles more effectively and productively in this digital era."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01976,2018-03-05-T-005,1976,Zaqy Mohamad,"In terms of info-comm careers, many opportunities have been made available currently to help prepare for a digital future. In fact, the Ministry of Communications and Information estimated that this sector requires thousands of info-comm workers in a few years’ time."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01977,2018-03-05-T-005,1977,Zaqy Mohamad,"Apart from workers, businessmen will also need to look at this trend and how it can affect their businesses, if they fail to make immediate preparations for this digital world. Some of them have to engage in partnerships, for instance, when entering the global market, in order to become more effective."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01978,2018-03-05-T-005,1978,Zaqy Mohamad,"In this regard, what are the Ministry's plans and efforts to help, especially small and medium enterprises, so that they can move quicker to join the digital wave?"

With the improvements in machine learning, AI can enhance its accuracy in diagnostic work, facilitate intelligent surveillance round the clock, and improve productivity through the reduction of manpower and the streamlining of work processes."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01982,2018-03-05-T-005,1982,Teo Ho Pin,"Sir, given the applications of AI being explored and the ethical questions that may arise such as personal data protection, are there plans by the Ministry to introduce regulatory frameworks to guide AI deployments and ensure that Singaporean society is ready to accept the effects of the adoption of cutting edge AI?"

2018-03-05-T-005-S-01984,2018-03-05-T-005,1984,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,"Mr Chairman, my cut today is on the digital economy as well. Over the last two decades, digital computing technologies have rapidly changed the world, with far ranging implications on businesses and consumers. Particularly, the pace of adoption of digital technologies have accelerated over the recent years. Adoption of digital technologies have resulted in a very connected world, empowering individuals and transforming how businesses and governments operate."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01985,2018-03-05-T-005,1985,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,"There are many benefits to a digital economy. Higher productivity, enhanced quality of life, better jobs, and the list goes on. There are many reasons to be optimistic about Singapore’s future in such an economy if we get a few core strategies right. This is a subject which I will return to discuss later."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01986,2018-03-05-T-005,1986,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,"First, why am I optimistic? Traditional factors of production like land, labour and capital will no longer constrain the economic expansion of a small island state like Singapore."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01987,2018-03-05-T-005,1987,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,"The Worldwide Web will be our land. Goods can be produced and can be sold anywhere through e-commerce. Through the Internet, we can also access labour anywhere. American high school teachers are teaching English Language to Primary school students in China through the Internet. This has become a thriving business for companies like VIPKID, which provides international elementary school experience to half a million registered Chinese students online."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01988,2018-03-05-T-005,1988,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,"Capital can be raised in any stock exchanges through angel investors, venture capitalists or even through crowd funding. All one needs is a sound business idea and persuasive skills."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01989,2018-03-05-T-005,1989,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,"So, instead of Land, Labour and Capital, as traditional factors of production, we are now seeing a new factor of production. And this is data."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01990,2018-03-05-T-005,1990,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,"For machine learning and Artificial Intelligence to thrive, one would need data sets. And lots of them. Here, Singapore is currently at a disadvantage. We have a small population and our privacy laws as they currently stand do not make for easy access to data. Data are also collected and stored separately even within different branches of Government and not freely shared. They are compartmentalised and do not lend themselves to analyses or deep insights which can help reduce pain points, improve asset utilisation or provide for a more tailored and customised service. And the list goes on."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01991,2018-03-05-T-005,1991,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Could the Minister lay out his plans to revisit our privacy laws to strike the right balance against data abuse even as we allow for data sets to be used for analysis for legitimate enterprise or government applications?
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01992,2018-03-05-T-005,1992,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,

2018-03-05-T-005-S-01994,2018-03-05-T-005,1994,Ong Teng Koon,"In the ""good old days"", film and TV students made content; broadcasters and cinemas distributed them; and the average man on the street consumed the content."

2018-03-05-T-005-S-01996,2018-03-05-T-005,1996,Ong Teng Koon,"Nowadays, everybody is both a consumer and the producer of content, using platforms like Facebook, Instagram or YouTube to share the content they create with the entire world."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01997,2018-03-05-T-005,1997,Ong Teng Koon,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01998,2018-03-05-T-005,1998,Ong Teng Koon,"It is in some ways amazing that these open platforms give each individuals so much power to communicate with the world – anybody, even a young child, and go viral if they create good content. However, this openness creates its own challenges, since the platforms do not own the content that they carry. If objectionable content is found on YouTube or Facebook, it is not always easy to assign responsibility and have it removed."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-01999,2018-03-05-T-005,1999,Ong Teng Koon,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02000,2018-03-05-T-005,2000,Ong Teng Koon,"We have continued advances in artificial intelligence and additional complication arises in the form of bots. They are programs which masquerade as real humans, adding to the noise on the internet. These can have serious consequences, as the recent revelations about the impact of Russian bots on the US elections show."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02001,2018-03-05-T-005,2001,Ong Teng Koon,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02002,2018-03-05-T-005,2002,Ong Teng Koon,"As technology continues to advance, we can only imagine that such threats will continue to grow. It was therefore a forward-looking move to merge IDA and MDA to better position the joint entity to deal with the fast-changing environment."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02003,2018-03-05-T-005,2003,Ong Teng Koon,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02004,2018-03-05-T-005,2004,Ong Teng Koon,"I would like to ask the Minister what does MCI see as the main regulatory challenges in the converged infocomm and media environment, and how will IMDA address them."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02005,2018-03-05-T-005,2005,,"Ms Sun Xueling, you have three cuts. Can you take all three together?"
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02006,2018-03-05-T-005,2006,,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02007,2018-03-05-T-005,2007,Sun Xueling,"Chairman, we recently debated the Cybersecurity Bill in Parliament which looks at 11 critical information infrastructure systems. But Singapore’s cybersecurity is more than that. Our regular businesses and individuals also need to practise cybersecurity."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02008,2018-03-05-T-005,2008,Sun Xueling,"Given how plugged in we are, as a country and as a people, every computer in our system can become a conduit in which to launch cyber attacks."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02009,2018-03-05-T-005,2009,Sun Xueling,"The Cybersecurity Agency (CSA) commissioned a survey last year to find out Singaporean attitudes to cybersecurity. It was discovered that one in three respondents did not manage their passwords securely – they store them on computers, write them down or use the same password for multiple accounts. For almost half the survey respondents, they did not conduct virus scans on their devices and files and used open, non-password protected wi-fi networks in public places."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02010,2018-03-05-T-005,2010,Sun Xueling,The risks to us as a country is thus large as there are many open gateways through which we can be hacked. How then can the Government work with businesses and educate the public on how to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents?
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02011,2018-03-05-T-005,2011,Sun Xueling,"As we work with SMEs to encourage them to leverage on digitalisation to increase productivity, can we also take the opportunity to educate them on cybersecurity and encourage them to take appropriate precautions? Can the SME Centres set up to help SMEs embrace digitalisation also be equipped to provide cybersecurity awareness training to SMEs?"
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02012,2018-03-05-T-005,2012,Sun Xueling,"For the public, can we work on two groups of individuals in particular? To the elderly who may give out personal details freely when asked, can we work through grassroots organisations to provide fundamental cybersecurity awareness to them? And to our young who will use online resources increasingly in schools, can we include cybersecurity training as part of their school curriculum?"
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02013,2018-03-05-T-005,2013,Sun Xueling,"CSA launched the ""Live Savvy with Cybersecurity"" campaign last year. Such general awareness campaigns are useful to inculcate awareness of cyber threats to mass audiences. Awareness is the first step. Then we can discuss the steps we can take collectively to avoid being victims of cyber attacks."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02014,2018-03-05-T-005,2014,Sun Xueling,"My second cut. The benefits of digitalisation to the economy is apparent. However, when we look at the rate of adoption of digitalisation by SMEs in Singapore, since the SMEs Go Digital Programme was launched last year, only a few hundred SMEs have adopted digital technology using 30 out of the 56 pre-approved solutions by IMDA. Given the close to 180,000 SMEs we have in Singapore, how can we promote wider adoption of digital technologies?"
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02015,2018-03-05-T-005,2015,Sun Xueling,"SMEs employ two-thirds of our workforce. If we can encourage the adoption of digital technologies effectively by our SMEs, the training our workers can receive in the process will be a huge plus."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02016,2018-03-05-T-005,2016,Sun Xueling,"The Government has worked with the TACs to establish Digital Tech Hubs. Based on our knowledge of the most frequent queries SMEs have when they approach the Digital Tech Hubs, are we able to put together learning points, customise solutions and push out to a larger group of SMEs?"
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02017,2018-03-05-T-005,2017,Sun Xueling,"My third cut. IMDA has highlighted that it would develop sector-specific Industry Digital Plans (IDP) for six priority sectors, namely Retail, Logistics, Food Services, Wholesale Trade, Cleaning and Security."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02018,2018-03-05-T-005,2018,Sun Xueling,"The Logistics Industry Digital Plan and the Retail Industry Digital Plan have been rolled out. What is helpful with the industry digital plans is that they include a self-assessment category which allows SMEs to know where the skill gaps are and then it directs the SMEs to look for help from Business Advisors at SME Centres or in the case of needing advanced digital advisory, that they meet with principal consultants at SME Digital Tech Hub."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02019,2018-03-05-T-005,2019,Sun Xueling,"On paper, the industry digital plans would give management consultants a run for their money and truly showcase the professionalism and high standards of the Civil Service. However, I am concerned with the roll out on the ground as many SME business owners may not read or understand the industry digital plans. How would the Government go about pushing out the industry digital plans on a broad scale? Are there plans to go to the ground level to push the message out rather than wait for the SMEs to show up at the SME Centres or Digital Tech Hubs?"
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02020,2018-03-05-T-005,2020,Sun Xueling,"Further, I would like to enquire how the six priority sectors were arrived at and what is the envisaged time line of the roll out? Would the Ministry be looking to roll out with certain Queen Bee companies in each sector to seed the digital plan and have it permeate through the supply chain?"
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02021,2018-03-05-T-005,2021,Sun Xueling,

SMEs can implement IT in two different ways – internal which is a process change in order to become more lean and save on the manpower, and become more cost-efficient; external which is to really change their business model, so their products and services can be sold or marketed more efficiently. It is an important part for them to shift their mindset not just on process change."

We went from transport to financial sector, then down to the grassroots from buying grocery to buying food at the hawker centres, wet markets, and we have also been pushing very hard to get everyone onboard."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02030,2018-03-05-T-005,2030,Saktiandi Supaat,"Since the last Budget, the Government has also launched SMEs Go Digital to help them build stronger digital capabilities so as to secure growth in the digital economy. The aim is to enhance productivity through tools such as digital ordering and payment, and fleet management, as well as cybersecurity, data protection, and data analytics."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02031,2018-03-05-T-005,2031,Saktiandi Supaat,The Government has also offered consultants at the SME Digital Tech Hub who will go beyond providing basic advice on proven digital solutions that are pre-approved for funding support. Can the Minister provide the House an update on the SMEs Go Digital programme so far and how has it been meeting its objectives?
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02032,2018-03-05-T-005,2032,Saktiandi Supaat,My second cut. The TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) is a SkillsFuture initiative driven by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and other partners. Its aim is to offer various programmes to support current information and communications technology (ICT) professionals and non-ICT professionals to upgrade and acquire new skills and domain knowledge. It also allows employers in ICT and non-ICT companies who want to leverage on TeSA programmes to attract fresh or mid-career professionals to their companies. It can also help develop the number of infocomm media professionals which is prevalent in many sectors and can eventually empower traditional companies to improve performance.
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02033,2018-03-05-T-005,2033,Saktiandi Supaat,Can the Minister provide an update on the TeSA Accelerator? Is it achieving its objectives and what are the next steps in the evolution of the programme?

2018-03-05-T-005-S-02037,2018-03-05-T-005,2037,Low Thia Khiang,"In order to encourage Singaporeans to pay more attention to translation, government agencies should take the lead. Take Chinese for example, currently, the media and the members of the public can check the standard translation of official terms from MCI's database. However, this glossary page was hidden in a remote corner of the MCI website, and people who are not aware of this service cannot find it at all. This database does not contain names of buildings and the streets either."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02038,2018-03-05-T-005,2038,Low Thia Khiang,"A reader from Zaobao recently pointed out that there were many translation errors with regard to the Chinese street names in the pamphlet distributed by a certain Town Council. There used to be standardised Chinese translation of street names, and SLA has published a Chinese version of the street directory before."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02039,2018-03-05-T-005,2039,Low Thia Khiang,"Currently, if the public wants to find the Chinese name of a certain street, they can go to the website of Street and Building Names Board (SBNB) under URA to check. However, there were few people who are aware of such a service."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02040,2018-03-05-T-005,2040,Low Thia Khiang,"To standardise the official translated names is the job of the Committee. However, after standardisation, if the public is still unaware of its existence, it would be such a waste. For the convenience of the media and the public, and to signal the Government's commitment in maintaining the standard of translation, I suggest an independent portal be set up, so that the public can check the official translated government terms easily including Chinese street names."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02041,2018-03-05-T-005,2041,Low Thia Khiang,"If there are enough visits to the website, we will be able to collect enough data to develop this website into a machine translation system. This will help improve Singapore's translation standard."

As social media and messaging application platforms become more prevalent, the Ministry must tackle this problem head-on, and fast."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02044,2018-03-05-T-005,2044,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Last year, the Media Literacy Council organised the ""Better Internet"" campaign to promote responsible online habits and safe Internet use. However, the resources available on the Council website are limited; there is no dedicated helpline, no support network or resources for parents and teachers and no channels for victims to submit cyberbullying reports."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02045,2018-03-05-T-005,2045,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"There is much we can learn from Australia, where the Office of the eSafety Commissioner is responsible for promoting online safety. The Office provides extensive resources on reporting of cyberbullying, helplines, online safety programmes and resources for schools and classrooms. The first step we can take is to organise a centralised resource bank, as well as to create a safe space for victims to take refuge in. I urge the Ministry consider this to tackle cyberbullying."

2018-03-05-T-005-S-02051,2018-03-05-T-005,2051,Desmond Choo,"The challenge is how we can help our workers to thrive in this new digital economy. A worker in his mid-50s and has started working in 1980s has survived the typewriter, the pager, browsing using Netscape, emails on UNIX in the 1990s, rise of the mobile devices in the 2000s, the on-going third industrial revolution on digital manufacturing, while trying to make sense of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, Internet of Things and data exchange. Some workers will make the transition fairly seamlessly but a fair number, especially the mature workers, will need assistance."

2018-03-05-T-005-S-02055,2018-03-05-T-005,2055,Desmond Choo,"For there to be good jobs empowered by technology, there must be good companies similarly empowered. For SMEs, they need to develop a digital strategy and access competent manpower to execute the strategy. However, SMEs might find it difficult to adequately resource this change. The longer term impact is impeded digital growth and uneven development."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02056,2018-03-05-T-005,2056,Desmond Choo,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02057,2018-03-05-T-005,2057,Desmond Choo,Can the Ministry develop a common pool of such technologies and manpower that these companies can tap on to accelerate participation in the digital economy?
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02058,2018-03-05-T-005,2058,Desmond Choo,"When I visited the SATS Workers' Union members two weeks ago, I am convinced that technology will generally help our workers work longer and more productively. Most of them whom I have met were in their 50s. The backbreaking work of hauling luggage can never be fully eliminated because there are just too many different shapes of suit cases for automation. But automated luggage drop off can take away much of the physical work. Part of the work now is to help passengers navigate and troubleshoot check-ins and drop-offs. The crux is early training and preparation including for the sub-contractors."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02059,2018-03-05-T-005,2059,Desmond Choo,Will the Ministry assist in ITMs to coordinate digital and technology preparation for workers and companies? How will MCI work with and incentivise employers to identify needed skills and train the workers ahead of digital transformation in the workplace?
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02060,2018-03-05-T-005,2060,Desmond Choo,"Automation and the growth of the digital economy are inevitable. This does not sound the death knell for the human worker. Throughout history, mankind has weathered technological disruptions to find new jobs when there used to be none. Human ingenuity was key. But we have to be prepared to adapt and train even though history appears firmly on our side. The consequence otherwise is a digital economy without a heart."

2018-03-05-T-005-S-02063,2018-03-05-T-005,2063,Vikram Nair,"The Government is taking the lead in going digital, and thanks to the efforts of GovTech, more and more Government functions are going online and getting tailored to our needs, making it easier and easier for us to use. Everything from tax returns to customs clearance are amongst the easiest and most user-friendly in the world."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02064,2018-03-05-T-005,2064,Vikram Nair,"The Government is also providing extensive encouragement and support for SMEs to digitalise. It is likely that more and more will do so, both to provide better services for consumers and also to improve productivity for the shrinking workforce."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02065,2018-03-05-T-005,2065,Vikram Nair,"However, the reality of digitalisation is that not everyone will be comfortable with the changes or able to adapt. Many of us here may have already gone to the trouble of forgetting passwords and having 40 to 50 to remember. But these problems are minor compared to those who may not have education, English in particular. And those who may not even be able to work on a computer. There are many, particularly, the older and less educated who have difficulty accessing some digital services."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02066,2018-03-05-T-005,2066,Vikram Nair,"Singapore has one of the highest mobile and Internet penetration rates. However, while the penetration is high, it is still not complete and there are many who are impecunious who do not have Internet access or mobile phones may be because they have not paid their bills. So, this too may impede some of their access to mobile services."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02067,2018-03-05-T-005,2067,Vikram Nair,How can we ensure that Singaporeans of all ages and backgrounds are not left behind as the economy digitalises?

The existing analogue TV channels will be switched off on 31 December 2018 and all Mediacorp TV channels will be broadcast in digital format only."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02070,2018-03-05-T-005,2070,Yee Chia Hsing,"I would like to ask the Ministry how many households are still on analogue TV signal. Of these, I suspect quite a lot of them are the elderly. As such, I urge the Ministry to put in more effort to highlight the importance of getting ready for the ending of analogue TV signal broadcasting."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02071,2018-03-05-T-005,2071,Yee Chia Hsing,"To increase awareness, is it possible for blank screens to be broadcast on the analogue TV signals followed by the necessary info-commercial messages to teach users what needs to be done to receive the digital TV signals."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02072,2018-03-05-T-005,2072,Yee Chia Hsing,I would also like to know if it is possible for the Ministry to work with the Silver Generation ambassadors for them to educate the elderly about the need to have a digital TV set-top box and maybe assist elderly residents to set up the TV set-top box.
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02073,2018-03-05-T-005,2073,Yee Chia Hsing,"So, in conclusion, I hope that more can be done to help our elderly prepare for the Digital Only TV signals and let us hope that New Year’s Day in 2019 will not bring blank screens to them."

The aim is to deliver a blueprint of strategies to help Singaporeans, especially the more vulnerable, understand and enjoy the benefits of technology. This workgroup, comprising representatives from the public and private sectors, are to propose strategies to improve digital readiness among Singaporeans."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02076,2018-03-05-T-005,2076,Saktiandi Supaat,"It is important that we get our senior citizens to tap on technology to make their lives better. The Silver Infocomm Initiative is one good example, which has reached out to more than 130,000 senior citizens to promote IT awareness and literacy. So, as we go on the Smart Nation drive we must not forget to help our seniors to get ready for it, as Member Mr Yee Chia Hsing mentioned just now."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02077,2018-03-05-T-005,2077,Saktiandi Supaat,"In addition, may I also suggest that more be done for low-income families beyond what is being done now, in particular those with young children at home?"

The mainstream media, to me, has perhaps the biggest and most important role to play in combating fake news in Singapore. They also have a crucial role to play in strengthening social cohesion. These can be achieved through two pathways  enhancing the quality of journalism and building a network of partnerships."

Editor-in-Chief of the SPH English/Malay and Tamil media group, Warren Fernandez, said recently that good journalism and news organisations that are credible and reliable play a vital role in combating fake news. This emphasis on quality journalism and credibility will ultimately also have important consequences for the company’s bottom line as print circulation and advertising revenues continue to decline at SPH."

Indeed, it has just announced that it made more than US$1 billion in overall subscription revenue in 2017. While other media companies are struggling, The New York Times saw its circulation surge, adding 157,000 digital subscriptions in just the fourth quarter of 2017 alone."

While reporting news quickly and accurately is important, Singaporeans would benefit from reading varied, considered commentaries that provide a deeper and sometimes alternative view of pressing national issues. Mature, cogent and well-argued commentaries can deepen the level of debate and discussion among Singaporeans, and also broaden the consciousness of the impact of certain arguments."

It is about talent, and about nurturing and developing quality talent in the newsrooms. To me, the country needs need more of quality commentators such as The Straits Times Opinion Editor Chua Mui Hoong and Mediacorp journalist Barathi Jagdish. Their commentaries are thoughtful, considered and balanced. They raise questions like good journalists, but they do so constructively. Their arguments are backed by facts and not just emotions."

Singaporeans today are bombarded by tidal waves of fake news and agenda-led, emotional reactions of online bloggers and pseudo-journalists. Many Singaporeans reading the personal ramblings of these so-called political-social commentators are not fully aware of the backstory and agendas of these sites and their contributors. Online commentators who are more than happy to make inflammatory and controversial remarks to grow their readership for advertising revenues. Commentators who insinuate without fear of any organisational sanction, and who are not bound by any code of ethics or journalistic ethos."

While the actual effectiveness of using young journalists to attract young readers warrants an in-depth study, I would like to suggest that newsrooms consider a structured and coordinated mentoring scheme to help develop and guide the younger journalists."

That uncanny eye for detail, relationship building and the art of learning how to ask the right questions – these are things that cannot be learnt in the newsroom. They are learnt on the ground, on the job. There is a rich wealth of talent among veteran journalists in the newsrooms at SPH and Mediacorp, and we must encourage our newsrooms to tap on these senior journalists."

They did not have Google to help them look for information, nor did they report off stories posted on social media. Instead, they spoke to people face-to-face, on the telephone and developed their own network of contacts. They also checked their facts and corroborated news breaks."

In a sea of emotional and sometimes irrational online commentaries, we must ensure that people are also provided with mature, well-argued opinions."

2018-03-05-T-005-S-02106,2018-03-05-T-005,2106,Ganesh Rajaram,We are beginning to see this renewed commitment to quality journalism by SPH and Mediacorp. Programming on Channel NewsAsia consistently stands out because of a focus on quality.

2018-03-05-T-005-S-02108,2018-03-05-T-005,2108,Ganesh Rajaram,"Last year, we saw the documentary, “Regardless of Religion”, the follow up to the previous year’s hit, “Regardless of Race”. Yet again, the producers treated a very difficult subject with sensitivity, and made it entertaining and interesting – it helped that they had a natural talent to front the show. Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary’s ease in front of the camera was pivotal in the success of the programme. It is programmes like these that go a long way in setting the platform, and developing social cohesion. Programmes such as ""Insight"" also deserve mention for their investigative journalism."

2018-03-05-T-005-S-02110,2018-03-05-T-005,2110,Ganesh Rajaram,"But while Mediacorp is putting the emphasis on quality and seeing positive results, it also needs to foster more partnerships to thrive."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02111,2018-03-05-T-005,2111,Ganesh Rajaram,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02112,2018-03-05-T-005,2112,Ganesh Rajaram,"Sir, partnerships are becoming the norm in the media industry among companies big and small. We have already seen some major mergers in the broadcast and film arena  the Disney and Fox merger is among the biggest."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02113,2018-03-05-T-005,2113,Ganesh Rajaram,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02114,2018-03-05-T-005,2114,Ganesh Rajaram,"And the recent changes at the Board and management level at Mediacorp have begun to show positive effects – with the company embarking on partnerships and looking to cement more. One recent partnership was the Channel 5 drama ""Missing"", a first ever co-production with Thailand."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02115,2018-03-05-T-005,2115,Ganesh Rajaram,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02116,2018-03-05-T-005,2116,Ganesh Rajaram,"Mediacorp will also have to look at partnering pay television platforms across the region, and locally to elevate the quality and increase the footprint of its content. Perhaps the Government can look at incentive programmes for Mediacorp to achieve this."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02117,2018-03-05-T-005,2117,Ganesh Rajaram,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02118,2018-03-05-T-005,2118,Ganesh Rajaram,"And lastly, Sir, my favourite topic – the broadcast rights for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. I thank Minister Yaacob Ibrahim for his comprehensive replies to my parliamentary questions a few weeks ago on this issue. I agree with the Minister that sports rights are getting more expensive, particularly for marquee events like the Olympics. And I also agree that as important as these events are for the viewing public, we cannot be held to ransom to any ridiculous fee being asked for by rights holders. But as someone who has been on both sides of the fence – a rights holder and a buyer – I would like to suggest that the 2020 Olympics should be seen with a special lens."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02119,2018-03-05-T-005,2119,Ganesh Rajaram,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02120,2018-03-05-T-005,2120,Ganesh Rajaram,"Firstly, The Tokyo Olympics will be telecast on prime time in Singapore. Secondly, we have the prospect of watching our Olympic gold medallist Joseph Schooling win more medals. Other athletes such as Quah Zheng Wen will also be in their prime. Thirdly, while Singaporeans were grateful for the last-minute deal to telecast the Rio Olympics two years ago, the hurried re-scheduling of programming is not ideal. It must have been difficult for Mediacorp to garner sponsorship and advertising given the last-minute deal. If the deal had been brokered earlier, it would have given them more time to approach global sponsors of the Games, who are, as I speak, already planning their media spend for the Tokyo Olympics."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02121,2018-03-05-T-005,2121,Ganesh Rajaram,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02122,2018-03-05-T-005,2122,Ganesh Rajaram,"Perhaps this could be the opportunity for Mediacorp to embark on a long-term partnership with pay platforms StarHub and Singtel to go after these rights together. In today’s world, content is platform agnostic – nobody cares where they watch content – if it is quality content, they will find a way to watch it."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02123,2018-03-05-T-005,2123,Ganesh Rajaram,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02124,2018-03-05-T-005,2124,Ganesh Rajaram,"Sir, given the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on public service broadcast (PSB) content every year, surely a small portion of that spent on Olympic rights – is justified, as these could have a far more lasting and tangible public service effect, than any PSB programme. In fact, the halo effect of Schooling’s win is still being felt two years after his feat. Some things, as they say, are priceless."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02125,2018-03-05-T-005,2125,Vikram Nair,"Chairman, let me pick up from on the PSB programming. The PSB contestable funds scheme has been very important in developing quality local content across different languages – English, Malay, Tamil or Mandarin. Shows that may not have been otherwise economically viable have been developed in Singapore and much appreciated by our own audience."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02126,2018-03-05-T-005,2126,Vikram Nair,
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02127,2018-03-05-T-005,2127,Vikram Nair,"Many of these PSB programmes have been part of our television and have developed a very strong audience. While television remains a dominant medium, changing media consumption patterns have many viewers going online. I must confess that I watch most of my own local programmes on Toggle. Besides free-to-air TV, what other platforms is the Government working with to extend the reach of PSB programmes to engage Singaporeans?"

Leading digital media companies such as Lucasfilm, Tecmo-Koei, Double Negative, Electronic Arts and Ubisoft have also opened offices in Singapore."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02132,2018-03-05-T-005,2132,Darryl David,"But what part can smaller media companies play in Singapore’s quest to be a global media hub? If it is crucial to create a digitally-enabled media environment, what measures are there to help smaller media industry players take that digital journey of transformation?"
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02133,2018-03-05-T-005,2133,Darryl David,Could the Government share how it is helping to build digital media capabilities needed for continued growth in the long term?
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02134,2018-03-05-T-005,2134,Darryl David,"The next cut, Mr Chairman. We would all agree that the library is, and should always remain an important social and educational institution and it has an important role to play in our new, evolving economy."
2018-03-05-T-005-S-02135,2018-03-05-T-005,2135,Darryl David,"How can we ensure that libraries remain viable and relevant in this new economy? Can libraries better support the nation-wide effort to promote and prepare all Singaporeans for the future economy so that job-seekers and entrepreneurs alike have access to ever-changing knowledge? Beyond the computerisation of services and the development of technology to support reading, what can libraries do to make reading, whether it is traditional or digital, delightful and engaging for its users in all languages?"

I wish to commend the efforts of the libraries in adopting many initiatives such as mobile apps, reading clubs and e-books to encourage reading. Despite that, the number of adults who visit library and borrow books for their own reading and learning has not been increasing."

2018-03-05-T-005-S-02145,2018-03-05-T-005,2145,Teo Ho Pin,"Sir, we need to transform our 26 libraries into “active lifelong learning centres” to further encourage reading and learning among Singaporeans. We must redesign our libraries to create more conducive leaning corners for children and provide a more comfortable reading environment for adults especially seniors. We must also make our libraries friendlier for the elderly and organise more regular activities such as talks to support active ageing."

For example, Chiba prefecture organises seminars on a regular basis for seniors on various topics that are relevant to the elderly. Hokkaido's libraries have partnered various senior welfare related organisations, and provide many senior friendly library services such as book delivery services, “dementia café” and recitation services for those who are visually impaired."

I would like to ask the Ministry how the National Library and Archives intend to reach out to ordinary Singaporeans to include their oral histories and capture footage of daily living. This will help preserve our heritage and also enrich the quality of our collections. Further, how are we increasing access to archival resources in our libraries to encourage greater understanding of our history and our culture?"

2018-03-05-T-008-S-02166,2018-03-05-T-008,2166,K Shanmugam,"The Ministry of Law regularly reviews the means test for civil legal aid, to ensure that legal aid remains accessible to lower income Singaporeans and PRs who cannot afford their own lawyers."
2018-03-05-T-008-S-02167,2018-03-05-T-008,2167,K Shanmugam,"Legal aid is unlike other forms of government social assistance, which benefits the individual seeking help, as legal aid often means the state helping one party in a legal case against another Singaporean. We must therefore ensure that our system is rigorous in only assisting those who wish to pursue meritorious cases but cannot afford to do so."
2018-03-05-T-008-S-02168,2018-03-05-T-008,2168,K Shanmugam,"For matrimonial disputes, the following provisions are in place to assist applicants first, where the spouses are estranged, LAB excludes the income of the applicant’s spouse when assessing the applicant’s means. Second, in a divorce case, the matrimonial property would not be included in the means assessment."
2018-03-05-T-008-S-02169,2018-03-05-T-008,2169,K Shanmugam,"Moreover, for family proceedings involving children or protection order applications between spouses or ex-spouses, the Director of Legal Aid can give an extra deduction for the disposable capital component of the means test. This ensures that the most vulnerable persons in family-related disputes are eligible for legal aid."
