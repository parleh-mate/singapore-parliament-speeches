2020-02-28-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Education whether changes are being planned with respect to the current numbers of allied educators in schools for both learning support and classroom support.,1,1,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00001
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"Mr Speaker, Sir, MOE currently employs around 2,000 Allied Educators (AEDs) in our mainstream schools. They comprise School Counsellors, Student Welfare Officers, AEDs in Learning and Behavioural Support (AEDs(LBS)), and AEDs in Teaching and Learning (AEDs(T&L)).",1,2,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00002
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"Each school is typically resourced with one to two School Counsellors to support the social-emotional and mental health needs of our students, and one to two AEDs(LBS) to provide structured intervention support to students with Special Educational Needs. Some schools also have a Student Welfare Officer to support our students who struggle with attendance issues.",2,3,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00003
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"Over the last five years, we have grown the number of School Counsellors, Student Welfare Officers and AEDs(LBS) by over 30%, and we intend to expand this further to meet the growing needs of our students. For the existing AEDs(T&L), we are encouraging and also facilitating them to still remain as allied educators, but in the other specialised roles. For example, over the last two years, we have sponsored around 100 AEDs(T&L) to a 10-month full-time Diploma in Special Education (DISE) at the National Institute of Education (NIE) and plan to train another 100 this year.",3,4,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00004
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),MOE will continue to review our AED numbers and workforce profile to ensure that we respond effectively to students’ needs.,4,5,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00005
2020-02-28-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.,1,6,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00006
2020-02-28-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. Just one supplementary question. There is some anecdotal feedback – it may or may not be the correct perception – that AEDs for classroom support are being reduced in number. Is that actually taking place or are there any plans to do that or is that just an incorrect perception?",1,7,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00007
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Member for his supplementary question and I also want to assure him that the AEDs form an integral part of our teaching force, to guide the growth and development of our students, especially students with special educational needs. MOE remains committed to deepen and also to expand our mainstream schools' capacity to support our students with special educational needs.",1,8,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00008
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"On the Member's specific supplementary question on AED(T&L), earlier on, I cited the four types of AEDs. Let me briefly explain the differing job roles and responsibilities. There are four types of AEDs in our schools. First, the School Counsellor provides counselling services to meet the social-emotional and also the mental health needs of our students. The second type is the Student Welfare Officer, who supports students with long-term absenteeism issues and sometimes, is involved in managing their family-related issues as well. The third is the AED(LBS) who provides learning and behavioural support for students with special educational needs, mainly students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), mild ASD, ADHD and dyslexia. The fourth type – the one that the Member specifically highlighted – is the AED(T&L) who provides teaching and learning support for our students in and outside of the classroom.",2,9,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00009
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Within the AED pool, we are committed to grow the number of School Counsellors, Student Welfare Officers and also AED(LBS) because we see that they are well-positioned to support the changing profile and the new and growing needs of our students, especially students with special educational needs. The number has grown for these three types of AEDs – it has grown by more than 30% and we are still recruiting. From time to time, MOE will review the profile of our teaching force, including the AEDs. We do need to re-shape the profile of our teaching force, including the AEDs, to be able to better support the changing needs of our students.",3,10,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00010
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For example, with smaller student enrolment and with a healthy teaching force, in general, our teacher-to-student ratio has come down, has improved, which also means that now, the teachers rely slightly less on the AEDs(T&L) to provide generic classroom support, than many, many years ago. In order to future-proof our AED(T&L), to better support them in terms of career development, career advancement, we also are facilitating them in terms of taking up the training or even sponsoring them in relevant diplomas, so that they can also take on specialised roles.",4,11,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00011
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"We are happy to see that in the past few years, AEDs(T&L) have successfully transited to AEDs(LBS). They have done well, also because of their previous experience supporting the teachers in the classrooms.",5,12,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00012
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I want to give the assurance that we remain committed to the professional development of our AEDs, including the AEDs(T&L).",6,13,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00013

2020-02-28-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. Sir, just one last supplementary question, really just to confirm if I understood the Senior Parliamentary Secretary correctly, the thinking of the Government is that AEDs(T&L) are less necessary now and therefore, the numbers are going to be reduced and then, those AEDs(T&L) are going to be transited to other roles and so on. I just want to confirm that understanding.",1,15,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00015
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Earlier on, I did mention that from time to time, we will look at re-shaping our teaching workforce, including the AEDs. And moving forward, we are looking at ramping up the recruitment of School Counsellors, Student Welfare Officers and AEDs(LBS). For existing AEDs(T&L) who are keen to make the transition or career switch to any of these three roles or even other roles in the teaching force, we will support the AEDs(T&L) in doing so with the necessary sponsorship or diploma courses in NIE or even very specialised courses to support them, so that they can continue to support students – whether it is students with special educational needs or students who need counselling and so on.",1,16,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00016
2020-02-28-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"In the next few days, during the MOE Committee of Supply (COS), we will share more details about how we are boosting the professional development of our teaching workforce, including supporting teachers to better support students with special educational needs.",2,17,2020-02-28-T-001-S-00017
2020-02-28-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) to date, how many cases of undeclared peanut allergens have been found in food products sold in Singapore; and (b) whether any adverse health effects associated with peanut allergy have been noted from these or other cases.",1,18,2020-02-28-T-002-S-00018
2020-02-28-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Mr Speaker, food manufacturers and traders in Singapore must comply with SFA's food safety standards and requirements. These include labelling requirements where food manufacturers and traders must ensure that known allergens such as peanuts, which are found in pre-packed food products, are declared on the labels of the products.",1,19,2020-02-28-T-002-S-00019
2020-02-28-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"From 2015 to 2018, there were no cases of undeclared peanut allergen in pre-packed food products. Since 2019, there have been five cases of undeclared peanut allergen in pre-packed food products. Upon detection, SFA issued directions to recall the products given the food safety concerns to consumers who are allergic to peanuts. SFA has not received feedback or information on adverse health effects arising from these cases.",2,20,2020-02-28-T-002-S-00020

2020-02-28-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),I thank the Minister for his answer. Just one supplementary question. Does the Ministry also work with the F&B sector to encourage them to declare peanut content in the food that is served?,1,22,2020-02-28-T-002-S-00022
2020-02-28-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"All these five cases came from overseas, all over the world. As you know, we import 90% of our food. And we also take instructions from food authorities around the world. When they find out that these allergens are not declared, then we do the recall. But for Singapore food manufacturing companies, it is a requirement for them to do so. We check randomly to make sure that they do so.",1,23,2020-02-28-T-002-S-00023

2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker,  we are the tail end of this Government's term. From 2016, all the titles of each Budget emphasised ""unity""",1,29,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00029
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"But unity in the context of a democracy, along with the 4G leadership seeking to engender a Singapore Together movement, must also encounter varied, diverse, edgy and even contradictory views in the effort to find common cause. This is to be encouraged not discouraged. It is that process of embracing diversity and accommodating political differences that give meaning to a democracy of deeds for the 21st century and not for a one-party parliament of decades past.",2,30,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00030
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Parliament is an august forum which is one manifestation of Singapore Together. My colleagues in the Workers' Party and I thank all Singaporeans for sharing their views and coming to us to bring up issues to Parliament over this term of government, particularly, those that Government Members of Parliament (MPs) cannot be expected to raise, not out of an inability of their own but because of the nature of politics and political contestation.",3,31,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00031
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"WP MPs agree with the Government when we have to, disagree where we must, in the knowledge that we endeavour for the best outcomes for Singapore and for a unity of purpose when politics must take a backseat, like during this current COVID-19 outbreak.",4,32,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00032
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My speech will be divided into three parts. I will first speak of the geopolitical environment and the response of some businesses to the Budget announcements. Next, I will talk about our fiscal position, with some points on our revenue and expenditure position before finally concluding with my views on the enhanced SkillsFuture Credits and the climate change-related announcements.",5,33,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00033
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, the Finance Minister's Budget speeches on the external environment and developments that affect Singapore's geopolitical developments over this term of government have been prescient, illuminating not just upon the challenges but imperatives ahead for Singapore. In his 2018 Budget speech, the Finance Minister outline three major shifts in the coming decade  the shift in global economic weight to Asia; the emergence of new technologies that will change the way we live, work and play; and finally, ageing. Themes which were repeated in the Minister's 2019 Budget speech as well.",6,34,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00034
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, the last few years have witnessed tectonic geopolitical shifts. US Attorney General William Barr's speech at the Department of Justice earlier this month captured the mood of the times ahead, at least from Washington's perspective. In reminiscing about the days of the Cold War, Barr remarked, ""Russia wants to conquer the world. We can deal with that. China wants to own the world. That is going to be more challenging to deal with.""",7,35,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00035
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"American policy towards China is on a very different course and with a bifurcation of the world looking like an almost foregone conclusion, not just a technological decoupling, but with differences in values and norms at the heart of things. More so than before, shaky US-China relations are threatening to force invidious choices upon Singapore, choices which the political leadership not just within the PAP but all political parties and citizens in Singapore would have to negotiate with greater judiciousness and sensibility without compromising an absolute commitment and loyalty to Singapore.",8,36,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00036
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, this circumspection does not just extend to the superpowers. We must also resist the urge to engage in gloating when our closest economic partners like Malaysia and competitors like Hong Kong negotiate their own unique political circumstances; circumstances which are historically apart, completely different and in many cases take place in a more complex and significantly larger country, many times our population size.",9,37,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00037
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My brief discussions after the Budget was announced with a few members of the various local Chambers of Commerce informed me that there has been a general acknowledgement of the relief provided by the Stabilisation and Support Package in the Budget. Separately, I understand Chamber Members are also continuing the work on longer term efforts at internationalisation and bringing businesses up to speed with new initiatives, particularly training and growth opportunities.",10,38,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00038
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, one specific group of Singaporean businesses and individuals reached out to me in the aftermath of the Budget. They are our private hire bus companies and drivers who are bearing the brunt of cancelled trips and tours arising from the COVID-19 outbreak. These are the bus drivers who bring our residents to Malaysia for durian trips and even National Servicemen around Singapore for local tours or training.",11,39,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00039
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I understand that an industry briefing was held on the 21 February by the Singapore Tourism Board on a relief package for travel agents and tour operators. While the briefing was appreciated, private bus companies feel the Budget support package is not targeted enough, in view of the nature of their business.",12,40,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00040
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I thank Minister Josephine Teo for her speech during the course of the Budget debate, explaining the policy reasons why foreign worker levies were not reduced or waived. Nonetheless, I hope the Government reconsiders this and extends some support by way of a one-month or partial waiver of the levies for companies that have no choice but to hire foreign manpower, on the condition that these companies consciously seek to increase their local headcount, by way of job redesign going forward. Some conditional support and consideration for them in these difficult times, may provide greater impetus on all our companies overly reliant on foreign manpower today to make a greater effort to hire locals – including senior citizens, and even those on a part-time basis – tomorrow.",13,41,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00041
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, I move on to the second part of my speech on fiscal prudence and sustainability, a subject which is a feature of practically every one of Deputy Prime Minister Heng's Budget speeches. One hard truth that we do not hear in this house, notwithstanding greater demands on expenditure, is that the current Government has had the privilege of far more budgetary elbow room, both political and fiscal, than any previous government in Singapore's history.",14,42,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00042
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Just think about it. After the inclusion of Temasek in the NIRC component of the Budget from 2016, monies for GST offset package can be set aside for the introduction of higher taxes for the next term of Government. Compared to 2015 when the NIRC component of the Government's revenue was about $9 billion dollars, today, the figure is almost double. Separately, the package to support the economy in light of COVID-19 was not funded from a draw on the reserves, unlike the support package during the Global Financial Crisis about a decade ago.",15,43,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00043
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, when the Workers' Party made inquiries on the reserves over the course of a few Budgets in this term of Government, it was to explore and consider different approaches and prospects to improve the lives of our people, particularly the low and middle class. At the last Budget, Finance Minister provided a lengthy reply on why the dollar value of the reserves could not be disclosed. But the answer remains unsatisfactory, particularly when the same argument could apply to the overwhelming majority of other democratic societies, who nonetheless err on the side of fiscal scrutiny and accountability.",16,44,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00044
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"At last year's Budget, I brought along a Business Times article that saw Singaporeans calling for a greater discussion on the reserves. These calls for greater transparency are not out of place and they will continue in years to come. They run in parallel with the Singapore Together spirit with Singaporeans taking ownership, exploring fiscal solutions, seeking to co-create not just today's Singapore but a sustainable and equitable tomorrow that future generations of Singaporeans will inherit.",17,45,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00045
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"More specifically, in Finance Minister's 2018 speech, the prospect of borrowing by Statutory Boards and Government-owned companies to build infrastructure was first raised to help spread the cost of larger investments over many years. This prospect of borrowing was raised again by Finance Minister in his 2019 Budget speech where the Finance Minister confirmed that the Government is studying the option of using Government debt as part of the financing mix for long-term infrastructure projects.",18,46,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00046
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, it has been two years since these plans on debt-financing were raised. Can the Government share more details on these plans, as this year's Budget does not communicate the results of the Government studies on the borrowing or debt-financing framework and their fiscal consequences on future Budgets?",19,47,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00047
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This year's Budget also saw the Finance Minister once again making reference to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, an initiative that seeks to ensure companies are taxed where substantive economic activities are performed. The Finance Minister first raised BEPS in his 2017 Budget speech. Then the House was informed that the Government was in consultation with businesses on scheme refinement and implementation of the relevant standards. What has been the results of these consultations from three years ago?",20,48,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00048
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"BEPS was raised again in the Finance Minister's speech this year and the Minister shared that there are discussions to revise international tax rules and that Singapore was actively participating in them. However, reference to BEPS this year was in the context of a sub-point of another sentence, which warned there were uncertainties and downside risks to the Government's revenue position – a matter which should be of interest to all Singaporeans.",21,49,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00049
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I have a query with respect to BEPS. Before that, it is useful to recap the Government's argument on proposals by Singaporeans to raise taxes of higher income earners, who do enjoy the safety and security offered by Singapore. The concern was that high net-worth individuals would be able to structure and move their assets to avoid higher tax obligations.",22,50,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00050
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"What is the impact of BEPS on this prospect and the Government's assessment of the impact of BEPS' developments on our tax policies?

2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, the Finance Minister's Budget speech confirmed that GST will not be going up next year. Notwithstanding the offsets announced, the GST is a regressive tax that will hit the low and middle income, retirees, seniors, particularly hard as they would have to manage their expenditures more frugally because offsets do not last forever, particularly for the middle class.",24,52,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00052
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"At this year's Budget, the Finance Minister said that the Government put off the rise in GST after considering the state of the economy, but more critically, I quote, ""...after reviewing our revenue and expenditure projections"". Sir, when the Workers' Party objected to the rise in GST in 2018, amongst other things, it was on account of a lack of information about alternate revenue streams. The Finance Minister's position then was that one did not need to have information on everything to make a decision on anything.",25,53,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00053
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"But from the Minister's speech this year and the announcement not to raise GST next year, it is obvious that the Government relies on revenue and expenditure projections to make these decisions.",26,54,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00054
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Would the Government make public these projections so that Singaporeans can critically evaluate the necessity of a GST hike? I believe this openness would contribute to a more substantive conversation and understanding of our fiscal trade-offs. This can only advance and mature conversations that take place in Singapore. Until this clarity is provided, the Workers' Party position has not changed. We cannot support a GST hike, especially since this is to be raised in advance and before the Government's projections have been put to this House.",27,55,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00055
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The third segment of my speech is a short one, Mr Speaker. I refer to the Government's call for special SkillsFuture Credit top-ups for Singaporeans between the ages of 40 and 60. The Workers' Party supports this move, but urges the Government to track the use of these credits for this age group to job and employability related outcomes closely. More generally, while SkillsFuture subsidised courses can range from, in the words of the Finance Minister, ""cooking to coding"", it does not bode well if taxpayers' money are expended on courses that are under-weighted with regard to real improvements of skills, job prospects and employability of our workers, in view of the workplace disruptions to come.",28,56,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00056
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"We know from previous Parliamentary replies that there is an upper limit to certain entrepreneurial prospects in Singapore, such as the opening of cafes.

2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Lastly, Mr Speaker, I expected some strong incentives or subsidies in this year's Budget on climate change outcomes, particularly in the aftermath of MEWR's efforts towards greater climate change awareness over the last few years, including designating one year, a year of climate action.",30,58,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00058

For example, a transitional subsidy amounting to $20 for households to subsidise the purchase of plastic bags at supermarkets could be considered as a bridge for Singaporeans before a charge is levied for every bag by all retailers.",31,59,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00059
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, incentivising the reduced usage of plastic bags is not just about our over-consumption of plastic bags per se. It is also about the amount of waste we generate and dispose which usually ends up in a plastic bag that is thrown down our bin chutes. A plastic bag charges far from representing mere climate change symbolism. It is a clarion call to us all and to alter social norms to equally, if not more importantly, reduce the amount of waste we generate. This is a pressing issue as there are infrastructural constraints on the amount of space we have to dispose our incinerated waste on Pulau Semakau which is expected to be full by 2035 or thereabouts. That is only a mere 15 years from now.",32,60,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00060
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Correct as of Monday, there were 342,304 pledges on the MEWR website to fight climate change. There is a window to move more decisively and we should move fast.",33,61,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00061
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To conclude, Mr Speaker, the Finance Minister is correct to say that many Singaporeans are coming up with and acting on ideas to make Singapore a better place on their own initiative. For the first time in his Budget speech in this term of Government, the Minister has spoken about the democracy of deeds. But whatever deeds our people underwrite, they take place within the context of our democracy, a democracy where alternative views, criticisms and disagreements shape the outcomes that give meaning to the phrase one united people – united in a vision for better and more confident Singapore, no matter what our political beliefs.",34,62,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00062
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"It is like that anthem that was referred to in this House, during the course of this Budget debate, ""You Will Never Walk Alone"". But how many of us know that it is not just the anthem of one club but others too, like Glasgow Celtic, Borussia Dortmund and many others.",35,63,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00063
2020-02-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, Singapore's diversity is its strength. As long as our people – youth, businesses, individuals – engage the issues of the day civilly in our democracy and treat their fellow Singaporeans and foreigners within our midst with dignity and empathy, and endeavour for a more caring society, the best years of Singapore – a Singapore for all – are ahead of us.",36,64,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00064

2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, my friends often accuse me of being obsessed with numbers. I tell them it is an occupational hazard because I am a chartered accountant by training. But, I have found over the years in practice that numbers give us the most precise and clearest indication of one's financial position.",2,67,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00067
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, this year's Budget Statement is no different. Overall, we estimate our position to be in deficit of $10.95 billion. Year on year, we hope for increases in our operating revenue amid very challenging global competition. For example, our tax collections can increase if our companies do well and pay more corporate taxes. At the same time, we also hope for more revenue from our Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC). Our NIRC only became possible because of the prudence and wise investment decisions made by our earlier generation of leaders. Against this backdrop, our estimated to the expenditure is expected to increase much larger because we need to fund our healthcare needs and infrastructure developments, like our MRT lines, to bring a better life for Singaporeans.",3,68,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00068
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, talking about healthcare amenities, I have for the last many years, been asking for a polyclinic in my constituency of Potong Pasir. I even filed a Parliamentary Question (PQ) for that. [Laughter.]",4,69,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00069
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"In my discussions with MOH, they informed me that there is no more space in Potong Pasir estate because it is all built up. That is true. But, MOH is building Kallang polyclinic, which is connected to Kwong Wai Shiu hospital. I see Dr Yaacob had a thumbs-up because that is in his Jalan Besar constituency. So, that is also good for Potong Pasir residents because that is one MRT station away.",5,70,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00070
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"However, I think I found some space for MOH. The residents of Bidadari are moving in and I think there should be some space in Bidadari estate to build a polyclinic for our Potong Pasir residents. So, if you can, Sir – please. [Laughter.]",6,71,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00071
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, let me continue with the Budget. A large part of the estimated Budget deficit for 2020, as Deputy Prime Minister Heng have explained in his Budget Statement, it should fund measures to address the impending difficult economic landscape that confront Singapore as a result of the COVID-19 virus outbreak. This includes the $4 billion Stabilisation and Support package for workers and businesses and also the $1.6 billion Care and Support package to help Singaporeans with household expenses.",7,72,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00072
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"In the Budget Statement, the sentence that captured my attention the most, was when Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced that there will be no draw on our reserves, no draw on our reserves. For FY2020, we have an expansionary budget with an estimated $10.5 billion deficit, but we need not draw on our reserves. Why? Only because the Government had accumulated sufficient budget surpluses during this term of Government.",8,73,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00073
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"As we have read in recent international media of other jurisdictions, similarly announcing support packages in their respective economies, I doubt you will find a jurisdiction that can say that they are able to fund such support packages in the manner that we have. I have not seen any.",9,74,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00074
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"During previous Budget debates in this term of Government, I am sure Members of this House will also recollect repeated calls for more spending of the surpluses or the use of more income derived from our reserves. There was even suggestion that the Government had a political agenda behind more prudent spending in the early years of a term of government.",10,75,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00075
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Had the Government done as what was popularly asked – spend more in the good years – then, this year, we could very well have had to dip into our reserves in order to introduce first-instance measures to support Singaporeans as a result of the COVID-19 virus outbreak. I used the term ""first-instance"" because I worry that we may not have seen the eye of this particular storm. Even as we speak, we continue to see worrying signs of the COVID-19 virus outbreak seriously affecting many countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, Iran and many others. We can anticipate further adverse headwinds against Singapore's globally interconnected economy. We could very well require even further measures from the Government to support and assist Singaporeans in the days ahead.",11,76,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00076
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, in my mind, there is another term for consistent financial prudence in our Budgets and, that is, always be ready and prepared for any eventuality. And I am sure I am not alone when I say that I am glad we did so for the past five years and, indeed, for many terms of Government before.",12,77,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00077
2020-02-28-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"In the premises, Sir, I would invite our Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister to share with us the Government's intentions and plans to further support Singaporeans and businesses in the event that the situation is drawn out over a prolonged period of time.",13,78,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00078
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Budget Statement was read by Deputy Prime Minister Heng, I felt very privileged to be on both sides of the fence. I had been a part of the team that was trying to figure out some of the schemes and programmes to be rolled out each Budget and I am now on the other side of the fence as a beneficiary of some of the programmes and schemes itself.",1,79,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00079
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"When I left the Ministry in the middle of 2017, I had wanted to set up my own ventures and businesses and I chose the most difficult path to do so. I chose businesses and ventures of a B2C nature, which is to create a consumer product, a consumer brand, starting from zero and I wanted to see if I could do it with the environment that Singapore offers, with all the different measures, grants and schemes that the Ministry offers. So, it has been a very good two-and-a-half years, but a lot of grinding and a lot of pain and also a lot of risks taken. It was not easy. But at the same time, I felt assured because I know that Singapore's business environment is one of ease of access as well as one that you could approach and feedback, where you could actually have help and assistance. But, of course, many in the business circle would say, ""Well, you had been an officeholder, you were a Member of Parliament. So, you have an advantage."" Not so.",2,80,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00080
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On the other hand, I took a lot of measures and also a lot of different ways to hide and not show which companies I owned and how I did it and actually worked behind the scenes really, really hard in order to grow those businesses. So, piece by piece, layer by layer, I built my business and I am very lucky, very blessed that, today, my venture in the consumer product business is profitable. I know many fall by the wayside and, out of 10, probably nine will fail. I am just lucky to be able to do so. I would not deny that some grants and programmes were made available for me or my company to be able to tap on them. But at the same time, it is very much dependent on ourselves as business people to do so, to be able to come up with solutions, with what the market needs and what the consumer wants and we can build a successful business from there.",3,81,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00081
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, the Government grants, schemes and programmes throughout each year are not an end-all and be-all. They cannot be the most critical function or most critical part of the business. I know that many businesses apply for those grants and schemes, hoping for additional cash flow. Yes, they are temporary relief measures, but they are not permanent. At the end of the day, someone must want to buy your product, work with you and believe in your company in order to invest in it in order for it to grow.",4,82,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00082
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, when I went through some of the speeches in the previous two days, I understand that Mr Leon Perera actually mentioned about slowing down some growth of the reserves and maybe putting in more investment into our people to be more creative, entrepreneurial and innovative. I do not disagree with that. But I think slowing down the growth of the reserves is not the way to go because, no matter what, we need to build up the foundation in order to take on the rainy days or challenges to come and deal with COVID-19. It is very clear that we have the facility and resources to handle some of these challenges. But, without which, we will find it a struggle to manage. It is like running the day-to-day business in every other way; you would want to have the reserves in order to handle some of these rainy days.",5,83,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00083
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, more importantly, these reserves and how we use them are extremely important. How the grants are rolled out is extremely important – a smart allocation of these resources and what kind of outcomes that we can get – those are the first things. And those schemes must be targeted to help, to be able to do so. I think more and more of those schemes for businesses are now very targeted. But having too many of those grants and schemes and we risk going into a welfare state for businesses. That, I would not encourage.",6,84,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00084
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Secondly, we must make sure that we define success carefully. What is business success? Some people say, ""Raise as much capital as you can if you are a start-up so that you have millions and millions"", but you make losses. If you are a unicorn, it is okay to make losses and you raise a lot of money. Well, I do not buy that. I am pretty traditional in some sense, maybe a Teochew businessman type, which is that all businesses still have to be profitable. You can raise a lot of money, you can make a lot of losses, but no end to come, you would not see the tipping point. You will struggle. You will still struggle. So, you will hone your skills in fundraising but not hone your skills in building the business. That is a worry.",7,85,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00085
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"So, how do you define success? Is success an exiting of the business when you gain or what? I believe that success in business, to me, is about building a business with a social conscience. The product or services that you provide must have some social impact in order to make it very meaningful. But at the same time, commercially viable. That, to me, is the most important.",8,86,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00086
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Thirdly is to have the environment. So, whatever reserves and schemes we have are to be able to create the environment for some risk-taking, embracing failures, so that our people do not give up. They try and keep trying. I think that is the most difficult part in terms of culture. But you can see our Government is so pro-business. Every which way, when there is a crisis, it will come up with more and more schemes. COVID-19 is a great example. You see a comprehensive slew of schemes and measures. Sometimes, I wonder, so many of them, I am also confused. Right? And I was also a culprit – creating those schemes and programmes as well. But at the end of the day, it is with good intention. The question is whether we are cushioning and detaching businesses from reality. Would they be more competitive when they go overseas? In COVID-19, I faced the same problem. I have both B2B and B2C businesses, especially B2C business dealing with consumers who are facing demand issues because the whole environment has been affected.",9,87,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00087
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"So, there are a few things that go through my mind when it comes to COVID-19 – the crisis itself, how it affects businesses. A few points here.",10,88,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00088
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"First, when I review my own businesses, all SMEs should ask ourselves whether we have the capital and resources like cash that can last us for the next two to three months if we are in the worst-case scenario – no demand, no revenue or minimal revenue. Can we handle or sustain? If we cannot, well, there are schemes where the Government is taking up a greater risk of the bank loan. So, borrow money, right? You can try. But I also know that, on the ground, sometimes it is difficult because the banks are not changing their risk assessment to let you have access to the capital. So, you have to keep trying. The first thing is to ask ourselves whether we have enough; second, maybe look for big companies. Right? And I am glad that Minister Chan, in one of the dialogues, said that big companies should help small companies. I hope so. But big companies have their own objectives, too. Unless a small company has value for the big companies, it is very hard to have a big company wanting to help a small company. So, what do you look for? Maybe an exit through the big company – let the big company acquire your small company or you just close it down, move on and move along.",11,89,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00089
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Secondly, COVID-19 does offer opportunities, too. For example, I had wanted to recruit this talent for a long time. But because of COVID-19, his company retrenched him. Suddenly, I have him available. Immediately, I recruited him. I would like to pay him the market rate, but I also could not afford it. So, he was willing to lower his salary and, suddenly, I have a great talent for IT in my company today and we are growing. He is glad that he joined a growing company. But he was willing to be able to say ""I joined the company. I managed my expectations. Let us grow it together"", which was an opportunity.",12,90,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00090
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"So, the talents are out there. Whilst I know the Government tells us, ""Let us train our workers, people and executives"". Well, also look out for some of these access to talents. NTUC actually came up with the Job Security Council. Maybe it is something that we can have access to some of the PMEs over there to see where we can do the matching. So, it is not all about retrenchment but about growing, too. So, this COVID-19 is not exactly all gloom and doom for many companies. Some of us are actually growing.",13,91,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00091
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Thirdly is to focus on the demand. Companies should focus on the demand. Is your product really having that demand? Maybe during this time, there are a few things that you have to do. First, lower your price, right? Second, refine your product again. Third, reposition your product. A lot of times, when it comes to this kind of crisis, we will look up to the Government to see what schemes to apply. I was telling my staff and my team this morning I do not think we want to do that. We look for competitiveness. We lower our price and we have to expand our market. Go overseas, go to new markets. Of course, I am already overseas. But where are the newer markets to expand your market and expand your revenue base? Because that is where we can help. And we realised that one of the markets that we are going to used to be 30% higher cost and is now 30% lower cost if I were to launch my product there and I thought ""Why not?"" That offers an opportunity.",14,92,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00092
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"At the end of the day, it is important to know that a lot of these things that we are doing today, we have to change. We may call it ""transformation"". But I will just say that it is just a transition, it is just a change. If you have been selling your product from a shop, then it is time for you to think about selling it online, without the sunk costs, without additional labour, you sell it online, figuring out how to do the logistics and delivery. I think a lot of people say ""We want to do it"" but, at the end of the day, they may not do it.",15,93,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00093
2020-02-28-T-003,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Most importantly is that at the end of COVID-19 or any other crisis or challenge, let us not give up. Let us not give up on what we can do because Singapore is in a much better shape not just in tackling the COVID-19 issues, the virus itself and making sure of healthcare but business-wise as well. I still see vibrancy in our businesses; I still see revenues rising for some of the companies. It is not everybody is doing badly. So, because of that, we can work together, both public and private sectors, as well as all of us in the House, to help bring this economy back up again. [Applause.]",16,94,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00094

With systematic and long-term planning, we have developed new facilities, like the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, deepened research capabilities in health and biomedical sciences, built up our networks of experts and honed our effectiveness in contact tracing and quarantine. Most importantly, we have well-trained and dedicated people. These capabilities are now deployed to good effect to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak.",11,106,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00106

2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"I have received a wide range of feedback about the support. Many are relieved that we have a strong and decisive Budget, with both broad-based and targeted support. Many Members of this House have asked if we are doing enough, particularly for businesses in the sectors directly affected and those feeling the knock-on effects. On the other hand, some economists have wondered if we are doing too much.",14,109,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00109
2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"We must not fight the current war simply based on the lessons of the last war.

So, we should, to the best of our ability, make a sound diagnosis of the current challenges and apply a decisive course of action, or as one says in Chinese, ""对症下药"", fit the remedy to the case.",15,110,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00110
2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"At the same time, we must bear in mind the caution that Ministers Gan Kim Yong and Lawrence Wong have given – this is a fast-moving, fluid situation. While the evidence is that the impact of the COVID-19 virus is more like H1N1 than SARS, its rapid spread through places like Iran, Italy and South Korea demonstrates the fluidity of the situation.",16,111,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00111

2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The overall size of our spending in Budget 2020 is appropriate for now. We have calibrated it to put sufficient purchasing power back into the economy, while injecting a boost of confidence. In fact, our Budget is higher than what most economists had expected. This took into account the context of the global slowdown and wider uncertainties.",19,114,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00114

2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The two biggest items in the Stabilisation and Support Package – the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) – are focused on preserving and enhancing jobs. With greater job assurance, workers are in a better frame of mind to go for training. It will also avoid them having to cut down too much on consumption. SMEs, which employ the bulk of local workers and whose concerns were raised by Ms Denise Phua and Mr Ong Teng Koon, are a key focus of these two schemes. As a percentage of revenue, SMEs will receive payouts that are on average five times as much as the average for all enterprises. This is on top of the help they will also receive through the Corporate Income Tax Rebate and other measures.",21,116,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00116

2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Our sector-specific measures are calibrated according to the extent to which each sector has been affected. Tourism, accommodation and aviation have been hit hardest and are therefore given additional support. In total, these sectors will receive over $400 million, in addition to the broad-based support that they will get through JSS, WCS and Corporate Income Tax Rebate. This will include enhanced absentee payroll support for workers, an issue that Mr Seah Kian Peng raised. Ministries will announce further details on this.",23,118,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00118

2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The disbursement of the JSS payout is operationally more complex due to the need to check and validate information on workers, employers and payment mode. Hence, we had initially projected for the JSS payout to reach companies by the end of July. In the last few weeks, the agencies involved have redoubled efforts and are now targeting to bring forward the payment for JSS from end-July to end-May. Employers using bank crediting will get the payout about a week earlier. Enhancements to WCS will be provided in the second half of this year. This way, we can also spread out our support for enterprises in a more sustained way.",28,123,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00123

2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"We should also look at the measures in the Stabilisation and Support Package in totality.

This is exemplified by PARKROYAL at Kitchener Road. I visited PARKROYAL this Tuesday. I was impressed by the measures they are taking during this downtime to renovate the hotel, redesign processes, retrain their workers and redesign jobs. They are able to do this because even before the COVID-19 outbreak, they had been making plans to transform their operations to cope with manpower constraints.

Some are pooling their money. Young leaders from six business families in the Singapore Business Federation, Young Business Leaders Network has set up a $5 million fund called the ""Helping our promising enterprises"" or SBFYBL and Hope Fund, to provide financing help for local enterprises hit by COVID-19.

2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The GST is only one part of our fiscal system. When you look at the system of taxes and benefits as a whole, it is a progressive one. Those who are better off, contribute more. The top 10% of taxpayers pay about 80% of our personal income tax revenue. As shown in this chart, lower and middle income households receive proportionately more benefits than the taxes they pay, whereas higher income groups contribute a far higher share of taxes than the share of benefits they receive. So, as you can see, the top 20% pay 55% of the taxes and receive 12% of the benefit. The bottom 20% pay 9% of the taxes and receive 28% of the benefits.",128,223,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00223

2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The reserves are our nest egg, borne of hard work and discipline. During the earlier years of economic catch-up, Singapore experienced fast growth and had a young working population. Our founding fathers made the decision to save the country’s surpluses and invest it for the long term to build up Singapore’s nest egg. They could have just spent it to gain immediate political advantage. But they were principled and had the long-term interests of our people and our nation at heart.",134,229,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00229
2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"In FY2019, our Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) was $17 billion, or 3.3% of GDP, the largest single contributor to the Budget. This is a highly unusual and a very fortunate position. Most advanced countries, shown in the lower half of this chart, pay about 2% of their GDP in debt servicing of accumulated debt. They collect taxes to pay off the debts of previous generations. As you can see from that graph, the red line is the US and the green line on top is France and Germany, in between at about 2%.",135,230,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00230
2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"In Singapore, as shown in the top half of the chart, it is the opposite. Our reserves generate substantial returns, which help to keep our taxes low. In other words, in most advanced countries, citizens today pay for the spending of the past generations. In Singapore, it is the reverse. citizens today enjoy the benefits of the savings from the past. Thanks to the foresight and policies of our founding generation of leaders and people.",136,231,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00231
2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"You can work out the sums simply. Today, NIRC at $17 billion is more than personal income tax at $12 billion and GST collections at $11 billion. So if we did not have the NIRC, even doubling personal income tax, or doubling the GST rate to 14%, would still not be enough. Tell me – in which other country are citizens able to reap the benefits of past savings in this way? So, let us never forget that what we have inherited is very unusual and very precious. Let us be responsible and steward this properly for our future generations.",137,232,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00232
2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Mr Leon Perera asked if we can slow the rate of growth of our reserves and release more funds to invest in our people and companies. I am sure he is aware that in 2008, we introduced the Net Investment Returns framework, and in 2015, we passed a constitutional amendment to add Temasek in the framework. This has resulted in a significant increase in NIRC that has gone towards various spending, including investments in our capabilities to generate future growth. Put it in another way, today at $17 billion, the NIRC is able to cover almost the combined budget of MOE and MTI.",138,233,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00233

That calmed our depositors.",140,235,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00235
2020-02-28-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"I was the Managing Director of MAS at that point. And I can tell you that our officers in MAS worked day and night to safeguard the stability of the banking system, and totally conscious that we were using our past reserves as a guarantee, but we were also confident that the guarantee will be put to good use because it is to stabilise the confidence of depositors. So, throughout that period, we had a very difficult time but towards the end of it, we did not have a single bank run. And the $150 billion remained untouched. It went back to our past reserves. Singaporeans’ money was safe.",141,236,2020-02-28-T-003-S-00236

With spare land to install solar panels or wind turbines, something practically impossible to undertake on a large enough scale in land-scare Singapore, building transmission lines to connect to our neighbours would allow Singapore to readily tap on clean power and significantly reduce our reliance for fossil fuels for electricity generation. It would also significantly enlarge our green footprint and boost our contribution to reduce the debilitating effects of climate change.",1,399,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00399

Have they shared how they can balance pursuing their aspirations with starting a family and how they see society supporting them in achieving this balance?",2,514,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00514
2020-02-28-T-006,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs and National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"In recent conversations with youths, some have shared their interest to work and study overseas. The Government is also promoting this, so that youths have a wider perspective and can also gain international experience which is extremely helpful in their careers and personal development. How do youths reconcile the internationalisation message with settling down with a family in Singapore?",3,515,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00515

2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Similar to most developed economies, our total fertility rate is below replacement – at 1.14 for last year and the year before. Globally, many countries are like Singapore, where birth rates have been declining since the 1970s. Some Nordic countries that had previously reversed the decline, have seen birth rates falling again in recent years.",5,521,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00521
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"However, there are some positive signs in Singapore. The average number of citizen births in the last five years is higher than previous five-year periods. From 2015 to 2019, we had around 33,000 births annually. This is higher than the average from 2010 to 2014, of around 32,000 births annually. I believe Mr Alex Yam, Mr Desmond Choo, Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Louis Ng, Ms Rahayu Mahzam and also Ms Sun Xueling, perhaps Mr Pritam Singh as well, all contributed to this. Thank you very much. Please keep going.",6,522,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00522
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"On top of this, as some Singaporeans live overseas, we welcomed about 1,600 Singaporean babies born overseas each year, over the past five years. This is also higher than the average in previous five-year periods. So, to Ms Sun Xueling's question, it is not incompatible – your overseas ambitions and raising a family – this can be done.",7,523,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00523

2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"At the Committee of Supply debate last year, I indicated that we would embark on a consultation process, to better understand Singaporeans’ needs and concerns around forming families. The aim was to move beyond feedback and suggestions, to work with fellow Singaporeans on practical ways to address marriage and parenthood issues. This is what the Singapore Together movement is all about. We are heartened that many Singaporeans stepped forward to take part.",10,526,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00526
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"We launched a series of online polls, inviting Singaporeans to give suggestions on how to better support young families. As Mr Christopher de Souza and Ms Sun Xueling mentioned, Singaporeans believe that making Singapore a great place for families requires partnerships across society. At home, most Singaporeans viewed parenting as a shared responsibility between spouses. At the workplace, Singaporeans felt that having supportive bosses and understanding colleagues were critical factors that enabled them to meet their work and family commitments. Respondents also raised concerns about the cost of having children.",11,527,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00527
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"We have listened carefully to their views. Last year, we announced significant enhancements to support young families. With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I ask the Clerks to distribute a booklet showing the key marriage and parenthood benefits today?",12,528,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00528

2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Desmond Choo asked how these enhancements have benefited young Singaporean families. Let me elaborate on three major moves.",1,530,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00530
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, couples can now more easily enrol their child in an affordable and good quality pre-school. We have increased the amount of pre-school subsidies, and made them available to even more families. Today, after subsidies, a working couple who earn a combined $5,000 a month, pays $130 per month per child for full-day childcare at an Anchor Operator pre-school. This is about a third of what they would have paid previously.",2,531,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00531
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To ensure that quality pre-schools are accessible to all families, we have kept fees affordable at all Government-supported pre-schools; fee caps for Partner Operator preschools will also come down next year.",3,532,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00532
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In addition, ECDA has been growing the number of pre-school places. By around 2025, eight in 10 pre-schoolers can have a place in a Government-supported preschool, up from just over five in 10 today.",4,533,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00533
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In the medium term, we aim to make full-day childcare at Government-supported pre-schools as affordable as the cost of Primary school plus afterschool student care. This is not even including the means-tested pre-school subsidies, which will allow low- and middle income families to pay even less. At the same time, we will ensure good quality learning and care across all pre-schools. These are significant steps that we are taking, to ensure that we continue to give every Singaporean child a good start in life.",5,534,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00534
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Second, housing is now more affordable for newly married couples. We have heard couples’ feedback on the importance of getting their own home before starting a family. We have made it faster for them to get a BTO flat. HDB has launched more than 3,600 BTO flats with shorter waiting times. The wait of about two and a half years is shorter than the usual three to four years.",6,535,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00535
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Couples can also more easily own a flat with the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG). First-timer families now receive up to $80,000 in grants when purchasing a new HDB flat, and up to $160,000 when purchasing an HDB resale flat. Since its inception, about 1,000 first-timer families have benefited from the Enhanced Housing Grant.",7,536,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00536
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In addition, the income ceiling was raised. More couples are able to purchase subsidised HDB flats and Executive Condominiums.",8,537,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00537
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Third, we improved the affordability of healthcare for children, and fertility treatments.",9,538,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00538
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"By the end of this year, every Singaporean child will enjoy subsidies for all nationally recommended childhood vaccinations and developmental screenings, at polyclinics as well as CHAS GP clinics.

2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,These enhancements reinforce our strong support for marriage and parenthood in Singapore. They have also been well-received by many Singaporeans.,12,541,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00541
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Ms Rahayu Mahzam was concerned that many Singaporeans find it a challenge to balance work and family. Mr Christopher de Souza asked whether there would be further enhancements based on feedback received.,13,542,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00542
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We have been working on ways to help families achieve better harmony in work and life, including whether to have longer leave for parents. At present, working couples have a combined total of 20 weeks of paid parental leave and two weeks of unpaid leave in their child’s first year. In addition, each parent receives six days of paid childcare leave annually until their child turns seven, and two days of paid childcare leave until the child turns 12.",14,543,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00543
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We announced the three-year Public Sector pilot on Unpaid Infant Care Leave in 2017. The pilot enables public officers to take up to four weeks of Unpaid Infant Care Leave in the first year after their child’s birth. This benefit has been well-received by parents who need it. Their supervisors and colleagues have also been supportive and feel that it has not affected their teams’ productivity. As such, we will formalise it as a permanent HR leave provision within the Public Service. We hope that more private companies will be encouraged by the Public Service’s positive experience, and initiate similar support to their employees.",15,544,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00544
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"There have been calls from time to time, including from Mr Louis Ng, to further enhance leave schemes for parents. We will continuously review all support measures for parenthood. We had prioritised housing, pre-school and healthcare because these were what young families said mattered most.",16,545,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00545
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Of course, when conditions allow, young families would welcome more paid leave being mandated. However, it would be unwise for us to ignore the impact on employers. While the public sector is in a position to do more than current legislation requires, we cannot assume the same for all businesses, especially SMEs which are the single largest group of employers and already facing manpower constraints.",17,546,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00546
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In the face of economic uncertainties and the pressure for businesses to transform, tripartite partners are also mindful not to add further to employers' burdens. Instead of imposing higher obligations on all, we will provide greater support to businesses that are able to do more, such as supporting them in implementing flexible work arrangements (FWAs). After all, working parents have consistently given us feedback that flexible work arrangements are key in supporting them to manage work and family commitments. I should add that when companies implement flexible work arrangements, other employees who are not parents also benefit. They tend to feel a greater sense of fairness. For example, if some do not have young children but have elderly parents who, from time to time, have medical appointments that they also need to take them to.",18,547,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00547
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As it turns out, a focus on promoting flexible work arrangements was also the preference of the Citizens’ Panel convened last year. The Panel brought together 55 fellow Singaporeans of diverse backgrounds to develop ways to improve work-life harmony in Singapore. I was heartened by their enthusiasm and commitment to build a future Singapore that would be more supportive of work-life harmony.",19,548,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00548
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Panel recommended thoughtful solutions, such as promoting flexible work arrangements and introducing more progressive HR practices.

2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"""Making It Accepted"". We will work together to shift societal norms and the mindsets of employers, employees and individuals in the larger community. MCCY will provide support through Our Singapore Fund, for Singaporeans who wish to organise meaningful projects that encourage these shifts.",25,554,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00554

2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Supporting marriage and parenthood is the Government's top priority for the population. Our policies and enhancements over the years attest to that.,27,556,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00556
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"However, I agree with Mr Alex Yam that beyond policy, a whole-of-society approach is needed to build a family-friendly Singapore. For instance, when we see parents with young children struggling with their prams in public spaces, do we step forward to lend a helping hand? When a colleague goes on paternity leave, do we say supportive words of encouragement or do we cast aspersions on this necessity? Quite often, it is societal values, workplace and cultural norms that determine whether raising a family is achievable, enjoyable and celebrated.",28,557,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00557
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Let me turn now to immigration matters, which Dr Lim Wee Kiak raised. This is a delicate issue in many places around the world.",29,558,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00558
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"With current birth rates and as our society ages, our citizen population will likely decline. For many years now, we have taken in a carefully controlled number of new citizens each year to keep the citizen population stable over the long term. As immigrants are mostly from younger age groups, this also helps to moderate our pace of ageing.",30,559,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00559
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Government has kept the pace of immigration calibrated, in line with our commitments. Over the past five years, we granted about 22,100 new Singapore citizenships on average each year. We also granted about 31,700 Permanent Residencies on average each year. We have kept the total size of the PR population at around half a million for many years now.",31,560,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00560
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"It is not easy to become a new citizen or PR. Many applications are rejected. We have high expectations of those who join our community. Newcomers who want to make Singapore their home have the responsibility to adapt to our way of life, and must continue to contribute to our society and economy.",32,561,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00561
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"One good example is Mr Trieu Dang Huy, who works as a senior projects executive at Singapore Airlines. He has lived in Singapore for 14 years and became a Singapore Citizen last year. When Mr Trieu first moved here, he took it upon himself to learn English, Mandarin and Singlish, so much so that when he speaks now, it is hard to tell that he was originally from Vietnam. Mr Trieu met his wife while studying at NUS. Together, they believe it is important to contribute to society and donate blood regularly. They also have a young son who is Singaporean. Members of this House would know of other examples.",33,562,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00562

2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Let me just highlight one new initiative. As part of the Singapore Together movement, we are inviting Singaporeans to help craft the content for the Singapore Citizenship Journey – a compulsory programme for all who seek to take up Singapore citizenship. I am happy that many have stepped forward. This will complement our existing efforts. For example, the People's Association appoints Integration and Naturalisation Champions to help new citizens and PRs settle into their neighbourhoods. They organise chit-chat sessions, interest groups and learning journeys to nudge newcomers to make new friends and get involved in the community. We continue to welcome Singaporeans' views on how we help newcomers to better integrate into our society.",35,564,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00564

We first tested this at the National Heart Centre. The GovTech team worked with the healthcare practitioners in the Heart Centre to improve the pilot solution, before rolling it out to more places.

For instance, online retailers like Carousell who have promoted users as verified buyers or sellers when they sign up using MyInfo, thereby building up trust in online transactions and the marketplace. Businesses also report saving up to $50 per transaction and processing transactions five times faster when their customers use MyInfo to prefill forms.

There are 100,000 of them in Singapore. They have the advantage of being in a have fixed location. Lampposts do not move. They are always powered. These attributes have made them very convenient to deploy sensors on. We are deploying sensors and testing out some use cases.

In particular, only officers with legitimate use of the data will be able to access the data, and the data will be de-identified for data analysis and for planning work. It will be identifiable only when absolutely necessary. For instance, in service delivery or in the case of facial recognition, if the Police need it to identify missing persons or for the purposes of investigation, then, under carefully controlled circumstances, that will be enabled.

He applied his skills in cloud architecture and app development and deployment.

These scams capitalise on the victims' lack of knowledge on how things function in the Internet age. An innocuous core is all it takes for the scammer to try to gain remote access to the victim's computer, bank account information, personal identification number and one-time password.

2020-02-28-T-006,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"While the scammer may work on this victim for hours, the success of such scams hinges on the split-second transfer of money out of the victim's bank account. If we have cooling-off period for direct sale, can the bank offers such feature for interbank transfer on demand as well? Any change of mind for such a cooling-off service will require a visit to the bank in person.

Every one of us can be targeted and the elderly are especially vulnerable. Such scams and crimes typically trick individuals into handing over monies through fake investment schemes or by using their personal information to access their bank accounts. The few cases that Mr Png mentioned fall into the latter category. The criminals can reach out to their victims either through phone calls, messages, emails, even cyber attacks.",1,680,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00680
2020-02-28-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Singapore Police Force (SPF), the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and our banks, have been working together to protect Singaporeans against these online scams and crimes. Our efforts have focused on the following four areas.",2,681,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00681
2020-02-28-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, raising public awareness. Public agencies have stepped up educational initiatives through media campaigns, roadshows and community outreach programmes. MoneySense, our national financial education programme, regularly puts out public messages to caution the public against online crimes and scams. Banks also regularly remind their customers, ""Do not to disclose your account details, User IDs, passwords or SMS One-Time-Passwords (OTPs) to anyone, no matter who they claim to be"". Bank customers have also been encouraged to maintain strong cyber hygiene by installing anti-virus software and regularly updating it.",3,682,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00682
2020-02-28-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Second, MAS has issued various regulations and guidelines related to the security of online transactions. For example, banks must implement multi-factor authentication so that scammers cannot perform online transactions using only the User IDs and passwords of their victims. You must have the OTPs as well. Fraud monitoring and detection systems are another prerequisite to facilitate timely detection and blocking of suspicious transactions. On a real-time basis, transaction alerts are sent to customers to allow them to quickly notify their banks of any unauthorised payment transactions. These security measures to curb unauthorised transactions, have become industry norms in Singapore.",4,683,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00683
2020-02-28-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Third, we freeze accounts suspected of receiving the proceeds from online scams. Where specific bank accounts have been identified to be associated with scams, the SPF's Anti-Scam Centre will freeze the relevant bank accounts as soon as possible. Doing so disrupts the scam operation and increases the chances of recovering victims' monies. In this regard, Mr Png suggested a possible cooling-off option and feature for elderly customers to opt-in, so that when they make a transfer, maybe it will happen 24 hours later. This is something that we can discuss with the banks as a possible way to help, as an option for elderly customers.",5,684,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00684
2020-02-28-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Fourth, where the scam is cross-border in nature, SPF will seek the cooperation of their foreign counterparts. The Transnational Commercial Crime Task Force (TCTF) was set up in October 2017 to investigate transnational scams such as China Officials Impersonation Scams, Internet Love Scams and Credit-for-Sex scams. It actively shares information with foreign law enforcement agencies and where possible, works with them to mount joint operations. Nine operations have been conducted since the set-up of TCTF, which resulted in at least 440 cases solved and the arrest of over 100 suspects regionally.",6,685,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00685
2020-02-28-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"But, as Mr Png mentioned, the sophistication of scams will continue to evolve. The criminals are getting smarter and smarter. The cross-border nature also poses additional challenges and limits what our public agencies and banks can achieve on their own. That is why core to our anti-cyber scam strategy has to be public awareness and education, so that all of us remain vigilant and do not fall prey to cybercrimes.",7,686,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00686

2020-02-28-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Today, we have seen several traditional jobs being automated completely, for example, services that are now online and where customers can do self-checkout and self-help. On the other hand, we also see some jobs, that are performed very differently today – for instance, through deploying RPA and ""training"" robots, as opposed to performing the manual tasks ourselves. What this means for Singapore, is that as a small and open economy, we need to be able to transform and innovate new products and services to maintain our competitiveness, while working within manpower constraints. Technology and longer career spans are two positive opportunities that can help us overcome our constraints.

In the latest Estimates, this has risen to $1.05 billion. The PMO houses functions that cut across Ministries relating to climate and population, for example. But over the years, the PMO has also come to acquire coordinating and leadership roles in a number of areas where there would seem to be a more natural fit with domain Ministries. For example, why is National Research Foundation programme under the PMO rather than MTI since research should be pursued in such a way as to maximise and multiply its benefits to industry and to the economy, which is MTI's purview?",1,702,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00702

Does this mean that all policymaking fields that function at the national as opposed to sectoral level and cut across Ministries to some degree will eventually come under the PMO? And if so, how do we ensure that the duplication of functions and expertise is minimised vis-a-vis domain Ministries, which generally have more staff with expertise in the domains? How would we also ensure that due weight in policymaking is given to subject matter experts in the domain Ministries?",3,704,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00704

It has been so and it will continue to be so. Let me first deal with Mr Leon Perera's question on how PMO decides which programmes come under its purview. There are usually three sets of considerations. First, if it deals with strategic issues with long-term consequences. Second, if it requires close coordination across many agencies. Third, if it is a nascent new capability where we need to incubate that capability development before we pass it on to a relevant Ministry.",2,726,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00726
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"So, you are right.

2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"The first and most fundamental mindset shift required before we even talk about all these technologies is this. The Public Service is committed to design our services and processes around the people whom we serve, around the businesses whom we serve. Now, this is fundamental. The rest will follow from here.",5,729,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00729
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"So, as mentioned, digital is a tremendous opportunity for the Public Service to embrace to better deliver our services in a more integrated fashion, at a faster speed at a lower cost.

2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"The second thing that we can expect with this mindset shift would be the cross-training of our officers to deliver services in an integrated manner. Our Tampines Hub is a great example. Various public agencies have come together to first co-locate and provide convenience to residents seeking services across different agencies. Today, we have moved on whereby a single officer has been cross-trained to provide services across different agencies.",7,731,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00731
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"This is the direction that the Public Service will continue to go in order to deliver quality services to the residents who need help.

So, this is the second example of how the mindset shift has gone on in the Public Service.",8,732,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00732

2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"But what I want to end off on this part is what Mr Cedric Foo mentioned. No matter how technology-dependent we will be, we will never forget that at the core of the Public Service is the heart for our people. The way we design the services, the way we design the app, be it for the young or the old, is to make sure that the service is delivered with the heart. For people who need the service but are unable to access technology, we will make sure that the processes are simplified, the service delivery is integrated, so that they will never be left out.

2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"The second thing that we want to is to make sure that they have the ability to rotate more even within the same domain and this will address one of the points that Dr Teo Ho Pin mentioned. How do we make sure that we check our own blind spots even if we are doing the same job? For example, in regulatory matters, by being able to go to different agencies and see how different regulatory ideas are applied, will allow our public officers to be much more responsive, much more agile.",16,740,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00740
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"The third thing that we can expect our public officers to do is this. If we have a 50-year career for the Public Service officer, we must make sure that they have the training that can allow them to have lifelong employability, as Mr Patrick has also mentioned. And this will require us to structure their training such that every few years, there will be a booster jab in their skills. When we ask our Public Service officers to be agile, it cannot be at the age of 40s or 50s. It must be done systematically, from age 20 and above.",17,741,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00741

2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Having dealt with all the changes that we can expect from the Public Service, I must reiterate one point. While the methods can change, the technology can change, the values of the Public Service will not change. The values of service excellence and integrity will never change in the Public Service. Service beyond self. The interests of the country and our people must always come before the interests of the individual officers. The pursuit of excellence is not just for today but always being able to anticipate the challenges of tomorrow, put in place systems and processes before the challenges even arise.",21,745,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00745

2020-02-28-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Sir. I just wanted to ask Minister Josephine Teo about the childcare sick leave. I understand that we are reviewing it but I am just wondering we can also review and look into what other countries are doing. There is a long list of countries that are providing the childcare sick leave – I would not read the whole thing – there is Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland. It is a much longer list. In the interest, I would not read them all. But I am just wondering whether PMO can study what other countries are doing, see how successful it is, see how they implement it and then we can do a proper review. I think the Minister once said that all good things will be considered. This is a good thing that should be considered.",1,748,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00748
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, the short answer to Mr Ng is yes. We do actually study and we study them holistically too. The Marriage and Parenthood Support measures, they do work in concert with one another and they have to work within the context of each country. And I think in our case, what is even more relevant is to reach out to the young people themselves and ask them what is it that they are looking for. And they have been consistent in telling us  help us with housing, help us with pre-school, help us with healthcare, and very importantly, help us to achieve more flexible work arrangements.",1,749,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00749

2020-02-28-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Thank you, Sir. Just a small clarification to Minister Chan. If I understood Minister Chan correctly, he said that there are three considerations for determining the functions within the PMO. And I think the third point was that, functions are sometimes incubated and then transferred to a Ministry where there is a more natural fit with the domain of that Ministry after a certain period of time.",1,752,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00752
2020-02-28-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"So, firstly, is that understanding correct? And secondly, where does that leave us, in terms of functions that have been there for a very long time? For example, the NRF. It is under PMO. I think that has been there for quite sometime vis-a-vis MTI.",2,753,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00753
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I thank Mr Leon Perera for that. On NRF, I would just like to clarify that NRF does not just serve economic functions. The NRF also conducts research in many other things, for example, ageing and societal forces as well. So, there is a good reason why NRF resides under PMO.",1,754,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00754
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Having said that, the NRF works very closely with MTI and, of course, A*STAR which is under MTI for the economic portions of it. So, whether it is the future of decarbonisation, the future of our bio-medical industries, they work very closely. We have also a very simple way to make sure that this is coordinated closely between NRF, A*STAR and MTI because the Chairperson of A*STAR is also the Permanent Secretary for NRF. If the two organisations have any issues, then it is actually internalised within the leadership team.",2,755,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00755

2020-02-28-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Chairman. I have two questions and one clarification. The two questions are for Minister Josephine Teo. I thank the Minister for her speech at the PMO COS covering population issues. Two points I raised in my cut. The first was the number of PRs that do not transition to citizenship. I think there was some very helpful data that was released in the Population in Brief document from September last year, that tells you at what age group these PRs are at. But what about those that do not transit to citizenship? What are those numbers like?",1,757,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00757
2020-02-28-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The second clarification pertains to the question I had on integration. I think the Minister also re-stated the point that new immigrants have to play their part and get involved. But on the flip side, we have two or three decades now of immigration experience. What are some of the points that the immigrants themselves raised? What are the issues that they had in integrating with the community?",2,758,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00758
2020-02-28-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The third point is a clarification for Minister Vivian. I think Minister Vivian said that Senior Minister of State Janil was going to say something about smart lamp posts but I do not believe the Senior Minister of State said anything about that. So, I am just clarifying that point.",3,759,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00759

2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, with regard to PRs, I think the important thing is that the PR population has been quite stable. It has been about half a million; we have basically kept it at that level. There will always be a certain number that may take awhile before they decide to become citizens. If they leave Singapore and do not return for a long period of time, then their re-entry permits could be cancelled.",1,761,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00761
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As they become citizens, the length of time they take to become citizens does not matter. Some take a shorter time; some take a longer time. Sometimes, it is a matter of thinking about it themselves, because it is hard to eventually make that transition. In some cases, they move faster. I think the important thing is that we have kept the PR population stable.",2,762,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00762
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Then, to the Member's other question. I think this is with regard to integration as to what do the new citizens themselves say about the challenges of integration. The practical thing will be that social habits are different. Singapore has high density living, and most will live in public housing, very close to their neighbours. That is why a lot of the emphasis on integration is carried out through the People's Association, which has the ability to reach to a large number of citizens. This includes new as well as long-time citizens.",3,763,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00763
2020-02-28-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The other is a very interesting observation is almost certainly, that second generation citizens acquire the features of local life very quickly.

2020-02-28-T-006,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng,"Chairman, this question is for Minister Chan. Historically, many Government agencies and Ministries design systems and processes from their points of view. I think the public will be well served if Government agencies can think ""the other way around"" and try to design processes from the citizens' or businesses' points of view. Does PMO intend to achieve this?",1,768,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00768
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr. Chairman, indeed, we totally agree with what Mr Cedric had said. And that is my point. We need to turn this around. It is easy, it is usual for people to think from their own perspective – how do people fit into my Ministry's policy objectives? So, from the exercise in designing the Moments of Life and equivalent apps, we have turned this around. We have asked people, ""If you are a parent-to-be, what are the questions that you would want answered? What are the services that you would want?""",1,769,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00769
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We do what we call a Service Journey. The officers, together from different Ministries and agencies, will walk the entire journey and imagine themselves in the shoes of the people that they are going to serve. And from there on, all their services will be designed around making it more convenient for the people that they are serving. That is how we have been able to achieve breakthroughs in the Moments of Life and even our Tampines Hub (OTH).",2,770,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00770
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But there is another very important element that we are putting our officers through. It is what we call empathy training or empathy design. How we lay out the services to welcome the residents whom we serve, how we design the processes that they have to go through. That requires training. It is not an after-thought. How our officers speak to the residents is also an acquired skill.",3,771,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00771
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In order to do that, we make sure that our Public Service leaders walk-the-talk. We make sure people, right from the leadership level, take the lead, by going onto the ground to serve the residents. So, we have many examples of this whereby even Chief Executives and the leadership team will be at the service counter serving the residents, seeing how the residents respond to the policies from different agencies, what are the challenges and how we can redesign the processes to do better.",4,772,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00772
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We have senior officers, for example, in the communications department and various other public officers walking the ground on weekends, talking to ordinary Singaporeans, hearing their feedback first-hand, unfiltered. This is part of the work that the REACH officers are doing. But it is not just the REACH officers that are doing this. Actually, many of our officers whom I am very proud of volunteered to do this so that they can go to the ground and hear for themselves first-hand how people are responding and reacting to the changes that they make.",5,773,2020-02-28-T-006-S-00773
2020-02-28-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, it is design upfront, change in their mindset and training of the officers in order to deliver a much more empathetic Public Service.

Growth projections for 5G, Robotics and blockchain technology applications are similarly breathtaking. Traditionally, economic development is predominantly the responsibility of MTI, but increasingly, several other Ministries are overseeing vertical domains which are filled with opportunities for innovation, technology applications and industry development. For instance, MND has deep knowledge of planning a smart and sustainable city, MCI for smart nation, MOT for driverless transportation, MEWR for clean energy and water solutions, MOF for Fin Tech, and MOH for telemedicine. In all these areas problem solving will require multi-disciplinary knowledge employing the new technologies I just mentioned. These Ministries are in very good position to champion R&D applications and industry development in their respective domain expert areas.",2,811,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00811

Whether it is the case of a failed marriage or the untimely death of a spouse, the burden and responsibility of single parenthood is a long and arduous journey to undertake. I have seen a number of single parents at my Meet-the-People sessions over the years. While most of them were women, there were single fathers who came along with the children in tow.",1,819,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00819
2020-02-28-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The story they share about raising their children all by themselves is a story of love and perseverance. A story that highlights the need and importance to have a support network comprising their extended family, friends and even enacted policies to make single parenthood work for them. Recently, a single father wrote to me to share about his experience about raising his two young children. While he works hard to put bread on the table for his young family and to provide for his aged parents, he found out that the taxman does not really recognise his role and effort as a single father.",2,820,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00820

While this single father can work out the apportionment of the Qualifying Child Relief with his ex-spouse, there is no levy relief for him if he hires a foreign domestic helper to look after his young children. This single father would fit the criteria for FML relief to the letter, except for the fact that he is of the wrong gender.",3,821,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00821

2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Such resources did not come about overnight. They were built up over several decades. They were the result of prudent fiscal policies put in place by our pioneering leaders. So, it is imperative that we continue to uphold this sound fiscal approach in order to maintain our strong financial position. In particular, as Ms Foo Mee Har mentioned just now and I think Mr Cedric Foo also said earlier in the Budget Debate, every generation must contribute its fair share and not leave an undue burden for the next generation to bear. This is why we must continue to pay for recurrent needs with recurrent revenues. That is why every year when we prepare the Budget, we do not come to Parliament to appropriate monies just for the sake of spending every cent. Instead, we look at each project on its merit, we spend on what we deem to be cost-effective, and then if there are any savings, we set these aside for anticipated future needs, as we did this year. We set aside some amount of money for climate change.",3,846,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00846

In fact, this is already the case. While MTI is the lead agency for the economy, various Government agencies do take on sectoral lead roles. For example, as all of you would know, MAS oversees the financial services sector; the IMDA looks at industry development for the IT sector; and the BCA takes care of the built environment, and so on. All in all, we have 23 Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) and we have set aside budgets for the respective lead agencies to support the implementation of the ITMs and that would include technology adoption, R&D and industry development.

So, this example illustrates the approach we take, how we scale up progressively, relying on data, evidence and learning points to improve the programme, and then, constantly review the effectiveness of public spending.",23,866,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00866
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),Mr Liang earlier shared about his work as a Member of the Public Accounts Committee. Let me thank him and the Public Accounts Committee for their hard work in scrutinising public expenditure.,24,867,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00867
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Addressing lapses that Mr Liang and Ms Foo mentioned is a continuing effort that requires balance between controls and efficiency. Like any large organisation, we recognise that it will not be possible to achieve zero lapses, given the high volume of transactions across the Government. Nevertheless, where lapses are found, our agencies will take immediate steps to address them and strengthen their controls to minimise recurrence. This may include relooking at our policies, practices and systems, as well as stepping up training of public officers.",25,868,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00868
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I assure Ms Foo that the Government adopts a zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption. Those who commit wrongdoing will face the full measure of the law. Where appropriate, disciplinary actions are also brought against officers responsible for lapses. MOF will spare no effort, as we work with agencies to ensure that the Government remains responsible, open and accountable in our use of public funds. We will continue to strengthen our system of checks and balances and instil discipline in every officer to make sound spending decisions.",26,869,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00869
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Next, Mr Leon Perera asked about succession plans and disclosure practices of Sovereign Wealth Funds, particularly of GIC and Temasek. The Government has explained its position clearly on these issues. Both GIC and Temasek are commercially-run entities, and the Government maintains an arm's-length relationship with them. The boards of these entities are ultimately responsible for their respective operations, performances as well as succession for leadership.",27,870,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00870
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"For these two entities, the focus and the mandate that we have put on them is to generate long-term financial returns for the benefit of Singaporeans. The two entities put out a lot of information every year in their annual reports, highlighting not just their performance, but also extensive information and commentary on their investment approach and their outlook. In fact, over the years, GIC and Temasek have progressively put out a lot more information than they used to.",28,871,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00871
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We will continue to encourage the two entities to review and examine what additional information they would like to put out in their annual reports. From the Government's point of view, our key consideration is this  whatever disclosure requirements that the two entities put out should be part of an overall system that enables these two entities to maximise their ability to secure long-term returns for the benefit of Singaporeans. That is our overall objective.",29,872,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00872
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We want to have a system that allows our two entities to succeed in achieving their mandate and we have to be very mindful of what kind of disclosure requirements we place on them, and be careful of not leading them to pursue indicators that can lead to undesirable behaviours. For example, if we were to insist, as some have suggested before, on publishing annual indicators of performance, some of these entities may then be driven towards short-term performance. That would not be in our interest because these are entities that are looking at achieving long-term financial returns.",30,873,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00873
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"If we are insistent on them disclosing indicators of fees and expenses to a great level of detail, it may lead these entities towards minimising expenses, potentially eroding capabilities or diminishing their talent pool, which would also not be in our interest. So, we are quite careful and deliberate in thinking about what sort of system we want to put in place and ultimately, it is a system that enhances the performance of the two entities in securing long-term returns.",31,874,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00874
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"That is why if you look at what is published, it is the long-term returns net of all expenses incurred, and the information is published for both GIC and Temasek in their annual reports.

2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Where there are Government benefits that support the child's growth and development, we will extend them, regardless of their parents' marital status. That is why all Singaporean children today receive over $180,000 of education subsidies by the time they turn 16, at least $6,000 in their Child Development Account (CDA) Grants and $4,000 in MediSave Grant for Newborns. In this way, we support all parents, including unwed parents, to give their children education opportunities, good healthcare and a conducive social environment, so they can realise their fullest potential in life.",34,877,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00877
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"For the Parenthood Tax Rebate and Working Mother's Child Relief, these were intended to support parenthood within marriage and for married mothers to continue working after childbirth. Likewise, for the Foreign Maid Levy Relief, this was specifically granted to encourage married women to continue working. So, there were specific objectives tied to these schemes. Having said that, all Members would know that,our schemes are never cast in stone. We continue to review and re-calibrate them from time to time.",35,878,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00878

2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I would encourage Members also to consider this. Besides looking at specific tax reliefs and comparing the benefits for one group versus another, it is important to take a step back and look at the broader picture. Ultimately, we all share common objectives. We want to give every child a good start in life, provide support for all parents and build strong families in Singapore. We have different schemes and policy tools to achieve these multiple objectives and we will continue to fine-tune and review our schemes to achieve the optimal balance.",37,880,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00880

2020-02-28-T-007,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"First, MOF has used regulatory sandboxes to lift procurement rules and allow agencies to test new approaches. One such sandbox enables Government agencies to negotiate with the most qualified bidders in open tenders to identify alternative solutions that provide better value for the Government. For instance, through this approach, we were able to secure a more cost-effective solution for a large ICT contract at tens of millions of dollars lower than the original bid price.",3,884,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00884
2020-02-28-T-007,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Second, we are introducing more dynamism in some of our bulk contracts to be responsive to market changes. While current ICT bulk contracts allow suppliers to refresh their prices, we are introducing further dynamism by allowing new requirements and new suppliers to be added throughout a multi-year contract. This is especially pertinent in an environment of rapid technology changes. Suppliers will be able to offer new products and services to the Government, without waiting for bulk contracts to expire. Agencies can have faster access to newer technology and capabilities, leading to time savings of about three months each time this feature is used. We have piloted the use of dynamic contracts for two ICT bulk tenders amounting to more than $700 million and will scale this up to three more bulk tenders this year.",4,885,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00885

It does not really matter whether the child was born out of marriage. But here we are now saying that they are not equal, that because the child was born outside of marriage, they will not qualify for the Parenthood Tax Rebate and the Working Mother's Child Relief.

So, why can we not just extend it to the single unweds? Unless of course we are saying we want that as a form of deterrent so that people do not have children out of wedlock. But again, as I raised in my Adjournment Motion, I doubt this will be a deterrence, unless, just before they have sex, they think about the Parenthood Tax Rebate and Working Mother's Child Relief, which we know, will not happen.",2,915,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00915

I think the question here is  do we want to provide support for parenthood in the context of marriage? Singaporeans have asked for this support.

2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Chairman, the NIRC will be an important source of revenue over the long term. As Mr Liang Eng Hwa, I think, is fully aware, the NIRC is tied to the long-term expected returns of our investment entities. So, the critical words are ""long-term expected returns"". It is not linked to short-term performance. It is not impacted by immediate market volatilities. So, we are not so concerned about that.",1,922,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00922
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But looking ahead, looking at the long term, there are indeed reasons for concerns. And we do expect more pressures in the longer term investment environment. For example, geopolitical tensions, I think, will be a long-term issue between America and China. That contestation for power will be with us for quite awhile and it may lead to a more bifurcated world over a period of time.",2,923,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00923

Not providing single unweds with the Parenthood Tax Rebate and Working Mother's Child Relief is not a deterrence. And I also hope that the Minister will agree with me that it is not an incentive. It might be this worry that if we provide the single unweds with more benefits, all of a sudden, there is going to be huge population of children born out of wedlock. I do not think that will happen as well. And if we do not think that it is going to incentivise or discourage, then again, what is stopping us from levelling this playing field and ending the discrimination?",1,928,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00928

2020-02-28-T-007,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,"I noted the same strong growth projected for 2020. It is 9.3%. And I do understand we project long-term expected returns. To me, that is a very big achievement and we are very grateful, because we can then use it to fund our Budget. But then, what would the trend be in terms of percentage increases? 9.3%, right? This year versus last year. I think in wealth management, if you can achieve 9.3% for long-term expected growth, that would be an amazing achievement. I would like to ask the Minister whether there was some special adjustment from 2020 versus 2019, because I would imagine for the long term, probably, it would look more like 4%. That would be a good achievement.",2,931,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00931
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Chairman, there are two figures which we should not conflate. One is the growth of NIRC but that does not equate to the long-term expected rate of return, because the NIRC is the base multiplied by the rate of return. So, the base changes too, in order to get your NIRC.",1,932,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00932
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As far as the rate of return is concerned, this is evaluated every year. We have a rigorous process to go through what that rate of return should be. The investment entities will review it. MOF will review it as well, and then we put it up to the Council of Presidential Advisers and the President finally has to approve the figures. We have explained the process, it is a rigorous process that goes through quite a bit of scrutiny before we finalise the figure.",2,933,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00933
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The trends which I talked about earlier, what Mr Liang Eng Hwa had asked for, are concerns that we have, looking ahead. It need not impact on the immediate long-term expected rate of return. But we are concerned indeed that over a period of time, if these trends were to continue, if you see continued geopolitical tensions, if you see a growing trend of de-globalisation, then indeed, expected returns over the longer term may be impacted.

2020-02-28-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Sure. I will put the clarification. Minister Wong, following up on the question on the NIRC, I remember when we had the debate in this House in July 2015 on the amendment to the Constitution. We confirmed that the formula that was derived – the figures the NIRC reflects – is very conservative. Even more so when the broader economic environment is poor. It could be structurally or cyclically poor. Can I confirm then that the prospects of a ""famine and feast"" of NIRC, as a budget line item, actually is very, very minimal. That is the first clarification.",1,940,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00940
2020-02-28-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The second clarification is pertaining to the question I had put in my Budget speech about the formula that the Government was proceeding with insofar debt financing was concerned and the implications that has on some sort of fiscal room in subsequent budgets. Is there any clarity on that particular point, because the repayment period is stretched instead of a lumpy one-time or two-time payments. Thank you for the indulgence, Mr Chairman.",2,941,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00941
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Technically, the second question is a new question not a clarification, but I will answer it anyway.",1,942,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00942
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the first part, the NIRC or the long-term expected return is looking at long-term what the investment entities are expecting in terms of their returns over a long period of time. So, it is not tied to immediate short-term market performance.",2,943,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00943
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, if this year's market performance ends up negative, stock markets everywhere were to crash and overall returns are negative, it does not impact on our NIRC. Conversely, if it is a bonanza year and markets were to go up, it does not impact on our NIRC because we are looking at expected long-term returns. So, to the first point, it is not so much a conservative element. It is simply that we look at a long-term figure in order to derive the NIRC. We do not look at short-term market changes. So, that is our focus for deriving the NIRC. And that is also why we have continually emphasised that we hold our investment entities to the performance measure of their long-term returns, rather than looking at year-to-year performance. Because year-to-year performance can vary depending on the market, but we look at long-term trends.",3,944,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00944
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second part, we are still working out the debt financing arrangement. MOF will reveal the details of the debt financing arrangement in due course. The idea is that we will borrow for selected major infrastructure. Rather than to fund this entirely from the Budget, we will do it through borrowing. We think this is a more equitable arrangement for major infrastructure that spans a long period of time; then, both current and future generations will pay for the payment of that infrastructure through its useful life. Doing so may provide you some fiscal space in the interim, of course, compared to the alternative of funding everything upfront. But I think it would also be wrong to assume that this fiscal space can be entirely spent away because you need to pay for it later on anyway. If you were to spend all of that fiscal space immediately on something that carries a long tail, down the road, you will end up with difficulties paying for the debt repayment.",4,945,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00945
2020-02-28-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, the idea of borrowing is, not so much to provide fiscal space. It is really one where we look at the infrastructure spending we will need to incur going forward, it is likely to be another lump that is coming up in terms of infrastructure needs, like we did when we first financed our first MRT project. We borrowed for it as well. So, now, in the new phase of development, there will be major infrastructure projects coming up. We think it is more equitable that the Government borrow and then spread out the repayment over the lifespan of the project rather than to fund everything upfront, which I think would then present too much of a burden on the current generation. That is the thinking around debt financing. It is not so much to provide fiscal relief or fiscal space.",5,946,2020-02-28-T-007-S-00946

So, from a system design perspective, it is something that is good to consider.",2,983,2020-02-28-T-008-S-00983
2020-02-28-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The third point is that he mentioned that it is quite difficult to remove the Attorney-General and cited the Constitutional provisions. But at the same time as well, if the Attorney-General is appointed for a short term, then his contract will just lapse and in that sense, he will be removed after a short period of time or his service will be terminated. So, is it not worth considering actually, to introduce a certain continuity in the term of the Attorney-General, so that he can see through certain matters that are of concern of public interest. At the same time, the former Attorney-General who wrote the article highlighted a frequent change of Attorney-General does affect the morale of the Deputy Public Prosecutors (DPPs). So, I would like the Senior Minister of State's comment on that.",3,984,2020-02-28-T-008-S-00984

But, more than that, we also look at the individual, persons of integrity, utmost integrity, discharging those functions. And finally also, the proof of the pudding is really in the eating – in looking at the conduct, looking at the fact that, with no fear and no favour, there have been high-profile prosecutions including those that I have outlined which demonstrates that our system is working.

Singapore is ranked second in the world and the highest in Asia for having the best IP protection as stated in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2019.

One Ministry whose website and mobile site has caught the eye for excellent legal design and user friendliness is that of MOM.

2020-02-28-T-009,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I was, at the time, quite impressed with the mediation format. It was less contentious and driven by parties instead of lawyers to seek a win-win solution where both parties are in a position to accept. It also makes sense from a commercial perspective. Mediation is more efficient than litigation in terms of time and cost. There is no need for commercial entities to be distracted from their day-to-day businesses by being embroiled in long drawn out and costly litigation.",2,1043,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01043
2020-02-28-T-009,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, I was therefore extremely pleased to note that, in August 2019, Singapore facilitated and was also among the first to sign the Singapore Convention on Mediation. This House has also passed the Singapore Convention on Mediation Bill earlier this month. We could be one of the first signatories to ratify the Convention.",3,1044,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01044
2020-02-28-T-009,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"This will pave the way for cross-border enforcement of mediated settlement agreements, give businesses greater certainty and assurance and encourage the greater use of mediation to resolve international commercial disputes.",4,1045,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01045
2020-02-28-T-009,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I note that in the past three years, the SMC has conducted under its auspices, close to 1,500 mediations with a recorded settlement rate of between 65% and 69% each year. This means that almost seven in 10 commercial disputes referred to mediation are resolved amicably. This is an excellent rate of return. It is a reflection of the good work that the SMC puts in to resolve a majority of the disputes referred to them. If more litigated commercial disputes are referred to mediation, this could also potentially reduce the case load burden of the Singapore Courts.",5,1046,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01046
2020-02-28-T-009,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"On the arbitration front, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, or SIAC, has also seen a steady rise of cases over the years.

This is a scheme for Singapore law practices to get funding support of up to 70% for the first-year cost of adopting baseline and advanced technology solutions. This scheme is supposed to prepare law practices for future disruptions beyond baseline technology adoption, empower them to focus on delivering enhanced legal services, strengthen their capabilities and increase their competitiveness in the global landscape. This is, indeed, a meaningful endeavour. Law firms, like other businesses, need to equip themselves with the necessary technology to be efficient and productive and be ready for trends and changes in the future.",1,1049,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01049
2020-02-28-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"However, as I had highlighted in my speeches in previous years, there is often hesitation on the part of small firms to invest time to review and adopt new technology because, unlike bigger firms, they cannot afford to dedicate resources and time to this effort in the midst of continuous and on-going legal work. I am also not sure if awareness of the various support programmes and schemes is high amongst the lawyers in the smaller firms. This may lead to some of these lawyers feeling left out of the efforts that MinLaw has been making in supporting the profession build capabilities. I am, therefore, wondering how MinLaw is preparing small law firms, which may not have sufficient resources, including time and money, to be future-ready?",2,1050,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01050

These could include more diverse roles, such as project management, business development, legal innovation and legal technology, as well as understanding foreign legal jurisdictions to enable internationalism.

Those who use the family justice system are usually in a state of emotional turmoil, mental anguish and have seen their families break up. It is not a legal proceeding that they wish to be in. They are often also vulnerable, especially those families with children, whose interests, above all, must be looked after.

Potential applicants can use these documents to self-help. They do not have to go to see lawyers. With iLab, these simple standardised documents commonly used can be generated. We hope to launch this in the next few weeks.",39,1100,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01100
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Mr Singh spoke about design thinking. I think these are all features which fit towards that. And it is a good reminder by Mr Singh that we should be looking at the various enhancements to ensure that they are designed around our clients' needs. And I take the point that it ought not be dense or verbose, and we will endeavour to avoid that.",40,1101,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01101
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Putting information online, enabling online applications, making it two-way, the process being dynamic, will make it easier for our clients who may find it difficult to be away from their families or take time away from work.",41,1102,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01102
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"We also undertook three rounds of rigorous user testing with LAB clients on the Portal and also on iLAB because we recognise that it can also be very frustrating if it does not work, the portal is not intuitive and not interactive enough. So, we have been fairly rigorous in the way which we have tested it before it goes out to market.",42,1103,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01103
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The broader legal system also designs access to justice and legal awareness with the end-user in mind. For example, the Courts have pioneered an online dispute resolution system which litigants-in-persons can use to conduct negotiations and mediation for claims online for the Small Claims Tribunal. Mr Sitoh would be glad to hear that as well – you can now mediate your case online as well. And we are also exploring new features, such as asynchronous hearings to make it more convenient for Singaporeans to resolve their disputes. So, rather than to have parties at the same time at the same place, these facilities make it easier, facilitate claims before the Small Claims Tribunal and also allow for some mediation to take place.",43,1104,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01104

2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"We will adopt the new means criteria and limits for civil legal aid, what I have just outlined, for CLAS as well. These changes will simplify and therefore shorten the application process, while at the same time, maintain the rigour of the means test which we need to have, given that these are public funds that are being used.

2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The Government also works with the Law Society and the Law Schools to cultivate a strong pro bono culture within the legal profession.

2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"There have also been efforts by the wider legal eco-system.

2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"But I think Ms Rahayu will agree with me when I say that access to justice goes beyond legal aid and just providing low bono or pro bono services. It is equally important that we see access to justice as understanding the problems in daily life, understanding at what stage there should be legal, and perhaps, also social intervention so that we can provide simple yet effective and, as far as possible, long lasting solutions to the problem at hand and not just fix the surface, leaving the underlying problems to continue to rear its ugly head.",56,1117,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01117

2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"However, I would stress that mutually agreed solutions between two neighbours, for instance, should always remain the first port of call, that is, should always be the first base that one goes to instead of triggering a process in Court. The CDRT, as far as possible, should be a measure of last resort. So, we encourage Singaporeans to engage their neighbours in an amicable manner, when disputes arise – use community mediation services, use grassroots leaders who can facilitate the process.",60,1121,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01121

2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Amongst other things, we are considering digitalising the process, in sort of the same fashion that I have been outlining, to make it simpler, easier and faster, and linking up Government systems to facilitate the retrieval of information. At the end of the day, information has to come through so that the applications can be processed and that sometimes is choke point. So, we will work on digitalising the process. And also streamlining the legal requirements imposed on applicants. These, I believe, will improve the experiences of Singaporeans dealing with end-of-life issues.",63,1124,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01124

This is one area where the original stakeholder or perhaps owner of the assets is not around to say how it should be done or what his intentions were. So, we do have to be careful. But within this rubric, strike an appropriate balance so that we can look out for the interests of both the convenience of the parties applying as well as also the rigours of what the interests of the beneficiaries ought to be. We will provide more details in the coming year.",64,1125,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01125
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Ms Tan asked about unscrupulous contractors.

CASE publishes a Consumer Alert List on its website. That is a useful first port of call. It lists companies that have multiple complaints made against them and operates to warn consumers about contractors with poor track records. So, to those cases that Ms Tan has spoken about where there have been repeated cases, it ought to be on this list. If not, we will try and find a way to better police it so that members of the public can be warned.",66,1127,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01127

The SCT provides a forum that is low-cost, no lawyers are involved. For example, claimants are only required to pay $10 for claims up to $5,000 in value. And the SCT may order one party to pay money to another party arising from these claims and also order a party to make good on deficiencies, as in the Member's example, the construction contract, for instance.",68,1129,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01129

2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"One area in which we shall move to keep pace with the competition is in the area of conditional fee agreements (CFAs). Following public consultations last year, we are working on introducing a CFA framework for certain categories of proceedings. The framework will help our lawyers and law practices by levelling the playing field for Singaporean lawyers and law practices, as against foreign lawyers who may already be able to offer such agreements in their own jurisdictions. We are also studying whether allowing CFAs for a wider range of proceedings can further promote access to justice.",72,1133,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01133
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Second, we are also promoting the use of Singapore law. Our initiatives include increasing free access to Singapore judgments. Steps have been taken to make more Supreme Court judgments from 2000 freely available online, and also potentially even earlier judgments, earlier than 2000.

Yes, indeed, we were one of the first two countries, together with Fiji, to ratify the Convention. This took place a few days ago in New York.

The Law Society reached out to at least 450 Singapore law practices through workshops and seminars to promote this programme and Altum was one of those who was a participant in these events. They were able to upgrade from the standard suite of computer services – they were using Microsoft Office, I believe – to legal technology solutions that were more curated and were better suited to their needs. The firm achieved time and cost savings from automating routine but important tasks, including shortening the time required to complete the checking of references in documents by up to 66%.",82,1143,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01143

2020-02-28-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his comprehensive responses. On my particular cut about Singapore being a leading international dispute resolution hub, I think one of the flagships we have, apart, obviously, from our court system, is the SIAC. The Minister would know, my question is really a nuts and bolts on how we get the model clause out. In a model clause, there is the centre, there is the rules, there is the seat and there is Singapore law being the relevant law.",1,1161,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01161
2020-02-28-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"So, my question really is – how are we able to advance Singapore law, advance the seat of Singapore, through these clauses such that international parties come? And when international parties come, they do not come with lawyers, they come with their experts, they come with their decision-makers and their witnesses. So how can we use that space to enhance Singapore law and Singapore as an international legal hub?",2,1162,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01162
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I can speak a little more slowly now. The clock is not running. So, a model clause is useful but parties must want to come to Singapore. So having a model law is one thing, but what we want to do is to really build the eco-system that supports why a party from outside Singapore will want to choose Singapore. So, if I may summarise some of the points from my speech earlier.",1,1163,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01163
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, we have to make sure that Singapore law is accessible, that it is first-rate, it is commercial. Our high-quality jurispurdence coming out of our Courts help a lot in that regard for parties who want to choose Singapore law.",2,1164,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01164
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, we must build a system that is neutral, that is based on the rule of law, that parties, when they come into Singapore, when they make their investments into Singapore or they choose Singapore as a forum, they know that they will get first-class hearings, hearings that will not be unduly interfered with, hearings that will be governed by the rule of law and as far as possible, in our best-in-class facilities as well, in Maxwell Chambers.",3,1165,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01165
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Third, we want to look at the way in which our stakeholders – law firms, lawyers, those who practise here, those who practise abroad – are equipped with this information, so that when they do the negotiation, persons such as yourself, Mr Christopher de Souza or Mr Murali Pillai, can then take these learning points, take these model clauses and persuade external parties that in Singapore, we do not only have the best facilities, but we have the best, most neutral system that will ensure a fair adjudication of the disputes.",4,1166,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01166

2020-02-28-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. My next question is on a different cut, which is – Singapore as a formidable IP fortress. I think we can protect a lot of protection and enforcement, but how is IPOS and MinLaw working with the R&D outfits to ensure that commercialisation of the IP? So, it is not only a portcullis or a fortress where we protect it but where we can enhance it into commercial terms.",1,1171,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01171
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I am not sure that is capable of a short answer but I will try. We have to first realise that no one will choose Singapore to file their patents in or to enhance or enforce their IP rights, if we do not have a strong neutral legal system. So, at the baseline, that is always something that we look at, frankly speaking.",1,1172,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01172
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"What else do we do? We want to make sure that our laws are updated. So, as I mentioned on several occasions and also earlier, we will look at enhancing and revising the Copyright Act, an experience that we have had after we did extensive consultations. What else can we do? What else can we say to people about how their ideas, their patents, their innovations will be better protected in Singapore and also enforced, should the case be necessary?",2,1173,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01173
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Third, we also want to make sure that we be with the system from start to end. So, I mentioned in my speech earlier, IDEAS, for instance. How do you monetise the value in intangible assets? Assets that would otherwise be difficult to look at in terms of valuation. We look at how it can be done so that we can help companies raise capital, raise financing and leverage on the value of such intangible assets.",3,1174,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01174
2020-02-28-T-009,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"When you bring all these together in the eco-system, you will then have, in Mr Christopher de Souza's words, a formidable fortress, in which to not just register but enforce and eventually enjoy filing of the patents in Singapore.",4,1175,2020-02-28-T-009-S-01175
