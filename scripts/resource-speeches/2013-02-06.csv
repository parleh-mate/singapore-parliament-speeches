2013-02-06-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,asked	 the Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the rationale for requiring anchor operators for childcare centres to be not-for-profit organisations and to have no religious or ethnic affiliation; and (b) whether the Ministry will use a different set of criteria when it re-opens applications for new anchor operators.,1,1,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00001
2013-02-06-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,asked	 the Acting Minister for Social and Family Development how the Ministry intends to prevent childcare centre operators from making excessive fee increases when higher subsidies for childcare and infant care are implemented.,1,2,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00002
2013-02-06-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,asked	 the Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many new childcare centres the Ministry plans for current and new anchor operators to open over the next five years; and (b) what will be the distribution of new childcare centres between the existing two anchor operators and the future new anchor operators.,1,3,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00003
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,The Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mdm Speaker, if I may have your permission to take Question Nos 1 to 3 together?",1,4,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00004
2013-02-06-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,5,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00005
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, the eligibility criteria for the anchor operator scheme were set to ensure that the operators' programmes are accessible to children of all backgrounds, and that the Government's funding goes towards serving the public good rather than private profit. Anchor operators are required to demonstrate financial stability and commit to meeting the quality and affordability targets set by the Ministry. The scheme is currently being reviewed and the Implementation Committee for Enhancing Pre-School Education co-chaired by MOE and MSF will announce more details by the second quarter of this year.",1,6,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00006
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Yee asked how we ensure that childcare centres do not raise fees excessively in response to the recent enhancements to subsidies. First, we have designed the enhancements to give more assistance to families who require more help. Lower income families will receive more subsidy, as well as larger families with a lower per capita income. As the enhancements are not universal, it is less likely that operators can raise fees across the board. Second, we will continue to facilitate the development of more centres in areas where there is demand, and grow the number of good quality, affordable places through the anchor operator scheme to help keep overall fees in check.",2,7,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00007
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the number and distribution of new centres by anchor operators, it would be premature for us to update on this as the new operators have yet to be chosen and to make their submissions for the new sites. We are committed to building as many centres as necessary to meet demand for good quality, affordable childcare services.",3,8,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00008
2013-02-06-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Acting Minister for the answers. I have three supplementary questions – one for each of the Parliamentary Questions I filed. The first is that I want to understand the policy ideas versus other Government policies. For example, MOE is quite generous in supporting schools that have religious affiliations. They are the Government-aided schools and they get very generous support. Also, in the transport industry, public transport is run by private companies with very generous Government support. There appears to be some inconsistency with the Government policies here and I would like a clarification from the Acting Minister.",1,9,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00009
2013-02-06-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second clarification is whether centres do need to get MSF permission if they wish to raise fees. And if they still raise fees after all the monitoring by MSF and after all these generous grants have been given out, what is MSF's position on this? Does MSF impose certain curbs on excessive fee increases?",2,10,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00010
2013-02-06-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The third clarification is that I am rather concerned, looking at past data, because of the very few numbers of void deck centres that are available for private operators to bid for. It has resulted in centres being bidded up to $45,000 per month rental. Anybody who operates in the industry knows that this is definitely not a viable model. But if going forward, there are too few centres allocated for the other operators and all centres have gone to the Anchor Operators, then we will have another bidding war and we will see the rents of centres going up.",3,11,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00011
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Yee for his three supplementary questions. On the first, different sectors have different characteristics. It is different for the transport sector and different for the pre-school sector. What we are most concerned with in the pre-school sector is to ensure that we have adequate and affordable services for the mass market. There will always be parents who will require niche services, and I think they are at liberty to pursue those services. But when it comes to Government funding, we would like to use Government funding, where we can, to support the mass market options so that most of our parents would have the quality and affordable options available to them. For all the Anchor Operators that take on Government subsidies, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that they make access available to children from all backgrounds, independent of religious affiliations.",1,12,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00012
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The other thinking is this. When we spend what is public money, then we should ensure that the public money goes on to benefit the two groups of people. One, the families and children involved. The other is the teachers providing the services that are so important in this sector. We would be very careful to design a scheme such that the public money does not go into private profit. That has been our abiding principle.",2,13,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00013
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second question about how and when the childcare operators can raise fees, we have guidelines in place to ensure that if the childcare operators raise fees, they are to give adequate notice to the parents such that the parents can make the necessary adjustments if need be.",3,14,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00014
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For the Anchor Operators, we are more stringent. We ensure that they do not raise fees beyond the industry median. So, if we compare the fees of the Anchor Operators with the rest of the industry, generally, they would be below the industry median. For childcare, it would be $750 a month for the industry median; about $615 for the Anchor Operators in the HDB estates.",4,15,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00015
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the last point about the availability of spaces for various operators – be they Anchor Operators or non-Anchor Operators – my Ministry is working closely with MND and other agencies to ensure that we have as many available and suitable sites as possible for the operators. We know that, whether Anchor Operators or non-Anchor Operators, rental cost is an issue. To the extent that we can, we will want to provide affordable options to the operators of such childcare facilities. And hopefully, the operators, whether Anchor Operators or non-Anchor Operators, will not raise fees unnecessarily and use the rental as an excuse to do so.",5,16,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00016
2013-02-06-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to seek Acting Minister's views on whether he would agree that there is a risk for childcare or pre-school education to go the for-profit route, mainly because we know that for-profit organisations are primarily driven by the bottom line. The public has voiced their preference for state-run or hybrid model childcare centres, so that this sector is not purely for-profit.",1,17,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00017
2013-02-06-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"My second clarification is to ask if Acting Minister has heard that there are private operators – some from overseas – who are buying up smaller players here in the pre-school and childcare sector, possibly to monopolise the market to have a bigger footprint, and even to bring the merged organisations to Initial Public Offering (IPO). I am still very concerned that Acting Minister has decided to take the for-profit route for this particular sector.",2,18,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00018
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, let me thank Ms Denise Phua for her two supplementary questions. Indeed, we share her concerns that people involved in the pre-school or the early childhood development sector should not try to do it primarily for profit and definitely not for the mass market sector. There are a few unique characteristics of this sector. One being that at such an early age, parents are justifiably concerned about their children's development. When you do not have a standardised test to check how much value-add a particular centre provides for the child, there is a danger that people might take price as a proxy for quality. There might also be a danger where people start to chase what they perceive to be quality programmes, which may or may not value add to a child's development.",1,19,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00019
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In the entire sector, we would not be able to rule out that there will be some people who might be in this work because of profit. What we have to ensure is that where public money is concerned, that if we do give any subsidies, they go towards helping those families that require help most, and not to go into the pockets of people who are pursuing this for private profit.",2,20,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00020
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We are also equally concerned about this potential of small players being bought up by a conglomerate that is essentially for-profit. This is a problem because it reduces the diversity of the players in the market. The greater concern is that if there is such a situation, then it might actually narrow the mass market options that we want to make available to the public. We are watching this very closely and we will certainly take this into account in the review of our Anchor Operator scheme. Part of the reason for us to have sufficient Anchor Operators is to provide the mass market options for the general public. There might be some for-profit operators that will provide niche solutions at one end of the market for those parents who desire such services. But, indeed, we are most concerned if this is to happen. When we announce the results of the review, we will be taking into account this particular aspect.",3,21,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00021
2013-02-06-T-001,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker, I have a couple of supplementary questions for the Acting Minister. I know it is still early days, but I would just like to check if the Ministry has received any feedback on fee increases at childcare and infant care centres operated by the Anchor Operators, as well as the commercial operators, following the announcement of the Marriage and Parenthood Package.",1,22,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00022
2013-02-06-T-001,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"The second question is  given the high demand for such centres, the worsening crunch in manpower in this sector, rising rentals and the quest for us to get better teachers, what can the Ministry do to mitigate the probable fee hikes, which may negate the effects of higher subsidies?",2,23,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00023
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, let me thank Mr David Ong for the two supplementary questions. On the first issue, it is still early days, because we have just announced the enhancement to the childcare subsidies, but we will certainly be watching closely to see if there are any operators who might be opportunistic in this and hope to raise fees. What we have done is this  we have tiered the level of subsidies to different income groups. There will be a smaller likelihood – not zero, but smaller likelihood – that they can increase fees across the board. That is one.",1,24,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00024
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second issue, indeed, the longer term solution to mitigate some of these cost pressures is for us to expand the number of options available in the number of sites, but, more importantly, in the number of teachers. The other cost driver for the childcare and early childhood development industry is the quality of the teachers. We are going to spend more money and more effort to develop the teachers, to groom them, to train them, so that the pool of available resources in the entire sector will be bigger than what it is now. That will be an important way for us to mitigate the cost pressures in terms of salaries for this sector. On the other hand, we would also like to gradually upgrade the qualifications of our teachers and, with that, the kind of salary remuneration that they can command.",2,25,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00025
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,There is a multi-pronged approach for us to gradually expand this sector for early childhood development. We do have a bit of an opportunity at this point in time because the kindergarten cohort sizes are shrinking. There is potential for us to encourage some of the current kindergarten operators to expand their services to the childcare sector.,3,26,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00026
2013-02-06-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Mdm Speaker, I have two follow-up questions. The first is regarding the use of the subsidies to benefit the mass market. I definitely agree with the Acting Minister that the subsidies should benefit the mass market, but I have difficulty reconciling this to why religious and race-based groups cannot be supported because many of them have operated for a very long time. They have benefited the people with their programmes and, usually, at very low fees as well. MOE has been very comfortable dealing with them as long as they do not overly promote religious views. And even for private operators, if he can set certain criteria such that they be monitored to see how much they are charging, to compete with what the Anchor Operators are charging, then I do not see the fear of them over-profiting because they will profit as much as what the Anchors are profiting.",1,27,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00027
2013-02-06-T-001,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"The second supplementary question is  the Minister said that for the Anchor Operators, the Ministry monitors their fees so that they cannot go above the industry median. We know that the industry median comprises of the private operators and the non-profit operators, and the private operators get very little support. They pay very high rents, so, obviously their fees will be very high. Would the Minister agree that it is better to compare their fees against the median of the non-profit operators rather than across the industry?",2,28,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00028
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, let me clarify Mr Yee Jenn Jong's first question. Firstly, for public funds that are used to support any programmes in general, we ask that they be made accessible to people from all religious backgrounds. So, we have programmes run by various VWOs – they are religion-based organisations – but the programmes must be made accessible to people from different religious backgrounds. And we also ask that they do not proselytise or do not use that to promote any religious belief in any particular sector. I think that is just to be fair to everybody, because these are, indeed, public funds that we are talking about.",1,29,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00029
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second issue about the private sector operators, our philosophy is that, as much as we can, we would like to use the public funds for public good and to minimise the potential possibility of profits going into private pockets. I think that people can generally agree with us.",2,30,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00030
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the third issue about benchmarking, it is not only just the industry benchmark that we have. Before they do any price increase, for the Anchor Operators, we have stringent criteria to ask them to justify the necessity to increase and what are the cost drivers. We actually drill down to the details. And, indeed, for other comparable non-profit operators, we also take them to account in our benchmarking. So, it is not just the industry median. But, of course, the industry median is one of the criteria that we take into account.",3,31,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00031
2013-02-06-T-001,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Acting Minister what plans does MSF have in addressing the severe shortage of childcare centres in new estates, such as in Sengkang? One of the reasons I am asking is because I have received numerous emails from residents requesting assistance, and partly also because of the structure of some of the new BTO flats there that makes conversion of void decks to childcare centres extremely challenging. Will the Ministry consider putting up modular structures to house childcare centres to ease the shortfall, at least in the interim?",1,32,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00032
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Dr Lam for the questions. Indeed, we are aware of the situation in some of the newer estates like Sengkang. We are open to exploring new ideas and we are also aware that because of the way the new HDB flats are constructed, they do have limited void deck space available for some of these social facilities. We are working with the grassroots advisors in the respective areas to see where we can find new sites. This may include incorporating some of these features into newly developed structures, like for example, multi-storey car parks and other open spaces. We are open to the idea of having modular structures if it is acceptable to the operators and also the parents who are sending their children there. We know that there are some open fields and open areas in Sengkang that can be studied. We are open to such areas and will be happy to work with the Member and the operators to bring those about.",1,33,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00033
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The other thing that we can do, and we are doing, is to make sure that there is a better matching of the demand and the supply. Sometimes, the centres are there but they do not provide the classes at the appropriate level for the students of that particular area. We have to encourage the operators to open up classes that accommodate those students.",2,34,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00034
2013-02-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The last thing that we are doing is to also provide better matching because people generally send their children to three localities  near their homes, near their workplace or near their grandparents' places. So, there is quite a bit of flux in the demand but we are trying to do a better matching of the people's demand with where they want to site their children. We are encouraging various employers to try and take up the scheme to set up childcare centres within their workplace. This will provide more options to the parents who need such services.",3,35,2013-02-06-T-001-S-00035
2013-02-06-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked	 the Minister for Communications and Information in view of the Media Development Authority's cross-carriage measure (a) what are its key performance indicators; (b) whether it will result in lower content subscription costs; and (c) what is the Ministry's assessment on (i) the effectiveness of the measure in bringing about better choice and diversity of content; and (ii) Singapore's competitiveness as a broadcast and content market.,1,36,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00036
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Zaqy Mohamad for his question on MDA's cross-carriage measure.",1,37,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00037
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"The measure was introduced in August 2011 to address the high degree of content fragmentation in the Singapore pay TV market. If it has been successful, we would expect pay TV content to be less fragmented. This is exactly what has been observed.",2,38,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00038
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"More common channels are now available to consumers. There were only seven channels, mainly foreign public service channels, available on both StarHub Cable Vision (SCV) and SingNet mio TV (mio TV) prior to the introduction of the measure. Today, there are over 50 common channels which include general entertainment channels, such as ONE, Celestial Movies and FOX International, as well as sports channels, such as ESPN and STAR Sports. As pre-existing content deals expire and are renegotiated, we expect that the number of common channels will further increase. MDA, Madam, will continue to monitor the number of common channels over time, as it serves as a good indication of the success of the measure.",3,39,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00039
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"The measure has also not prevented pay TV operators from acquiring exclusive content. Last year, all consumers, including non-pay TV consumers, were able to purchase from SCV, the Euro 2012 tournament on an a la carte basis for the first time without the need for a basic subscription. Mio TV subscribers were able to subscribe to the tournament and watch it via their Mio TV set-top box even though SCV was the exclusive rights holder.",4,40,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00040
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"On the industry front, pay TV operators are also striving for service differentiation and innovation. For example, besides the option of viewing subscribed content on TV, both SingNet and SCV are now offering their customers value-added services, such as viewing the content over mobile networks and the Internet. This has contributed to a growing and more vibrant pay TV market, as evidenced by the increase in the total number of pay TV subscribers from about 694,000 in 2009 to more than 900,000 last year.",5,41,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00041
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"The Member has asked whether the public should expect the cost of pay TV packages to decline. Madam, I would like to emphasise once again that it is not the intent of the measure to lower the cost of pay TV subscriptions. These costs are driven by multiple factors that the measure will not be able to address. One key factor is the cost of acquiring premium content, sports or otherwise, which has been rising across the world, in particular, for the highly popular sports franchises. Members may be aware that in June 2012, the British rights to broadcast the 2013 to 2016 editions of the Barclays Premier League (BPL 2013/16) were acquired exclusively at slightly over £3 billion or $$6 billion, a 71% increase in price. This inevitably will translate into cost increases. In our region, the prices of the Barclays Premier League 2013/16 season and rights sold to various ASEAN countries have, indeed, reportedly seen significant increases.",6,42,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00042
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Nonetheless, the MDA is mindful that consumers are concerned about the rising cost of pay TV subscriptions. We encourage consumers to signal their displeasure to the pay TV operators, so that, over time, the operators will be more responsive to consumer demand. In this way, we make market forces work in the interest of the consumer.",7,43,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00043
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"In the past two years, we have seen a growing range of content choices for consumers. Today, pay TV operators, including nationwide TV providers SCV and SingNet and a number of niche pay TV retailers, offer more than 400 channels. This is a significant increase from the 236 channels that were available in 2010. Channels are also offering content that is premiering at the same time, or very soon after premiering in their home market. The industry has thus grown more competitive and vibrant.",8,44,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00044
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Despite the benefits brought about by the measure, we cannot stay stagnant. The industry is continually evolving and the pace of technological changes is rapid. There is a need to regularly review the continued relevance of the measure. MDA will conduct this review as part of the triennial review of the Media Market Conduct Code later this year.",9,45,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00045
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, I am confident that as we continue to fine-tune the measure with the involvement of our stakeholders, our pay TV landscape will grow in vibrancy and consumers can look forward to better service offerings.",10,46,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00046
2013-02-06-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his response. The objective of the cross-carriage policy, I suppose, was also to bring more players on board. And I hope that we will see a more competitive market. But I also would like to know from the Minister whether other broadcasters, apart from the two that he has mentioned, have expressed interest. What has been prohibiting other such operators from coming in? What measures does MDA have in place for operators who signed non-exclusive content to declare some of these principles of the contract agreement?",1,47,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00047
2013-02-06-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I understand that MDA requires other operators to provide evidence before they take action and, of course, these kinds of commercial arrangement, such as discount structures, length of delays before the next person comes in, are barriers for others to come in. My intent is to ensure that the cross-carriage policy has bite and that the regulatory framework also works.",2,48,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00048
2013-02-06-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Lastly, specifically, I think the Minister brought up the BPL issue. I know many Singaporeans are soccer fans. Given the cross-carriage policy, why have no other players come in? I know SingTel has signed on exclusively last October. We have not heard updates since then. There is market talk, but are there other loopholes that have gone into this non-exclusive arrangement that the current framework perhaps could not detect?",3,49,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00049
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the questions. Let me begin with the one that all of us have common interest in, which is BPL. All I can say is that negotiations are on-going. MDA is monitoring this very, very closely because the Member is right, and this relates to the Member's third question – whatever it is, we have to look at every contract that is agreed upon between the provider and the content owners, and ensure it does not, in any way, violate our cross-carriage measure.",1,50,2013-02-06-T-002-S-00050
2013-02-06-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"I want to assure the Member and the House that the MDA is on top of the situation.

There are also different methodologies to measure broadband speeds and to make international comparisons. Over the past two years, there has, in fact, been a significant improvement in broadband speeds in Singapore. One major reason for this is the availability of fibre services over the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (NGNBN) since September 2010.

Clearly, Akamai's results are dependent on its methodology, its content delivery network, the location of its servers relative to the countries it measures, and how it streams its data. But the results point in the same direction, namely, that Singapore is amongst the leading group of countries in broadband access speed. This is a positive sign, considering that a significant amount of traffic is from overseas hosted sites. IDA also regularly measures broadband speeds in Singapore. To get a better sense of the connection speeds experienced by users in Singapore, may I ask Members to refer to Exhibit 2? [Please refer to Annex 2 on Pg xxxx.] For example, in November 2012, the local average peak download speed ranged from 93 megabits per second (Mbps) to 98.3 Mbps for a 100 Mbps plan.

There are on-going efforts to encourage the hosting or mirroring of more of such content in Singapore. This reduces the geographical distance that Internet traffic has to traverse, thereby speeding up access to desired content. Long-term regulatory measures have also been taken to facilitate the landing of submarine cable systems in Singapore and the cross-connections amongst these cable systems, making Singapore one of the most connected countries with high bandwidth capability today.

Many of the residents, including myself, do not find that the broadband speed is really up to that mark. In fact, the average broadband speed that we experience for the 100 megabits per second type of plan is about 10 to 20 megabits per second.",1,66,2013-02-06-T-003-S-00066

Does the audit cover different geographical areas or does it just concentrate on certain areas?

On his first question on how the measurement was done, IDA commissioned a local company to perform the measurement of our fixed broadband network performance of the local ISPs. In fact, the results of the performance that we gathered were all reported on IDA's website and it is a consolidated total of 563 test probes installed in the homes of volunteers from both the public and IDA. These test probes cover a selected range of plans from the major residential broadband service providers in Singapore. And at regular intervals, the test probes conduct the series of tests against IDA's test servers housed in the local Internet Data Centres and the US East Coast and West Coast. So, it is quite comprehensive, but I will be happy to ask IDA to look into the Member's concern in his own area and see whether we can find out what is the cause of the problem.",1,68,2013-02-06-T-003-S-00068

The last thing that we want is to introduce new measures that basically dull the market rather than make the market more competitive. I would like to assure the Member and the House that this is a very important concern for us. So, we have now imposed a quality of service (QoS) standard for the fixed broadband that has been set out with specific indicators so that the Internet providers know what is expected of them. We are also reviewing the quality of service standard for fixed time broadband to ensure that it is continually relevant to the end users.

We will ensure that we provide meaningful and effective platforms for our youth to be heard, and to share their hopes and views about the future of our nation.",5,105,2013-02-06-T-006-S-00105
2013-02-06-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"I thank the Acting Minister for the reply. I have a few supplementary questions. Firstly, could I seek clarification on how youth programmes are assessed for their effectiveness and whether they are sustainable? Basically, the definition of success. Secondly, given the different platforms, such as dialogue sessions that youth are being involved in, as the Acting Minister has highlighted, how are their feedback, opinions, proposals being harnessed, especially towards policy formulation?",1,106,2013-02-06-T-006-S-00106
2013-02-06-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Thirdly, I read that recently there has been a press release on the increase in investment in terms of partnerships with some youth sector organisations in terms of developing youth. Would the NYC be open to considering partnering alumni from previous youth programmes? Because they have gone through the system and there is some goodwill created, I am sure they will be very happy to take on some of these programmes and help complement efforts by NYC. Lastly, I would like to ask the Acting Minister whether Singapore is ready for a youth parliament at this stage. It was first raised in Remaking Singapore. I think it was raised again last year during Our Singapore Conversation, so I would like to ask the Acting Minister whether Singapore is ready for this.",2,107,2013-02-06-T-006-S-00107
2013-02-06-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I thank the Member for her four supplementary questions. I will take them in turn. First, on the success of the programmes and what we use to assess success, well, there are a range of quantitative and qualitative indicators. We could look at attendance, outreach, the number of youth who participate in the programmes. These are some relatively straightforward quantitative indicators. But we also use qualitative indicators through feedback forms, through responses of the youth participants themselves on the engagement levels within these forums that we provide.",1,108,2013-02-06-T-006-S-00108
2013-02-06-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"How can the feedback of the young people be factored into policy processes? Again there are various ways. One, ideas that are gathered during these platforms, NYC will make a point to convey the ideas and suggestions to the relevant Ministries and Government agencies. Secondly, if there is interest, NYC also specifically organises focus group discussions on particular policy topics with the stakeholders and with Government agencies themselves so that there is a direct process and interaction between the policy-makers and the young people. Third, will we be prepared to make use of alumni or to collaborate and partner with alumni from these youth programmes? The answer is, certainly, we will be happy to collaborate with not just youth sector organisations but individuals who have been alumni from these programmes because they certainly have valuable experience to contribute.",2,109,2013-02-06-T-006-S-00109
2013-02-06-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, is Singapore ready for a youth parliament? I think the answer is not so much whether Singapore is ready. I think the question should be, ""What would young people themselves like to have?"" That is the question we would like to hear from young people themselves. Yes, a few have suggested the idea of a youth parliament but we really need to hear from the young people themselves what platforms, what engagement platforms or forums would be ideal, would be suitable for them and then let them take ownership of the platform which they would like for meaningful engagement.",3,110,2013-02-06-T-006-S-00110
2013-02-06-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Acting Minister. I am very heartened to hear his reply, especially the part on involving alumni. One other supplementary question following the answer to whether Singapore is ready for a youth parliament. So, will the Ministry be considering conducting a study, a review or an engagement with youths from different backgrounds on what kind of platform they would like to have and, specifically, whether they would like to have a youth parliament?",1,111,2013-02-06-T-006-S-00111

2013-02-06-T-006,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We are not wedded to the particular idea of a youth parliament. I do not think we are wedded to any particular modality of engagement. We would rather let young people themselves voice out their opinions, their views, what exactly would they like and then we would hear from them and then, based on the consensus of youth, based on the opinions of young people, we can move forward on a more effective platform.﻿",2,113,2013-02-06-T-006-S-00113
2013-02-06-T-007,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"asked	 the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what is the policy on naming rights to facilities at the Sports Hub; and (b) whether bids for naming rights to Sports Hub facilities will be invited from other interested parties and, if not, why.",1,114,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00114
2013-02-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, the Sports Hub is being developed under a 25-year public-private-partnership (PPP) agreement, where a commercial operator undertakes to finance, build and operate the entire project in return for a pre-agreed payment and a share of the overall revenue. Part of the revenue from the operation of the Sports Hub would include revenue from the sale of naming rights, which then may be used to finance future enhancements to the facilities to have better events and shows, as well as to fund community events and support the development of our athletes.",1,115,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00115
2013-02-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Under the contract of the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), the operator may sell the naming rights to individual facilities within the Sports Hub, except for the National Stadium. However, any sale of naming rights within the Sports Hub is still subject to SSC's consent. Our aim is to strike a balance, preserving the character of our national icons while allowing sports to benefit from corporate sponsorship.",2,116,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00116
2013-02-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Based on the agreement, the marketing for the naming rights is undertaken by the operator. SSC is not involved in inviting bids from interested parties.",3,117,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00117
2013-02-06-T-007,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"I wish to thank the Acting Minister for the reply. One supplementary question is whether the Ministry can ensure that the buyer of these naming rights does have a strong local flavour, a strong local character and identity that can connect with the community. And, of course, how can we ensure that there is longevity to these naming rights so that we do not keep changing names when we change the buyer?",1,118,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00118
2013-02-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We will do what we can. But as I mentioned earlier, this is already provided for in the agreement where the operator is allowed to sell naming rights for individual facilities within the Sports Hub. It can be for the aquatic centre; it can be for the indoor stadium. These are individual facilities within the Sports Hub, but not for the National Stadium which we have preserved. Whichever the company that is prepared to come forward, as I mentioned earlier, would still require the SSC's consent. Whether or not the SSC agrees to it, they have to do so within reasonable grounds.",1,119,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00119
2013-02-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"They would be able to say no, if a tobacco company wants to put its name on the facility. But there would be limits. You will have to find reasonable grounds to evaluate the applications put up by the operator based on the discussions that it has with potential sponsors. So, that is what SSC has to do.",2,120,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00120
2013-02-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the duration of the naming rights, again, that is a commercial arrangement that the operator would have made in discussion with different potential sponsors, and it depends on what the sponsors would be interested to do. I would imagine quite a number of them would be looking at long-term sponsorship arrangements. But, again, that is something that the operator would have to do, talk to the potential sponsors, put up an application and then SSC would look at the application on the merits of each individual case.",3,121,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00121
2013-02-06-T-007,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"I thank the Acting Minister for his reply. The media reports have it that a local bank is in discussion with the Sports Hub operator. My question is whether this discussion could be open to all interested parties? Can any entity approach the Sports Hub operator? It seems as though there is this preferential treatment for the local bank. Secondly, much as I understand that there are commercial considerations, would the Ministry have any policy or preference with regard to naming some of the facilities to recognise some of our founding fathers or sports personalities?",1,122,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00122
2013-02-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I thank the Member for the suggestion. We would certainly be considering the naming of facilities that could take the name of some of our public figures or sports personalities. We are prepared to consider the suggestion and that is still provided for within the context of the Sports Hub because, as I said, not all of the naming rights have been sold or are part of the agreement with the operator. There are still entities where the naming rights have not been provided for in the commercial agreement. So, there are still entities within the Sports Hub which we can name and the Government can decide to so name in a different manner or after a sports personality or after a public figure, as he has suggested. We have not decided; we have not made that decision. But the option is there. So, we would be prepared to study that.",1,123,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00123
2013-02-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the earlier question about whether there is any preferential treatment, the answer is no. Whatever the media speculation, any interested party can approach the Sports Hub company and let them know that they are interested in a sponsorship deal with naming rights for a particular facility. It is open to any company. I know that the Sports Hub operator has been talking to many parties. There has been a media report speculating about a potential deal with one local bank, but I do not think that means that it is only one party that is interested.",2,124,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00124
2013-02-06-T-007,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"Mdm Speaker, earlier, the Acting Minister said that only the National Stadium's name would not be commercialised. In a subsequent reply, he mentioned that there could be other similar entities within the Sports Hub. Could the Acting Minister clarify whether there is actually more than one facility that is not open to commercial naming rights?",1,125,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00125
2013-02-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I thank the Member for the clarification. Yes, indeed, there is one particular entity, which is the National Stadium, which is not open for commercial naming rights. The others are, but, again, it depends on the outcome because if there are commercial parties that are not interested, then these facilities may be still open for us to name differently instead of commercialising them. Because it depends on whether there is any commercial interest. The naming rights of the overall Sports Hub itself is not going to be commercialised. So, that again can be discussed. There are various possibilities. It is not as though all of the naming rights have been sold away.",1,126,2013-02-06-T-007-S-00126

There are even courses which would associate stock market movements with the time of the year or with movements of the stars. MAS is not in a position to assess exactly which courses are credible and will make money for consumers. It is also not meaningful to assess the trainers without considering the content of the courses conducted. Ultimately, consumers have to decide whether the course and the trainer can deliver on their promises.

In this regard, MAS has published, through its national financial education programme called MoneySENSE, a consumer alert on the various ""Get-Rich-Quick Seminars"" to highlight the key things that consumers should consider before parting with their monies to attend such training seminars. MAS will consider developing further guidance on what consumers should look out for when offered these types of courses, such as checking and verifying the qualifications of those providing the training.",4,131,2013-02-06-T-008-S-00131

2013-02-06-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I think the two questions are somewhat related. So, I would say that for financial professionals who provide advisory services pertaining to specific products like stocks, forex, they are already licensed. MAS already has a licensing framework for that – the Financial Advisory Act, the Securities and Futures Act. There is a licensing framework for these people who provide specific advisory services. But MAS would prefer not to go into regulation of general education and training. That is very broad and we have to start regulating every single provider who provides general training.

When our Lions won the Suzuki Cup, for example, they won it with people like Alexander Duric on the team. He is embraced by Singaporeans as part of the team, very much so. We can make it work. The sports talents who come in do add something to raise sports excellence. They do inspire young Singaporeans because they come in, they contribute, whether as athletes or as professional coaches. They do contribute something to our local sports teams. Doing this does not mean we neglect talent development of young Singaporeans. They are not mutually exclusive.

Singapore is the third fastest ageing population in the world. If we do not grow our population, we would become like Japan. With economic recession, higher taxes, and dwindling job opportunities, Japan, the fastest ageing country in the world, is paying the price for its ""closed door"" immigration policy. Some of their government and grassroots organisations have realised the negative effects of this closed-door policy. Now, they are trying to advocate welcoming immigrants through petition and open dialogues.

It is inevitable that a bigger population will create more social problems. From the feedback gathered, we know the police would delay the non-emergency cases when there are more important and urgent cases. We have already outsourced the work of parking wardens. What else can we outsource? With a gradually ageing population, there would be more crimes targeted at the elderly, such as fraud. Public security is very crucial to a nation.

I think it is better late than never. The slew of pro-family measures in the Marriage and Parenthood package is highly encouraging. Nevertheless, we must also realise that money is not the only issue that is discouraging people from procreation. Many residents have confided in me their worries about how stressful life in Singapore is. Potential parents fear that increasing costs of university education and housing will make it difficult for their children to get good jobs or even a roof over their heads in the near future. The influx of foreigners and the perceived problems and competition drives them even further away from the decision of having children.

A high salary alone may not be a permanent solution as those who are in it for the money may quit after a few years on the job. For many teachers or ex-teachers I have spoken to, the heavy workload is a major problem that deters people from adopting teaching as a lifelong career. Teachers have to handle a myriad of non-teaching related work such as administrative work, co-curricular activities, school excursions and sometimes even counselling.

The best place for integration would be in the schools. Unfortunately, the increasing number of foreigners has led to the establishment of international schools that cater to specific nationalities, and this impedes integration. These children will grow up among their own countrymen with little motivation for change and assimilation. Eventually, this leads to social segregation. Understandably, we cannot stop such schools from operating, but we can encourage organising of more inter-school activities and more exchange programmes between these schools and the public schools to facilitate socialisation and cultural immersion.",18,210,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00210

On the other hand, the SMEs who hired foreign workers to keep expenses low are experiencing difficulties coping with the increase in foreign worker levies. A balance needs to be sought − I know it is not easy − but it has to be done, ensuring that Singaporeans are getting good jobs while SMEs get time out to adjust to the increase in expenses.

I personally think that planning long term is the right and responsible thing to do. Not every Government has the will and opportunity to do this kind of long-term planning. Come to think of it, long-term planning is crucial for small nations without resources, without a hinterland, like Singapore. But we must address the problems that our masses experience now, give them confidence so that they can share the same vision.

GDP growth means little if Singaporeans cannot afford cars and if houses are out of reach.

But in this regard, the White Paper has not gone far enough to ask why Singaporeans are having fewer children. Mdm Speaker, in my view, a large part of this is down to a compendium of factors linked to our work culture, cost of living especially for the low- and middle income, and the sense of reducing physical space in Singapore. In the final reckoning, there is a confluence of factors, but rather than just look at more paternity leave and financial incentives, the White Paper was an opportunity for the Government to bite the bullet and introduce far-reaching changes to address our TFR problem for the long run.",5,223,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00223

A very telling sentence stated that there are ample opportunities for those wishing to learn English, such as courses run by PA and NTUC. Why not encourage the economically inactive like the former teachers in our population to teach English and get them in the workforce, with the appropriate regulatory standards in place?

That is the main reason Dr Lim Wee Kiak finds that in recent months, we have observed that car agents are selling more Mercedes and BMW as compared to Toyota or Nissan. Thus, I suggest that MOT could consider allocating more COE to Category A and less for Categories B and E because of two reasons  (a) Category A buyers are more likely to be the working class people who need the car for small businesses, job requirements or to meet family needs; and (b) Category B car buyers are more likely to be those who can afford it and are less price-sensitive as well.",2,260,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00260

Hence, I have earlier suggested changing the definition of Category A to include only vehicles with Open Market Value (OMV) of less than, say, $20,000, which include Toyota Corolla and many other Japanese makes, to favour buyers with smaller budget. I am glad that Minister of State Mrs Josephine Teo has agreed to look into this suggestion.",4,262,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00262

By doing so, it would illustrate the determination of the Government to address today's concerns before we grow the population further.",5,263,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00263
2013-02-06-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"As the percentage of Singapore citizens could shrink to as low as 55% when we grow Singapore's population, we need to take steps to ensure that Singaporeans feel secure and benefit from having foreign workers. There are many ways to improve the sense of belonging and rootedness for Singaporeans. Some are tangible and some are not tangible, as mentioned by Minister Grace Fu. I just want to touch on one aspect, that is, how Government can help to provide affordable housing for Singaporeans.",6,264,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00264
2013-02-06-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Many Singaporeans are lamenting that public housing is getting expensive and wonder if their children can afford an HDB flat. We are glad that Minister Khaw has already de-linked the prices of BTO flats from market prices. It is certainly a step in the right direction. In fact, I would want to urge the Government to be bold and consider the following suggestions.",7,265,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00265
2013-02-06-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Firstly, I hope HDB could tie the affordability of HDB flat with a 20-year housing loan, instead of the current 30 years. Many residents told me that they do not want to use the entire working life of 30 years to pay for the housing loan. Moreover, many feel that they might lose their jobs or be forced to change industries as Singapore restructures its economy. With the push for higher productivity, some companies might not catch up or have to close down and axe workers and create structural unemployment. As such, Singaporeans feel that being able to pay for their HDB flats within 20 years would give them a better sense of security.",8,266,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00266
2013-02-06-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Secondly, HDB could consider increasing the housing grant significantly for first-time HDB flat buyers, of course, with means testing. The increase in housing grant would help Singaporeans pay off their housing loan faster. With the increased housing grant, HDB could also consider granting a maximum of 20 years for the housing loan, instead of the current 30 years.",9,267,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00267
2013-02-06-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Thirdly, HDB could consider removing the resale levy should Singaporeans want to upgrade to a bigger flat as their family or income grows. Removing the resale levy and limiting the loan repayment period to 20 years would encourage the first-time HDB buyer to opt for a smaller flat at the first instant. This would also allow Singaporeans two bites of the cherry without the stink of the resale levy.",10,268,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00268
2013-02-06-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Fourthly, I would like to urge HDB to allow singles above 40 years old to purchase a new 2-room flat so as to give them a bigger stake in Singapore. Why 40 years old? If we allow singles to buy new HDB flat early in age, this might indirectly encourage more Singaporeans to stay single. Why 2-room flat? A 2-room flat is comfortable enough for one person to stay in and probably not roomy enough to rent out one room. We understand about one-third of Singaporeans may choose to remain single and many of them may not afford a resale flat because of high COV.",11,269,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00269
2013-02-06-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,It is very important that we encourage Singaporeans to get married and have children. We know that many Singaporeans at the age of between 25 and 35 are not married. More than 80% of those who are not married have expressed the desire to get married but more than 80% of them are not dating seriously. We have to find ways to help them to interact and socialise with each other.,12,270,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00270
2013-02-06-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"The above measures would go a long way to assure Singaporeans that they could afford new HDB flats in the years to come. Many of us want the Government to build more HDB flats. However, I am quite appalled to hear that someone wants to ask the construction industry to slow down. If the construction industry were to slow down, it means that we will probably have less HDB flats, and fewer workers to build MRT lines and other infrastructures that Mr Pritam Singh was asking for. In fact, Mr Chen Show Mao had once said that he would like to have more workers for the construction industry because these are the jobs that Singaporeans do not want to do.",13,271,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00271
2013-02-06-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"To recap, the above measures would go a long way to assure Singaporeans that they can afford new HDB flats in the years to come. Ordinary Singaporeans, including singles, would feel that the new housing estates at Bidadari, Tampines North, Tengah and the enlarged Punggol are meant for them, not just for the rich Singaporeans. Singaporeans would once again feel proud of our HDB flats.",14,272,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00272
2013-02-06-T-015,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"As Deputy Prime Minister Teo mentioned, the main objective of the White Paper is to allow Singaporeans to enjoy the fruits of a vibrant Singapore. We need to convince Singaporeans that the foreign workers are here to build houses, build MRT lines, drive the buses and assist us to care for the elderly. We need to convince Singaporeans that the foreign talents are here to create more good jobs for Singapore rather than taking jobs away from Singaporeans.",15,273,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00273

I believe that much more can be done to encourage Singaporeans to have more children. We have not yet shown enough political will to remove the institutional and structural obstacles that are discouraging young Singaporeans from having children. If we are going to consider aggressive immigration policies, as a way to correct the problem of low TFR and replacement rates, we should also at the same time be considering more aggressive attempts to support the development of Singaporean families to boost the TFR. Even though we may not see the immediate effects of an increasing TFR till beyond 2030, we are talking about a long-term sustainable solution. Without tackling TFR directly, we will continually have to incease the population by way of immigrants and this will be a never-ending cycle.",2,276,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00276

Secondly, we must support a more equal distribution of family responsibilities between men and women and the families. And, thirdly, we must institutionalise better work-life balance. The Workers' Party acknowledges that a declining TFR is a serious problem for Singapore. However, we disagree that the solution should be to support a much larger foreign population before we are assured that we are doing enough to support all children in Singapore, regardless of their background or parentage.",3,277,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00277

I believe we can go further in extending financial support and recognition for families, parents and children that are at the margins of society. The first group in need of more support are low-income families. While the increase in Baby Bonuses under the Baby Bonus Scheme is a welcome relief on parents, the dollar-for-dollar bonus structure tends to favour higher income groups over those who may be more in need of extra financial help to raise children.",4,278,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00278

The question we must ask is  how many families are able to put down $6,000 or more in order to receive the bonuses? How many families are we leaving out of this incentive scheme?",5,279,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00279

She is only entitled to eight weeks' paid maternity leave, unlike the 16 weeks for a married woman, and a further four weeks of unpaid maternity leave with no Government funding. An unmarried single mother will not qualify for the tax relief for a foreign domestic worker, and is entitled to only two days of childcare leave per year for a child below the age of 7.

However, before we invest heavily in developing infrastructure to accommodate extensive immigration which is a ""worst case scenario"" that the Government says they are hoping will not happen, we must ask whether we have done enough to support all Singaporean families that live in Singapore and their children, and to tackle the problems that are here and now. Not investing enough in our own people is what will cause the real worst case scenario.

I would like to propose the introduction of Bonding Leave for fathers in addition to the Paternity Leave. A two-week Bonding Leave, where the father can take a week of leave each time to take care of each child, would allow them to care for their children for extended periods in order to share the responsibilities of childcare with their wives and to develop stronger father-child relationships. The cost of this should be shared by the state and the employer.

We should consider all options, and not immediately opt for quick-fix solutions through foreign immigration that will have long-term consequences.

Land, even valuable nature areas which are in the way, has to go. It must support our GDP growth. The words ""our population and workforce must support a dynamic economy"" in the White Paper continue to make Singaporeans feel that we are economic digits rather than individuals whose hopes and aspirations increasingly do not have a whole lot to do with the usual material definition of ""success"" anymore.",8,318,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00318

The letters to the press that ensued from my PQ, the Facebook posts and even a petition to save it, show that this place that MEWR describes as ""temporary"" despite being in existence since the 1930s – thank you very much – begs the question just what exactly is the meaning of ""temporary"", shows how people feel about the place.

2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Our immigration policy takes into account factors such as the individual's family ties, economic contributions, qualifications, age, family profile, ability to contribute and integrate into our society, and commitment to Singapore. How exactly are these factors being computed? Can we have a more transparent point system like that of other countries?",15,366,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00366
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"I ask this because all Members must have seen many people during their Meet-the-People Sessions to appeal for LTVP, LTVP+ and PR for their foreign spouses. Some have been married for years to Singaporeans and have Singaporean children, yet they continue to be denied PR and sometimes LTVP+. We were often not told why in the rejection letters.",16,367,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00367
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Next, I wish to touch on increasing TFR. Challenging as it may be, increasing our TFR is still the best way to sustain a Singapore Core. My party colleagues have made various suggestions earlier. I would like to focus on education and childcare. These can influence young couples in their decision to have children or have more children.",17,368,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00368
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Yesterday, Minister Grace Fu said that the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) is working with MOE to reduce stress and to provide holistic education for students. I am glad MOE wants every school to be a good school. However, MOE is struggling against many of their entrenched policies that have added unnecessary stress and cost to education. The Primary 1 registration gives priority to alumni, to those living in the immediate vicinities of schools and to parent volunteers. Getting children into what parents perceive as good schools is a stressful process. And while MOE tells parents that every school is good, parents know which schools are better. From MOE's data, we see that the results achieved by students at PSLE are vastly different across schools. Two days ago, we were told that median 2012 PSLE T-scores in schools range from 160 to 247, a wide difference in standards. So, parents try very hard to get their children into what they perceive as better schools.",18,369,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00369
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Unnecessary examinations such as for giftedness add to parents pushing their children hard right from entry into Primary schools. Secondary school admission is almost entirely based on the T-score achieved at the PSLE. Today, Secondary schools and academic streams are highly differentiated. Students are sorted into schools of different status and into different academic streams. Parents push children hard at high stake examinations to get them into desired schools or to avoid certain academic streams. Often, they take leave from work to coach their children. Even Minister Grace Fu had said that she took leave to coach her children for the PSLE. Some get so exhausted in the process that they decide not to have more children.",19,370,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00370
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,Many parents have deemed it necessary to get private tuition for their children. A Sunday Times poll five years ago of 100 students showed that 97 of them had tuition. The situation is no better today. Parents even send children for tuition to get them into the Gifted Education Programme because GEP has the Direct School Admission (DSA) advantage into top Secondary schools.,20,371,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00371
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"While some level of stress is healthy to keep students diligent, many parents have cited stress in our education system and the high cost of tuition as important factors for not having more children. We are often told that Singapore parents are kiasu. I believe the system has made them so.",21,372,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00372
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,I will elaborate on future occasions when I make proposals for the education system.,22,373,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00373
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Next, infant care and childcare are important for young parents. Last month, the Government announced a slew of goodies in this area. I welcome the fact that the Government is willing to put more money into the industry. I had made various proposals in the adjournment Motion on childcare last year. While a lot more money is now added, there is no change to the structure of the industry, which I consider is flawed. It is flawed because the industry is left to private market mechanisms. This is made worse by hugely disproportionate Government grants for a small number of Anchor Operators that give them incredible advantages over other players in the industry.",23,374,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00374
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"I fear that the monies injected will inflate rents and fees. We had seen that before. In 2008, the Government doubled monthly subsidies to working mothers. Fees quickly went up after that. Under this new subsidy framework, the situation will be worse for higher income families. Those near to, or above $7,500 in monthly family income will get little or no additional subsidies. Private market forces will escalate fees. These parents will end up paying more for childcare. I hope MSF can consider making childcare as a public good, with open competition for all and with fairer support for all operators. MSF is already spending a lot of money on infant care and childcare. Reforming the industry may be a smarter and more efficient way to achieve affordable fees and high quality services with the same money. It will take away the uncertainty of childcare cost for young parents.",24,375,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00375
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Next, I like to deal with issues raised by some PAP Members. Dr Amy Khor has said our proposal will hurt businesses. Ms Jessica Tan asked if we had read the new reports that businesses are planning to leave. Yes, the economy will go through some pains but it is simplistic to say that slowing the manpower growth is what kills businesses. I know of businesses that have been killed, not by lack of manpower, but by high rentals. The Government's policy on industrial land, for example, has caused huge spikes in rents and land prices. Companies that need transport find it hard to afford vehicles due to high COE prices. The cost of many items has gone up. These are in part due to Government policies and the overcrowding of Singapore. The Government certainly has scope to re-examine its policies and to see how else it can help businesses restructure in times like this.",25,376,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00376
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Inderjit Singh has called our proposal zero growth. Our proposal is not zero growth. Our GDP projections are just 0.5% to 1% lower than the Government's. GDP growth of 1.5% to 3.5% is decent by the standard of mature economies. We have a 1% increase in resident workforce as well.,26,377,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00377
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"PAP Members have painted us as turning off the tap, as if leading businesses to dry up. This is an incomplete picture. The tap leads into a plugged sink, that is already filled with quite a lot of water. There are 2.1 million residents and 1.3 million non-residents in our workforce. We have two taps. As foreigners leave for whatever reasons, we turn on the non-resident tap to fill it back up. We can try to get more out of the resident tap by increasing it at 1% per annum. If the resident tap cannot fulfil that, we turn on the non-resident tap. We are not leaving the sink dry. In contrast, the Government needs to be reminded that the sink is actually quite full. Having the taps turned on too fast will flood Singapore with a population that we will struggle to manage in the future.",27,378,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00378
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"We have studied the population data. You can see from the projections that by managing both taps, there could be an increase in population to 5.8 million in the worst case. This GDP trade-off will allow a more sustainable population growth of at most 500,000 people over the next 17 years.",28,379,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00379
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Lastly, Mr Vikram Nair seems fascinated by the way we run our Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. He is welcomed to visit us. He said he is interested because he wants to know how the Workers' Party will run this country if we are in power. He wants to know how we will use foreign manpower. I believe Mr Nair has forgotten that we are elected by the people to be in this House to establish policies and make laws, not to run businesses. This is precisely the problem I spoke about in my maiden speech in this House, that our Government runs many big businesses across our economy. When the Government itself is a big vested player, and in fact the biggest single player in the economy, it will itself take a lot of pain when the economy is restructured hard.",29,380,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00380

2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"In conclusion, PAP Members spoke of the pains to SMEs with our proposal. I should know. I have owned and run private businesses for the last 13 years. Yet, at the same time, I am reminded that I am also a father to three children. I think of what Singapore would be like for them 17 years from now. I think for Singaporeans, what Singapore would be like for them when we ramp up our population so fast, leaving just 4% of our land as reserved space. Would we reach the population cliff by 2030?",31,382,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00382
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Singaporeans are told there are trade-offs. We are told that a population of up to 6.9 million may be required because the Government believes we need 2% to 5% economic growth yearly. Unlike the Government, we present a model for sustainable growth, more consistent with fostering a strong Singapore Core.",32,383,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00383

We will sooner or later face the constraint of our small land size. If this Government moves too fast again, what would be left in the future to sustain the future generations?

2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mdm Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on this Motion. Sensing the ground, speaking to residents and friends, this debate on the Population Paper is a bold move and has generated much debate among citizens. I thank Deputy Prime Minister Teo and the Ministers for sharing the Government's deliberations in putting forth this White Paper and the rationale behind the various plans presented.",1,391,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00391
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The White Paper has outlined bold initiatives, such as the Marriage and Parenthood package, packed with substantial benefits and subsidies. It has also put forth a bold promise of 700,000 homes, how we will optimise land use, the upgrade of public transport system and other measures to ensure that Singapore can scale to accommodate more growth.",2,392,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00392
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"It is also certainly bold for the Government to make public its planning consideration towards a 6.9 million population projection. The Workers' Party, as iterated by Member Pritam Singh earlier, has also taken the bold step of projecting a population target of 5.9 million in 2030. I agree that we face a tight infrastructure today. And, therefore, my view is that it is better to commit resources to ensure that we do not face the same issues today in 2030. Infrastructure cannot be built overnight. So, I ask, what is the Workers' Party's position on what should be the parameters for population planning? As it stands, should the Government plan on a 6.9 million projected upper limit in 2030? Or should we plan based on a 5.9 million population projection and with future bottlenecks again? If we fail to plan sufficiently, we plan to fail.",3,393,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00393
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"As for Member Yee Jenn Jong, I am not clear on his objectives on subsidies for childcare for fear of fees going up. I think MSF has got guidelines on fee increases. So, is he asking for the Government not to give childcare subsidies or that all private centres close down and be taken over by the Government and be made public? We cannot, in all honesty, use Government funds to fund shareholders' profits. The Anchor Operators today are charity foundations, and I believe the right step is to increase the number of Anchor Operators, but we have to qualify and ensure that taxpayers' support in subsidies is met and used for the right reasons and not to line the pockets of private shareholders.",4,394,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00394
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Through my interaction with residents and Singaporeans in general, most understand our challenges of an ageing population and how our population will downsize in the long term if we do not take the necessary steps today. However, many are also concerned because not enough time has been spent to convince and solicit feedback from the public to assure them that the White Paper is in sync with their aspirations and why this is the best way forward.",5,395,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00395
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The initiatives presented are bold, but the Government needs to do more to show that it has come up with ground-breaking solutions to some of our existing issues. The White Paper also leaves Singaporeans with many other questions. What will our cost of living look like in 2030? Will Singapore still be an affordable place for my children? Can my children succeed and find their way in this Singapore 2030? What types of jobs and what kind of salaries can we expect by 2030? Will I retire comfortably and what amount of savings and retirement income do I need to live comfortably? And for those left behind, what will our safety nets look like for citizens who cannot cope with the high-value, high-pace economic and social environment?",6,396,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00396
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mdm Speaker, let me begin on an area which the Population Paper has not addressed substantially, which is Singapore's cost of living and the economic competitiveness from a cost perspective – and how these will be projected into the 2030 scenario.",7,397,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00397
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Reading the White Paper, I appreciate the plans and proposals for Singapore to provide quality housing, quality education, attract quality investments and so forth. But reading the booklet, there is a lot of mention of ""quality"" but our concern on ""affordability"" is not covered in the same depth.",8,398,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00398
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"We appreciate the Government being upfront and transparent on its planning projections. But this also created fear – not just about the perceived lack of space – but also how do we manage costs as Singapore tries to move towards high value-add industries, higher quality housing, higher quality education. So, basic economics tell us, in a land-scarce environment – as more land is used, property prices will only have to go up. Meaning business costs, consumer indices seem destined to go just one way – up.",9,399,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00399
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The narrative about ""quality"" lifestyle becomes synonymous to high-cost lifestyle in people's minds. I hope that the Government will consider a dedicated initiative in its population plan and put in the necessary research and resources. We have asked businesses to transform to adapt to the changing economic and manpower landscape. But the Government also needs to be proactive to find ways to transform our cost structure and supply-side strategy to manage costs because our current strategies are not sustainable given our land constraints. What happens beyond 2030 if we get our land supply policies wrong? We need to and we should also look into sacred policies or philosophies, if necessary, to look into managing our cost of living and cost of doing business in Singapore.",10,400,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00400
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,I am concerned that the Government has not done enough to outline how it plans to reign in inflation for the long haul. How do you plan to balance high quality living with affordability of Singaporeans?,11,401,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00401
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,The recent Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU) survey that ranked Singapore as the sixth most expensive city in the world and the third most expensive in Asia. It is a concern for me. I think many Singaporeans as well. Member Inderjit also pointed out yesterday that our wages have not caught up with inflation given the steep increases over the past few years.,12,402,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00402
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The Government needs to make clear where we stand on managing our cost structure. Should we not also make it a goal to reduce our cost structure to move our ranking down the ladder? And on the wages benchmark, we should be conscious of how real wages move in line with inflation and cost of living indices.",13,403,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00403
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"In fact, the Government should avoid statements that aim to compare our costs to other global cities as the primary indicator. Yesterday, I noted Transport Minister's statement that our public transport fares have not increased as much as other global cities. It is a credit that the Ministries try to keep our costs low by comparing to similar economies. But in addition to such comparisons, the Government should consider and share with the public how fares and other public costs are also benchmarked to increases in real wages, especially at the median and the lower income groups.",14,404,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00404
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"So, we cannot just take a topline approach. I ask that the Government reconsider its KPIs and benchmarks to include how the various costs, whether it is public costs – transport costs, housing, food, recreation facilities – have affordability benchmarks pegged to real wage growth. Our strategy cannot be just about GDP growth, it should also be about real wage growth and household income growth. So, the Government needs to keep grounded to keep affordability and quality of living sustainable.",15,405,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00405
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On the business front, similarly, we should not simply benchmark our cost indices to the global cities. Their business dynamics are different and their economies are more mature with a larger proportion of local businesses that carry the local economy. So, why is this important to Singaporeans? There is a link. If companies are not profitable, they are pressured not to pay Singaporeans well and not give bonuses and increments. If companies are under cost pressure, this is when they revert to lower cost alternatives by using foreign labour and here is where wages may be depressed. Otherwise, companies may just move out of Singapore to find lower cost alternatives. So, my concern for the ordinary worker is that any productivity gains that the Government has pushed for so far may be lost to increases in rentals and other business costs.",16,406,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00406
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The Government needs to do more to help businesses manage their cost structure and help them derive more value add from our economy. To do so, the Government may also need to relook its revenue maximisation mantra for land use and value-add KPIs it expects from its agencies, such as JTC and its corporate spin-off, Ascendas. The business community perceives them as expensive sources of industrial property space rather than agencies that add value to their growth. This, despite the Government's best intentions to help our local businesses. Given the expectation to extract the maximum value for our limited landspace, this approach seems to have translated into how agencies charge for services and rentals in trying to match market prices.",17,407,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00407
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Recently, Madam, I led a delegation of business leaders to the Iskandar region. Of course, it was heartening that Ascendas has also ventured into Iskandar and I was asking if any of the businessmen were interested in exploring space with them. Many were of the impression, and likely, that Ascendas would be more expensive than some of the local industrial developers. So, if we take a purist free market approach even as a Government, we are not helping our SME businesses venture and grow. We need to take a differentiated approach to ensure that we continue to build and support quality growth of our SMEs.",18,408,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00408
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Recently, I met a resident during a block visit who had just moved in, in the last few months. They said they purchased a flat which was previously managed by JTC. I asked, they must have gotten a good price for it? They said, no, JTC asked for $30,000 Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) upfront. So, I asked myself why does the Government need COV? Thus, we need to be mindful of the impact and influence these agencies have on the market and on the people.",19,409,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00409
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"If Government agencies and vehicles take the perspective of maximising revenue in each venture, where should our local businesses and SMEs turn to?",20,410,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00410
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I hope that the Government invests more in research and manpower to find breakthrough solutions beyond traditional methods, such as currency control and land sales, to manage inflation, property prices and rentals. There are also limits to Government subsidy and tax rebates if costs are not managed effectively. We must find new ways of managing our cost structure. The White Paper should consider dedicating a whole chapter on affordable cost of living and sustainable cost of doing business in 2030. This will send a strong signal on the Government's priorities in managing our cost issues today, projecting into 2030.",21,411,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00411

Many business leaders I speak to are also concerned with the Government's deliberate attempts to manage expectations on this growth number, coupled with the tightening of foreign manpower.",22,412,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00412
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"So, this is how it looks to businesses. Singapore is projecting a low growth, but Singapore lies within a fast-growth, high-growth region with many opportunities to offer.

If we are doing this, we are giving them the wrong signal of not wanting them in Singapore.",29,419,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00419
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"But I am most concerned about essential areas, such as healthcare, where we need to be able to find people to do the difficult jobs of taking care of the less able, elderly and the ill. So, we still need foreign manpower to supplement our own, but I think the Government needs to calibrate – and go down into more details which areas the conditions should be more relaxed. But manage the overall foreign manpower population numbers.",30,420,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00420
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"We need to manage population and manpower polices well. I agree with Member Inderjit as well, that we should give our smaller businesses more breathing space to adapt. SMEs do not have the benefit of larger firms who can attract top talents and have the spare capacity to transform and transit to the next business model. Several business associations have come out to say that the projected productivity gains are aggressive as the trends have shown that the industries have always lagged behind the Government's productivity targets.",31,421,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00421
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"It will also help businesses, if the Government takes the bold step of being more transparent to businesses on target quotas for the various work passes, and broad allocations to the different sectors. This will also help companies by giving them advanced notice and adapt to the environment better. I also strongly encourage the Government to have a more open approach in helping companies manage their foreign manpower workforce. We must give them some level of certainty that they face no shock surprises when work permits are not renewed or new growth requirements cannot be met.",32,422,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00422
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The reality is that GDP is about jobs and the livelihoods of Singaporeans. Let us not sell Singaporeans half-truths. Let us be honest about the implications of the projections – foreign manpower, GDP growth, population projection – we are all putting our livelihoods at stake here. These are about our jobs, these are about the jobs that our children can have when they graduate, these are about the businesses that we want to run, or businesses that our children want to start up.",33,423,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00423
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"But the Government also needs to change the narrative on jobs competition against foreign manpower. We need to come to a compromise on the Government's position and its narrative. We need to do more to assure Singaporeans that Singaporeans do come first. Singaporeans accept competition, and that we cannot be protectionist. But Singaporeans must also know that their interests are always protected, their stake and commitment here must count for something.",34,424,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00424
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"We must make Singaporeans feel valued. Do more to develop each citizen to his or her full potential. And I urge the Government, as some Members have before me, to take the bold step of seeking companies to justify why a Singaporean cannot fill a job, in order to justify their need for foreign manpower growth. I also urge the Government to strengthen our laws and enforcement authority against discrimination against Singaporeans and biases against race, against age, against gender. Singaporeans cannot lose out on opportunities because someone else comes in cheaper. After all, Singapore has created a high cost of living structure and we need to ensure that our citizens are taken care of and get the adequate wages to survive.",35,425,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00425

Seventeen years from now, in 2030, what will be the position of the Government of our Malay sons next to others from these families with foreign spouses and new citizens? This will be a question to consider as the numbers from immigration and foreign spouses have increased significantly. Seventeen years from now, we will see more and more sons of this segment serving National Service.

He referred to my speech about childcare and he said that we should increase the number of Anchor Operators instead of lining the profits of private shareholders. He also referred to my proposals. I hope Mr Zaqy has heard my proposals during my adjournment Motion where I had also asked for the same conditions and criteria to be given to private operators if you are to appoint them as Anchor Operators.",1,440,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00440
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Now, I would like to ask Mr Zaqy if the private operators can use the same conditions applied to Anchor Operators and make profits to line their own pockets, does Mr Zaqy then think that non-profit Anchor Operators are lining their own pockets with profits as well. That is my first question.",2,441,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00441

2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"The second question is that Mr Zaqy is in the private sector. Does he not believe that competition in the private sector drives innovation and competitive pricing? And why does he feel that the Anchor Operators should be protected from competition? If they are able to provide high quality and value, then they should not be afraid of competition.",1,445,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00445
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"In response to Mr Yee Jenn Jong's clarification, first and foremost, I was not referring to your adjournment Motion. I was referring to your speech. The questions were directed exactly at your speech asking whether we should make all childcare operators public and not just subsidise the Anchor Operators. Secondly, I think the Anchor Operators today have a special function, in that they are targeting and helping the lower income segments. But whether the criteria is something that we have to go by, it is something I believe in, it is up to Ministry to decide, I am not in that position to decide on the criteria.",1,446,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00446
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Since Mr Zaqy was not referring to my adjournment Motion, now that I have told that my adjournment Motion called for the same conditions and criteria to apply to private operators if they wish to be considered as Anchor Operators, does he think then if it is all right for them to be considered? And if they make profits, whether the Anchor Operators are also similarly making good profits?",1,447,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00447
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I think the Member got me wrong. When I said Anchor Operators, I did mention that they also be charity organisations. And the criteria if they are similar, they should be in a similar fashion in that they should be charity organisations and foundations as well. So, if they are private organisations, then I think it is up to the Ministry to decide whether it wants to consider them in the evaluation. I think it is up to the Ministry to decide whether the criteria are right or not.",1,448,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00448
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"But my personal belief – I did not say which criteria – I just said that we should have more Anchor Operators. I agree with the Member that competition is good but it is not just about competition among Anchor Operators; it is about giving that service to our citizens. At the same time, we have some leeway when we have charity organisations and foundations who are helping the lower income segment. So, it is not just about profit lining, but there is also a social objective that we are trying to achieve here with the Anchor Operators.",2,449,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00449
2013-02-06-T-015,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"I would like to ask Mr Zaqy whether he believes that the outcome for the parents should be that they should have affordable fees, and that they should have good quality service. So, it does not matter whether it is provided by some non-profit operators with a social mission, or whether it is by private operators, as long as they can charge low fees, then is there anything wrong with that?",1,450,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00450
2013-02-06-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I think the Member is confused about what I am trying to say here. There is a difference between the Anchor Operator scheme and what MSF is trying to do in subsidising childcare. The Ministry is putting forth a lot of subsidies to ensure that childcare is affordable. To a certain extent, yes, we are trying to make childcare affordable for all families who qualify in Singapore. That is the end objective but the Anchor Operators also serve certain social objectives which we should also protect. But, yes, we should do more and I think we should increase the number of Anchor Operators if we can but I leave to the Ministry to decide on the criteria relevant.",1,451,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00451

I think this is a good phenomenon as it shows that Singaporeans are concerned with our future development and we love our homeland. If people do not care or give little or no responses to such important issues, then that will be a serious problem. Likewise, if a Government does not act in advance to study an issue of far-reaching impact and does not introduce a solution for everyone to discuss and debate in advance, then that is an indifferent and weak government.",2,454,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00454

2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"(In English)  The Population White Paper has thrown up key questions on our nation's identity, psyche and desires. There is worry of how Singapore may change even as our national identity is being shaped. The pragmatic Singaporean in all of us acknowledges that the Government has to plan ahead to deal with the double whammy of a low birth rate and an ageing population. However, the prospects of having more people and increased competition for resources naturally trigger red alerts. Weighing heavily on the minds of many are questions on social costs and the impact of the White Paper.",4,456,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00456
2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"At this point, I would like to ask for Members' indulgence and courage to consider with me how some of the future challenges, related to the economy and an ageing population, could be mapped. For if we could re-invent ourselves, perhaps we could really avert the possibility of a 6.9 million population in 2030 where only 55% of the population are Singaporeans. I would like to suggest three key ideas for your consideration.",5,457,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00457
2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"One, re-defining prosperity. The conventional vision of social progress through endless growth has indeed come under increasing scrutiny across the world, according to Prof Tim Jackson from University of Surrey. Jackson, who is also economics commissioner on the UK government's Sustainable Development Commission, argues that economic growth may not infinitely deliver lasting prosperity. Instead, we need a more coherent vision of prosperity. This is especially so in the wake of the Eurozone problems and the anaemic US recovery. To him, ""Prosperity, in any meaningful sense of the term, is really about the quality of our lives and relationships, about the resilience of our communities, and about our sense of individual and collective meaning.""",6,458,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00458
2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Is the desire for ""wholesome"" growth what Singaporeans want? We are now all experiencing a post-material age where youngsters tell us that they place work-life balance above economic gains. Discussions about the White Paper have posed soul-searching questions on what constitutes success, happiness and growth. Could ""prosperity"" for Singaporeans take on new meaning? The London-based public policy body, Legatum Institute, has created a unique ""Prosperity Index"" that assesses national prosperity based on wealth and well-being. Its prosperity indicators are economy, entrepreneurship opportunities, governance, education, health, safety and security, personal freedom and social capital.",7,459,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00459
2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Are some of these factors the values that Singaporeans associate prosperity with? As Our Singapore Conversations take place, perhaps we can ask participants for their views on what ""prosperity"" means to each of them and collectively. For instance, could ""prosperity"" mean having more time to make babies and watch them grow, but perhaps for each and every one of us with less pay and opportunities? And if this were so, would Singaporeans be ready to accept a slower or even no growth in the future? Or even the possibility of fewer jobs?",8,460,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00460
2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Two, the second point I want to raise is about reviewing the model of engagement. We all know jobs are crucial to any country. The urgency to attract investments and high-value jobs into Singapore has always kept us on our toes. We need Singapore to stay relevant, globally competitive and attractive to investors, MNCs, SMEs and entrepreneurs. New growth areas and nascent industries offer good potential and high value jobs to Singaporeans. However, due to the nascent stage of these industries, specialised skills are required. This leads to such companies broadening their search for talent beyond Singaporeans. For example, Manufacturing Integrated Technology, a company dealing in solar energy, revealed that its biggest obstacle was not business costs, but the shortage of talent. In The Straits Times article on 16 January 2013, the company's CEO said that ""the firm is sorely lacking qualified engineers"". While 80% of this company's workforce is local, the company had to tap on foreign manpower to fill a 20% gap.",9,461,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00461
2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Are we the victims of our own success? Perhaps it is time for us to consider re-calibrating the forces of demand with the supply of our local talent pool. The high-value jobs created by investments coming into Singapore are creating a demand at the nascent stage that our locals find hard to meet. The White Paper recognises this gap and has tried to plug it by allowing businesses to hire foreigners. But over time, the use of foreign manpower to kick-start new growth areas may blunt our workforce.",10,462,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00462
2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"So, can I suggest that we consider opening up programmes like the EDB's Strategic Attachment and Training Programme (STRAT), which trains workers for emerging industries, to allow these vacancies to go to mature and older workers too, especially those workers from related industries, for example, from semi-conductor to solar energy industry and not limit them to only school leavers or younger workers? Knowledge transfer needs to take place more quickly and more nimbly. Furthermore, could we also consider having the economic agencies hard wiring into our incentives for companies – the key criteria of hiring a set number of Singaporeans – in order to qualify for Government assistance?",11,463,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00463
2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"I recall that in a forum organised by NUS and the Europe Union Centre last December, Acting Minister for Social and Family Development Mr Chan Chun Sing highlighted that many of our work processes are still designed for employees in their 20s to their 50s. They do not currently take into account many years of experience that mature workers can contribute to the workforce. I hope the Government, the various agencies, can consider factoring in such considerations as it reviews the kinds of businesses and industries that Singapore will pursue and continue to develop in the future. And this leads me to my next point which is age-ism.",12,464,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00464
2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Third, whether we like it or not, age-ism is found throughout the world. In fact, today's media and the modern culture worship beauty and youth. And this has really spilled over to businesses and the workforce. We need to fight the onslaught of age-ism, and, in fact, middle-ageism – and encourage a new mindset that embraces what maturity can bring to a society and an economy.

The launch of the ""re-employment"" ads by the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers is a good start but we have to do more.

In Bukit Gombak, I have met residents from 40-plus years old to 60-plus years old, who want a job but find it hard to secure one. They often wonder if this is due to their age or a mismatch on their part or that of the employers'. If our present industries are not able to re-employ or absorb older Singaporeans fast enough, could we pursue or even develop sectors specifically for our mature and older workers?",15,467,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00467
2013-02-06-T-015,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"To this end, can I suggest that the Government consider setting an example by launching active recruitment drives and fairs for mature workers on a regular basis? MOM and WDA can work with Ministries and agencies to review and draw up available positions with roles which are suitable for mature workers. For instance, in the areas of healthcare, eldercare, childcare and even social services – these are the new growth areas that need to ramp up capacity, we all hear. They have huge demand for manpower. So, in these sectors, can we consider identifying or even re-designing specific jobs in these sectors that are well suited for mature workers? This should be work that should not be physically demanding, but it also should be work that will draw upon our mature Singaporeans' strengths. In fact, they have very extensive life experiences. Jobs like healthcare or administrative assistants, carers for the elderly, nannies or childcare edu-carers, or even counsellors, social service jobs. These are possible roles for our mature Singaporeans.",16,468,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00468

In Hokkien, they say ""ang-ji"", ""red hot"". I asked her, ""Why?"" She said, ""Don't you know, Government says 6.5 million - 6.9 million people."" That is how she has distilled the two heavy documents into one single number!",2,475,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00475
2013-02-06-T-015,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"She is not alone. But at least, she took the news in a light-hearted way. Many Singaporeans have not taken it so calmly. Many Members have conveyed their very strong sentiments that Singaporeans are upset. We know. Then why are we moving such an unpopular debate? Indeed, why is the Government, well aware that Singaporeans are already upset with overcrowdedness, still insisting on planning for a growing population?",3,476,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00476
2013-02-06-T-015,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Deputy Prime Minister Teo has explained why. Basically, we have a severe crisis heading our way. Our Singaporean population is ageing rapidly and our labour force will soon shrink. If nothing is done, there will be less job opportunities for our young and not enough healthcare workers for our old. That is the crisis that will confront us in the next 10 to 15 years, which is not far away. Two or three terms of government, that is all. We cannot avoid it but we can mitigate it, if we do something about it now. If we sweep the problem under the carpet and wish it away, it will not go away. It will still be there and, if anything, it will become more serious and may become not soluble.",4,477,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00477

This demographic crisis confronts every country and Japan is a live example because it is ageing the fastest. As Members heard from some speakers before, we will be ageing even faster than Japan. Those of you who have visited Japan have seen it with your own eyes. It may not be visible in Tokyo, but the signs of a shrinking, ageing society are everywhere outside of the cities. Tokyo is still growing because the young Japanese are migrating from their villages in search of opportunities there.",5,478,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00478

Yes, it is a highly emotional issue but this is a moment in time when all of us need to use both our heart as well as our head. It would be irresponsible of us otherwise.

As flat allocation is conducted through balloting, some married couples do lose out to the not-yet-married couples. That is why we introduced the Parenthood Priority Scheme to put the first-timer married couples ahead, starting with those with children. And once we have cleared this backlog, we can easily extend the scheme to married couples without children. Parenthood Priority Scheme can then morph into Pre-Parenthood Priority Scheme. It is still PPS in acronym. This will affect the not-yet-married couples, but not too much because of the huge number of ramped up new flats to be launched.",15,488,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00488

2013-02-06-T-015,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"But I know Singaporeans remain anxious about prices. They see the prices of resale flats continuing to rise. And as BTO prices are pegged to resale prices, they worry about affordability. Again, do not worry. I have suspended the practice of pegging BTO flats to resale prices. And that is how we have stabilised the BTO prices  increasing the Government subsidy when resale prices rise, instead of following the resale prices up.",17,490,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00490
2013-02-06-T-015,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Let us look at last week's BTO launch. A 3-room flat in Choa Chu Kang costs an average of $160,000; a 4-room flat at $260,000; and a 5-room flat at $340,000. These prices were similar to the earlier BTO launches in Choa Chu Kang a year ago. Prices are not identical so it is not a straight horizontal line as every BTO launch is unique, with some local differences. But by and large, you can see we have kept the BTO prices steady, even though the resale prices had risen. Similar observations can be made in other non-mature estates.",18,491,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00491

Singaporeans know that we are a little red dot, we have no mountains and we have no lakes, but we still get to enjoy the lush greenery, the clean air, the blue sky, and our HDB flats are superior to most of the apartments in Hong Kong, Tokyo or New York.

By most measures, Singapore is more liveable than many other cities with lower population densities. From the time that Mr Lee Kuan Yew led Singapore, our policies have always focused on good planning to ensure liveability. We take this as key to Singapore's survival as a city-state.

It is not quite so yet for some of the routes. By now, I have cycled about half of the 180 km. And there are some routes where, as I said before, it is really ""teruk"". You have to carry your bicycles, up the bridge, and cross the highway. It is very troublesome. But we will improve on that. And by 2030, at least 85% of all residents will find a park within 400 metres of their homes. Where possible, we will infuse our tall buildings with lush vertical and rooftop greenery.",25,498,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00498

Apart from our parks, we have conserved a significant and representative part of our native biodiversity. However, we cannot protect every local green area. Some are slated for development and, in time, will need to give way to other uses. It is painful, I know, for the local residents. Actually, it is more painful for us in MND. We seek your understanding but, overall, we will maintain about 9% of our land for parks and nature reserves. This is highly significant for a small urbanised city. Both natural and built heritage are important to us. That is why we will continue to retain buildings and structures which are of significant historical, cultural and architectural merits wherever possible, even as we develop.",26,499,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00499

When you have the time, please take a walk – I will be happy to organise it and accompany you – through the HDB precincts in Punggol South. And see for yourself how we have carefully planned, designed and integrated the common areas, the greenery, the open spaces and recreational facilities. The common green area in each precinct is centrally placed, at the foot of the HDB blocks, so that residents can have wonderful views and direct access to the greenery. They are also designed to keep cars away so that it is pleasant and safe for residents of all ages to enjoy. This common green is supplemented by gardens and gathering spaces on the rooftops of the multi-storey car parks.

The models and the plans have been in HDB Hub for several months now for public viewing. They have been very well received by both experts – architects – and laymen. I have received many emails from architects, city planners – Singaporean architects – who come to tell me how impressed they are with the Punggol North plan.

I totally agree and I will do my best to support that wish.

It is an important reminder for all of us to plan ahead and invest in the infrastructure in a coordinated and timely manner. We will do our best not to allow our population to surge ahead of our infrastructure again. What we must do is to build infrastructure ahead of demand, and where possible, we will also build in a buffer so that we can respond to unexpected needs.

But it is not just buses and trains, we also want hawker centres, clinics, playgrounds, schools, childcare centres, parks, barber shops, and so on to be available to serve our residents soon after they move into their HDB flats. Physical facilities we can build. That is easy. But getting the service providers and merchants to start their business from day one, that is more difficult.

You see, my resting pulse rate now is 68 beats per minute. It is almost athletic but not because I am athletic. It is because of my medicine. For my daily exercises, the physiotherapist requires me to pump up my heart, but not to exceed 125, and to sustain it for at least fifteen minutes, which I do daily. As Members know, I am a very disciplined chap. This should hopefully keep my heart in good condition. For the biannual stress test, the doctor requires me to pump the heart up to 165 beats per minute; 165 is way above my daily exercise 125. But this will enable the doctor to check how my heart functions at a heightened stress level.

Then they can decide what they want to do with the options, to create the kind of society that they want. Creating more space will provide them with such options.",37,510,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00510

They include reclamation of new areas and recycling of existing land for other uses. For example, after we decant the port facilities at Tanjong Pagar, Pulau Brani, Keppel and Pasir Panjang to Tuas, we will free up large tracts of waterfront land near the city to create the southern waterfront. This will allow us to create yet another growth corridor, even bigger than the Marina Bay District.

The development is far from complete. We are probably halfway there but you can already see the transformation effect it has on our city, on our downtown and on Singapore. The southern waterfront will be the western extension of the CBD. The CBD, the eastern wing, the western wing and together offer scope and opportunities bigger, greater and much more than Marina Bay. It is an exciting – or as the young people like to say ""awesome"" – vision, and it is totally within our grasp. What I do not know is whether I will live to see it completed.

We made sacrifices so that our children can have a better life.",45,518,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00518
2013-02-06-T-015,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"That is why we plan long term, try to anticipate future problems and try to nip them in the bud. That is why we put out these two reports, because we know if the demographic challenges are not dealt with properly, our children will suffer. We cannot simply pretend that these challenges do not exist. We cannot simply pass them to future generations to deal with. I think that will be totally irresponsible and it is certainly not our style.",46,519,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00519
2013-02-06-T-015,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"This Government is and will always be on the side of Singaporeans. The scenarios sketched in the Population White Paper are not blindly pro-business or pro-growth. It is you; it is us, Singaporeans; who are at the centre of our planning, centre of our policies  your well-being, your security, the quality of your lives. People first, not growth first – that is the key thread which runs consistently through the two Papers. Please read them closely and see for yourself [Applause].",47,520,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00520
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Mdm Speaker, since the White Paper was released last week, most debates, discussions and commentaries, in the print or social media, and even coffeeshop talk, have been defined by one number – 6.9 million. That figure represents a population size that is 30% more than what we have today.",1,521,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00521
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"When this figure was released, a very natural response from Singaporeans was to find a way to relate this to their own experiences. So, people will naturally draw from their own memory, from their own encounters in the crowded train, the traffic jam, the long wait for the HDB flat – and wonder what it might be like if it were to be 30% worse. And they would then conclude that it would not be a very pretty picture.",2,522,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00522
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"That picture, however, has formed the backdrop of the various debates and discussions which have been going on. Population is an emotional topic and has been for many years, an issue which the Government has grappled with many times in the past. Previously, Singaporeans have been asked to stop at two. Later, it was to have three or more if you can afford it. Singaporeans accepted them. Then there was also the Graduate Mothers' Scheme which was not quite so well accepted.",3,523,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00523
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"The proposal in the White Paper is an altogether more challenging one. We live on a small island with limited resources. We have just come off the back of an unprecedented population growth fuelled almost entirely by immigration. Singaporeans feel crowded out, and indeed we have been behind the curve in terms of aligning the relative growths in foreign workforce with housing, transport and other infrastructural needs as Members have just heard. The Government has been working very hard to address these concerns, but that still remains very much a work in progress. Yet, we are now being asked to endorse a plan that could see us share that limited space with more people, many of them foreigners, such that the Singaporean citizen population drops to 55%.",4,524,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00524
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"I think, in that context, Singaporeans are entitled to ask some very hard questions about this proposal, and I think the answer lies in finding the right emotional balance between the different competing interests which are at stake for Singaporeans. Let me elaborate.",5,525,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00525
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),The White Paper has identified a clear problem with our declining TFR and an increasingly ageing population. We are amongst the world's best in terms of a low TFR – not a record we should be proud of. Our ageing population is ageing at a rate faster than even Japan's.,6,526,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00526
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"So, there is no doubt that we have to address this problem, although it is not a problem which is unique to Singapore. It is a global phenomenon – also called the ""Ageing Century"" by some commentators. Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, they all have the same problem. Many countries in Europe have the same problem.",7,527,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00527
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"But unlike these other countries, we have no natural resources to count on, to weather slow or negative economic growth which impact income gains and ultimately the standard of living that we will enjoy.",8,528,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00528
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"On that score, let me comment on the first balance which we have to find – which is economic growth. GDP growth is not, and cannot be, the end game. We cannot use GDP growth as a starting point and then work backwards to see what kind of a population resource we might need to sustain it. Equally, however, it would be wrong to pretend that economic growth does not matter, or that we should just work out what kind of economic growth, if at all, a declining population can yield us, and then just be happy with that.",9,529,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00529
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"No, we should plan to achieve a judicious growth rate that would be sufficient to sustain our economy, keep income levels up and improve our overall standard of living. Singaporeans all want better jobs. Those who have a job want their jobs to be secure and stable, with good promotion prospects. We want a good bonus at the year end. We want our children to be able to find good jobs when they come into the job market. Do we all not? All of this depends on having good strong employers who will stay in Singapore, run a stable, viable business and operate in a competitive and vibrant economy.",10,530,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00530
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),Take Japan as an example – an economy that has been dulled over the years by an ageing population and an almost cultural aversion to immigration. Businesses have moved out and unemployment rate has reached an all time low in 2009.,11,531,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00531
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"In his speech, Deputy Prime Minister made the point about the sale of adult diapers out-stripping baby diapers. Another example – in 1994, the number of males in Japan eligible for the national defence services – that is, aged between 18 and 26 – stood at about 9 million. As at 2010, about 16 years later, this figure dropped to 6 million, a 30% decrease over 16 years. What does that say about its other workforce? Which brings me to my second point of balance – that of immigration.",12,532,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00532
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Sir, this is a most delicate balance because it affects every Singaporean directly on a daily basis. The front page headlines in yesterday's Business Times best illustrate, Sir, how difficult this balance is. The main headline reads  ""Several foreign firms prepare to leave S'pore"", but the headline just below says, ""Thinning Singaporean core troubles MPs"". We cannot fully satisfy both concerns.",13,533,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00533
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"This aptly reflects the dichotomy which, to borrow Deputy Prime Minister's words, the White Paper seeks a ""judicious balance"" of. If we tighten too much, our businesses will suffer – as amply demonstrated by the Business Times headline on Tuesday. You will also just have to look at the immediate reaction of the Singapore Business Federation in response to some of the Workers' Party proposals in Parliament yesterday to know that this is a matter we cannot afford to strike a wrong balance on. This could well set us on a road that Japan has taken, but minus the buffer which their natural resources give to them.",14,534,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00534
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"So, I agree that we have to be open to immigration to shore up our workforce. I myself do not see any other choice. We could be more selective, more discerning in deciding who we allow in, but it would be wrong to shut it out or keep it constant as the Workers' Party has suggested.",15,535,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00535
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"But at the same time, we have to strike the right balance when doing that. The White Paper has proposed a significant slowdown in foreign labour and I agree with that. But even at this reduced rate, I would caveat that topping up our population with immigration is an easy option and we cannot let that mask our fundamental problem which is that of the declining TFR, which I will address a little later.",16,536,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00536
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"In some ways, using immigration to arrest a declining workforce population is a bit of a textbook solution because many other countries are doing likewise. But we have to be careful.",17,537,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00537
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"First, can our physical infrastructure cope? Not in a few years' time but now. More housing, more transport options, more hospitals are being planned, but these will take time. Can the pace of these developments keep pace with the number of foreigners coming in?",18,538,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00538
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Second, just because other countries are doing it does not mean we should do too, at least at the same rate. We ought not comfort ourselves with living density numbers and comparisons because we cannot easily compare ourselves with these other countries simply because Singapore is small with no natural hinterland. We are not like people in London, New York, Tokyo or even Hong Kong who can choose to live elsewhere in their own country if one city becomes too populated. We cannot. This, and only this, island is our home.",19,539,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00539
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Third, we must never compromise the Singaporean heritage and identity. Too much immigration over a sustained period would weaken it. Our Singaporean Core is rich in diversity and multi-culturalism. We are not xenophobic, but integration and assimilation are not uniform and never achieved overnight. Being Singaporean is not only about having the same colour IC, but rather, it is about having built up a collection of shared experiences and having a commonality of ideals and goals. This takes time to nurture, and it has to be done each time a potential new citizen lands on our shores.",20,540,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00540
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"In addition, we have to be careful not to rely only, or even substantially, on immigration. If we do get to 6.9 million in 2030 and we still find ourselves short, where then would we go?",21,541,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00541
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Hence, immigration cannot be seen as a long-term solution. The root problem of a declining TFR has to be fundamentally addressed. In the nature of things, TFR cannot be turned around overnight; and even if we are to be successful, we will not see the effects until around 2035 at the earliest. Hence, for the short to medium term, whilst we find a solution to improving the TFR, we will need immigration to supplement our resident and workforce population.",22,542,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00542
2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"The truth is that we do not want to get to 6.9 million, let alone get to that number by having more foreigners, which will dilute the Singaporean population core.

Minister Grace Fu yesterday emphasised that marriage and parenthood remains top priority for the Government. I agree but I think we can and we should do more. In fact, I think we have to pull out all the stops on this one because that is the one strategy that, if we get right and are successful at it, will cut away at the population problems which we now face, and, in the longer term, will alleviate our reliance on foreigners for labour.",27,547,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00547

That is good and it gives young expectant couples a leg up. But we must recognise that the decision to start a family is not just about financial incentives or rewards or even parenthood leave. The entire parenthood eco-system and the infrastructure for bringing up children have to be reviewed and encouraged – not just about the availability of childcare centres or Foreign Domestic Worker levies, housing, education, work-place environment ethics, reforms, changes to tax structure and so on.",28,548,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00548

The Marriage and Parenthood Package can only take us so far. I would propose that the Government considers setting up a specialist committee tasked specifically to look into revamping these measures. Go well beyond the present paradigm. A starting point could be to study the Swedish family policies. I know there is a different dynamic there and a different ethic consideration but in Sweden, family policies are placed as a priority and are co-ordinated with educational and flexible labour market policies. There must be something in it, because in a declining European TRF, Sweden is the one country that has consistently maintained a healthy TFR over the years.",29,549,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00549

2013-02-06-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Sir, I will end off with one last point. This is an important debate on a policy which will affect all Singaporeans up to 2030 and beyond. This House has been asked to endorse the White Paper, and I fully agree with the amendments which the Member for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, Mr Liang has made. The debate, however, should not end there, and I urge the Government to continue to consult and receive views, and refine the projections in this Paper, both Papers. It should be a dynamic process. The Government should continually review the implications of the policy not only in terms of the big picture, but also the small. Look at the picture through the eyes of the average Singaporean and what it means for him. It is only then that we can really strike the right emotional balance in our policies.

Because it means jobs, food, homes, clothes, schools, medical services, roads, trains and all the necessities and niceties of life. We pay attention to economic growth in order to create good jobs for fresh graduates and school-leavers, provide security for workers, accumulate resources to subsidise housing, health care and education, help the lower income Singaporeans through schemes like Workfare, and save for the future. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is an economic indicator to sum up the economic activities within a country. Pursuing GDP growth is a means to get a good harvest for Singaporeans.

My experience in Government has been to be upfront with Singaporeans, face the unpleasant facts and work together to overcome problems and crises.

I remember the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, SARS in 2003, the September-11 terrorist attacks, the discovery of a terrorist cell in Singapore and recently, the 2008 sub-prime crisis. I remember the anxiety and uncertainty of Singaporeans during these crises, and the tough decisions we had to take to overcome them. I remember most of all the fear in Singaporeans as SARS took its toll on the lives of Singaporeans and our economy. Our hotels went almost empty. But I also recall the courage and sacrifice of doctors, nurses, taxi-drivers, grassroots leaders and a host of front-line staff, and how we all pulled through together as one people.",23,574,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00574

In those crises, people could see and sense the immediate danger. We instinctively came together to tackle issues head on. We knew we would otherwise be worse off. We weathered the storms, emerging stronger from each.",24,575,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00575

If our institutions are not forward-looking, our economy flat, our society divided, Singapore will not be able to punch above its weight. It will lose its lustre and influence.

When former Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew said that the Government was going to transform Singapore from a swamp to a gleaming metropolis, not many believed it could be done. The key was that Singaporeans allowed the Government time and space to embark on its vision, to effect medium and long-term strategies – on the economy, housing, transport, health and so on.

In order to build housing and hospitals, roads and rail network, industries, the Government acquired property from Singaporeans. And this included farms and business premises. Some were dislocated, lost their homes, their inheritance, even their livelihoods. And I still have some residents who complain bitterly about this today. We can understand why they were all unhappy. But is there any doubt that these measures were necessary and have benefitted the vast majority of Singaporeans? I think few would argue against it.",5,593,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00593

But it is also common for people to view the past with rose-tinted glasses. Despite the current and legitimate unhappiness about over-crowding, high property prices and such, we are today far better than our parents' generation. All the objective facts show that education, home ownership, employment, wealth and household income, quality of life, health and longevity – all point to a better standard of living for Singaporeans today.",6,594,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00594

We all want TFR measures to work so that there will be less dependence on foreigners. Future technology and advances in healthcare may well help our seniors remain active and productive longer. Other innovations and mechanisation may reduce our dependence on unskilled labour. Technology can change life dramatically in the next 20 years, just as it has done in the last 20 years.

Will the added capacity only be sufficient to cater to the increased population? In basic terms, will Singaporeans have to wait longer, shorter or the same time for their flat or the next train?

How are we going to ensure that jobs which Singaporeans are ready, able and willing to do are not given to foreigners? How do we help our children secure places in good schools and universities? How do we ensure that foreigners do not speculate and drive up property prices, and put it beyond the reach of Singaporeans?

There is a difference between a vision and a fairy tale. We have to compare something with something, and this debate will not be advanced or served by comparing Singapore, as envisioned in the White Paper, with something that only exists in fiction.",19,607,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00607

Let us deal with the real effects on real Singaporeans. For example, what will low growth mean to employment opportunities for young Singaporeans? All around the world today, youth unemployment is increasing at alarming rates. The ILO 2012 report puts ""Youth Unemployment for Developed Economies and the European Union"" at 18% in 2011 and about the same this year. In Spain and Italy, as of July 2012, youth unemployment was 52% and 35% respectively. This is because businesses are not investing or growing, and cannot absorb the many young people who are graduating from schools every year. Why do some assume Singapore will be different? Businesses in Singapore will not invest and expand if labour is tight and growth is low. To say that we can have the same growth as other mature economies is no answer as it ignores the problems that these other economies have today.",20,608,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00608

It is clearly not enough to say you empathise with local SMEs, which you kill off with your plans, and then say it is for the Government to find a solution to help them.

This, in the short run, allows the working population base to remain constant and to support the ageing population. However, I wish to highlight two major drawbacks with this recommendation. Firstly, there is nothing that will stop immigrants who come to Singapore and swear their allegiance to this tiny nation from moving to another greener pasture. This is especially so if we are unable to remain attractive to these immigrants. Secondly, there is a high possibility that these immigrants who settle down in Singapore will want to have their parents migrate here as well. This is especially true for one-child families from China as with our safe environment, many will want to bring their elderly parents over and care for them in their silver years. I am sure many of us have received similar requests for Long Term Visit Passes, permanent residency or citizenship for these family members at our weekly Meet-the-People Session (MPS).",10,623,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00623

Ridiculous as it may sound, we are now holding a double-edged sword. On the one hand, we need new immigrants to maintain our edge, productivity and economic growth; yet, on the other, they may very well contribute to the woes of an ageing population. While the immigration office can exercise strict admission criteria, is it ethically or morally right to disallow the parents of our new citizens to relocate to Singapore, especially when the new citizens could be the only children of these elderly parents?",11,624,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00624

If the current TFR remains with no immigration, this will decrease to 2.1. This declining old-age support ratio will inevitably result in an increased burden on the productive part of the population to support the economically dependent. There will also be a smaller workforce with a less vibrant and innovative economy, resulting in fewer job opportunities. As the Deputy Prime Minister had alluded earlier, many young people may then decide to leave for faster growing, more vibrant cities, hollowing out our population and workforce. This is already happening in many European countries such as Greece and Spain.",16,629,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00629

To put it bluntly, our children and grandchildren will have to pay higher taxes, unemployment rate will likely increase, and many may even have difficulty looking for a good quality job in Singapore and decide to venture overseas to make a living.

Let us take a step back and ask ourselves this question  why would the Government put up this White Paper for debate when it could have just succumbed to popular demand by curbing the growth of the population? Would this be the responsible and right thing to do? Would we not be shortchanging our children's and grandchildren's future? Whether the eventual projection be 6.9 million, 6.5 million or 5.9 million, the hard truth is that Singapore needs to grow both economically and in total population to ensure our long-term survivability.",18,631,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00631

Unfortunately, many of the treatment modalities may not be the most pleasant experience for the young patients. For example, for a child suffering from advanced retinoblastoma, or cancer of the eye, the treatment entails enucleation, or surgical removal of the entire eyeball, followed by chemotherapy. These are difficult and painful decisions for the parents, but absolutely necessary to ensure survivability of the patient. As a doctor, I will have to explain the benefits and potential side effects of the treatment.",21,634,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00634

White Papers are tools of participatory democracy, not an unalterable policy commitment. White Papers are used to perform the dual role of presenting firm Government policies while at the same time inviting opinions upon them.

In doing so, let us look to fulfil not just prosperity and progress, but also happiness. After all, we pledge to achieve happiness before prosperity and progress in our National Pledge. Let us perhaps look at how Singaporeans can remain linked and connected to Singapore, not just by ensuring that the tangible aspects are available, but also the intangible, emotionally and mentally. The White Paper must move away from just figures and projections, and do more to address the experience of living, the experience of being Singaporean.",27,640,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00640

2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"With help from the United Nations, Singapore's first Concept Plan was formed in 1971 to guide our land planning for the following 20 years. In 1971, we had a population of 2.1 million. A major review of the 1971 Concept Plan was undertaken and completed in 1991. It stressed quality, identity and variety when planning for a population of 4 million. In 1991, our population was 3.1 million. Another review was completed in 2001 based on the ""long-term population parameter of 5.5 million"". The Concept Plan was not specific about when we were projected to reach that number. At that time in 2001, we had reached 4.1 million people. A mid-term review was conducted in 2006 and the long-term population parameter was raised to 6.5 million in view of population trends and economic developments.",3,647,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00647
2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Today, many Singaporeans have expressed concerns, even unease, over the White Paper's projected population of 6.9 million in 17 years. I do not think there were such intense reactions in 1971, 1991 and 2001, when the respective figures were projected. If we look at the percentage increase of the projected figure against the existing population at the point in time, it was 29% in 1991, 34% in 2001 and 30% now in 2013. These increases have been quite close. There are probably a few reasons why we are hearing the sentiments today.",4,648,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00648
2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Firstly, the pace of increase is getting quicker. The White Paper is referring to 17 years from now. Most people see ourselves still around to either enjoy the better environment, or suffer the bigger squeeze for common space and opportunities. Whereas in 2001, when the projected increase was the highest at 34%, it was over a period of 40 to 50 years. Even I wonder if I would be around in 2050. However, the pace of development in the world is quickening. The Prime Minister has been very upfront in admitting that the Government did not have 20/20 vision over the last decade. It is, indeed, getting more difficult to plan really long term as the world, including Singapore, will experience many and more frequent changes in future.",5,649,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00649
2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Secondly, people are also questioning if the population increase is the way for continual growth. A 12-storey block was considered a high-rise building in the 1970s. Now we have flats at the 50th floor. I am sure technology will allow 100-storey blocks to be built en masse in the future. We can live higher up, we can go underground, we can reclaim more land. However, is there a limit to how many can live in our little island state? There is a fundamental question about the growth or sustenance model for Singapore.",6,650,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00650
2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Thirdly, this topic is particularly sensitive now when people are finding it difficult to board buses and MRT trains, when people are not getting their HDB flats soon enough, when people are waiting longer times for medical appointments. People just cannot fathom that things will get better before the grand vision of the 2030 materialises.",7,651,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00651
2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Sir, that is why it is extremely bold – and some may even say foolish – for the Government to want to subject itself to full scrutiny by laying down its cards to try to explain itself and take up the uphill task of convincing the populace. It could have chosen to be silent on the projection number or the timeframe. It could have just rolled out the grand plans for the new nature spaces, new MRT lines, new housing estates to make everyone happy.",8,652,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00652
2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"However, Singaporeans today want greater transparency; they want to express their views and want their voices heard. This is what an educated population and a more mature society expects. This is the process that we are going through now and we have to go through it. It is appropriate to put forth projection figures for further discussions and debates. It is a move in the right direction since we want to encourage more active citizenry and participation from Singaporeans. Only this way can we collectively decide our future and make conscientious choices between trade-offs. Let us keep an open mind, understand the issues at hand, accept the constraints and face the challenges as we have as a people, both for our generation and future generations.",9,653,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00653
2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Sir, the Government has been building more flats, roads, rails and hospitals to accommodate the population which has grown significantly in the past five years. It will take a couple of years before Singaporeans can feel the full positive impact of these investments.",10,654,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00654
2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"We should consider only increasing the inflow of foreign workers to close the urgent infrastructural gaps in the next few years, while constraining inflow in other sectors. We have to ensure that our citizens feel that the Government has truly listened and forcefully acted on their concerns on housing, transport and healthcare before increasing the foreign worker population further.",11,655,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00655
2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Singapore must also continue to increase our citizens' birth rate. I especially support the enhanced Marriage and Parenthood Package proposal of giving Singaporean couples with children first priority in new HDB flat applications. These are the types of changes that would play a material role to help parents beyond baby bonuses and subsidies. I would like to propose a modified version of a suggestion I made during the Budget debate in 2011 that I think would encourage Singaporeans to not only have babies, but more babies.",12,656,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00656

While I do subscribe to the notion that ""every school is a good school"", I can understand that some parents would have preferences for certain schools for various reasons. I am more worried that now, for some popular schools, their student profile is far from being representative of the general population.",13,657,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00657

For example, if the child has one sibling, he would be eligible for Phase 2B, and, if he has two, he can register at Phase 2A, and maybe, for those with three or more siblings, Phase 1 priority is given. This will also encourage parents to have more babies earlier, before their eldest reach seven years old. In support of intact families, the child and his siblings must have the same parents.",14,658,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00658

While I do not advocate a protectionist mindset to shelter people from the realities of competition and erode the values of determination and hard work to strive for a better life, Sir, our immigration policy sometimes does come across as being cold-hearted and too pragmatic.",16,660,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00660

Most of them are middle-aged, lowly-educated blue-collared workers, some without fixed incomes. This group of Singaporeans is fully aware that they are not very eligible and have difficulties getting a girlfriend. Some of them even gave up the idea of getting married and were prepared to remain single and lonely for the rest of their lives. In recent years, more and more people tried to look for spouses in neighbouring countries. Just like any other men, they just wanted to have a companion to grow old together with, to raise children or to have someone to help them take care of their elderly parents.",18,662,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00662
2013-02-06-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"These women, usually from neighbouring countries, come from poor background and have few opportunities of getting good education. They also have poor career prospects in their home countries. Thus, they choose to leave their home country to search for a better life and marry a Singaporean spouse. In a way, they are quite similar to our forefathers who decided to move southwards to settle here many years ago. In my interaction with them, I find that they are typically good wives and mothers. Even though their husbands may be much older, they are willing to go through toil and hardship with them.",19,663,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00663

So, even though they have started a family and want to settle down in Singapore, they are not able to do so. Do we want to see such families fall apart? Or do we want to add salt to the wound when they already have financial difficulties to deal with additional expenses for housing and medical fees?",22,666,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00666

Perhaps, we could make it easier for them to apply for PR or citizenship for their foreign spouses.

The White Paper asserts that productivity growth is increasingly harder to achieve. Yes, it is hard, but this means that we must increase our efforts to improve productivity so that our economic growth is not so dependent on foreign labour. To address worker shortage in labour-intensive sectors, we must support companies in re-designing job scope and work processes. There would always be some companies in each sector that would not be able or choose not to invest in the necessary technology or revamp their work processes to boost productivity.",25,669,2013-02-06-T-015-S-00669

It sets out a comprehensive roadmap on what the Singapore population of the future is likely to look like. It outlines the framework for a significant shift in policy, from manpower-led growth to productivity-led growth. It spells out major boosts in marriage and procreation incentives. Finally, it details the huge investments to be made in infrastructure improvements, especially in our rail network.",1,723,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00723
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"Sir, there are so many bold and positive initiatives in the White Paper affecting us as Singaporeans. And, yet, I worry that we are not being fair to ourselves when public discussion and debate, even in this House, overly focus on numbers, especially the figure of 6.9.",2,724,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00724
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"This figure has been called many things  it is a ""target"", which it is definitely not; a ""possibility"" – yes; ""projection"" – also correct; a ""worst case scenario"" – maybe. We have been caught in a semantics trap. In other words, what was said has been taken to mean something other than what was intended. People believe what they chose to believe.",3,725,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00725
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"The fact is that nobody really knows for sure what our actual population will be like in 2030. Because population planning is not an exact science – it has never been. It depends on so many variables  our TFR, immigration rates, our physical constraints, which, in turn, depend on factors beyond our control  the external economy, technology changes and, most of all, our relative competitiveness and attractiveness as a city.",4,726,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00726
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"Twenty thirty is so many years away. Some of us will not be around by then. Anything can happen between now and then. The world will change. And Singapore will change. Frankly, right now, it is hard to convince people that the White Paper is on the right track, Our people cannot understand why we are talking about bringing in more people when, in their own day-to-day experience, they feel the squeeze on trains and buses. One resident put it to me bluntly – fix the problems first, then talk. I explained to him that the Government is doing both  fixing the short-term problems and also, at the same time, talking about our long-term challenges. He was not entirely convinced. Seeing is believing.",5,727,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00727
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"I suggest that we should deal with this issue in two parts. First, from now till 2020, concentrate on the on-going infrastructure improvements like new rail lines, bus routes, ramp up our marriage and procreation policies, strengthen integration and community bonding among citizens, old and new and PRs; while slowing down but not stopping the inflow of foreign workers to allow companies to adjust. Leave the debate on post-2020 scenarios to another date but continue to improve our infrastructure.",6,728,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00728
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"Second, in five years' time, review the White Paper's assumptions and estimates for post-2020. This will give everyone a clearer picture of whether our trains and buses are getting less crowded, our housing prices have stabilised, our people are having more babies, our companies are more productive and learning to cope with less foreign workers. Will these happen and, if so, by how much? It would be a much informed and meaningful debate by then. So, let us not be sidetracked by the numbers. Numbers can change, numbers are not targets. The real objective of the White Paper must be the well-being of Singaporeans – happy, confident, optimistic, hopeful now and in the future. And population is a means to that end.",7,729,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00729
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"This debate on the White Paper is not a debate about which number is the right one. It is about the direction we want to take. The kind of Singapore we want. Is it fully open for business? Is it partially open? Or is it totally closed? It is quite clear to us that it cannot be fully opened as we were before. We are running; smack into our resource constraints and the pace of change is too fast for people to adjust. To be totally closed would be a disaster, even for a few years, as the Workers' Party had suggested. Business will close, jobs lost. Once businesses decide to leave, it is unlikely that they will come back.",8,730,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00730
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"We would have thrown away one of our key competitive advantages  a consistent, investor-friendly approach to business. We would very quickly wither into irrelevance. Which leaves us with the balance option  let in some foreign labour to supplement our local workforce, but not as much as before. Businesses would want more, some people would want less. The numbers can be collaborated. I support this. I say go for the maximum that our resources – land, water, energy – can support; whatever that number.",9,731,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00731
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"It shows that Singapore is an attractive place, a thriving, vibrant city, one where people want to come here; live and work and play. If we lose our competitiveness, we lose our verve and vitality, our cohesion and confidence. Not only will we not have foreigners wanting to come here, our own sons and daughters will leave for a better life. Which brings me to my other point.",10,732,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00732
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"In this debate, we have spent a lot of our time looking inwards; talking about our discomforts, our space. We have not asked ourselves how we are going to compete with the outside world. How we are going to earn a living to live a good life? It is almost taken for granted that the good life will continue even if growth slows. We expect new infrastructure to be rolled out even if growth slows. More houses, more rail lines. We want more subsidies for healthcare and housing. But, ""please, let's have fewer foreign workers and a slower pace of life"".",11,733,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00733
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"Where will the revenue from all these come from? I looked for some indication of this in the White Paper and I found it in small print in a footnote on page 31. It says and I quote, ""Government revenue comes mostly from income taxes, consumption taxes and asset taxes all of which are dependent on economic growth"". I think this should be in bold. I think it should be highlighted in a box and not put in a footnote.",12,734,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00734
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"How do we make a living in an increasingly competitive world? I believe size matters. I believe we need a bigger population with better educated and trained citizens, as well as talented non-residents, to supplement our home-grown talent.",13,735,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00735
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"I visit China regularly for business. Every time I come back from China, I get worried for Singapore. The young people are getting more and more educated. Every year, they produce more than 6 million graduates. But there are not enough good jobs for them, so they are thirsty for knowledge, they are hungry for success. They are willing to work long and hard for their rewards. I was in Tsinghua University in Beijing recently and I met with some students. I could see the drive and the tremendous energy oozing out of them. They are our competitors, not just the foreign students who are studying here. This is happening not only in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai but all across China.",14,736,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00736
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"According to the 2010 census, there are 18 cities in China with populations of over 6 million. They range from provincial level cities like Beijing and Shanghai to prefectural level ones like Wuhan, even Dalian and Qingdao. All of them are our potential competitors. They are attracting investments in high-tech areas like biotech, like digital animation, like optics, renewable energy. Not your traditional lower end industries; high-tech industries.",15,737,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00737
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"Closer to home, our neighbours are also doing well. Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines have started to move. They complement us but they also compete. So, which will dominate? It really depends on us. Further afield, developments will also affect us. Will the US' new-found access to cheap energy make their manufacturing more competitive and less reliant on cheaper overseas plants? Will Europe be able to recover quickly from its economic woes? All these issues affect us profoundly. We cannot influence how they turn out but we can position ourselves so that we ride the wave with them, and not be caught in the tide and drown.",16,738,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00738
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"Our fundamentals have not changed. We are still a small city-state, in fact, we are a tiny city-state. We still do not have oil or gas, gold or diamonds. Our politics may have entered a ""new normal"" but our need to earn a living through our wits, our hard work and our need to be useful to the world – that has not changed. Sir, this White Paper is about each and every one of us, as Singaporeans living on this tiny island. It is about how we can enjoy a good life – happy and meaningful, balanced and fulfilling.",17,739,2013-02-06-T-017-S-00739
2013-02-06-T-017,Mah Bow Tan,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"I urge my fellow Singaporeans to keep our hearts and minds open to give the Government a chance to explain its plans and time to implement them.

2013-02-06-T-020,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will (a) issue licences to other private operators to fill the gaps in the provision of bus services; and (b) review the bus routes operated by SMRT and SBS Transit to create intended competition on the same routes and improve efficiency.,1,749,2013-02-06-T-020-S-00749
2013-02-06-T-020,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The Public Transport Council regularly reviews the various schemes that licensed private bus operators to provide services that complement the public bus network. For instance, guidelines for Premium Bus Services were reviewed to encourage operators to provide more direct connections to work places. The Shuttle Bus Service scheme was also enhanced to make it easier for operators to run short routes to areas where basic bus services are unable to meet the needs of residents. Today, there are 90 Premium Bus Services run by 21 different licensees, and 83 Shuttle Bus Services run by 37 licensees. We will continue to review whether more and different types of non-basic public transport bus services can be implemented to better serve the needs of local communities.",1,750,2013-02-06-T-020-S-00750
2013-02-06-T-020,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Er Dr Lee also asked if we have plans to review the bus routes operated by the two public transport operators to create competition and improve efficiency. We will look into such issues in the longer term, but our immediate priority is to improve bus service levels and inject more buses and routes to improve capacity and connectivity, amongst others, through the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP).",2,751,2013-02-06-T-020-S-00751
2013-02-06-T-021,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs whether the Police can consider installing surveillance cameras in Potong Pasir HDB blocks to deter loan sharking and other illegal activities.,1,752,2013-02-06-T-021-S-00752
2013-02-06-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Police has already been deploying mobile cameras in public housing estates, including Potong Pasir, to help fight and deter crime. Separately, as part of the roll-out of the Community Policing System (COPS), Police aims to progressively install police cameras across all 10,000 HDB blocks and multi-storey car parks by 2016.",1,753,2013-02-06-T-021-S-00753
2013-02-06-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Since April last year, Police has installed police cameras in 350 HDB blocks.

In identifying specific locations to deploy the police cameras, Police will consider its operational needs and also take into account inputs from the Town Councils.",2,754,2013-02-06-T-021-S-00754
2013-02-06-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"While cameras can help deter crime and capture valuable footage to aid investigations, they are not sufficient on their own. Under COPS, Police will strengthen the Neighbourhood Police Centres with additional resources to tackle local crime concerns and enhance community engagement.
