2018-01-08-T-001,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) whether he can provide a detailed account of the recent spate of fraudulent claims from SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG); (b) what are the counter-measures taken; and (c) whether a full review will be undertaken to prevent future breaches.,1,1,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00001
2018-01-08-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) what will be the measures taken to prevent future abuses of SkillsFuture claims without stifling the growth of the SkillsFuture movement.,1,2,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00002
2018-01-08-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what is the outcome of the Government's internal investigation into the weakness of its controls over the $40 million scam on SkillsFuture claims; (b) whether there have been additional safeguards put in place since $2.2 million have been identified as false claims earlier in March 2017; (c) why did the rectification measures put in place from the earlier incident fail to prevent the recent occurence; and (d) whether any staff or personnel have been suspended pending investigations on the lapse.,1,3,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00003
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Deputy Speaker, can I take Question Nos 1 to 3 together, please?",1,4,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00004
2018-01-08-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please, carry on.",1,5,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00005
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,The Members asked about two separate cases of fraudulent claims. They were unrelated and of different natures.,1,6,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00006
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the first case, more than 4,400 individuals were found to have made false SkillsFuture Credit claims within a very short period last year, amounting to over $2 million. The fraudulent claims were made by individuals who did not attend any training, but falsely claimed to have done so. They acted largely on their own accord, prompted by a viral WhatsApp message. As at December, over 90% of these individuals have either made full payment or have made arrangements for instalment payments. Those who did not respond will be blacklisted for all future SkillsFuture grant claims until they have repaid. We will also not rule out further legal and enforcement actions.",2,7,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00007
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Arising from that episode, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) has reviewed the claims processes for SkillsFuture Credit. Individuals can no longer be directly reimbursed by SSG for use of SkillsFuture Credit. It has already been implemented. Instead, payments will be made to training providers, who then reduce the course fees chargeable accordingly. This arrangement has significantly reduced the risk of false claims under SkillsFuture Credit. At the same time, the claim process is still convenient and easy, and has not affected the number of individuals using their SkillsFuture Credit every month.",3,8,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00008
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The second case involves $40 million of fraudulent claims. It did not involve SkillsFuture Credit or new SkillsFuture programmes. Instead, the fraudulent claims were for training grants drawn from the Skills Development Fund (SDF). The SDF was established in 1979 to support the training and retraining of workers and workforce upgrading programmes, and is built up through levies collected from employers. It is therefore a scheme that has been around for many years.",4,9,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00009
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"From its preliminary investigations, the Police believes that a criminal syndicate was behind this. The syndicate operated an organised network that utilised business entities, comprising employer companies and training providers to submit fraudulent claims. CPF documents provided by the syndicate listed employees that the Police believe were fictitious. In short, this appears to be an elaborate and conscious effort.",5,10,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00010
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"These fraudulent claims were made in 2017, with the majority being made in October. When these irregular claims were detected, SSG immediately suspended all payments of grants to the relevant business entities and reported the case to the Police. Five persons have been charged with various offences, such as engaging in a conspiracy to submit forged documents, and concealing the benefits from criminal conduct. The Police has also seized $6.7 million in cash and 11 kg of gold, and frozen slightly more than $10 million in bank accounts.",6,11,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00011
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As investigations are on-going, I am unable to disclose more details about the case. But what is clear is that this case involves fraudulent claims amounting to a large quantum. This should not have been allowed to happen. While we cannot always prevent all forms of fraudulent activities, SSG should have detected this case much earlier, especially when it was so egregious and the amounts involved were so large.",7,12,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00012
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"SSG's priorities are as follows  first, work with the enforcement agencies on the current prosecution to ensure that any perpetrators will face the full consequences of the law; secondly, systematically plough through other claims it has received over the past year. And thankfully, so far, there is no evidence of other cases of a similar nature.",8,13,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00013
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thirdly and very urgently, improve the system of fraud detection, checks and audits. SSG has formed an Inter-agency Process Review Task Force, overseen by its Board, and comprising members from SSG management, the Accountant-General’s Department, Commercial Affairs Department and MOE. The task force is conducting a thorough review of how the fraudulent cases happened and will evaluate the current fraud detection system and make recommendations to improve the system.",9,14,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00014
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Specifically, I have directed SSG to strengthen its fraud detection system through data analytics. Fraudsters, who are going all out to cheat, are getting more sophisticated and their plans more elaborate. They will also evolve their approach. SSG's detection system must improve and become more sophisticated too. Through appropriate use of data analytics and drawing on data across Government agencies, we can better detect false claims, without significantly affecting genuine employers applying for training grants to upgrade the skills of their workers. SSG is currently getting help from both private sector consultants and GovTech to get this done. It has restructured and strengthened the fraud detection and audit team. SSG has started implementing some of the measures manually, and will progressively automate and systemise them. By the third quarter of this year, we will have a good and effective data analytics system in place.",10,15,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00015
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In response to Mr Zaqy Mohamad's question, as of now, no staff member has been disciplined or suspended arising from the latest fraud case as there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by any staff member thus far. But SSG will take necessary management measures to remedy this weakness in fraud detection capability. We must also take the real culprits to task, send a strong deterrent signal, so that SkillsFuture continues to serve the working people of Singapore.",11,16,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00016
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We cannot afford a repeat of fraudulent claims of such egregious nature and of such scale. SSG will do a thorough review and rectify any shortcomings in grant administration that it may have. But at the same time, we should not allow this case to detract from the important task of re-skilling and up-skilling the workforce, in this period of technological disruptions and economic restructuring.",12,17,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00017
2018-01-08-T-001,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Minister for the answer and response. The Minister agrees that because of the large amount of public funds involved, we need measures to prevent such occurrences from happening in the future. Will the Ministry consider raising the bar or, in fact, having greater sanctions and harsher penalties in the review for the SDF Levy Act as well as related legislation involving public funds?",1,18,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00018
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This will clearly come under the Penal Code. Administratively, we have a process. When we set up SSG, we enacted the SSG Act. We have provided for higher penalties. But for cases such as this of such an egregious nature will have to come under the Penal Code.",1,19,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00019
2018-01-08-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Sir, I have one supplementary question. I have received feedback from residents that very often, they were falsely told that SkillsFuture Credit will expire, for example, while some are being told that they would need further courses in order for their certificate to be valid. I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any plan to make the reporting of such service providers easier. For example, is there a hotline set up for residents to report such service providers?",1,20,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00020
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Member for the suggestion. We will definitely consider having such a hotline. I believe a hotline to SSG does exist, but we probably have to make it more widely known. The Member can assure her residents that SkillsFuture Credit does not expire.",1,21,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00021
2018-01-08-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I welcome the Minister's approach and strategies to combat such scams in the future. Bearing in mind that this may also mean tightening of the processes, firstly, how would SSG balance not having to make it more onerous for employers to claim, and secondly, given that $40 million was involved in the scams, how does it affect the performance and results that SkillsFuture had earlier reported. Will some old numbers be taken out and the adjusted numbers re-reported?",1,22,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00022
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We cannot count those numbers as training; that would not be honest. In any case, training numbers are not really the full outcome of what SkillsFuture is trying to achieve. We work closely with MOM. The Adapt and Grow numbers drawing on SkillsFuture funding and programmes are much more important. Thus, outcomes are one thing, KPIs are one thing, but understand the spirit of what we are trying to do and the real ground impact of what we want to do.",1,23,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00023
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"How to make it not onerous, I think that is an excellent clarification. The natural instinct is to think, ""Because this thing happened, let's double-check everything and let's check a huge number"" and this will impede the whole system. That is when genuine employers who want to train their workers will get affected. But we do not have to do that and if we do that, we will end up putting out efforts in the wrong areas. What we want to do is, through data analytics, work out the pattern of cheating and then, we can detect them much better. That pattern of detection of cheating has to keep on evolving because they are evolving too.",2,24,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00024
2018-01-08-T-001,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,If we can do that well – and we must do that well – we will not over burden employers. We can improve the audit and fraud detection system while not over burdening employers. The bottom line is this  the system has a big capability gap today; this could have been prevented and it should have been prevented; and we will take the necessary actions to remedy this.,3,25,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00025
2018-01-08-T-001,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I have two questions for the Minister. First, will GovTech be involved in the move to use data analytics to prevent fraudulent claims, and secondly, what are the terms of reference for the Inter-agency Task Force and will they be making their findings public?",1,26,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00026
2018-01-08-T-001,,Mr,,1,27,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00027
2018-01-08-T-001,,Mr,"If the Member files a question, I will be happy to report on the findings of the Task Force.",2,28,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00028
2018-01-08-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Mr Patrick Tay, next question.﻿",1,29,2018-01-08-T-001-S-00029
2018-01-08-T-002,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked  the Minister for Finance (a) whether he can provide a detailed account of the recent spate of Wage Credit Scheme claims; (b) what are the counter-measures taken; and (c) whether a full review will be undertaken to prevent future breaches.,1,30,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00030
2018-01-08-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked  the Minister for Finance in light of recent fraudulent claims made under the Productivity and Innovation Credit, Wage Credit Scheme and SkillsFuture (a) what considerations determine whether additional audits or investigations of a forensic nature ought to be carried out for claims under these schemes; and (b) whether there is any threshold of fraudulent claims which can lead to the suspension/review of such Government schemes in view of the administrative burden of assessing fraudulent claims.",1,31,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00031
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Minister for Finance),"<span style=""color  rgb(51, 51, 51);"">  Mr Deputy Speaker, with your permission, I would like to take Question Nos 4 and 5 together.</span>   Mr Deputy Speaker, with your permission, I would like to take Question Nos 4 and 5 together.",1,32,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00032
2018-01-08-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please proceed.",1,33,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00033
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS), Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC), and the SkillsFuture movement were designed for specific economic and social objectives. For businesses, especially SMEs, the PIC provides funding support so that they can become more productive and hence more profitable over time. Through the WCS, the Government supports businesses by sharing in sustainable wage growth for workers, especially for our lower and middle-income workers. As for SkillsFuture, this is a national movement to empower individuals to take charge of their own learning and adapt to a changing world.",1,34,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00034
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Patrick Tay asked about the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS). A total of more than $4.7 billion in Wage Credit payouts has been given out to employers from 2014 to 2017. This includes the recent payout in 2017, where more than $0.6 billion of Wage Credit payouts were made to over 85,000 employers.",2,35,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00035
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Over the same period which is from 2014 to 2017, IRAS denied or clawed back $5.57 million of WCS payouts. IRAS found a total of over 1,000 cases where employers either gave false information or contrived to fraudulently obtain payouts that they did not qualify for; or which were otherwise non-compliant. The vast majority of these payouts were denied upfront, with the remainder being clawed back by IRAS largely within a year. These figures cover cases of attempted fraud which IRAS detected and acted against over the four-year period. The media had reported the figures recently but they were not a recent phenomenon. So, the 1,000 cases were all acted upon over the entire period of the WCS, since it started. But IRAS recently publicised these figures to caution employers against attempts to abuse or game the system.",3,36,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00036
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Pritam Singh also asked how Government agencies go about investigating fraudulent claims. The Minister for Higher Education and Skills has covered SkillsFuture, and so I will cover WCS and PIC.",4,37,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00037
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Essentially, IRAS uses a risk-based approach to safeguard against abuse. This methodology is used for all IRAS programmes, including WCS and PIC. All potential WCS payouts and PIC applications are first checked upfront against a set of pre-determined criteria for signs that indicate possible gaming. This is complemented by the use of analytics, field intelligence and other sources of information including a whistle-blowing platform.",5,38,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00038
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Cases that are assessed to be of a higher risk profile, say claim amounts that are not commensurate with the scale of the business, are subject to more detailed investigations. For WCS, this may entail examination of supporting documents such as pay-slips and bank statements, and conducting phone interviews to verify the authenticity and accuracy of the submitted wage increases. For PIC, this may entail examination of transaction details and verification of documents such as suppliers' invoices and payment evidences. IRAS may also conduct field visits to understand the applicant’s business, for example, how the PIC equipment is used in the business.",6,39,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00039
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"IRAS will continue to take strict enforcement and legal actions against those who abuse the schemes. This includes disqualifying offenders from other Government schemes, and taking legal action against such offenders. Offenders can be charged under the Penal Code or the Income Tax Act for abusing the schemes. To date, IRAS has prosecuted 13 cases for fraud under the PIC scheme, and one case under WCS.",7,40,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00040
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"More generally, MOF undertakes periodic reviews of Government schemes to ensure that they are relevant and achieve the purposes that they are designed for. Programmes which continue to serve their purpose will be retained. Others which are intended to be time-limited will be terminated at their end-date. Yet others may be continued with revised criteria, based on the actual experience of running the schemes and the assessment of the scheme’s overall effectiveness, which includes a weighing of the scheme’s benefits against its administrative costs.",8,41,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00041
2018-01-08-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I thank the Second Minister for Finance for his reply. I refer to the latest Estimates Committee Report where it was made known that about 313,000 PIC cash payouts have been submitted over the years and 98,000 ­– almost one third of them – were selected for review and out of that number, 64% of the claims were rejected upfront. The reply from MOF to the Estimates Committee also stated that for the remaining 215,000 PIC claims, I quote, ""they may be selected for review based on other factors"". Are there any additional factors that IRAS specifically considers for claims which fall outside their usual risk-based approach? From the reading of MOF's reply to the Estimates Committee, it appears that more review is going to be done for claims which were not originally audited.",1,42,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00042
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, as I had mentioned earlier, IRAS takes a risk-based approach. Taking a risk-based approach means not 100% sampling. As Minister Ong earlier mentioned, doing 100% checks is going to be counter-productive to a large extent because it will entail a large bureaucratic process.",1,43,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00043
2018-01-08-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, taking a risk-based approach means sampling according to risk and when IRAS says that it has done audits for 98,000 cases, then it has identified these as the higher risk cases and done detailed audits for them. To the extent that there are cases with lower risk, then the sampling will be lower as well.",2,44,2018-01-08-T-002-S-00044
2018-01-08-T-003,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked  the Minister for Home Affairs what are the processes involved before the Ministry decides to ban a foreign religious preacher from entering Singapore.,1,45,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00045
2018-01-08-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the criteria used in banning foreign preachers of different faiths take into account the location and environment in which their speeches justifying their bans were made; (b) whether these views have been or would have been applied to their sermons in Singapore; (c) what is the estimated number of congregants who follow the banned preachers; and (d) whether the Ministry finds the move effective given that their speeches and sermons are still pervasive through other mediums such as the Internet.,1,46,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00046
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Sir, with your leave, can I take Question Nos 6 and 7 together?",1,47,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00047
2018-01-08-T-003,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Yes. Please proceed.,1,48,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00048
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, we hold a clear position on the preaching of religious intolerance and we draw a line on teachings that seek to divide our society along religious lines.",1,49,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00049
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, we should also be clear that a foreigner's entry into Singapore is neither automatic nor a right. It is a privilege. It will only be granted if we assess that his entry will not harm Singapore's interests. In this context, the foreigner who wants to deliver a talk in Singapore, if the talk is related to religion, race or politics, he has to obtain a Miscellaneous Work Pass (MWP) from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) because of the issues are sensitive. MOM will consult other agencies in its assessment of MWP applications. Each application is assessed on its own merits, through a process.",2,50,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00050
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"From a security perspective, one of the principles is that a foreigner should not have antecedents of radical preaching and teachings. For example, if he has advocated violence or promoted segregationist, intolerant teachings that are inimical to our multi-racial, multi-religious society, he will not be allowed in.",3,51,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00051
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is not material whether the previous comments were made in relation to Singapore or whether they intend to touch on these issues when they speak here. If they hold views that are inappropriate or unacceptable in our context, then it is not in our national interest to give them a platform in Singapore, whether to propagate their teachings or to build up their followings.",4,52,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00052
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is also not material to consider how large their followings is in Singapore. We should be concerned even if a small number in Singapore take in their radical, intolerant or segregationist teachings. And we should not allow them to preach or speak here, to spread these viewpoints amongst Singaporeans and build up anger amongst the different faiths.",5,53,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00053
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked about the effectiveness of banning such foreigners given the accessibility of digital platforms.,6,54,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00054
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"There are obviously limits to the extent to which we can prevent access to such content, in particular through the Internet. But this does not mean that we should make it even easier for such foreigners to spread their views more directly and personally to Singaporeans, and build up a following here by allowing them to come into Singapore and giving them a physical platform. Preaching and grandstanding ""live"" and in person is quite different a proposition from doing so on the Internet.",7,55,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00055
2018-01-08-T-003,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"I would like the Minister for his reply. I have one supplementary question. I just want to know whether the Ministry engage these foreign religious preachers to give them an opportunity to explain themselves prior to the imposition of the ban or after the ban had been imposed, in a way to allow them to make an appeal against the ban.",1,56,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00056
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let us take someone, who says, referring to Islam, Islam, communism and other societal problems, such as human trafficking, are referred to as ""goliaths standing at our door"". He had also described Allah as a false God, asked for prayers for those held captive in the darkness of Islam, refers to Buddhists as ""tohuw people"", which is a Hebrew word for loss, lifeless, confused and spiritually barren. Do you think we should invite him into Singapore and give him an interview? Let me know.",1,57,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00057
2018-01-08-T-003,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,I believe the Minister did not answer my question. I just want to know whether there is a process involved or a channel for an appeal to be made.,1,58,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00058
2018-01-08-T-003,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Mr K Shanmugam,"Let us look at specific facts. Will you answer my question, so that we can take this discussion further?",1,59,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00059

2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I started out by saying, often it will be quite clear whether we should or we should not allow, and I gave you a passage. Let us say, a preacher says the following, he describes Islam, communism and other societal problems, including human trafficking, categorising all of them together, as ""goliaths standing at our door"", describes Allah as a false God, asks for prayers for those held captive in the darkness of Islam, refers to Buddhists as ""tohuw people"", which is a Hebrew word for loss, lifeless, confused and spiritually barren individuals, who can be saved by converting to Christianity. Do you believe we should invite him into Singapore and interview him, or should we ban him outright?",1,61,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00061

2018-01-08-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I have a question on the issue of context. It is a tricky one because many scriptures of the various religions do deal with the non-believers and many religious leaders and preachers have had to address this and speak on such topics when they are overseas. So, it may not be easy for them to align the speeches into context of multi-racialism or multi-religionism, to what we believe here in Singapore; we are an exception. So, how do you differentiate whether it is through their views or it is a context of which they were giving that speech or sermon in those countries? And how can we do more to help our own religious leaders to also counter such radical beliefs?",1,64,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00064
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It has a number of different facets. If you look at it within Singapore, then you look at it outside of Singapore. Within Singapore, we are very clear on the framework. We have complete freedom of religion. We encourage the different faiths to carry on, you have seen the consequences, we are ranked one of the most religiously diverse societies in the world. So, we guarantee freedom of religion including to the minorities and, in fact, we support them. Both Members of Parliament as well as office holders turn up in many of these events. The line that we draw, and if you look at it, the Penal Code has legal provisions. The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act has a framework, but essentially if I were to identify one principle, do not do harm unto others, do not advocate violence, do not put down somebody else's religion. As long as you keep to that, propagate your faith.",1,65,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00065
2018-01-08-T-003,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"That, I think, has seen us being an oasis of religious peace in a world that is highly troubled. So, when we look at foreign preachers, we would have to look at who is bringing them in, we will have to talk to them, and we will have to look at the context of their sayings, but on the whole, we take a fairly conservative approach in that whatever you have said elsewhere, if those represent your viewpoints, like what I just said, if someone calls Allah a false God, and then he wants to come into Singapore and say, ""Well, you know, that was in a different context."" I think it nevertheless, runs serious risk of people following such a preacher and then they go on to look at what else he has said elsewhere and the context is not always apparent to people to be understood. So, I think it is better for us to be careful.",2,66,2018-01-08-T-003-S-00066

The DPA, which has been published, sets out how the amount was arrived at. Among other things, KOM was given maximum credit for its full cooperation with investigations. Out of the US$422 million, 50% would be paid to Brazil, 25% to the US, and 12.5% to Singapore.

Suffice to say, if there is good reason to investigate, the authorities will do so, whether or not the company is a Government-linked company.

2018-01-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Earlier in her response, she mentioned that I was not correct to categorise the arrangements reached between Keppel and the Singapore authorities as a three-nation plea bargain agreement. What we read, however, from the statement by CPIB and the AGC in December, is that this Deferred Prosecution Agreement in the US was reached, of course with the US government, but in discussion with Brazil and Singapore, and as part of that global resolution, Singapore was issuing a conditional warning to KOM here. So, my question is, is she actually saying that these agreements that we have reached with Keppel for the conditional warning were not taken in consultation or as part of arrangements with the USA and Brazil, which seems to be what the statement is implying, and that we reached it independently, and we could have actually gone on to prosecute KOM if we had wanted to, it would not be in breach of any global arrangement? So, that is the first question, whether we are completely free to decide whether to prosecute or not in this discussions with Brazil and the US.",2,107,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00107
2018-01-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question is, the Senior Minister of State mentioned in her response that the conditional warning, of course, carried certain undertakings from KOM which were closely aligned to the undertakings in the US agreement, but she did not really specify whether they were coterminous or whether there were variations. So, I would like the Senior Minister of State to give some examples of some of the key undertakings that we have included in the Singapore agreement with KOM.",3,108,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00108
2018-01-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The third question is, in the Senior Minister of State's response, she mentioned that by reaching this arrangement, we would have achieved much more than we could have on our own. The CPIB and AGC statement say that KOM is being given a conditional warning in lieu of prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act. I am not sure whether the Senior Minister of State, in her response, was actually saying that it would have been quite difficult to successfully prosecute KOM, because the evidence was overseas and so on and so forth, in which case then is a question of whether this ""in lieu of prosecution"" really means anything.",4,109,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00109
2018-01-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, of course, I think the Government would be aware that there has been much interest in this case. Looking at what has been happening to Keppel as a GLC, as a corporate entity, given the large sums of money involved and the damage to our reputation, people perceive that they are just being given a slap on the wrist, whereas it is a daily affair that individuals, who are not well connected, they are prosecuted for corruption offences involving $10 or $20 and they go to jail. So, I would like the Government to respond to that because I think there is some public concern about this, what is perceived to be some lenient treatment being given to KOM.",5,110,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00110
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for her questions and the opportunity to clarify certain things. Her first question was whether I had, in my reply, suggested that the actions taken by the AGC were not done in consultation or coordination with the other authorities. I did not say that at all. Let me just read what I actually said. I said that there was no ""three-nation plea bargain agreement"". What happened was that each jurisdiction acted under its own domestic laws, but in coordination with the two other jurisdictions.",1,111,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00111
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"What I was trying to explain is the legal basis or the legal concept behind it. Because when you say ""three-nation plea bargain agreement"", it suggests that there is either some kind of agreement or treaty to which all three countries are party and we are acting under the same instrument. That is not the case. What I was seeking to establish was that each country is acting in accordance with its own laws. But even whilst acting in accordance with its own laws, they reached a coordinated global resolution.",2,112,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00112
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, that is what I said in the main reply and the intent of it was to explain the underlying basis, which is that each country is actually acting in accordance with its own domestic laws. That is why in the US, they are acting under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and they are using the DPA mechanism. In Singapore, we use the conditional warning and the PCA. And, of course, in Brazil, they had the Leniency Agreement. So, that was all that was being said in relation to that.",3,113,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00113
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The second question was in reference to the main answer where I said that the terms of the conditional warning were closely aligned. Ms Lim wanted to know whether it was coterminous and, essentially, asking what are the terms of the conditions. It is not our practice to disclose terms of conditional warnings, not just for Keppel but for all cases. In other words, conditional warnings are things which had been given in the past by the agencies but, as a general practice, we do not disclose its exact terms. What I can say is what I have said, which is that it is closely aligned with what has been done in the US.",4,114,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00114
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The third question was whether, when I said that we have achieved more than if we were acting on our own, and acting in lieu of prosecution, if I could just clarify with Ms Lim her third question, what was the purport of that?",5,115,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00115
2018-01-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Yes, what I was asking was that the Senior Minister of State has said that some of the considerations in such transactions which take place primarily overseas and whether we decide to prosecute locally is, for example, whether our local authorities might have difficulties getting the evidence or witnesses locally. That is what I understood her to have said. So, my question was that when the CPIB and the AGC said in their statement that they are giving a warning in lieu of prosecution, is it a real risk of prosecution or is it a case where there will be difficulties and that is why we are saying that we are not prosecuting them but, in reality, the case would be difficult to mount?",1,116,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00116
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I thank the Member for her clarification. In this particular case, since Keppel has actually come forward and cooperated, it has, in effect, as a company, admitted its part in this. So, the next question that arises is  do you prosecute or do you give a conditional warning in lieu of prosecution? And in this particular case, it was decided to give a conditional warning in lieu of prosecution because of the factors which I had outlined earlier.",1,117,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00117
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But the point I was making, when I talked about being able to achieve more than we otherwise would have been able to do if we had proceeded solely ourselves, is for a number of reasons. First, the maximum fine under the Prevention of Corruption Act is $100,000 per charge. So, this would not get us anywhere near the penalty under the global resolution or even Singapore's share of the current penalty. And with respect to disgorgement, there will be issues of which country gets what. So, under the global resolution, what it means, essentially, is that we are able to achieve all the things that we would have been able to do with prosecution, but even more. And, in addition, under the US DPA, there are requirements for an enhanced compliance programme.",2,118,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00118
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, all of these are things which we have obtained, which is more than what we would have been able to obtain if you had proceeded solely under the DPA. That is what I meant by that.",3,119,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00119
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Let me proceed now to the last question where Ms Lim suggested that people may be getting off lightly because it is a conditional warning. For this, I think it is important to understand that there are actually two different things.",4,120,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00120
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First, there is a company; second, there is the individual. Insofar as the company is concerned, it is not a light thing at all. They have not got off lightly. They paid something to the tune of ─ in the DPA, it says US$55 million worth of bribes. They have been slapped with a penalty of US$422 million. That is something like eight times whatever they would have paid out. They have been subject to an enhanced compliance regime. As I have pointed out, we have actually achieved more than what we would have been able to do if they were prosecuted solely under the PCA and the company itself has obviously taken remedial actions. So, as far as the company is concerned, make no mistake. There has been a heavy price to pay and deservedly so.",5,121,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00121
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"With respect to the individuals, as I have explained in my earlier reply, investigations are still on-going. That outcome has not been determined. Nobody has got off or not got off, as the case may be. That is something that the Public Prosecutor has to decide, and I have explained some of the challenges that the Public Prosecutor is facing in terms of getting the evidence. But that is something we have to let the Public Prosecutor deal with independently.",6,122,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00122
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But let me just say one other thing on this, which is that it is not a matter of letting individuals off lightly. We have in the past taken actions against people irrespective of their status. In the ST Marine case that I mentioned, all seven individuals were senior management, including former Presidents of ST Marine. There was Patrick Lee, the former Group Financial Controller of ST Marine; there was Ong Teck Liang, former Group Financial Controller; Han Yew Kwang, former Chief Operating Officer; Mok Kim Whang, former Senior Vice President; Tan Mong Seng, former President (Commercial Business), ST Marine; Chang Cheow Teck, former President, ST Marine; See Leong Teck, former President, ST Marine.",7,123,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00123
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Government officials and politicians have been investigated in the past by CPIB and charged. These include the Minister of State Wee Toon Boon, sitting and former Members of Parliament Phey Yew Kok and Choo Wee Khiang, the SCDF Commissioner Peter Lim, NKF CEO T T Durai, and the Deputy Chief Executive of PUB Choy Hon Tim. There was a Cabinet Minister, Teh Cheang Wan, who took his own life after CPIB started to investigate him.",8,124,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00124

2018-01-08-T-004,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Mr Deputy Speaker, with your permission, I would like to ask three supplementary questions. As background, if a prominent company, especially one linked to the Government, fails to uphold the law and proper standards of conduct wherever they are, it hurts our national reputation. As my residents have told me, it is not enough just to win or get the job done.",1,127,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00127
2018-01-08-T-004,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"My first question is  even if the Government or Temasek Holdings do not manage the day-to-day operations of GLCs, what measures are there to send a clear signal that Singaporeans and Singapore companies overseas must not engage in corrupt behaviour, whether directly or through proxy agents?",2,128,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00128
2018-01-08-T-004,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"My second question is  does the Government have a view on whether KOM should conduct a claw-back of bonuses paid out to ex-employees implicated in illegal behaviour? Even if KOM has no legal means of claw-back, should such bonuses be subject to forfeit by law under the Penal Code or the Prevention of Corruption Act, if not so already?",3,129,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00129
2018-01-08-T-004,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Thirdly, for Government tenders, what incentives are there to shape the behaviour of proxies and agents to minimise the risks of illegal activity? For example, should there be punitive liquidated damages written into a tender in the event that a contractor is found to have breached the law either in Singapore or overseas?",4,130,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00130
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. I certainly agree that it does hurt our reputation and, for that reason, we do not condone this. We are extremely disappointed as well in what has occurred.",1,131,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00131
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"With respect to the first question that the Member asked about what measures Temasek can take to send a clear signal to Singaporeans and Singapore companies, as I have said − and I repeat − the Government expects Singapore companies and Singaporeans to do business honestly and lawfully even in complex environments.",2,132,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00132
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"For Temasek, their position is that they foster an ethos of integrity and good governance and sustainability, and they, too, do not condone improper conduct and malfeasance. So, Temasek expects companies in its portfolio to abide by sound corporate governance and robust codes of conduct and ethics. Temasek holds the respective boards and managements responsible and accountable for the day-to-day decisions and actions of these portfolio companies, but Temasek does not direct the day-to-day business decisions or operations of the Temasek portfolio companies. But what Temasek can and does do is to conduct regular roundtables, forums, educational programmes, all essentially directed at encouraging not just its portfolio companies but all other companies to keep and maintain clean systems and avoid corrupt practices.",3,133,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00133
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The second question the Member asked was about whether we have a view on whether KOM should claw back bonuses paid out to ex-employees, and so on. The Government does not intervene in internal corporate disciplinary actions. This is a matter for KOM and its board. But, as stated in the US DPA, KOM has imposed about US$8.9 million in financial sanctions on 12 former or current employees as part of the disciplinary process.",4,134,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00134
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The third supplementary question, I think, was with respect to tenders. Government tenders explicitly state that tenderers can be debarred if, for instance, they are convicted of corruption by our courts. Debarred entities will not be eligible to participate in any tender by Government agencies for a period of time. The directors of a disbarred company will also be debarred, and for any new companies or businesses they set up during the debarment period will also not be considered for award of tenders. Beyond disbarment, the track record of a supplier is typically an evaluation criterion in Government tenders. Any known facts that reflect on the commercial integrity of the supplier will be taken into account in evaluating the supplier's track record.",5,135,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00135
2018-01-08-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, I have five questions for the Senior Minister of State. The first question is, in view of the Government's status as the largest single shareholder of Keppel, will Temasek Holdings call for an extraordinary general meeting with a view to pursue civil action against board members and senior executives found responsible for the bribery scheme for breach of fiduciary duties and to seek equitable compensation from those responsible?",1,136,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00136
2018-01-08-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question pertains to the questionable P-61 contract which amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. It would have likely required board approval for it to be approved. Is the Government aware whether the Keppel board gave the CEO broad powers to enter into the contract? If not, what is the nature of the board's oversight and their culpability in the bribery scheme? Is this something the Public Prosecutor or the CPIB is going to look into, or is this a matter for shareholders to consider?",2,137,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00137
2018-01-08-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thirdly, in its information release, the US Department of Justice shared that a KOM subsidiary in Singapore paid the bribes amounting to $17-odd million into an entity based in Miami, Florida. What is the name of this subsidiary? This is only a question of fact. And who are the officers of this subsidiary?",3,138,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00138
2018-01-08-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Fourthly, a former Keppel CEO and Senior Adviser, Mr Choo Chiau Beng, was the Singapore Ambassador to Brazil from 2004 till 2016, I believe. Was Mr Choo removed as Ambassador because of his involvement or knowledge of the bribery scheme and, if so − and I stress, if so − which month or year did the Government first come to know of Mr Choo's involvement? Finally, is the CPIB or the Public Prosecutor investigating whether Mr Choo used his position as Ambassador to dishonestly assist Keppel secure contracts corruptly in Brazil?",4,139,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00139
2018-01-08-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My final question pertains to the matter of the identities of the individuals identified in deferred prosecution agreement. There is a dissonance between what the public reads in the newspapers for individuals who are being investigated, for example, the General Manager of Ang Mo Kio Town Council – no charges, I understand, have been preferred against him yet, but his identity, his name, is well-known to the public. How does the Minister reconcile that with the non-disclosure of the names of the individuals involved in the Keppel matter?",5,140,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00140
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Let me just deal with the last question first, in which I think the Member wanted to know how does the Government deal with the fact that the names are out there. The Government's position is very simple. The Government deals with the Government's actions. So, the Government's actions are that when investigations are on-going, we do not disclose the identities of people being investigated. What other people may say outside, what other information may be floating outside, what other comments may go on in social media, that is separate. But as the Government, as an investigation authority, the Government does not disclose names of individuals who are being investigated. And we are not alone in that. All civilised jurisdictions which observe the rule of law uphold that principle simply because, as I have mentioned earlier, we do not want to prejudice either the investigations or the persons being investigated, depending on how the investigation might turn out.",1,141,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00141
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"With respect to the first question, I think Mr Singh asked can the Government as a shareholder call a meeting and ask for a resolution to be passed to commence civil action. I think that was the thrust of the question.",2,142,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00142
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Let me just correct a few factual inaccuracies here. First, the Government owns 100% of Temasek. The Government is not a direct shareholder of Keppel. That is number one. Temasek owns just over 20% of Keppel Corporation, which is not the entity in question here, which means that there is 80% of other shareholders. Keppel Corporation then owns 100% of KOM, which is the entity in question here. So, the general principle of corporate governance, with which Mr Singh is familiar as a lawyer, is that the shareholders deal with their companies in which they have shares at the shareholder level. Shareholders appoint the boards. The boards then, depending on whether the members are executive or non-executive, it is their business to make sure that the policies and so on for the company are proper, that governance is proper, and then the day-to-day operations are done by the executive team or the executive management.",3,143,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00143
2018-01-08-T-004,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"As I had mentioned earlier, in this particular instance, the Government and Temasek do not interfere in the day-to-day running or management of the Temasek portfolio companies. What I can say and what I can point Mr Singh to, is what is already in the public domain which is in the DPA, paragraph 4(d) – which I am sure Mr Singh is familiar with – the company has engaged in extensive remedial measures including taking disciplinary action against 17 former or current employees in relation to the misconduct described in the statement of facts. They have caused seven employees who participated in the conduct described in the statement of facts to separate from the company. They have issued demotions and/or written warnings to seven employees who failed to detect the misconduct and failed to take appropriate steps to mitigate corruption and compliance risks. They have imposed approximately US$8.9 million in financial sanctions on 12 former or current employees as part of the disciplinary process, and have conducted individualised anti-corruption and compliance training for six employees.",4,144,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00144

2018-01-08-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The Senior Minister of State said that the question really pertained to the nature of the Board's oversight over that contract. If indeed they had knowledge or they were involved in that contract, what was the nature of their oversight and their culpability in the bribery scheme, and specifically, is this something that the CPIB or the Public Prosecutor is looking into?",1,147,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00147

As to what is known and not known within the Keppel group, that is, really, a Keppel matter. The only thing that I can do here which would be useful is to point Mr Singh to one of Keppel's media releases, where Keppel said that the current boards of directors of Keppel Corporation and its unit KOM were not aware of the illegal payments made to secure projects in Brazil. That is Keppel's position. As far as the Government is concerned, as I have explained, the Government is shareholder in Temasek, Temasek has a just over 20% shareholding in Keppel Corporation and the operations of Keppel are run by Keppel itself.",1,148,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00148

2018-01-08-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Third, would the Senior Minister of State not agree with me that the money earned by KOM through illegal and corrupt means are highly improper, and would the Senior Minister of State not agree that the dividends paid out by KOM who knew very well that its earnings were derived from bribing people and political party in power would also be deemed illegal, and would then need to be clawed back from members of senior staff, Board of Directors past and present, and the only way to ascertain the amount is through a forensic audit?

Let me just go back to my original answer, which I hope will be clear. I said how the Public Prosecutor decides will depend on several factors; so not just one factor but several. It includes the culpability of each individual, the available evidence, what is appropriate in the circumstances, the knowledge of each individual, the extent of his involvement, his motivations, any personal benefits he obtained, the circumstances under which relevant acts took place and any cooperation rendered. So, it is not a single factor; it is a whole array of factors which the Public Prosecutor will have to take into account.",1,158,2018-01-08-T-004-S-00158

Healthcare professionals play a key role in providing quality care that is appropriate to patients' needs and charge reasonable fees for their services.

I would like to clarify with the Senior Minister of State regarding the fee benchmarks which MOH will roll out soon. Do they include the total bill, with breakdown into the components such as the doctors' fees and facility fees? Part of the public concerns has to do with the facility fees charged by the hospitals, which have been increasing quite a fair bit recently.",1,173,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00173
2018-01-08-T-005,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"The second clarification is on my last question asking whether these benchmarks will cost doctors who are charging lower fees now, to up their fees instead. So, we are worried that there could be a knee-jerk reaction.",2,174,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00174
2018-01-08-T-005,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Indeed, the concern about healthcare fees is not only about doctors' fees. It is about the overall healthcare cost. So, this will include doctors' fees, but it would also include facility fees and other components of the overall healthcare cost that patients, insurers, taxpayers and Government, on the whole, will have to pay.",1,175,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00175
2018-01-08-T-005,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"We focused on doctors' fees for a start because these were also the recommendations of the Health Insurance Task Force. It made a report and recommended that fee benchmarks focused on professional fees in the first instance. For other fees such as hospital charges, Dr Lim is aware that we currently publish the facility fees for common procedures. If there are ways that we can present the information better to allow the members of public, to allow patients to have more information to make comparisons, we would be happy to receive feedback on how we can do better. We will also continue to monitor if benchmarks for other healthcare-related services will be required in the future.",2,176,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00176
2018-01-08-T-005,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, the fee benchmarks, by themselves, will not be a silver bullet to address healthcare cost. I mentioned in my reply that we also need collective effort from all stakeholders – providers, institutions need to focus on improving productivity, improving appropriate care. Recently, we set up the Agency of Care Effectiveness (ACE) and they issued some guidance on appropriate care guides, drug guidances. These are ways to help medical professionals, patients and care-givers to identify what are the cost-effective treatment options. So, ACE will also be looking into medical technology guidance this year to guide the selection of clinical and cost-effective medical devices.",3,177,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00177
2018-01-08-T-005,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),I thank the Senior Minister of State. I am presuming he was also answering Question No 13.,1,178,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00178
2018-01-08-T-005,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,I meant to ask for Mr Deputy Speaker's permission to answer both Question Nos 12 and 13 together. I apologise for that.,1,179,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00179
2018-01-08-T-005,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,I have three supplementary questions. The first one is  what other sources of information or expertise would the Ministry be using to ensure the independence of the benchmarks other than the Advisory Committee?,1,180,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00180
2018-01-08-T-005,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,The second question is  how would the Committee be involving the patients because they are not organised into associations or any other kind of bodies?,2,181,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00181
2018-01-08-T-005,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,The third question would be  what would the Ministry do to prevent insurers from using the benchmarks to reduce the payouts or to reject legitimate claims?,3,182,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00182
2018-01-08-T-005,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"I thank Assoc Prof Goh for his supplementary questions. I think it is important for us when we do the fee benchmarks, to have representation from all stakeholders – the professionals, the professional bodies and, of course, from patients, consumers. We want to be able to reflect different perspectives as we set the benchmarks. These benchmarks are meant as guidelines, as references. When insurers refer to these benchmarks, it is not something that prevents them from treating each claim on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the merits of the case and certainly, if it is within the appropriate guidelines, insurers, I am sure, would continue to be able to fulfil their obligations to their policy holders, in accordance with the terms of their insurance products.",1,183,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00183
2018-01-08-T-005,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Going back to the earlier point that Dr Lim raised with regards to the concern that some doctors may, as a result of this, raise their fees. I certainly hope that would not be the case because I believe that the large majority of our doctors have their patients' well-being and concern at the foremost, and that is what they want to focus on.",2,184,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00184
2018-01-08-T-005,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"But, of course, the benchmarks would help us to identify the small number of doctors who overcharge. This is information for us to be able to use, for patients to use, for insurers to use and for the authorities, including the Singapore Medical Council, for them to be able to take action and prevent the small number from raising healthcare costs for everyone else.",3,185,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00185
2018-01-08-T-005,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,I agree with the logic of representation. The question is  how do you select the patients? Because it is not really organised as a body.,1,186,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00186
2018-01-08-T-005,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, we have groups like the Consumers' Association of Singapore. We also have groups that can represent different stakeholders. It would not be possible to represent every single individual, as I am sure Assoc Prof Goh would agree with me. But to have the input and perspective from patient groups, from consumers, certainly, I think that would be something that could be taken as part of the process.",1,187,2018-01-08-T-005-S-00187
2018-01-08-T-006,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked  the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can provide an update on the number of e-scooter accidents and near-misses in 2017 involving pedestrians on footpaths and walkways; (b) what avenues for redress or compensation are available for pedestrians injured in e-scooter accidents; and (c) how awareness of the relevant laws can be enhanced among e-scooter and electric bicycle users of (i) local and (ii) foreign origin.,1,188,2018-01-08-T-006-S-00188

2018-01-08-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,There were about 30 reported accidents involving pedestrians and Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) including e-scooters on public paths from January to September last year. We do not have statistics on near-misses.,1,192,2018-01-08-T-006-S-00192
2018-01-08-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA will step up efforts to prevent accidents through enforcement and education. Last year, LTA issued more than 1,700 advisories for unsafe riding behaviours. Offenders will also pay fines once the Active Mobility Act comes into force soon. LTA is working with 800 Active Mobility Patrol volunteers to conduct regular patrols in their communities and also to share safe riding practices.",2,193,2018-01-08-T-006-S-00193
2018-01-08-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA will soon be conducting a campaign to raise awareness of the active mobility rules and penalties.

In response to the growing use of PMDs, the composition sum of $100 will be increased to $300 and $500 for offenders who ride on local and major roads, respectively, from next week, January 15. Repeat offenders will face stiffer penalties including court action. If convicted, offenders face a fine of up to $2,000 or imprisonment of up to three months or more.",6,197,2018-01-08-T-006-S-00197
2018-01-08-T-006,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister for his reply. I have got two supplementary questions. Firstly, regarding near-misses, would Minister feel it is beneficial for residents who have been involved in the near-miss to make it known to LTA and the authorities, so that we can draw lessons from such near-misses which may herald more serious incidents in future?",1,198,2018-01-08-T-006-S-00198
2018-01-08-T-006,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Secondly, would his Ministry continue studying or perhaps reviewing whether we should introduce some form of compulsory insurance for device owners, especially where the potential of harm from an accident from that device is higher than other device types? The reason I raise this is  some of my residents are worried that when an accident occurs, there could be a double financial tragedy. The injured party is injured, has medical bills, the person riding the device may be of limited means and unable to provide compensation even if the Civil Court finds him or her liable.",2,199,2018-01-08-T-006-S-00199
2018-01-08-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, I thank the Member for both suggestions; I think both are reasonable and good suggestions. I have actually asked the Active Mobility Advisory Panel chaired by my colleague, Assoc Prof Faishal Ibrahim, to review the code of conduct and practices governing AMDs. We have now almost a year of experience and in the light of that experience, we should see what other rules we should introduce, rules we should tweak or toughen.",1,200,2018-01-08-T-006-S-00200
2018-01-08-T-006,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Some of these suggestions, I am sure the panel will take into account as well, including insurance, wearing of helmets, and whether we should register e-scooters. We have started registering e-bikes, so, whether there is a case to also register e-scooters. I do not think we should be registering all scooters or all bicycles but I think those which are power-assisted, therefore potentially can incur greater harm, there may be a case of some sort of registration. I leave it to the panel to review this.",2,201,2018-01-08-T-006-S-00201

If my memory serves me well, it was in January or February, and the clip that was put up of certain exchanges, there were certain bits removed. It was actually communicated with Mediacorp and through the correspondence, they actually made the rectification and put up a different clip. So I think that was resolved quite amicably"", unquote. I was asked to clarify my remarks later in that day.",2,205,2018-01-08-T-007-S-00205
2018-01-08-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I acknowledged that I could have recalled certain facts incorrectly about an exchange with Mediacorp that had occurred in February 2017, nine months earlier.

Secondly, whether and how videos are edited, which was also clarified by the PQ in that and if there is editing insofar as that means the arrangement of parliamentary exchanges into the clips and so on, but not verbatim editing of exchange within a particular clip.

The central agencies, which are the Public Service Division and the Ministry of Finance, together with the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and Ministry of Communications and Information, recently did a comprehensive stock-take of all these Acts. This Bill will reduce and minimise this unevenness, with a view to institutionalise a clearer and more consistent governance framework for Statutory Boards.

For example, Statutory Board salaries are benchmarked to the talent markets they compete in, and we do not expect every Statutory Board to pay exactly the same salary or to have the same salary scales. But it would be imprudent to allow Statutory Boards to have an absolute free reign in setting salary packages.

For example, when we drive, our location data is aggregated with the other drivers, shared with an app company to generate real time traffic condition maps and to guide our travels. The Public Service is also using data to better serve the public, in two ways. The first, is to better provide front line service.",37,267,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00267
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"One good example is MSF’s Social Service Offices (SSOs).

2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Another way to improve public service is to use data for analysis and to develop policies and programmes. For example, Government agencies are using the Enterprise Data Hub (EDH), a central repository of business entity data, to better understand industries and companies, bring about better analytical insights, and improved support strategies for industries and businesses. In the case of MOE, we can put together data on past education attainment, family background, jobs and careers to better understand the relationship between education and careers.",40,270,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00270

2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, the Bill provides the bases for data to be shared between public sector agencies. Specifically, there are seven purposes supporting public interest, under which data can be shared under the direction of the Minister. This is backed up by amendments to the Civil Service’s internal guidelines to further elaborate the conditions for sharing. In gist, identifiable personal data is shared when services need to be better delivered to the individual, while non-identifiable data is shared to improve policy analysis, planning and formulation.",43,273,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00273

The requesting agency is using the data, but yet the owner is responsible and accountable for the security of the data. This Bill will correct this asymmetry and makes clear that it is the user who will be accountable for the protection and safeguarding of data passed to them. So, it will actually enhance data security and safeguards.",44,274,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00274

Exemption is due to the function of the Statutory Board and the context in which they operate. For example, the National Council of Social Services is unlike regular Statutory Boards in that its main functions focus on developing the capabilities and representing the interests of the voluntary welfare sector, and serving as a bridge between the Government and the sector. As such, NCSS functions more autonomously from Government than regular Statutory Boards and is exempt from the requirement to obtain PSC’s concurrence in the appointment, removal, promotion and discipline of its Chief Executive.",47,277,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00277
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Another group of Statutory Boards, like the Singapore Medical Council and the Land Surveyors Board, serve mainly to self-regulate the professional standards, training and conduct of their respective professions. Their core functions relate to the exercise of professional judgement on licensing particular persons to practise as a professional in a field. The Governing Boards therefore comprise registered practitioners of relevant professions with autonomy to exercise professional judgment. Hence, the Minister has a smaller role to play in their work and the PSC is not involved in the appointment or the removal of their Registrars.",48,278,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00278
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Related to this, I will later move amendments at the Committee stage to bring the treatment of People's Association (PA) more in line with that of similar Statutory Boards. The text of the Bill currently exempts the People's Association from  one, the power of the responsible Minister to give directions to the Association; two, the role of the Governing Board and responsible Minister in appointing the Association's Chief Executive; and three, the requirement for the Chairperson to sign the Association's audited financial statements. We had originally given the exemptions due to the unique constitution of the PA where the Prime Minister is the Chairperson while the responsible Minister is the Deputy Chairperson. But we have since relooked the exemptions and decided to have consistency in PA's governance with the other Statutory Boards. The only remaining exception is that volunteers who serve on PA's committees will not be subject to the protection as well as the offences that relate to public servants under the Penal Code, for the simple reason that they are volunteers.",49,279,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00279

Let me provide some background. Article 21 of the Constitution states that the President must, in exercising her statutory functions, act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, except as provided by the Constitution. However, the text of two sections of the PSC and LSC Act is inconsistent with this because it states that the President can exercise her discretion to permit the communication, publication and disclosure of information relating to the Commissions' work, which should not otherwise be disclosed. This inconsistency exists because the PSC and LSC Act was enacted in 1956 before the Singapore Constitution was enacted in 1963. Article 162 of the Constitution requires any law pre-dating the Constitution to be brought into alignment with the Constitution. Hence, we are taking this opportunity to amend the PSC & LSC Act to remove the phrase ""acting in his discretion"" from two sections of the Act. This will not affect the President’s powers, and we have consulted the President’s office before proposing to streamline our statutes.",55,285,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00285

2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Too often, many give up on these schemes or benefits because of the long process and when data and document sharing becomes onerous. The family situation for those in need is not always so straightforward – family members may be difficult to locate and sometimes family members are also estranged. An example involves Government assistance schemes that need salary declarations to determine household income, but the Government may already have had some salary information either through income tax declarations or CPF contributions.",7,294,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00294
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I ask that officers handling such sensitive cases for welfare, housing and health subsidies, be given greater access to data to make decisions more easily, and more importantly, to reduce the burden on the residents to keep providing updated statements and data every few months when assistance needs to be renewed.",8,295,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00295
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand that the sensitivities as explained by the Minister earlier on, of allowing officers to see such salary data and declarations are indeed sensitive for the families. Thus, I have a suggestion. Can the Government work on a points-based system to determine the eligibility of citizens for various schemes – similar to what we do for credit scoring. So, systems can work in the background without having to reveal exact numbers to officers. So, in a sense, you go to the back end, get certain data, churn out a formula and therefore a score comes out to say whether a resident is eligible or not eligible.",9,296,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00296
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"So, officers making the assessments will see some form of points scoring to make it easier and quicker to approve one’s eligibility for a scheme. This will allow officers to make decisions without having to access actual data. For example, an agency can evaluate if an applicant’s household income exceeds the specified criteria through comparing CPF and/or IRAS data, without having to be given actual details which will breach some of our laws. If the system can compute such a formula, this will help reduce trauma and difficulties by the applicant and reduce the burden on the processing for help. This way, more citizens will get help more expediently and with much lesser stress.",10,297,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00297
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The second consideration is the possibility of achieving cost effectiveness. In the sharing of data and making Government processes more efficient, would such services not become cheaper for the relevant agencies and, consequently, the public? I am not just talking about direct cost savings but also indirect savings in terms of netter allocation of resources, achieving optimal outcomes and leading to effective policy outcomes.",11,298,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00298
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"From the business point of view, for example, the amount of time and resources companies spend in administrative filings, whether for taxes, specific permits and licences or manpower quotas, can be drastically reduced through the sharing of data among Government agencies. So, I understand MyInfo is a good platform and I hope that more can be done, but also not in terms of pre-filling forms, when we were to carry forward some of these application data that was previously submitted.",12,299,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00299
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In recent years, we have heard of many businesses attributing the low take-up rate of Government schemes and grants to complicated and long-drawn processes of such applications and reporting. Hopefully, we will see businesses more encouraged to do so now in light of easier data sharing among agencies, so they do not have to keep repeating their applications across agencies.",13,300,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00300
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Last, but not least, the importance of taking concrete steps towards being a truly Smart Nation. Data and, more importantly, the insights that can be garnered from it – are proving to be critical and significant in this digital era. Companies and governments around the world are increasingly leveraging on data to serve their customers and citizens better, and Singapore should leverage on such capabilities to improve and enhance policy making. After all, if we are truly driving Singapore towards being a Smart Nation, then the Public Service should be incentivised to lead by example.",14,301,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00301
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I support this initiative to further our use of digital technology under our Smart Nation initiative, in areas that can better our lives, such as making our public transport services more efficient and enhancing our access to healthcare, amongst others.",15,302,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00302
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"However, acknowledging these benefits, I would like to share the concerns I have on this Bill based on feedback gathered on the ground.",16,303,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00303
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The main concern some have on this move is the perception that ""big brother"" is watching. How does the Government plan to assure citizens that they are not actively being tracked? While governance and transparency are areas to keep in mind, we need to be clear on whether the Government will make public on what datasets that the ""directing"" Minister has asked for across agencies, and what they will be used for. This is especially for datasets that will be used for proactive enforcement of citizens, if any, such as tax compliance or declarations.",17,304,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00304
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"My other concern is the erroneous or non-updated data on an individual or business which could work against them when used by the Government to approve applications for schemes and services. With this Bill, an outdated or erroneous data is now transmitted across multiple agencies. So, how can a citizen or a business find out whether the data that the Government has on them is actually correct and if they can self-update easily, without the hassle of checking from agency to agency?",18,305,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00305
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Also, given that Government officers now have access to a full suite of data, which, put together with reasonable deduction, may lead to market or sensitive insights and the possibility of what some may call ""insider trading"" for use of information for personal gain. Will there be measures put in place for such officers to declare interests beyond the grade ones that the Minister shared earlier, and holdings of investment and properties? Will the Government also consider stronger penalties for breaches of data access or leaks so as to create stronger deterrents?",19,306,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00306
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"While the Bill covers penalties for data leaks, I do have concerns that in recent years, we have seen AGO reports where data and systems controls remains a concern for some agencies. So, what additional measures will be put in place in terms of data security? Once data is leaked, even if we can penalise the officer, there is no retrieving the data back. So, I would like to know how the Government plans to balance security, governance and accessibility of data.",20,307,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00307
2018-01-08-T-012,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"If these concerns are addressed, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am confident that the Bill brings greater convenience and efficiency to Singaporeans and the public service. As such, I support the Bill.",21,308,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00308
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Public Sector (Governance) Bill makes interesting reading. According to the long title of the Bill, it seeks to provide for a consistent governance framework across the public bodies and to support the whole-of-Government approach to the delivery of services. To this end, the Bill has several aspects.",1,309,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00309
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"On the one hand, it aims to standardise certain policies and practices that cut across the different public sector agencies, such as personnel matters, governance and managing conflicts of interests and financial administration. These are set out in Parts 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill. More critically, Part 2 prescribes the accountability relationships between Government Ministers and the public sector agencies. These accountability provisions set out how Ministers should interface with public sector agencies which wield significant state power over Singaporeans on daily basis. How should Ministers behave and what are the boundaries that Ministers should not cross. I shall focus my speech on this aspect of the Bill.",2,310,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00310
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, clause 3 of the Bill states that one of the Bill's aims is to, and I quote, ""clarify the accountability relationship between public bodies, their members, their responsible Ministers and the Government."" As one would assume that the Government will not legislate without course, I would ask the Minister to explain why it is necessary to clarify in explicit legislation the accountability relationships between the Ministers and the public sector agencies. Are Ministers or the agencies confused about their roles? Why legislate rather than issuing guidelines on this? Is there concern from the Public Service officials that they are being subject to political pressure from Ministers?",3,311,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00311
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Part 2 of the Bill talks about Ministers issuing directions to agencies. However, the word ""directions"" is not defined. I note that under clause 9, it is provided that the directions may take the form of a circular or instruction or order. But clause 9 says that the directions may take such a format, not that they must take such a format. Is it safe to assume then that directions have to be in writing and signed or authenticated by the Minister? Can the Permanent Secretary, for example, sign off? Is there anything prohibiting directions in the form of emails or going further, can directions even be oral?",4,312,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00312
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),Part 2 envisages two types of directions from Ministers – directions for whole-of-Government approach and directions to certain Statutory Boards regarding functional responsibilities.,5,313,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00313
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, directions on whole-of-Government approach. Under clause 4, directions for the whole-of-Government approach will only relate only to a pertinent subject matter. These pertinent subject matters are restricted to five areas as set out in sub-clause (3). First, employment, management and discipline of employees. Second, management of official documents. Third, financial and resource management and accountability. Fourth, use or development of IT. And fifth, data governance and sharing.",6,314,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00314
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Such whole-of-Government directions are to be issued by, I presume, the Prime Minister's Office or the recommendation of the Minister-in-charge of the pertinent subject matter. In addition, the directions can only be issued for the purposes set out in clause 4(2), such as securing economies of scale, efficiency of public programmes, ensuring business continuity and managing financial risks. Overall, I welcome the thought process behind clause 4 and the implied reminder to Ministers that directions should not be issued for extraneous purposes.",7,315,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00315
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, I move to directions to Group 1 Statutory Boards. The second type of directions are to be issued under clause 5 to specific Statutory Boards on the performance of their specific functions. The Statutory Boards in question are listed in the Schedule to the Bill under Group 1A and Group 1B of the First Schedule. These bodies total 50 in number and include major public functions that affect the lives of Singaporeans across the Board, for example, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, the Central Provident Fund Board, the Housing and Development Board, Land Transport Authority and Public Utilities Board. I also understand from the Minister that he would be moving an amendment in Committee to include the Group 1C public body, namely People's Association under clause 5 as well.",8,316,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00316
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Clause 5 states that such agencies' specific directions are to be issued by the Ministers responsible for those agencies. Implied here is a drawing of a line that other Ministers have no authority to give instructions to agencies not under their charge concerning the agencies' functions. In this regard, it would be important to understand the spirit behind this provision. According to the Explanatory Note, there are currently inconsistencies and this clause will help to avoid duplication of laws. Could the Minister give an illustration of this problem so that one can better understand how clause 5 will help?",9,317,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00317
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, I move on to limits on Ministerial directions. This is contained in clause 11, an all-important clause which seeks to limit the Minister's powers to issue directions to public sector agencies. Clause 11 provides that the Minister's directions must not be contrary to written law. A Ministerial direction is also not binding if it would impede or affect the performance of a statutorily independent function of a public sector agency or a quasi-judicial function of a public sector agency in a particular matter.",10,318,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00318
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To enable greater public understanding of this point, can the Minister give some examples of such functions? Earlier, I believe he mentioned the courts which are an obvious example but it would be helpful if he could mention other examples.",11,319,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00319
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Furthermore, should there be a doubt as to whether a direction from a Minister is contrary to law or tantamount to an undermining of that body's independence or quasi-judicial function, how will such an issue be resolved? Who should the public sector agencies complain to?",12,320,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00320
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, clause 11(3) goes further to say that Ministers are not authorised to direct any public sector agency or any public body or public officer to perform or not to perform a particular act with respect to a particular person or persons. I have a few queries about this.",13,321,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00321
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, the clause is very widely worded as there is no definition of what sorts of acts are contemplated. Read literally, does this mean, for example, that henceforth, a Minister cannot direct a Statutory Board to scrutinise the accounts of a particular company? Does this mean that Ministers cannot instruct Ministries or Statutory Boards to issue specific media releases affecting particular persons? Next, which agencies are protected under this clause from Ministerial abuse?",14,322,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00322
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Clause 11 says that Ministers cannot issue the offending directions to public sector agencies which is defined in clause 2 to mean Statutory Boards listed in Groups 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule, a Ministry or department of Government, an Organ of State, or a public officer or person as gazetted by the Minister. Public bodies are also mentioned in clause 11 which means it protects all Statutory Boards, even those not listed in the Schedule.",15,323,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00323
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To be absolutely clear, does clause 11 apply to the Public Service? We just define to include the Armed Forces, the Civil Defence Force and the Police. Are these considered departments of the Government, and therefore, public sector agencies for the purposes of this Bill? This is important because if clause 11 applies to the services, a Minister would not be able to direct them to take particular actions, for example, to direct the Police to arrest a particular person.",16,324,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00324
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Third, Sir, while these restrictions on Ministerial directions are impressive on paper, they appear to me easy to circumvent. For instance, what is there to stop a Minister from speaking to a public officer on the side to get such things done, thus bypassing the prohibitions in clause 11?",17,325,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00325
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, Sir, according to the Explanatory Note, clause 11 is there too, and I quote, ""ensure that the public sector, like the Singapore Public Service, does not become politicised."" This sounds well and good on paper and there also seems to be an assumption that the Public Service is not politicised. But with the public sector that has known only one ruling Party for nearly 60 years, how we entrench a culture of political neutrality of the civil service in substance? How do we achieve depoliticisation in reality?",18,326,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00326
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"For instance, buried in our Statute Books is a piece of legislation called ""The People Association's conduct and discipline rules"". These rules expressly state that, I quote, ""Every employee shall refrain from engaging in party political activity and shall maintain complete reserve in all matters of party political controversy.""",19,327,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00327
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Besides this, I believe there are similar pronouncements elsewhere. But are these quotes being observed on a daily basis? Are the Ministers themselves all mindful of letting public servants do their jobs professionally and not putting them under political pressure?",20,328,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00328
2018-01-08-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, let me conclude. This Bill is an attempt to entrench the relationships of accountability and demarcate out-of-bounds markers for Ministers vis-à-vis the public sector agencies. That is certainly a good thing. The Workers' Party welcomes this development, after nearly 60 years under the same ruling Party. Nevertheless, as I have said, I have some doubts and concerns about how the Bill will be operationalised and what appear to be gaps that may allow the Bill's intentions to be circumvented.",21,329,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00329

2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In Singapore, we have a history of public servants moving on to take up roles in politics immediately upon leaving the Public Service, primarily by joining the ruling Party and serving as Members of Parliament or Ministers in the PAP government with little or no break in between. There would always presumably be some public servants who possess the necessary ambition, aspiration and willingness to seek to exit the Public Service and join politics and perhaps to become a Minister or even Prime Minister one day.",4,348,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00348
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"So as to increase their chances of successfully joining the ruling Party and becoming Members of Parliament or Ministers, such public servants may try to second guess what their Ministers would like them to do. Even in the absence of any explicit instruction from a Minister to do the said act, they may then just go out and do it. The intended goal of such a strategy may be for that individual public servant to be looked upon favourably not just by his or her Minister but by the leadership of the ruling Party in respect of consideration for being fielded as a ruling Party candidate in the next election.",5,349,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00349
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not arguing that this necessarily happens today but it is something that may happen in the future. My focus is on the principle and managing future risks. To be sure, there would be nothing illegal about any public servant attempting to pursue such a strategy and this law does not change that. But is it healthy for Singapore for such a culture to become widespread? After all, becoming a Minister is an attractive career option for a high performing public servant as it means taking on the role of the boss under which he or she ultimately serves.",6,350,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00350
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"So, the incentive for such a culture to grow is there. And if such a culture takes root in the future, it would mean that the public service would become partisan and eventually and inevitably be seen by the public as partisan which would be a terrible outcome not least in terms of attracting and retaining good public servants who have no wish to be partisan or to eventually enter politics.",7,351,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00351
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"To be sure, the risk of subordinates second guessing their boss and doing what their boss wants in the absence of a formal explicit instruction is not new. In fact, it is a risk that has been noted for centuries in the context of all kinds of organisations.",8,352,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00352
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I will cite one famous example from history. There is a sentence attributed to a former King of England from the 12th Century, Henry the II. He was supposed to have said in the council of his senior advisors and noblemen, ""Will no one rid me of this meddlesome Priest?"" – referring to Thomas Becket, the then-Arch Bishop of Canterbury, with whom he have had repeated conflicts. This was not a direct order, but it is said that upon hearing this comment, four senior knights attending the meeting then went on to kill Becket in one of the most famous political assassination of medieval times. I cannot, of course, attest to the historical veracity of every part of the story but it is a story that has been told through the centuries to illustrate the perils of subordinates in any organisation second guessing their boss and taking actions that they think may please their boss and even perhaps going to greater extremes than their boss would have thought necessary.",9,353,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00353
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"So, this problem is not a new one, and not specific to any organisation or context. So, how do we prevent a culture of ambitious public servant second guessing their bosses and take partisan but legally permissible actions which may over time tend to erode the reputation of the Public Service for non-partisanship?",10,354,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00354
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I would like to make one suggestion here, which is to impose a mandatory time gap between when an individual leaves the Public Service and when that individual enters politics. In the debate on the Banking Act, I had asked then, coincidentally Minister Ong Ye Kung as well, if such a mandatory time gap, referred to in that context as ""garden leave"" or a cooling off period, existed for MAS officers who wished to resign from the MAS and join the financial institutions. He confirmed that such a mandatory time gap existed.",11,355,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00355
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The analogy here with what I am proposing is not perfect but it is useful to note that there is a precedent for such a mandatory time gap proposal. Imposing a mandatory time gap between when one can leave the Public Service and when one can join politics – say, three years – would give pause to any ambitious public servant who might seek to read their political masters' mind and do their partisan bidding unasked, so as to facilitate their chances of joining the ruling Party as an elected politician. He or she would know that they would need to find employment outside the Public Service in the private sector or not-for-profit sector for some years before joining politics.",12,356,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00356
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Hence, there would be a period of time when they would need to find alternative employment and the fruit of their partisan action or actions could not be reaped immediately. And with the passage of time, the memory of their acts in the Public Service and their links to their former political masters may become more attenuated thus further reducing the motive to commit such acts in the first place.",13,357,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00357
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Imposing a mandatory time gap may send a signal to aspiring public servants that if they choose to second guess their bosses and speed the path to a Ministerial post, the link between their actions and the hoped for results will be weaker than it is now. It may cool the ardour of such public servants to second guess their boss and act for him or her.",14,358,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00358
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),Such a rule would also have other benefits than the one I have mentioned. It would ensure that future Members of Parliament and Ministers from the civil service would need to have private sector and or not-or-profit sector experience prior to becoming Members of Parliament and Ministers.,15,359,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00359
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The relative lack of such experience in the Cabinet has often been bemoaned by experts and commentators. In Singapore's first Cabinet, upon the attainment of self-government, the proportion of civil servants was far, far less than in the Cabinets that followed.",16,360,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00360
2018-01-08-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),And the period of time during the mandatory time gap would also allow them an alternative form of employment to give them the time and space to reflect if they really do want to enter politics. So that those who eventually do take that step may prove to be more committed to that pathway. I hope that some form of mandatory time gap can be considered for ex-public servants seeking to join politics.,17,361,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00361

Apart from being contained in the Statutory Board's constituent Acts, there should be no question as to whether or not there is an obligation to do so. The same can be said perhaps of requirements of information sharing, disclosure of certain interests, and submitting budget estimates on time.

Although the Personal Data Protection Act does not apply to Government agencies, I understand that there have been constraints in the sharing of personal data between public bodies due to the Government’s own data policies.",1,406,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00406
2018-01-08-T-012,Chia Yong Yong,Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member),"From a social service perspective, data sharing has advantages. From the perspective of a client, data sharing enables multiple public bodies serving the same client to construct a holistic profile for more timely and relevant intervention and support. Data sharing equips public bodies to anticipate the on-boarding of a client, prepare the relevant support, and to monitor the progress of a client or of a former client. This will enable public agencies to provide further intervention and further support. It also saves the client time and effort in having to produce the same information to different public bodies at different times. These are some of the advantages from an individual's perspective.",2,407,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00407
2018-01-08-T-012,Chia Yong Yong,Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member),"For public bodies, data sharing enables public bodies to develop more holistic profiles of the clients and their needs, thereby informing policy-making in the planning of services, in the delivery, through analytics and research. It enables public bodies to better understand the trajectory of the clients, which would improve the planning of the respective downstream and upstream services and interventions.",3,408,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00408

There are, however, a number of concerns, one of which being how members of the public do not fear the sharing of personal data. We are very happy to give our identity card number for lucky draws. We do not realise that the giving of such important pieces of information for not so critical functions or purposes can do a lot of harm to us.

There seems to be a lot of power vested in the Minister to decide on the removal of the Chief Executive from the public sector agency.

2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),This Bill has set out some aspects of this nature but I would like to highlight three areas for consideration by the public service.,6,478,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00478
2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"One, encourage a more positive culture and accountability. With the many years of public service in Singapore, it is undeniable that a positive working culture does exist. Through my interactions with the agencies, I have worked with good-minded public service individuals who go the extra mile for the community. But we need more such individuals. Given the complexity of projects moving ahead, we need even stronger cooperation and coordination between the inter-agencies, from planning to implementation. Less silo is absolutely necessary.",7,479,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00479
2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"For better implementation, it will be best when one of the agencies can take the lead and be responsible in any joint project. It is critical for clear accountability, and necessary should there be no revolving doors. This is also equally applicable to Government-linked Companies. Public service workers should be encouraged to give their best of ways and not worry that their actions are not the usual approach. In public service, it is the results and the positive impact on the community that matter and not the process.",8,480,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00480
2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Increasingly, there are more challenges that we will encounter which may never be prescribed or previously documented. We need the working level in the public service to be empowered and supported to take such initiatives. There is no absolute right or wrong approach in the public service. Each needs to be tried and adapted to the needs of the target group for their purpose. This is also the spirit that we are trying to promote in schools and inculcate in our young to try and know that it is okay to fail. Certainly, there is more than a single approach or solution to every challenge, and not trying but leaving things to status quo will make us worse off in the long run.",9,481,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00481
2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Let me cite a typical example of common public works where accountability, open communication and effective communication between the agencies and community are important. I am sure many have heard that to enable a better first- and last-mile connectivity, LTA has put up covered walkways within 400m of MRT stations. By default, the walkways will cover the different exits of each MRT station to the immediate surrounding pathways.",10,482,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00482
2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),What happens if one of the pathways to be covered is not a frequently used route by pedestrians? Or what if it is known that there are future works currently in planning that may be required this covered pathway to be taken down within a short time after it is installed. Should the works still proceed as the contract has been awarded or should it be partially deferred for future?,11,483,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00483
2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"On the same note, some of the works involve various agencies as it encompasses matters ranging from underground utilities to the trees. Without proper cross-coordination in its implementation, the disamenity created can be huge and constant. With better co-ordinated planning and implementation between these agencies, I believe we can look forward to reducing wastage of resources. With that, I mean finance, time and workers. Additionally, this can enable the lead agency to have the ability to stop or re-prioritise projects if the objectives or needs have changed.",12,484,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00484
2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"To be accountable for public services, we need the courage to pull the plug or make changes as projects progress and not continue when the final impact on the public is less than desired.",13,485,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00485

2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"As our population ages, how can we encourage more of such initiatives to assist the elderly to age within our community? For more effective outreach, there will come a point when it is difficult for the Ministries to roll out more programs on the ground solely with internal resources, especially if it requires intense, frequent follow-up with the individuals. How then can we harness external resources, for example, the ground-up voluntary groups, the VWOs, beyond the Ministries to assist the needy and vulnerable in our society without infringing their privacy through sharing of data, knowledge or relevant information?",18,490,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00490
2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"With this said, I do recognise that individuals’ privacy and wishes must still be respected and honoured. Thus, any changes to enable the inter-agencies, voluntary groups and individuals and the community to collaborate must be built upon the fundamental principle of personal choice as set out in the PDPA.",19,491,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00491
2018-01-08-T-012,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Three, partnership with citizens. With time, our society has become more plural and diverse. It is a fact that we have to embrace and adapt our policies to. Governance is no longer restricted to the public sector. It requires our citizens to be a part of the process.

The quantity of programmes is a poor indicator of quality and effectiveness of outreach. At times, it competes for the same pool of resources.

Likewise, we too hope our citizens play their part as we build our nation. Be encouraged to volunteer, build a sense of ownership and belonging for Singapore and fellow citizens, demonstrate active citizenry, and, therefore, they should have the options to embark on this journey with us sooner.

2018-01-08-T-012,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),I stand in support of all the provisions and amendments to the Bill but would like to urge the Government to pay special attention to two key aspects which I feel are at the heart of corporate governance. They are  quality of leadership and transparency in the area of accountability.,3,504,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00504
2018-01-08-T-012,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our Statutory Boards are very well run and led by strong CEOs.

2018-01-08-T-012,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Our statutory board CEOs have stellar pedigrees. Yet some are not, in my view, given the opportunity to fully test their potential in their brief stints at the various Statutory Boards. In some sectors, these CEOs – and members of their leadership teams – are rotated perhaps a little too frequently. From a civil service career perspective, this may be intended to expose and stretch these leaders in a variety of sectors and experiences. However, there is concern that in some sectors, a two- or three-year stint might not provide enough time for a CEO to fully understand the industry and to build a strong corporate culture and governance ethos. In certain sectors, might we consider a longer stint for CEOs? Perhaps feedback from industry and SMEs in the various sectors could be used when deciding on leadership and succession.",5,506,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00506
2018-01-08-T-012,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Indeed, there will be some leaders who will be exceptional in whichever industry they may be placed, but such leaders are few and far between, even in the corporate world. By and large, leaders need time to understand the industry, its people and culture. Leaders could spend up to three years to fully comprehend the complexities of the sectors they operate in, before they can even begin to make an impact. As we were informed late last year, the CEO of SMRT is still grappling with internal culture issues, this, after five years on the job!",6,507,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00507
2018-01-08-T-012,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Each time a Statutory Board CEO is rotated, it’s like hitting a reset button  industry leaders would have to rebuild relationships, and re-orientate each new CEO; and SMEs in the industry would have to start building the relationship from scratch, again. And as good as the new CEO may be, there will be industry initiatives that are left in limbo while he or she comes up to speed. For a good six months to a year, things would not move, because it is not just the CEO who is learning the ropes. It is also his or her management team, because these appointments would also be rotated, though at different times.",7,508,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00508
2018-01-08-T-012,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"What we need to avoid, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a mentality that these rotating appointments are treated as a rite of passage that would lead almost automatically to bigger and better things.

We want leaders who will observe the spirit and principles of good governance outlined in this Bill. But beyond this, we must aim to groom leaders who will shape the future of good governance, leaders who will have the industry insights, experience, relationships, perhaps some ""battle scars"" to speak from positions of credibility, respect and trust.

2018-01-08-T-012,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, beyond this, there is also room to consider making the accountability of leaders more transparent to the public. Leadership begins from the top. I feel that the boards of Statutory Boards should also be made more accountable for the performance of the entities they lead. For if we are to truly embrace private sector practices – and not just borrow chunks that we might deem useful – we must also hold our boards and CEOs accountable when statutory boards run afoul of corporate governance.",10,511,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00511

However, it is not always clear what becomes of the errant leaders and Boards that were in place when these mistakes were made. This leads to unwarranted speculation that leaders are just rotated to another Statutory Board or government position. Perhaps a little more transparency over Board and leadership appointments, as well as leadership performance, is warranted.",11,512,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00512

2018-01-08-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I have comments and queries on one fundamental aspect of the Bill. The bulk of the clauses in the Bill apply to the ""Singapore Public Sector Agency"", the term excludes the ""Public Service"", defined to include the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Civil Defence Force, Singapore Civil Service, Singapore Legal Service and Singapore Police Force, effectively limiting much of the scope of the Bill to cover only ""Public Bodies"" and ""Singapore Public Sector Agencies"".",3,518,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00518
2018-01-08-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"As illustration, clause 4(1) confers powers on the Minister to give directions to all Singapore Public Sector Agencies. This principle behind clause 4 is to enable a whole-of-Government approach in implementation of policy. Hence clause 4(2)(g) specifically qualifies that such directions can only be made for purposes of supporting a whole-of-Government approach. In this case, then it seems logical and consistent to ensure clause 4(1) applies to the Public Service as well.",4,519,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00519

2018-01-08-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I understand that all organisations, public or private, have hierarchical structure and contain layers of structures.

2018-01-08-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Applying this line of logic, I foresee a possible rationale for the exclusion of the Public Service – on justification that these five agencies exercise very specialised powers and fulfil very specific, critical functions within our society such that their constituting act already contains provisions allowing Minister to directly make directions, or an informal tight governance framework may currently be in place, or that these five agencies need the flexibility and autonomy to have room to exercise discretionary powers.",9,524,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00524

I would like to ask if the record of offences in each of the enforcement agencies and across all agencies and Ministries, such as URA and HDB parking offences, are actually consolidated and, if not, will it be consolidated with LTA and the Traffic Police's records of each individual? Similarly, will his or her records with other enforcement agencies or Ministries, such as NEA and MOM, be consolidated?",4,530,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00530
2018-01-08-T-012,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Overcoming the challenges posed by the current walls between Government departments is one thing. How about between Government and non-Government entities? More often than not, there are many exchanges and overlaps between information and data held by Government agencies and non-Government related bodies. These include information which have to be requested from or extracted from private entities. An example of such situations are medical records.",5,531,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00531
2018-01-08-T-012,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to know, how does the Government intend to ensure the cooperation of private entities in providing access to such information?",6,532,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00532
2018-01-08-T-012,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"For example, what is the progress in getting private medical practitioners to share their consolidated patient records with the Ministry of Health, which is necessary for better health care management of patients? In addition, in situations where Government bodies have to provide information to private entities in order to enable certain transactions and the provision of certain goods and services, how would the Government ensure the safety and privacy of such information?",7,533,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00533
2018-01-08-T-012,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"A recent study found that nearly half of IT professionals have sought information they were not permitted to access. The personnel guilty of this are the very ones charged with keeping the information safe – the information technology staff. This can happen in both Government and non-Government entities. I would like to ask what strategies do we have in place to plug this gap in our cybersecurity measures. With that, I conclude with my support for the Bill.",8,534,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00534

2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Members for your support and your questions. There were quite a few questions citing specific clauses and sub-clauses, and fairly technical. I will try my best to answer them all.",1,536,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00536
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me start by addressing questions from Ms Thanaletchimi and Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan, who asked broader questions and philosophical questions about governance in the Government.",2,537,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00537
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Thanaletchimi is right to say that there is a balance between central control as well as getting our Statutory Boards to have flexibility and autonomy and creativity and innovation. And this is a balance that we have to strike between effective governance, policy consistency on one hand and operational autonomy on the other hand. It does encourage innovation and creativity.",3,538,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00538
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"It is the same when a manager runs a department of a few people. You want to give the staff the space to take initiative, run with it, work with different people, but they are still your staff. And you meet them once in a while to give them support and direction. Every year, it is good HR practice also to do appraisal and coach them on their development. And, when something goes wrong, you still have to answer for the staff as department head.",4,539,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00539
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, the same principles apply to Statutory Boards. The responsible Minister is answerable to Parliament for the performance of the Statutory Board.",5,540,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00540
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,The powers to give directions to the Statutory Board and to approve the appointment of the Chief Executive (CE) are in line with this accountability to Parliament.,6,541,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00541
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But for operational matters, it is better for Statutory Boards to have autonomy, tapping on board members. And I agree with Mr Ganesh Rajaram  the Board members can do more and be more active in helping the governance and running of the Statutory Board and ensuring that the Board members are from different backgrounds, experience and skills that they can bring to the table. These are the layers that we have to put in place to make sure a Statutory Board is run well.",7,542,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00542
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In answering to Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan, this Bill is really not in response to any Government lapses, incidents or confusion on the part of public servants, or that there are instances where Statutory Boards refuse to comply with a Government direction. The purpose is two-fold. I have mentioned some of it in my Second Reading speech.",8,543,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00543
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"One, for the lack of a better word is really neatness, really just neatness. Today, we have over 60 Statutory Boards operating in an increasingly complex and disrupted environment, facing challenges that no single agency can tackle alone. The continued need for Statutory Boards to be governed well and work together to provide better public service is all the more pressing.",9,544,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00544
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The central agencies therefore did a stock-take of the all the Statutory Board Acts. And they found that, of the governance provisions that are important to uphold to sustain good governance, not all were uniformly present across all Acts. Specifically, on the clause for Ministers to give direction, they are present in all Acts but they are written slightly differently with different conventions. There are no good reasons why they are different, other than they were written and passed at different times in history. So, we centralise them into one central Act. It is now clear, transparent, neat, and should we find the need and justification to amend them in future, the amendment will also be transparent and more effective.",10,545,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00545
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Where there are substantive changes from today, I have highlighted them in my Second Reading speech. One, is that we are making it explicit that part of the work of the CE of a Statutory Board is to collaborate with other public agencies. This is new. Not that they are not doing so now. They are already doing so, but we are now hard-coding this, and in so doing, make our direction clear. Two, is the setting up a data sharing regime that I spoke about.",11,546,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00546
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan specifically asked if the term ""CE"" is a new one mentioned in the Bill. It is not new. It does refer to the CEO and the apex job within the Statutory Board.",12,547,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00547
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Ganesh Rajaram asked about the tenure of the CEO and whether postings are too frequent. It is a point that we constantly have to wrestle within the Public Service. It is really not part of this Bill but we do have to balance between someone staying long, having the experience and stability, but at the same time, they can get entrenched; versus bringing in somebody new perspective and innovative ideas. We constantly have to juggle both. And what the Member raised, it is a pertinent point and we will continue to consider this very carefully.",13,548,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00548
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I agree with Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan that the broader point is that our system of governance must be one that allows us to constantly work together, recognise problems and improve. What we do not want is a culture of witch-hunt and blame. It does not improve things. Our approach has always been to look honestly at our flaws and focus our attention on improvement. And I think this is the culture we want.",14,549,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00549
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Chia Yong Yong said Public Service goes much beyond just running day to day. It is much beyond efficiency but also about service to people with kindness and humanity. So likewise if we want to bring about such a culture, it goes beyond legislation, but also ensuring that the ethos, the spirit is in every single Public Service agency and that culture and that ethos are upheld. Most important of all, to uphold this are the leaders, leaders across the various levels of the Public Service, the type of people we bring in, how we make them work together, learn from each other and uphold the values. We will continue to place great emphasis on this.",15,550,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00550
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me now move on to a topic which is better coordination across Government agencies and sometimes, even within a Government agency. This is raised by Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, Dr Intan and Miss Cheryl Chan. Various examples were given.",16,551,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00551
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I agree it is important to coordinate well amongst public sector agencies as challenges become more complex. This Bill actually sends a strong signal on the importance of cross-agency coordination. For example, the Bill clarifies how the Minister charged with the responsibility for the public sector can work with the relevant Ministers to give directions to Statutory Boards relating to central policies. And that, second, the chief executives of Statutory Boards now, by law, have to cooperate and collaborate with other public sector agencies to deliver public value.",17,552,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00552
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As to how to ensure strong coordination between agencies and reduce wastage, I think all agencies simply need to work harder, eyes open, ears up and be more creative, more innovative, more citizen-centric. That is a point that Miss Cheryl Chan and Dr Intan have both raised. And we have seen many such improvement projects. For example, Masterplanning Committee coordinates infrastructure projects. There is a OneMap platform. I downloaded it. It is very useful. It allows 80 agencies to come together on a single platform to provide authoritative location information and services.",18,553,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00553
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We will welcome more suggestions from Members. Some of the examples that you mentioned are coordination within the departments and they simply need to sort them out. But they are really outside of this Bill – and you do not need this Bill to have them sorted out. But in my capacity as Minister helping out with the driving of public sector innovation, if you observe any of these, please let me know and I will be most happy to take them up.",19,554,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00554
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me now move on to various technical clarifications. These are raised by Mr Louis Ng, Ms Sylvia Lim, Ms Chia Yong Yong and Dr Intan.",20,555,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00555
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, the Bill does not prescribe the form of directions. It should not, as Acts that are overly prescriptive rapidly get out of date. Given the purposes for which directions may be given and the subject matter they are to cover, the form of directions will likely be in formal instruments.",21,556,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00556
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned two types of directions. First, as she correctly said, are really central Ministry issues − governance issues concerning HR and Finance. These typically come in the form of circulars and they are signed by the Permanent Secretaries.",22,557,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00557
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second are policy directions. I would say the Bill does not prescribe this, but the typical way the Ministries work − for many years and decades, that is how they work − is that there is brainstorming between Political Office Holders and staff, including Statutory Board staff, because we have to take into account implementation issues. When it is all discussed and we have certain consensus, staff papers are put up with all the views, considerations, options and recommendations incorporated, and many angles covered. Then, it goes to the right forum. It could be a Minister's staff meeting. For bigger issues, they might go to the Cabinet. Decisions are made, and then conveyed through notes of meeting, through to the Statutory Boards, and then it is followed up that way. It has been done this way for years. For those coming from the private sector, this is quite a big adjustment. In the private sector, documentation is not done so diligently. But trust me, nothing in the Civil Service is decided through WhatsApp and, worse, through emoticons.",23,558,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00558
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me talk about clause 4. It is merely an extension of the principle in clause 5. I think a Member asked about it. Statutory boards are already complying with the Government's central policies today, and clause 4 gives this legislative backing.",24,559,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00559
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Louis Ng asked about the scope of the Bill. Simply put, the Bill is written such that the provisions apply by and large to the Singapore public sector agency, and the singapore public sector agency is broadly defined to include Ministries and departments, Statutory Boards and Organs of State. The Civil Service, SAF, SPF, SCDF, Legal Service are all part of Ministries and departments. So, the governance requirements of this Bill apply to them. There are many references and definitions in this Bill, so it is a bit confusing to read. I put on record, the governance requirements of this Bill apply to them. Likewise, the protection under clause 11, which Ms Sylvia Lim asked about, extends to every Singapore public sector agency, too. So, the Member's reading is right.",25,560,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00560
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"However, for certain clauses, Civil Service, SAF, SPF, SCDF and the Legal Service are excluded, because they are already formally subject to central policy governance requirements that are before this Bill. For example, these agencies have to comply with Government Instruction Manuals. For the appointment of the head of Ministries, that is, Permanent Secretaries, the Constitution already provides a framework where appointments are made by the President, acting in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister, from a list of names submitted by the Public Service Commission.",26,561,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00561
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Dr Intan asked about removal of the Chief Executive (CE); that, indeed, is not a small matter. Although the Bill does not spell out the exact processes, but for a CE, the apex post of a Statutory Board, to be removed, that is a serious matter and, certainly, a lot of consultation, even before that, if it is for performance-related reasons, coaching, counselling, that all has to take place. That is only good HR practice. So, rest assured. Even removing a public service officer is a serious matter, what more a CE.",27,562,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00562
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Ms Chia Yong Yong asked a specific question whether PA is to be exempted from clause 40. The answer is that the effect of the Notice of Amendment will be that PA is not exempted from it. It will apply to the PA.,28,563,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00563
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Faisal Manap asked about financial related provisions that pertain to MUIS − I think clauses 34 to 41. While MUIS is, indeed, exempted from these provisions of the Bill, it is not exempted from similar financial administrative requirements because all these requirements are currently already spelt out and covered by MUIS' constituting Act, namely, Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA). We decided there is no need to duplicate them in this Bill.",29,564,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00564
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Now let me move to the topic of clause 11. Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Chen Show Mao and Mr Leon Perera asked about this.",30,565,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00565
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me explain how clause 11 came about first. Clause 5 standardises the power of responsible Ministers to give directions to their Statutory Boards, and clause 4 formalises the requirements for Statutory Boards to comply with central policies. And clause 11 of the Bill presents safeguards to limit the effect of these Ministerial directions. So, why is clause 11 needed now?",31,566,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00566
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The legal requirement to abide by Ministerial direction is not new at all. It is found in the constituting Acts of most of our statutory boards. But with this Bill, we have a separate and centralised legislation to provide for this. So, it becomes necessary to have clause 11 to make it clear that Ministerial direction does not trump other provisions in the statutory board legislation. It is a very logical thing to do for legal officers drafting this Bill.",32,567,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00567
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,There are a few key points to this clause,33,568,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00568
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, the Minister's direction cannot be inconsistent with written law. For example, the Minister charged with the responsibility for Government records and archives − a point that Mr Chen Show Mao asked about − can direct statutory boards to comply with central policies on the treatment of public records. But these policies must be consistent with the provisions in the National Library Board Act on the role of the National Archives in the treatment of public records. For example, the Minister’s direction to the Singapore public sector agencies cannot authorise the destruction of public documents without the authorisation of the National Library Board, much less destroy a particular archival document. To do so would be inconsistent with the National Library Board Act.",34,569,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00569
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, the Minister's direction cannot impede or affect the performance of statutorily independent or quasi-judicial functions. Ms Sylvia Lim asked for further elaboration on this.",35,570,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00570
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"A statutorily independent function is a function which is required by law to be performed independently. The obvious example is the exercise of judicial functions by the Judiciary. But we also have Statutory Boards like the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, the Maritime and Port Authority or the Info-communications Media Development Authority. They are vested with the discretion to issue or revoke a licence based on criteria set out in their own legislation.",36,571,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00571
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for a quasi-judicial function, that is a function expected by the law to be discharged, taking into account the facts of the case. Some of our Statutory Boards have those powers. For example, a disciplinary committee constituted under the Estate Agents Act has the power to decide if there is sufficient cause for disciplinary action against an estate agent ""according to the circumstances of the case"".",37,572,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00572
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Third area of safeguard, the Minister’s direction should not be specific to a case. So, clause 11(3)(b) prohibits any Ministerial direction to secure an employment, a promotion or a termination of any particular employee of a Singapore public sector agency. For example, a Minister cannot direct the award of a procurement contract to any particular tenderer, because that is specific to a case or a person; or to license a particular applicant; or to employ a particular person. And for that matter, he cannot ask the police to arrest a certain person, and I hope Ms Sylvia Lim is not suggesting that this is happening. In fact, the Police Force Act makes that quite clear. It is the SPF that has the powers to apprehend offenders. So, if you look at the Skills Development Fund (SDF) fraud case that happened which I answered earlier, I am flabbergasted. I want the culprits to face the full consequences of the law, but I cannot ask the police or anybody to arrest them. We report through SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) to the police, the police investigate, and if they deem fit, the police arrest them. That is the way things have been done and will be done.",38,573,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00573
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Having said that, in my years of public service, I have not come across an impasse between Ministers and public servants on this point. If there is, a public servant who feels any pressure from Ministers can report to their Permanent Secretary, or to the Head of the Civil Service, even the PSC, or even CPIB, if the case warrants it, and I am sure they know how to follow up.",39,574,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00574
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me just elaborate this a bit. Ministers handle MPS cases. And I would say, in a typical month, Ministers would have handled hundreds, maybe even thousands, of individual cases coming to us. Each is appealing for a licence to be given, for an employment pass to be given, or whatever the case may be. And the discipline all these years has been we write them down as appeal cases, lay out the facts of the cases, send them back to the Ministries, the staff still process them based on the grounds and the circumstances of the case. But, ultimately, they have to run the individual appeal cases through the system to be processed.",40,575,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00575
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, clause 11 merely puts a longstanding and existing practice into law. However, let me highlight this. If a Minister comes across a case that highlights the deficiencies in a system, or an act that should be illegal turns out to be legal, then there is a flaw in the system or in the law. Then, it is incumbent upon Ministers to review and improve the system, together with the agencies under his charge.",41,576,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00576
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me touch on a point that Mr Faisal Manap specifically raised about what is the definition of being politicised. I think for civil servants to be politicised in the context of this Bill means to be specifically put under pressure to decide on a specific case. That is being ""politicised"" under this Bill.",42,577,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00577
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Faisal Manap then went on to talk about a certain Advisor. I assume it is a constituency that the Member knows, that a certain candidate lost and then continued to operate on the ground. But, really, based on the definition I gave this has nothing to do with this Bill. If there is any specific complaint that the Member would like to raise, he could raise it with our Deputy Chairman of PA, Minister Chan. He has mentioned in this House before, that the role of an Advisor has to be very clear. It is to serve the community, it is to foster cohesion in the community. If they overstep into politics and the Member has reasons to believe so, then please raise it with him. I am sure he will look into it.",43,578,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00578
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Leon Perera gave a narrative about civil servants who have aspirations to be Ministers, therefore, they second-guessed the Ministers to be in their good books and, in the process, become partisan and, therefore, should we not impose garden leave for civil servants that decide to enter politics? I think there are many problems with what he said.",44,579,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00579
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, second-guessing is now a bit of a dirty word. But if you think about it, in all our work, we do have to anticipate what are the needs of our customers, what are the needs of the people we work with. It is very reasonable for civil servants not to be sycophantic but to understand what is the Ministerial direction, what is the agenda of this Government, how is it shaping up, what are the key priorities, and able to work with the Ministers to develop policies in those directions. Do you call that second-guessing? I mean, if you want to put it in a negative sense, it is up to you. But I think there is value for public servants to do that. And for that matter, for anyone working to do that. And I think consultants, too, have to anticipate and maybe second-guess their customers. This is what real life is. And whether they then become partisan, I hope the Member is not suggesting that civil servants are partisan because the conduct and ethos of civil servants are articulated clearly in the IM, that they cannot be politically pressurised.",45,580,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00580
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"They have to act neutral and in the interest of the public. Therefore, do we then have garden leave for civil servants who then go on and maybe join politics? And you draw the analogy with the financial sector.",46,581,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00581
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The circumstances are totally different. In the case of Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the financial sector, MAS is a regulator, whereas the regulatee is a commercial profit-seeking entity. So, to prevent a conflict of interest, we do not want an MAS officer to be offered a job by a regulatee while he is still at the job at the regulator. Therefore, you have a garden leave so that you minimise the chances of that happening. Garden leave is widely practised across financial regimes in the world. When we come to the Civil Service and Political Office Holders, neither one regulates the other, and neither are commercial profit-seeking entities.",47,582,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00582
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Member felt that a garden leave will help the civil servant think more carefully before joining politics. I think anyone, not just civil servants, joining politics today thinks very, very deeply about it, and spends a long time deliberating that with their families and friends before they are prepared to come in. It is really a calling, as you would know.",48,583,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00583
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me now move on to data sharing. Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Chia Yong Yong asked about data sharing, the scope and the benefits.",49,584,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00584
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,The data sharing directive seeks to strengthen the rules that enable and govern cross-agency data sharing within the public sector. There are two main areas of improvement. I have mentioned this in my Second Reading speech.,50,585,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00585
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, the Bill provides the bases for data to be shared, and there are seven specific public purposes, as stated in the Bill. These will translate broadly into two kinds of initiatives.",51,586,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00586
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"One, better delivery of services to the individual. This will inevitably have to involve sharing of identifiable and personal data, and Mr Patrick Tay asked for some examples.",52,587,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00587
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Improving social assistance programmes or removing repeated filling of forms when applying for Government programmes. I spoke about this during the Second Reading speech.,53,588,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00588
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Where feasible, as Mr Zaqy Mohamad has suggested, specific details need not be shared if they are not needed for the task. For example, when you apply for financial assistance, data can be shared between other agencies and the processing officer, and they can come in the form of whether do they meet or not meet the criteria, and not necessarily tell you how much they earn. That can surely be done and it will be a good practice.",54,589,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00589
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"It can also involve not personal data, but information that each agency holds, which, when put together, offers much better value, such as One-Map which I mentioned earlier.",55,590,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00590
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The second benefit for data sharing is better policy analysis, planning and formulation. This will involve sharing of anonymised, non-identifiable data.",56,591,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00591
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For example, when deciding where to build certain facilities, we want to understand the concentration of different segments of Singaporeans. There is no need to know personal details in this instance. So, to decide whether to build a senior activity centre, for example, the relevant agency only needs to know the aggregate number of seniors living in the block or in various precincts.",57,592,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00592
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"It can also be about correlating data to derive deeper policy insights. There is an immense amount of work we can do here, to better understand the relations, say, between family backgrounds, education experiences, careers, employment, health, social security, so that we can formulate better policies to address our challenges. However, to do so, raw data from various agencies need to come to a centre where they are matched and anonymised before release to relevant agencies for analysis. We intend to set up such centres where central oversight would mitigate the risks of failing to anonymise data.",58,593,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00593
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Let me talk about a point that Mr Zaqy Mohamad raised about privacy and big brother watching. This Bill is also in alignment with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). Public Service agencies belong to one Government. They need to share data and information with one another to best serve the public.,59,594,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00594
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,This Bill will significantly improve the protection and safeguard of such shared data.,60,595,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00595
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Beyond the fact that there are now clear bases for data sharing, there are four levels of protection.",61,596,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00596
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First level, it allows existing data sharing practices to be formalised, such as sharing identifiable information for service delivery and enforcement functions, and using only anonymised information for policy making and planning.",62,597,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00597
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second level, by articulating the responsibility of each party involved in the data sharing, it ensures that the same high level of responsibility for data protection is borne by all agencies. So, it is now clear that the agency that uses the data is responsible for protecting and safeguarding it. We will be able to redress the current misalignment of incentives, where the owner of data is still responsible.",63,598,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00598
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The third level is that information that is protected by specific legislation today, such as information under the Income Tax Act, the Banking Act and the Statistics Act, will continue to be protected.",64,599,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00599
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Four, criminal offences for three data-related offences are also introduced in the Bill to ensure individual officers are responsible and accountable for safeguarding information. This includes the unauthorised disclosure and improper use of information, and, specifically, the unauthorised re-identification of anonymised data.",65,600,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00600
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Bill did provide for the flexibility for re-identification of data. That is to deal with contingencies, such as when source agencies’ data is corrupted or destroyed. When that happens, re-identification of anonymised data may be performed in order to continue to deliver services to citizens.",66,601,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00601
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The purpose of the Bill is not to pave the way for a future where Government knows everything about everyone, and every misdeed everyone committed is all consolidated. I think there was a question by Mr Gan Thiam Poh. If ever there was such an initiative, it would have to be explained as to why and for what purpose and for what value. And decision making, be it for policy, licence or grant application, are all reduced to data processing and AI algorithm. That is not the future we want. In fact, it will be quite a sad state. If that happens, civil servants will all lose their jobs because we only need computers and software.",67,602,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00602
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, in response to what Mr Patrick Tay said, yes, there are algorithms in various software – which will be tested and audited − but when it comes to decision making, there must be human intervention, supervision and judgement all the time.",68,603,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00603
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Chia Yong Yong asked for greater clarity on data sharing initiatives. Members, I hope, will feel assured that, today, there is a high level of transparency and public discourse in policy implementation and public service delivery in Singapore. If there is a new service to be delivered, such as recently we hear that HDB has an initiative to halve the processing time for transaction of resale flats, it will be announced and how it will be done will be explained. And I read the whole explanation in the papers. For more significant initiatives, such as MOH's current initiative to set up a National Electronic Health Record system, they have to do this properly. So, a separate consultation is being held, new legislation needs to be debated and enacted in this House to protect the users of this system.",69,604,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00604
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"There is one more question by Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan. He asked when unauthorised data sharing may not be offence. The common law already permits sharing of information between public sector agencies where there is public interest. The Bill does not allow the data sharing direction to displace the application of common law, nor does the data sharing direction seek to do this. It will instead be providing the much needed practical guidance and certainty on what circumstances would be considered public interest without being exhaustive. So, while the Bill criminalises data sharing other than in accordance with the data sharing direction, clause 7(2) allows a defence where sharing is authorised or allowed by ""other law"". That ""other law"" is a reference to the common law. For example, it can be shared in order to respond to, say, a life-and-death situation of an individual or in times of a natural disaster or any kind of disaster where contact tracing is required.",70,605,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00605
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Miss Cheryl Chan asked about data sharing beyond the Public Service, to VWOs, for example. This Bill covers only sharing of data within the Public Service. It does not include the sharing of data with parties outside of the public service, such as VWOs, healthcare providers or private and commercial entities.",71,606,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00606
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But that does not mean today we do not share data with parties outside of the Public Service at all. We do so when there are clear justifications to improve the public service or to improve service to the public. For example, to help a student from a dysfunctional family, MOE has to work hand-in-hand with VWOs, Self-Help Groups or Family Service Centres, and, inevitably, personal data has to be shared with all these partners. Or we share aggregate data sets with research institutes to conduct research and analysis for the Government.",72,607,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00607
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Further, data shared with entities outside of the Public Service and designated for service delivery are bound by confidentiality agreements, with contractual terms that prescribe data protection requirements, and these entities are also bound by the PDPA and the Official Secrets Act. Volunteers are also bound by strict confidentiality agreements and educated on the appropriate use of the data.",73,608,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00608
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Specifically, on the sharing of medical data within the healthcare sector – again, this is beyond the scope of this Bill because restructured hospitals are not defined as part of the Public Service – MOH is embarking, as I mentioned this earlier, on the National Electronic Health Record initiative, consulting the public and tabling a Healthcare Services Bill to enable it to do so, to achieve better health outcomes and yet safeguard the interest of patients.",74,609,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00609
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Having said that, it is true that when this Bill is passed, the framework that governs the sharing of data within the Public Service will be improved and better than that for sharing with entities outside of the Public Service, specifically in areas such as the responsibility to safeguard and protect data. So, the framework will be available and set up for the Public Service but it will not be extended to sharing outside of Public Service. This is something that we should look at and we will review and consider if further legislation is required.",75,610,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00610
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked a question about data accuracy and verification. Accuracy of a citizen's personal data is critical for seamless service delivery. We will assign designated agencies to proactively verify and update specified personal data fields and share that across Government, so that all agencies’ databases are up-to-date and accurate.",76,611,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00611
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Government also relies on citizens to verify their own information. MyInfo, the platform mentioned earlier, allows citizens to amend certain personal information and this information will be shared for transactional services that the Government provides. This ensures that all agencies are using accurate information on the individual based on this latest update.",77,612,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00612
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Ms Chia Yong Yong and Mr Gan Thiam Poh also asked about storage and security. Government data is stored in Government systems which are protected against breach. More sensitive information, such as identifiable data, will be held in designated databases with even more limited access and additional protection. There are various measures we have undertaken to protect data.",78,613,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00613
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, controlled access and dissemination. Every civil servant/public officer can only access data he is allowed access to. Access rights will continue to be prescribed based on security clearance and data is only accessed when there is a legitimate purpose or need. The Government continues to calibrate IT security policies accordingly, such as having proper access control and the role-based access of data based on its classification. Deliberate unauthorised access of information is criminalised under other legislation, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA). It is also likely to lead to improper use or unauthorised disclosures of data which are new criminal offences under this Bill.",79,614,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00614
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Existing measures to ensure that public servants do not use privileged access to information for their personal gain will continue to apply. For example, all public servants have to declare annually their interests in investments and properties.",80,615,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00615
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For ex-public servants, the Official Secrets Act (OSA), already requires that they do not retain information once they leave service and they are culpable too, under the OSA, if they commit any data-related offence in this Bill. The provisions in the Protection of Secrecy Act remain valid and relevant for Statutory Boards and prescribed Government companies to abide by, and will be a complementary safeguard to this new Bill.",81,616,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00616
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, is to institutionalise our cybersecurity capabilities and that is done through the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), established on 1 April 2015, to oversee a new national cybersecurity structure, with the mandate to devise and coordinate national cyber security strategy and policy development, carry out both peacetime capability development and crisis management across all sectors and finally, adopt a holistic approach towards the management of information infrastructure.",82,617,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00617

2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I will wrap up. Third, Internet surfing separation. In May 2016, the Singapore Government decided that devices connected to Government networks would no longer be able to access the Internet, in order to strengthen the Government ICT systems and this was implemented in mid-2017.",1,619,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00619
2018-01-08-T-012,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Fourth, adopt best practices. This is obvious. And five, education, because the weakest link is always the human. We always need to educate every single officer on how to do the right thing so that cybersecurity breaches are minimised, and this must include the reporting of malpractices, as mentioned by Ms Chia Yong Yong.",2,620,2018-01-08-T-012-S-00620

2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Fifteen years ago, MAS enacted the Payment and Settlement Systems (Finality and Netting) Act (FNA) to address this problem. The FNA made provision for the protection of payment and settlement systems from disruptions that may generate systemic risks in the financial system. The FNA was designed to be technology-neutral, allowing MAS to designate critical payment and settlement systems regardless of technology used. A designated system consists of  first, participants, which are financial institutions; two, a settlement institution that maintains the participants’ accounts and settles funds, usually the MAS; and three, an operator to run the system, such as Banking Computer Services Ltd.",4,714,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00714

2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Since the enactment of the FNA 15 years ago, there has been a proliferation of faster payments systems with different settlement models and longer business hours. Taking these developments into account, the Bill aims to achieve the following  first, enhance the protection of payment transactions by extending the period during which transactions enjoy finality and hence, protect a wider range of transactions from insolvency law in a liquidation event. Two, set out clear criteria for MAS to designate such systems, and third, strengthen MAS’ administrative powers. The amendments take into account foreign and domestic developments since 2002, in the areas of insolvency protection and regulatory controls for designated systems. We have incorporated feedback from a public consultation exercise conducted in August 2017.",6,716,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00716

Such activities are currently regulated under two separate Acts – the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act and the Money-Changing and Remittance Businesses Act respectively. In November 2017, MAS commenced a separate public consultation exercise proposing to streamline the regulation of payment and remittance service providers under a single and new Payment Services Bill.

2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Currently, the FNA does not protect a designated system if it continues to process, net or settle transactions beyond the calendar day on which a participant becomes insolvent. Such transactions may be affected by the application of insolvency law and this poses financial risks to the participants.",10,720,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00720
2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The Bill introduces an amendment to mitigate this risk by extending insolvency protection of the key elements in a payment cycle – transfer orders, netting and settlement – by one business day beyond the day on which a participant becomes insolvent. This will cater to systems which operate in multiple time zones or where an insolvency of a participant occurs close to the end of a day and spans into the next day.",11,721,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00721
2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"For example, if on 2 January, a participant’s foreign parent bank goes into insolvency in a foreign jurisdiction at say 10.50 am New York time, that is same day 11.50 pm Singapore time. The operator of the designated system may be unaware of the insolvency of its participant’s foreign parent bank since this occurred outside office hours on 2 January, almost during bedtime. In a 24/7 payment system, transactions from the now insolvent participant would continue into 3 January, whereupon transactions from this participant would be settled. Without the amendment, the settled transactions on 3 January could be unravelled by liquidators since it is after the date of insolvency. This amendment will provide finality and added protection to the participants’ transactions.",12,722,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00722
2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),Credit risk arises when a participant pays out funds to customers in real-time but receives funds from its counterparty in interbank settlement on a deferred basis. An example is the Fast and Secure Transfer System (FAST) where customers receive funds immediately while the participants only settle with each other twice a day on weekdays. Such risks are mitigated by having participants provide collateral to the designated system so that these collateral can be drawn upon for settlement in the event of any default by a participant. The Bill introduces amendments to extend insolvency protection to designated systems which use collateral.,13,723,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00723
2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The Bill also introduces amendments to provide that an operator, settlement institution, collateral holder of a designated system or an officer or employee of such an entity will not incur liability for any act or omission which was done with reasonable care and in good faith in the execution or purported execution of any relevant function, duty or power under the FNA.",14,724,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00724
2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Second, clarity in designation. The Bill introduces criteria for designation, to provide greater clarity to the industry and stakeholders. Designation will focus on critical systems, where a disruption in the operations of such a system may transmit further disruption to its participants, or to the wider financial system or affect public confidence in other payment systems. MAS intends to designate FAST and NETS EFTPOS debit card system in 2018, as they meet the criteria for designation.",15,725,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00725
2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The amendments will also prohibit an operator or a settlement institution of a non-designated system from claiming to be an operator or settlement institution of a designated system. Holding out to be an operator or settlement institution of a designated system could mislead participants to think that there is statutory protection from insolvency law. The penalty will be a maximum fine of $100,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to two years or both.",16,726,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00726
2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Third, strengthened administrative powers. The Bill introduces amendments that will strengthen MAS’ administrative powers over a participant, operator, settlement institution and collateral holder. These include MAS’ powers to obtain information and issue directions to rectify outstanding issues. The participant, operator, settlement institution and collateral holder of a designated system will have an obligation to notify MAS in the event of a potential insolvency. The Bill will also introduce a requirement for a designated system to seek approval from MAS before rules which govern the essential roles, responsibilities and operations of a designated system can be implemented or amended.",17,727,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00727
2018-01-08-T-013,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In conclusion, this Bill will enhance the insolvency protection of designated payments systems.

2018-01-08-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to note that the amendments to the Bill reflect our endeavour to strengthen Singapore’s status as a regional financial centre as well as a fintech hub. They are also in line with the recent changes to the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill that I spoke on last year. These enhancements will ensure that our national systems and cross-border systems are further protected. They will enhance and promote systemic stability in the financial system as well as give MAS a more robust oversight. This will happen through improved stability of the key systems and a more secured cross-border system. For the banks and financial institutions, this means greater confidence and transparency, and greater readiness for collateral-based systems.",1,729,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00729
2018-01-08-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The amendments sees several significant changes which will translate into desirable outcomes. One of these changes is the penalty clause. Should key officers, including senior executives fail to take reasonable care or play a key part in the commission of offence, they will have to face the consequences. Holding key officers accountable is really important as according to CEO Today magazine, leadership shortcomings will often emerge as a principal underlying cause for bank failures.",2,730,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00730
2018-01-08-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next, with some more precise designation criteria, the industry and stakeholders will benefit from greater clarity. It will also prevent non-Designated Systems (DS) from making illicit claims of being a DS, which some are doing to benefit their business, but with the consequence of misleading, and disrupting systemic stability. This has become considerably more important, in light of another policy change concerning Designated Systems.",3,731,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00731
2018-01-08-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Currently, DS does not have any protection under the 2002 Finality and Netting Act (FNA), should they continue to process, net or settle transactions beyond the calendar day on which a participant becomes insolvent. This creates undue financial risks to the participants. Considering that more transactions are occurring globally on a daily basis for both commercial entities and individuals, and the nature of businesses that operate across multiple time zones, this risk is greatly multiplied.",4,732,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00732
2018-01-08-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The new amendments offer protection of transfer orders, netting and settlement is extended by one business day beyond insolvency day, providing certainty and finality to DS transactions. This will certainly be a welcome move for financial institutions. For the DS which utilises collateral as part of their netting and settlement processes, the introduction of collateral security and collateral holder will help extend further insolvency protection and mitigate credit risks.",5,733,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00733
2018-01-08-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Having said that I would like to raise some concerns regarding these enhancements. Can the Minister inform the House where would these changes take place for Singapore compared with other jurisdictions? By this, I mean to ask if any study or consultation has been done on the DS of other countries. The rise of fintech has brought about many new technologies and innovations that are vastly different from traditional financial methods in the delivery of financial services. How forward-looking are the enhancements in ensuring that transactions via these new technologies are adequately protected? These days, block chain technologies, crypto-currencies and QR-based solutions are growing in popularity. If these technologies are also covered under the amendments, then how does this reconcile with the prevention of illicit claims to be DS?",6,734,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00734
2018-01-08-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next, I also note that under the proposed amendments, MAS is to be exempted from certain sections of the FNA. Can the Minister elaborate further on this self-exemption? In what aspects of the insolvency law are carved out by virtue of the FNA?",7,735,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00735
2018-01-08-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The security of domestic operators of DS is another matter or aspect to consider. Banking Computer Services Pte Ltd handles the SGD Cheque Clearing System, USD Cheque Clearing System and the Interbank GIRO. And the settlement institution for the USD Cheque Clearing System is Citibank N.A., a foreign bank. What are the contingencies made in the case of insolvencies of a foreign bank in this instance, or for that matter, domestic operators such as Banking Computer Services Pte Ltd, should they be affected by other operational risks?",8,736,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00736
2018-01-08-T-013,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Finally, moving towards a cashless society means we should anticipate more sophisticated payment systems and it is important to constantly review the relevant policies. The Bill, when passed, will provide greater security and mitigate risks for the designated payment and settlement systems through systemic and prudential means, which would be a welcome move for financial institutions in Singapore. Sir, I support the Bill.",9,737,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00737
2018-01-08-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I stand in support of this Bill. Given the rapid development in fintech, we need to ensure our laws and regulations keep up.

2018-01-08-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I refer to the Consultation Paper MAS shared dated 3 August 2017 which listed the objectives of the amendments in this Bill.

2018-01-08-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In this Bill, I note that clause 9 which amends section 8 of the Payment and Settlement Systems (Finality and Netting) Act (FNA) does not prescribe the same degree of certainty as to whether a transfer order or any other transactions in section 8(1) list will be legally enforceable and binding on third parties as long as a transfer order or any other list of matters are entered before an opening of an insolvency proceeding. Can the Minister clarify why this is so?",5,742,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00742
2018-01-08-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Prescription of this timing is important to my mind, as cross-border payment settlement and netting seem especially vulnerable to insolvency laws in different jurisdictions.",6,743,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00743
2018-01-08-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I understand that this insolvency carve-out is dealt with in Clause 9 of the Bill, which amends section 8 of the FNA. Section 8 of the FNA states that transfer orders and the transactions in section 8(1) list ""shall not be regarded as to any extent invalid on the ground of inconsistency with the law for distribution of the assets of person on bankruptcy or winding up, or on the appointment of a receiver, receiver and manager or equivalent officer"".",7,744,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00744

2018-01-08-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"If so, can Minister further clarify if this may be opened to abuse in any way such as by a company disposing its assets even after commencement of winding up, contravening section 259 of the Companies Act by effecting transfer orders into DS?",13,750,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00750
2018-01-08-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Additionally, can the Minister provide specific examples for members and the public to understand the practical implications of these amendments, specifically the extension of insolvency protection for transfer orders, netting and settlement in a DS amendment?

2018-01-08-T-013,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Saktiandi asked if any study or consultation had been done on the designated systems of other countries. MAS studied a variety of jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, New Zealand and UK, to distil the best practices. The proposed amendments are also in line with international standards such as the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, set by the Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures of the Bank for International Settlements and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions. In addition, MAS consulted financial institutions extensively and drew on our experience administrating the FNA over the last fifteen years. With this Bill, MAS will be among other leading jurisdictions in the area of insolvency protection for designated systems.",2,757,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00757

2018-01-08-T-013,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The EU's regime takes a different approach from this Bill. It protects transfer orders that are entered into the system after the moment of insolvency provided that a central counter-party or clearing house demonstrates that they were not aware, nor should have been aware of the commencement of insolvency proceedings.",4,759,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00759
2018-01-08-T-013,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We have chosen not to emulate the EU Directive, but instead provide for a window – one business day – for transactions to be protected even after insolvency is declared. There are three insolvency scenarios envisaged by MAS that will require this. I have briefly mentioned one of them in my Second Reading speech but will elaborate.",5,760,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00760
2018-01-08-T-013,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, a system that spans multiple jurisdictions across numerous time zones, such as the Continuous Linked Settlement System which needs more than one day to settle transactions in a distress situation as the distressed participant may face difficulty paying its obligations, usually in multiple currencies.",6,761,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00761
2018-01-08-T-013,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, a system that originates transfer orders on the day of insolvency but settles the next business day. For example FAST transactions which occur on late Friday evening which will be settled between the banks only the next Monday morning – these transactions would now be protected.",7,762,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00762
2018-01-08-T-013,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Mr Ong Ye Kung,"And, as I mentioned in my earlier speech, a foreign bank branch in Singapore has its parent bank go insolvent close to midnight, Singapore time.

The Bill will ensure the designated system participants’ transactions – including the foreign bank branch’s transactions – are honoured and protected.",8,763,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00763
2018-01-08-T-013,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the EU’s case, the operator would have to prove that they were not aware, nor should have been aware of the insolvency proceedings. MAS has assessed that the challenges in proving this will create significant uncertainty which will defeat the very purpose of giving operators and participants certainty of finality of transactions, and then protect the system as a whole. Hence, we decided not to subject the operator to such a burden of proof, but instead provide for a short window where there is certainty.",9,764,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00764
2018-01-08-T-013,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Notwithstanding, there are safeguards to prevent abuse of this protection.

2018-01-08-T-013,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Saktiandi asked a pertinent question about the adaptability of the Bill to future technologies, especially given the robust developments in the payments space. The FNA is technology neutral and allows MAS to designate systems which meet the fundamental criteria for designation, where a disruption in the operations of such a system may transmit further disruption to its participants, or to the wider financial system or affect public confidence in other payment systems. Hence, as long the designation criteria is met, whether a system is based on block chain, QR code or biometrics, or something we have not seen, MAS will be able to designate the system. Designated systems will be gazetted and publicly listed on MAS’ website. This allows any consumer or business to cross-check the system’s legitimacy of being a designated system.",11,766,2018-01-08-T-013-S-00766

The regulation and supervision of payment systems fall under a separate Act - the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act or PSOA. BCS and Citi are regulated under the PSOA and thus, closely supervised by MAS. Both entities are required to have strong risk management controls in place to address key risks – such as credit, liquidity and operational risks. They also need to have business continuity plans and these are validated through industry-wide exercises.

2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"However, existing powers are not sufficient to protect the checkpoints in today’s security climate. For example, ICA officers are not able to search a person suspected of carrying an offensive weapon if he or she is not in the authorised area but is instead in public areas of Changi Airport, or at the bus-stop outside Woodlands Checkpoint. To be more effective, the powers have to be expanded so that ICA officers can intervene in any suspected security incident within or in the vicinity of the checkpoints. On the ground, this will allow any ICA officer nearest to a security incident at the checkpoints to be the first responder.",13,788,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00788

For example, Police officers today are not empowered to search suspected vandals even if surveillance cameras or other security sensors at the checkpoints have been damaged; the suspect must first be arrested before he can be searched. That is the existing law. Clause 4 will therefore expand and allow ICA officers and Police officers to search individuals if there is suspicion of the commission of any offence within or in the vicinity of the authorised areas.

2018-01-08-T-014,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"What kind of enhanced training will these ICA frontline officers be provided with in order to empower them? Will there be some form of psychological preparedness training, briefing and counselling that they would be put through as well?",4,803,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00803
2018-01-08-T-014,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"My concern is that police officers have been prepared for these types of work from the beginning of their career but these ICA officers may not.

Can the Minister elaborate on this a bit more for our understanding? Also, I feel that this ties in very well with this Bill’s implementation. Can the Minister explain how they will be synergistic in terms of Singapore’s preparedness as well, and how will it enhance to ring fence our safety and security?",6,805,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00805

How fast can information be shared and in terms of action, how rapid can the execution be when facing certain crises?

They would also be able to respond to incidents, conduct preliminary investigations and take steps to contain the situation when police officers are not yet at the scene. The Bill will also allow ICA officers to collect personal identifiers such as photographs, passport details and fingerprints.",2,809,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00809
2018-01-08-T-014,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"While the intent is to enable the Home Team to deal with security incidents at checkpoints more promptly by having ICA officers perform protective security functions in support of police officers, I have some questions on the expansion of the role of ICA officers and how they are being prepared to take on these additional duties. This is given that the ICA officers are empowered under this Bill to carry out search and seizure duties and arrest suspects for offences under any written law.",3,810,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00810
2018-01-08-T-014,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"First, the Integrated Checkpoints Command policy was launched in 2015 to achieve greater operational coordination, and provide clearer lines of responsibility and command for the officers from ICA, Singapore Police Force and Central Narcotics Bureau working together at the checkpoints, for example, faster operational responses and more successful interceptions of persons and vehicles of interest. With ICA officers taking on duties of the Police, how would this impact the lines of responsibility across the various elements of the Home Team in carrying out their work at our checkpoints?",4,811,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00811
2018-01-08-T-014,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Second, ICA officers are already dealing with large numbers of travellers daily while under expectations from travellers for timely clearance at checkpoints.

2018-01-08-T-014,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Third, a Direct-Entry Sergeant in ICA would have undergone a 16-week non-residential ICA Basic Course (Sergeant) at the Home Team Academy while a Direct-Entry Sergeant in the Police force would have undergone six months of residential training including lessons in criminal law, physical training, community policing, as well as leadership development. Males are required to be PES A or PES B1L1 in order to qualify as a Direct-Entry Sergeant in the Police force whereas only a PES A or B grade is required for ICA officers.

2018-01-08-T-014,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. The amendments provide greater empowerment to Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore officers critical in dealing with any cross border threats. In order to perform their duties better in their expanded role, the ICA officers need to be well trained in protective security, especially during emergency situations. With the enhanced responsibilities comes the need for up-skilling. As such, would the career path for ICA officers be similarly enhanced? Will there be a review of their career progression?",1,815,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00815
2018-01-08-T-014,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Second, it is commendable that the Integrated Checkpoints Command would be better equipped to deal with any checkpoint incidents with minimal delay.

2018-01-08-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We are giving ICA officers more authority to perform security screenings, conduct search and seizure duties, as well as arrests, and I think is a good move. With the relevant training that comes with these new duties, this will not only aid in improving security and efficiency, it can boost the officers' morale as they can carry out their tasks more efficiently. However, I note that when a suspect is arrested by the ICA, the ICA officer is required to inform a police officer of the arrest. And he has to wait for the arrival of the Police to hand over the suspect under section 51AA, clause 12. I would like to ask why this cumbersome procedure required. And why cannot ICA be given the authority to detain the suspect for investigation for more than 24 hours and carry out whatever investigations required if it is a simple offence.",2,822,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00822
2018-01-08-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"With the terrorism threat becoming more prevalent, Police and security forces around the world are shouldering heavier responsibilities to protect the community.

2018-01-08-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, my second question is in relation to investigation work. Can the Minister enlighten the House on the training for an ICA officer compared to a police officer? In regards to the enhanced powers for ICA officers, can the Minister also share plans to ensure that the officers have the pre-requisite training to handle the enhanced powers and search authority that they have now with these changes. This also includes the proper handling of individuals and suspects as part of the search but also taking into consideration the sensitivities and communication skills needed with the extra responsibilities.",4,824,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00824

2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, while I understand the overriding security necessity of responding swiftly to incidents at the checkpoints, allowing ICA officers to exercise certain Police powers are an expansion of executive powers, which should be done cautiously.",1,826,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00826
2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),We should thus closely scrutinise the powers this Bill gives to ICA officers to ensure that there is sound basis and sufficient checks for an extension of power.,2,827,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00827
2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"As was noted in MHA's press release on the Bill, the intention of giving ICA officers such powers is to enable them to respond to incidents and contain situations before police officers arrive. The powers that are granted to ICA officers should be constrained insofar as they are necessary for that purpose.",3,828,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00828
2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The amendments will give ICA officers the power to take statements from persons who appear to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the relevant offences.,4,829,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00829
2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The language of section 51AA(6) and (7) is similar to section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) which allows the police to take long statements.,5,830,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00830
2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Unlike section 23 of the CPC, the amendments do not expressly require persons being questioned to be given notice that choosing to remain silent may have a bad effect on their case in court.

2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"If so, is there a duty to inform the person being examined of their privilege against self-incrimination under section 51AA(6) and does the failure to inform the person of their right to remain silent affect the admissibility of the statement or the ability to draw adverse inferences from the statement?",7,832,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00832
2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Laypersons may not know that they have such a right and it seems only fair that they should be informed of this right if the privilege against self-incrimination is to have any substance. The right to remain silent under section 51AA(5) would be very weak in practice if there is no need to inform an individual of their right to do so. It is those who are ignorant of the law and the most vulnerable who would suffer the most.,8,833,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00833
2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Further, section 51AA(7) sets out requirements, which are intended to be procedural safeguards for the person's whose statement is taken. Will a failure to comply with the requirements under section 51AA(7) affect the admissibility of the statement?",9,834,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00834
2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Next, the exercise of police powers are governed by the CPC and the Police General Orders (PGO) issued by the Commissioner of Police.

2018-01-08-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"As highlighted earlier, these powers are only transitory in that they are intended for ICA officers to be able to contain the situation until the police arrives.

2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),There are three main facets of this Bill. The first is the expanded role of ICA officers. The second is the provision for the collecting of personal identifiers of transit passengers. And the third is the increased penalty for breach of regulations.,2,840,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00840
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The expanded role of ICA officers promotes synergy and collaboration of the Integrated Checkpoints Command (ICC).

One domain head at overseas operations of all Home Team officers in that domain, whether they be CNB, Police or ICA officers.",3,841,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00841
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This was a further step to optimise the organisation of our Home Team resources. Back in 2003, the ICA was born with the merging of Singapore Immigration and Registration and the Checkpoints Operations of Customs and Excise department. Today, this Bill seeks to confer certain Police's powers on ICA officers so that we are able to respond to situations promptly and effectively. This move in this Bill keeps our Home Team agencies nimble, flexible and able to address the changing needs in these changing times.",4,842,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00842
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The new section 51AA (1) and (2) under clause 4 of the Bill seeks to allow ICA officers to stop and search any vehicle, train, vessel or person or any aircraft for evidence of criminal offences being committed in or around the protected area. This includes security screening under subsection (4) of the new proposed section 51AA under clause 4.",5,843,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00843

Through prompter collection and preservation of evidence, an act or near the crime scene, there may be more evidence and more cogent, reliable and accurate evidence collected. It is hoped that this will greatly enhance the administration of justice in Singapore.",6,844,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00844
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Further, through the powers of arrest under clause 4 of section 51AA(8) to (10), ICA officers' presence at the borders will strengthen deterrence presence of the Home Team officers there. The procedure safeguards are in subsections (11) and (12), with subsection (12) playing an important signal that the Police are still primarily in charge of this policing duties. Subsection (12) requires the ICA officer to inform the Police immediately of the arrest and await the Police's arrival for handover, detaining the person in a suitable place for not more than 24 hours.",7,845,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00845
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As the ICA officers' powers are restricted to offences committed in the authorised area and its vicinity, an arrested person has to be ultimately handed over to the Police, the relationship between the ICA officers are clearly delineated for effective collaboration. Rather than abrogating from the Police's primary duty, these expanded powers further promote prompt and effective responses to a situation at our borders. Even with a strong uniformed presence near borders, there are some who still dare to commit offences in the area. ICA officers will be equipped through training and they will not hamstrung if they witness or have reason to believe that an offence is being committed before their very eyes. This supportive role will enhance the ICA's powers to protect Singapore and strengthen security at our borders.",8,846,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00846
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The second main feature of this Bill is the collection of personal identifiers from passengers transiting through our airport. What has happened in some countries previously is that illegal immigrants travel using forged documents, staying in the airport lounge to connect to their next destination. Alternatively, illegal immigrants cleared immigration using genuine documents but switch to forged documents or even took other persons' boarding passes inside the travel lounge. By collecting personal identifiers from those transiting through Singapore airport, it will be harder to commit identity fraud.",9,847,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00847
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Furthermore, there has been a proliferation of fraudulent documents that facilitate travel. It is not just boarding passes that can be faked. Lost passports and faked IDs have increased in number. As of July 2013, Interpol had nearly 38 million lost or stolen travel documents. According to Political article, EU passport fraud epidemic, or refers to EU passport fraud epidemic in January this year, the number of lost and stolen documents in the EU has doubled in five years. There are 250,000 stolen or lost Syrian and Iraqi passports, including blank documents – very easily utilised.",10,848,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00848

2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The collection of personal identifiers of transit passengers is now more common in today's increasingly globalised world. Such countries include New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates. Currently, travellers who remain in the transit area do not need a visa. Clause 55B which provides for collection of personal identifiers covers both those who remain in transit and those who apply for or hold a Singapore visa. This is needed. Such a provision is necessary and timely to ensure security in our airports and it should be implemented with the utmost care to stringently secure the information collected. If such personalised data gets into the wrong hands, the cure may be worse than the ill.",13,851,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00851
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As the number of travellers at our airports has been increasing, hitting the record 60 million mark last year, it is important that those who travel through Singapore for legitimate reasons not be afraid of the collection of important personal identifiers such as fingerprints and even irises. Rather, through stringent in high quality implementation, our position as a travel elite hub and Singapore's airports' reputation will grow stronger by being more secure and lowering possibility for identity fraud and a safer transit area.",14,852,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00852
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),We need to ensure that our security measures are tight and kept to date or even ahead of the technologies used by criminals to manoeuvre their way around the proper safeguards.,15,853,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00853
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Another feature of the Bill is the increased maximum penalty for breach or regulations. Originally set at imprisonment of six months or fine of $1,000, clause 5(C) of this present Bill increases it to imprisonment of two years or a fine of $3000. This update of the maximum penalty ensures that inflation does not rob the penalty of its punitive effect.",16,854,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00854
2018-01-08-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, this Immigration Amendment Bill is a welcome addition to the tools and the weaponry that our ICA officers need to secure effectively in these changing times. By empowering Home Team officers to respond promptly and by enhancing security measures, this Bill is a further step forward towards a synergistic and comprehensive against terror threats in Singapore. I therefore strongly support the Bill.",17,855,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00855
2018-01-08-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the ever-present threat of terrorism makes it imperative for us to find ways to boost the level of security in Singapore. Our Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints handle a high volume of people daily. During festive periods the numbers can go up to half a million a day. Changi Airport handled more than 50 million passengers last year, and looks set to increase its passenger load with T5 on the way. We clearly need to future proof our security coverage and provisions.",1,856,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00856
2018-01-08-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"With volume, potential perpetrators of harm seek vulnerabilities during busy periods. It is not merely a matter of volume. The nature and essence of threats evolve quickly. This makes timely and efficient intervention critical. With Singapore seeking to continue our position as a top transit hub, we must be at the top of the game with our security without losing our hallmark efficiency. This Bill widens the powers of immigration officers to search and arrest suspects for some offences, which currently come under the authority of the Police. Being at the frontline of security incidents, our immigration officers required powers to quickly intervene and resolve issues. Empowering them with greater authority will boost the level of safety and security, and be efficient.",2,857,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00857
2018-01-08-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"One important measure included in this Bill is to allow ICA to collect personal identifiers from travellers in transit at Changi Airport where necessary. This contrasts with the current situation where the information is obtained only from travellers at immigration counters. Transit passengers make up about a third of Changi Airport’s passengers. We cannot allow terrorists to use Changi as a transit stop. Yet, we cannot allow this extra layer of checks to cause transit passengers to encounter delay in the process of transferring from one flight to another. What measures will be taken to ensure that inconveniences are minimised, even as security steps are being increased, how is new biometric technology used to handle the increasing load?",3,858,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00858
2018-01-08-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"With increased responsibilities coming their way, we must also ensure that our officers are equal to the task. The law is after all only as effective as the officers using them. They must be trained to enhance their knowledge, skills and capability. How can SPF officers be involved in helping their ICA colleagues to take on the new powers? Inter-agency capabilities and operabilities are even more critical. We need to ensure that our officers operate well together as one unit.",4,859,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00859
2018-01-08-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Other than training on their “hard” skills that are directly related to their profession, are ICA and SPF officers provided with ""softer skills” such as Cultural Intelligence, as their job requires them to deal with people from different cultures and nationalities?",5,860,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00860
2018-01-08-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Another aspect of manpower and human capital, security work cannot be easily substituted with technology and enhanced legislation. Experience and street knowledge are essential elements built up over time. The Ministry must continue to leverage on such strengths of our officers, especially when more powers are vested in them to meet our ever-evolving security threats. This might require buttressing our competencies with experienced officers from SPF and other enforcement agencies.",6,861,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00861
2018-01-08-T-014,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Notwithstanding the above, the Bill is important to harden our borders without sacrificing on our efficacy and efficiency. Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.",7,862,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00862

2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Several Members asked about the Integrated Checkpoints Command (ICC). Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked for a further elaboration of the ICC concept, and how the Bill will enhance Singapore’s preparedness for emergencies. Mr Patrick Tay asked how the Bill will impact the lines of responsibilities across the various Home Team agencies working at the checkpoints.",2,865,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00865
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Under the ICC, the checkpoints are clustered into three domains, namely the Land Domain, Sea Domain and the Air Domain, which were progressively launched in 2015.",3,866,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00866
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"An ICA Domain Commander now helms all Home Team operations in each of the three domains. And so we have a unified command structure under a single commander. And with this, the lines of responsibility and as well as accountability are very clear and this will help in ensuring that the security and operations in each domain is properly taken care of. And by doing so, we have also strengthened the co-ordination amongst the officers from the various Home Team departments deployed at the checkpoints because there is a unified command structure.",4,867,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00867
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Another potential benefit of the ICC is in joint operations as compared to operations mounted separately by each Home Team Department. In fact, it did not take long for the benefit to be realised. In 2016, a joint operation at Woodlands Checkpoint detected four male Indonesian travellers who had plans to enter Singapore to make their way to Syria to fight for ISIS. The timely sharing of information and exchange of analyses made the critical difference. The subjects were eventually repatriated to Batam and handed over to the Indonesian counter-terrorism unit.",5,868,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00868
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef also asked about the coordination between ICA officers at the various checkpoints, and how prepared we are for a planned multi-site incident.",6,869,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00869
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Any terrorist incidents involving multiple checkpoints will be coordinated by the Police. This is again clear. The Home Team has developed joint operation plans for such scenarios and we have been exercising them. And some of these exercises were publicised earlier. For example, Exercise Northstar, held in October 2017 at Changi Airport, involved Home Team agencies as well as the SAF, MOH, Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Changi Airport Group. Exercise Quicksilver, which is a series of regular internal exercises, involves scenarios of multiple attacks at the land and sea domains where officers are not notified beforehand. In other words, it is a surprise exercise. One of these surprise exercises was held in October 2016 and it involved more than 3,000 officers across the Home Team and the SAF. So, it is a very large scale exercise.",7,870,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00870
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The aim of these exercises is of course to prepare ourselves to respond to security incidents as soon as possible. But I should stress that it is not just speed. It is also the quality and the effectiveness of the response that matters. And that is why we are making these amendments to ensure that when we respond, the response is an effective one.",8,871,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00871
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,All Members who have spoken felt it was important for the ICA officers to be properly trained to exercise the enhanced powers and I fully agree.,9,872,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00872
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Before I outline our training approach, let me clarify what is expected of the ICA officers under this Bill, something that Mr de Souza had also talked about. The ICA officers are not expected to become Police Officers. What this Bill seeks to do, is to empower ICA officers, who are usually the majority at the checkpoints, to respond to security incidents within and in the vicinity of the checkpoint. This will further enhance the ICC concept, where the nearest Home Team officers to a security incident at the checkpoint will be a first responder acting swiftly to mitigate the situation instead of waiting for the Police Officers to arrive.",10,873,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00873
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Once the Police Officers arrive at the scene, there is a clear understanding that they will take over management and investigation of the incident, including the recording of statements from arrested persons and working with the AGC to prosecute the person in Court. The training for ICA officers is therefore designed specifically for them to be the first responder rather than full-fledged Police Officers.",11,874,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00874
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"With this consideration in mind, ICA has been working with the Singapore Police Force (SPF) to develop appropriate training courses for ICA officers. We need courses for newly appointed as well as current serving officers who are selected to perform protective security functions. There are modules on the legislative provisions, management of protective security incidents, interview skills and search techniques. Classroom training is also complemented by on-the-job training with Police Officers serving as coaches, a point which addresses Mr Desmond Choo’s observation that the Police officers have much they can share to help ICA colleagues get up to speed.",12,875,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00875
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In addition, ICA officers will join Police Officers for relevant protective security training courses such as the Public Security First Responder Training, where officers are given tactical movement training to augment their existing competencies in firearms.",13,876,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00876
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,ICA officers will be assessed to a similar standard as Police Officers in these areas before they are deployed for protective security duties.,14,877,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00877
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Today, more than 900 ICA officers have undergone the training and ICA will progressively cover all those selected for protective security duties.

2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"During their basic training, ICA recruits already undergo psychological training to boost their resilience and prepare them for the challenges in their work. Frontline supervisors are trained on how to look out for distressed officers and to provide support. At the same time, selected ICA officers are trained as para-counsellors to look out for and support their fellow colleagues. The officers are further supported by the ICA Psychological Services Branch, which provides staff counselling services.",18,881,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00881
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As part of the ICC training programmes, ICA officers will be exposed to challenging situations that they may face in the course of duty, and trained on how they can respond to such circumstances. These range from managing security incidents such as travellers attempting to dash through without immigration clearance to dealing with possible bomb threats. Scenario-based trainings, along with on-the-job training with Police Officers, will help to prepare ICA officers for their new roles.",19,882,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00882

2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As part of their training, ICA and SPF officers learn how to manage members of the public in a professional and tactful manner.

2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To be clear, the intent is to minimise the time ICA officers will detain an individual before handing him over to police officers. This is why the new section 51AA(12)(a) in clause 4 requires the ICA officer to immediately inform a police officer of the arrest. However, there may be instances where the Police needs more time to take over custody of the person, such as during major emergencies. To cater to such circumstances, the provision allows an ICA officer to detain the person for up to 24 hours.",24,887,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00887
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat has asked whether it was necessary for the ICA officer to hand over an accused to the Police immediately, and if ICA officers can perform the required investigations instead, to free up Police resources. As I have explained earlier, the intention is not for ICA officers to take over Police's duties, and Police officers are still best placed to carry out the post-incident investigations.",25,888,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00888
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Mr Louis Ng spoke about the need for safeguards when ICA officers take statements under the new section 51AA. He pointed out that the provisions of section 51AA(6) and (7) were similar to section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code but unlike section 23 of the CPC.,26,889,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00889
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I would like to clarify that under section 22 of the CPC, a statement can be recorded from any persons acquainted with the facts of a case, and this could include witnesses as well as suspects. As for section 23 of the CPC, the statement is recorded from an individual after he or she has been charged with an offence and will be prosecuted in Court. So, there are material differences between the two types of statements provided for under the different sections of the CPC.",27,890,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00890
2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The intent behind providing ICA officers with the powers of examination under the new section 51AA of the Bill is to allow ICA officers to conduct preliminary fact-finding and checks during or immediately after an incident. On this basis, the new section 51AA(5) to (7) of the Bill is modelled after section 22 of the CPC, rather than section 23. As to the admissibility of such statements, existing case laws interpreting section 22 of the CPC will similarly apply and be followed by the Courts.",28,891,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00891

2018-01-08-T-014,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Thanaletchimi asked what it means for ICA officers to use reasonable force within the new section 51AA(10)(b) to make an arrest. The usage of the term ""reasonable"" can also be found in section 75 of the CPC, which is applicable to police officers and from which this new section is adapted. Generally speaking, reasonableness will entail using only as much force as is appropriate to effect arrest and one that is proportional to the level of perceived threat. For example, officers should not use firearms to shoot an unarmed person who may be trying to evade arrest. It would not be proportional. As I have explained earlier, ICA officers will be trained to use their enhanced powers appropriately which, of course, include the proper use of force.",30,893,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00893

In introducing transit security screening, MHA and ICA work closely with MOT, CAAS and CAG, as well as airlines, to minimise the impact on passengers. We conducted field trials to test the procedures and those resulted in several process refinements. They were very useful. So, we now assess that the minimum connecting times that can be maintained for most of the instances will remain unchanged. We are also working with CAG on protocols to clear passengers with very short connecting times.",41,904,2018-01-08-T-014-S-00904

2018-01-08-T-015,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Law),"One key change introduced by clause 19 in this Bill is the aggregate loan cap. The Moneylenders Rules presently cap the amount of unsecured credit an individual may borrow from any single moneylender. However, there are borrowers who approach multiple moneylenders for loans and consequently may still become over-indebted despite the current restrictions. The proposed aggregate loan cap in the Bill addresses this issue. It sets an overall limit on the amount an individual can borrow from all licensed moneylenders, combined.",9,924,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00924

2018-01-08-T-015,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),Many seek moneylenders over the banks because of their ease and convenience. Some do not qualify for bank loans and therefore resort to moneylending services for short-term credit. These people are often vulnerable and every effort must be taken to ensure that they know what they are getting themselves into. Education is timely and counselling in management of finances is perhaps important as the total outstanding amount in licensed moneylending and the number of borrowers is on the rise.,2,954,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00954
2018-01-08-T-015,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In 2016, it was tabulated that $367 million was borrowed by close to 40,000 borrowers. A year before that, the amount was $239 million for 35,000 borrowers. Although the proposed regulations will protect low-income families and prevent them from borrowing beyond their means, I wonder if our efforts to regulate the industry may also inadvertently push some of these borrowers into the outstretched arms of illegal moneylenders.

The Moneylenders Credit Bureau (MLCB) will act perhaps like a goalkeeper and verify lenders’ loan statuses before a loan is granted. But will the imposition of a nominal fee for the checking of records put off moneylenders from exercising due diligence, no matter how small the amount may be? What if they do not check the records and continue to issue loans more than the cap that is stipulated within the Act?

The onus is on the borrower to exercise due diligence and to ascertain if the loan required that is necessary. And if it is, will it be possible for them to repay the sum within the stipulated period? This is where the Government can perhaps lend a hand by making available counsellors who would advise people in need of their options.

I wish to ask the Ministry if there are acceptable standards of debt recovery that are set and how they are being policed. I have come across feedback that there are sometimes methods that border on criminal intimidation. How many moneylenders employ their own debt recovery agents and how many make use of third party debt recovery companies? How many cases of intimidation have been prosecuted or reported? While we also need to protect the interests of honest moneylenders dealing with difficult clients, we must also similarly ensure that less than scrupulous moneylenders do not intimidate vulnerable clients.

This aim is worthy of support. However, I am concerned the Government might be over-tightening the rules, making credit so inaccessible to individual borrowers that they are driven by desperation to unlicensed moneylenders.

The Minister updated this House in August 2016 that unlicensed moneylending cases fell to a 10-year low in 2015, at 4,862 cases. The number of people arrested for unlicensed moneylending activities also fell to around 1,500 in 2015 from close to 2,000 in 2011.

Would the Minister please share with the House the number of unlicensed moneylending cases reported and the number of offenders arrested in 2016 and 2017? These numbers could tell us whether the 2015 tightening had the effect of pushing more borrowers to unlicensed moneylending.",5,972,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00972

In the 2015 tightening, borrowers could borrow up to the loan cap from each moneylender. With the further tightening allowed by the new regulatory framework, borrowers could borrow up to the loan cap from all moneylenders combined. This is quite a drastic tightening of credit. Would the Senior Minister of State please inform the House what are the new developments on borrowing, new data on moneylending trends that have led to this escalated tightening?",6,973,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00973
2018-01-08-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"My third question follows from the first and the second questions, and is concerned with the balance of things, between protecting borrowers from over-borrowing and driving them to turn to unlicensed moneylenders. Would the Senior Minister of State please advise whether the Ministry has studied the probability that this further tightening would drive borrowers to turn to unlicensed moneylenders, and whether the Ministry has the monitoring tools to measure this possible effect?",7,974,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00974
2018-01-08-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Deputy Speaker, Sir, other than the main points above, I have four other minor points to raise for the Senior Minister of State to address.",8,975,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00975
2018-01-08-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"First point. In the 2015 adoption of the Advisory Committee report, two of the recommendations were put on hold to be reviewed later. These are  one, the lifting of the moratorium on granting of new licenses so as to encourage competition and bring down interest rates; and, two, the creation of guidelines for debt-collecting practices so as to further professionalise the industry and distinguish it from unlicensed moneylenders. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether these recommendations have been reviewed. If they have not been reviewed, whether she thinks it is timely to review them now, given the extensive makeover to prevent over-borrowing and to professionalise the industry.",9,976,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00976
2018-01-08-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Second point. One of the recommendations in the Advisory Committee report was that, while no recommendations were made in respect to the location of moneylenders in the heartland, the Committee advised that the Registry should monitor the situation and ensure that it is not aggravated. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether and how the Registry has been monitoring the situation and whether the Registry decided that it is not currently aggravated.",10,977,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00977
2018-01-08-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"A research policy report published by the Centre of Banking and Finance Law, at the Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore, in July 2015, shows that more than half of the licensed moneylenders were located in primarily residential areas rather than the commercial areas of town centres. There may be a case for the Ministry to commission a study using current geographical methods to determine whether location matters in encouraging unnecessary and excessive borrowing and thus whether or not the location of moneylenders should be regulated.",11,978,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00978
2018-01-08-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Third point. Would the Ministry look into working with the moneylending industry towards standardising loan products, with guidelines to advertise these products at their premises in a transparent manner? This will further professionalise the industry as well as better fulfil the 2015 recommendation to standardize loan contracts and practices. If I am not mistaken, standardisation is currently limited to the standard form used for contracts, which still allows for very flexible contracting terms within the interest rate and borrowing caps. Also, moneylenders have been innovating contracts to sustain predatory practices, and the Registry has been issuing directions and advisories with the burden placed on consumers to monitor and report. Standardisation will minimise such predatory practices.",12,979,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00979
2018-01-08-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Fourth and last point. Peer-to-peer lending platforms are on the rise around the world and is one exciting bright spot for innovation in fintech. There are some interesting P2P lending start-ups in Singapore such as Funding Societies from Indonesia and the local outfit Moolah Sense, linking up individual investors with SMEs.",13,980,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00980
2018-01-08-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"As far as I know, there are no platforms, legal or otherwise, that are connecting individual borrowers with lenders. But there are risks associated with these potentially disruptive fintech innovations. After all, many individual borrowers could be borrowing from licensed moneylenders because they are shut out from mainstream credit facilities and need loans to manage their cash flow problems in their micro-enterprise business. Is the law currently adequate to tackle the potential issue of P2P lending platforms becoming de facto moneylenders in practice?",14,981,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00981
2018-01-08-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned at the start of my speech, I support the aim of this bill to protect borrowers from over-borrowing and from predatory moneylending practices. My concern is that in the pursuit of good intentions, the Government might be over-tightening, over-regulating, thus shutting out individual borrowers from access to credit lines and driving them to unlicensed moneylenders. This would greatly upset the balance between giving borrowers credit access and clamping down on loan sharks that has been hard won. I hope the Senior Minister of State would allay this concern. And with this caution, I support the Bill.",15,982,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00982
2018-01-08-T-015,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Mr Deputy Speaker, moneylending in Singapore is a complex, diverse and challenging industry. Due to its unique nature, moneylending is relatively costly for off credit provision, if you think about it, especially when lending to individual small borrowers with low incomes. We need to also understand many small time borrowers are often caught in a desperate situation for funds and thus are vulnerable to exploitation by some moneylenders.",1,983,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00983
2018-01-08-T-015,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"But beyond this, did you also know that moneylending is actually a very small part of the consumer credit market. It is often not even considered a mainstream financial service. It makes up less than 1% of overall consumer lending in Singapore. So, let us put that into perspective",2,984,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00984
2018-01-08-T-015,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"In planning our handling of the issues related to moneylending, I feel it is important to maintain a well balanced approach.

2018-01-08-T-015,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"In this sense, it is a welcome move to have the limits set as prescribed in this Bill and I support that. It is also stated that the Moneylenders Credit Bureau will check if borrowers have exceeded the limits. How will this be practically carried out? Who will help with monitoring and compliance?",11,993,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00993
2018-01-08-T-015,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Recently, a licensed moneylender saw me and shared this anecdote. I have informed the person of my sharing this in my speech today.",12,994,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00994
2018-01-08-T-015,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Two PRs borrowed money from this moneylender. They had their identity cards and passed the usual checks that needed to be carried out. Now, when it came to repayment, they did not comply. Thus as is usually done, the moneylenders will send debt collectors to their homes. Now, guess what happened? The person who opened the door told the debt collector that the two guys who were PRs, have never lived there and they were just using the address. And they are moving around. In fact, he went on to say that he, as Singapore citizen, had allowed the two men to use his name in support of their PR applications. He further elaborated to the debt collector that the two men had a track record of borrowing and then not being traceable and many had come to the house before. Thus he felt that this moneylending company will never get the money back.",13,995,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00995
2018-01-08-T-015,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"The moneylender made a Police report giving all details present and available. However, the response from the Police came back that they had treated the case as closed. Being a bit disappointed, the moneylender came to see me and of course, made some representation, confided that it was not really about just getting back the money but more that it was the duty to highlight to the authorities that these two men were going around and cheating and still circulating.",14,996,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00996
2018-01-08-T-015,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Thus, there are gaps. We also need to know to prevent or reduce incidence like these in the market. We also do not want a situation whereby the tightening of rules is seen to force genuine moneylenders to exit the market and loan sharks to take over dominance. In fact, moneylenders can also tend to be at the mercy of some borrowers, who declare bankrupt readily when unable to repay.",15,997,2018-01-08-T-015-S-00997

But there will also be the issue of people needing to borrow money, and then over-borrowing. My only concern is whether this new cap will lead to even more underground moneylending activities and at even more cut-throat rates for desperate borrowers. Will the Government enhance the penalties for anyone caught operating an illegal moneylender joint? Will those reaching the cap be asked to attend credit counselling?",4,1006,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01006

Amongst other things, this Bill aims to restrict the amount people are able to borrow from licensed moneylenders, by introducing an aggregate loan cap depending on income levels. I believe this is a step in the right direction.

The number of borrowers with outstanding unsecured debt exceeding 18 times their monthly income has declined by 47% to 27,000 borrowers, compared to 2015 where there were 51,000 people in that situation. The amendments proposed under this Bill will enhance these measures as moneylending is further tightened.

As explained in my speech, the cap was a recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Moneylending in 2015, and has been calibrated to achieve a balance between protecting borrowers and preserving reasonable access to credit. Since the recommendation was made, we have observed an upward trend in the amount of outstanding debt owed by moneylending borrowers. Among Singaporean borrowers who took out loans between March 2016 and March 2017, nearly 2% will have an outstanding balance exceeding the incoming cap. This is not a big number, around 610 borrowers, but the aggregate cap will help us to nip the over-borrowing in the bud before it gets worse.",9,1074,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01074

Their total outstanding loan amount was $339 million. Based on a 2013 study commissioned by the Ministry of Law, borrowers who were interviewed said that the top three reasons for borrowing were to pay household bills; settle an outstanding loan from another moneylender; and to pay debts owed to friends or relatives.

The Police will also conduct an investigation to establish the identity of the person sending the spam message, and take action which may include the termination of the SIM cards with the telecommunications companies. If the moneylender has a licence, the police will refer the case to the Registry who will investigate and take appropriate action.",25,1090,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01090

2018-01-08-T-015,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I now turn to another important issue which some Members have highlighted - the usage and protection of borrowers' data. Mr Yee has cited instances where his constituents received unsolicited SMSes from unlicensed moneylenders offering loans, after they had approached licensed moneylenders. MinLaw takes a strict view of borrower data protection, and the Bill reflects this. For example, section 30R of the amended Act imposes duties on every moneylender to maintain the security of any information in any credit report received from the designated credit bureau. Failure to comply is punishable by a fine of $20,000 and or imprisonment of up to six months.",27,1092,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01092

2018-01-08-T-015,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"At this point, I would like to clarify how the MLCB operates. The MLCB is a centralised data bureau. It is not a moneylender. The private company that operates the MLCB will be designated under the amended Act and subject to the full suite of legal obligations we are introducing in the new Part IIIA of the Act. These include strict requirements on maintaining borrower privacy and data confidentiality. MinLaw regulates the MLCB.

This means that an individual's banks and employers, or any moneylender that he has not approached for a loan, will not be able to access his credit report unless he chooses to provide it. Likewise, under section 30W of the amended Act, the MLCB is not permitted to disclose any borrower information, except to a moneylender processing a loan application from the concerned individual, to the individual himself, to the Registrar, or to a public agency as directed by the Registrar.",31,1096,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01096

Sir, moneylenders' access to data is limited to the circumstances spelt out in the Act, that is, to determine an individual's creditworthiness, and the data provided to a moneylender is limited to the individual's details and the borrowings of that individual. The usage and disclosure of such information by moneylenders are also subject to the regulations I mentioned earlier. Individual licensed moneylenders, just like clinics or financial institutions that also possess sensitive personal information, will need to comply with the PDPC’s guidelines on the management of data breaches.",32,1097,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01097

2018-01-08-T-015,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Gan has asked whether the reports relied upon by moneylenders are based on other moneylenders updating the system, and whether any lead time might lead to system arbitrages and leakages. The MLCB is a real-time credit bureau, and any loans taken by a borrower will be automatically updated against his record. If a borrower approaches a moneylender and is offered a loan, and does not immediately decide if he wishes to take it, the system will reserve that amount against his name. This way, the borrower cannot borrow over the permitted cap, even if he approaches a second moneylender before confirming his loan with the first moneylender.",36,1101,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01101
2018-01-08-T-015,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Dr Intan have asked how a borrower’s limit will be checked. We have designed a rigorous process to enforce compliance with the aggregate cap. Before granting a loan to the borrower, section 30N of the amended Moneylenders Act requires moneylenders to obtain a real-time credit report from the MLCB. The credit report will contain aggregated information about all the loans the borrower has taken from licensed moneylenders. After obtaining the report, the moneylender must ensure that a further loan will not result in the borrower exceeding the aggregate cap before granting that loan. Failure to abide by this verification process is punishable by a fine of $20,000 and or imprisonment of up to six months.",37,1102,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01102
2018-01-08-T-015,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Given the penalties, to answer Mr Yam’s query, the nominal fee of 50 cents per credit report is unlikely to deter moneylenders from conducting due diligence before lending. In fact, the majority of moneylenders already purchase these credit reports as a matter of course. There are also in-built checks within the MLCB’s IT system to prevent a moneylender from unknowingly lending beyond the aggregate cap, and the Registry will conduct periodic audits to monitor compliance.",38,1103,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01103
2018-01-08-T-015,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"With the MLCB in operation, such borrowers who fail to repay their loans will leave a record. In the event of default, the usual form of recourse is for the moneylenders to pursue a civil claim against the borrowers for an unpaid debt. Under the law, there is a distinction between the non-payment of debt, which is a civil claim, and cheating, which is a criminal offence. Not all cases of defaulting debts will result in criminal investigations or prosecutions.",39,1104,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01104

Rule 9(2) of the Moneylenders Rules state that a licensee ""shall require the borrower to provide reliable and independent documentary evidence in support of all information provided in the loan application form, and verify the information against such evidence"". This would include a borrower’s actual address. Besides asking for a borrower's identity card to verify his actual address, other documents like IRAS and CPF statements, and utility bills, can be requested from a borrower.",40,1105,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01105

In addition to the Registrar’s regular audits, section 24A of the amended Act requires all licensees to conduct independent audits of the licensees' accounts and to submit those audited financial statements to the Registrar every year. These will help ensure that moneylenders are reporting all their transactions accurately. If these audits reveal that there are loans which have not been reported accurately, appropriate action will be taken against the licensees.",41,1106,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01106

2018-01-08-T-015,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Ng has also asked whether the Registrar will be providing reasons when rejecting an application and what channels and grounds of appeal are available to a rejected applicant. Even though there is no statutory right of appeal available for a rejected applicant, the Registrar will provide the rejected applicant with reasons for the rejection. It is worth highlighting that the grounds for denial of approval are largely based on indisputable matters of fact, as spelt out in subsections (4)-(5) of sections 11A and 11B of the amended Act. That said, subsections (7) of the same two sections do provide that the licensee seeking to employ or hire an applicant has a right to be heard by the Registrar, and that the Registrar may not refuse to grant such approval unless the licensee has been heard first.",43,1108,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01108
2018-01-08-T-015,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Goh also asked about peer-to-peer lending platforms, and whether the present law is effective to tackle the potential of such platforms being de facto moneylenders. Sir, section 3 of the Moneylenders Act states that ""any person, other than an excluded moneylender, who lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be a moneylender"". This presumption is sufficiently expansive to cover peer-to-peer platforms and their participants. The Government has been monitoring such platforms, and has so far not found them to have run afoul of our laws. We will continue to keep a close watch to ensure a proper balance between providing the space for these fintech innovations, and protecting vulnerable Singaporeans.",44,1109,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01109
2018-01-08-T-015,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Choo has also asked about the number of complaints against licensed moneylenders received by the Registry. In 2016, 124 reports were received by the Registry, and this number dropped to 104 in 2017. There are two main types of reports received. The first type are requests for assistance to re-negotiate their contracts with the moneylenders. Such requests would be referred to an appropriate VWO for assistance. The second type are complaints about debt collection and harassment. The Registry will speak to the moneylender concerned, and also advise the complainant to lodge a Police report if the debt collection activities in question may be criminal in nature. The Registry will continue to take licensing action when infractions are committed. MinLaw issues press releases when moneylenders are convicted of offences under the Moneylenders Act. Nonetheless, we will take Mr Choo’s suggestion on-board and consider how to make the list of suspended moneylenders more visible on the Registry’s website.",45,1110,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01110

The Bill introduces a new section 6A, which provides that only a company with the prescribed paid-up capital may hold a licence after the appointed day.

The Registry conducted a geospatial study with the Singapore Land Authority in 2017, and found that borrowers are increasingly borrowing from moneylenders situated outside their neighbourhoods. On the whole, there is no evidence that the location of moneylenders induces borrowing. Nonetheless, we will continue to monitor the situation.",50,1115,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01115

But beyond this, MinLaw is mindful that over-standardisation could prevent moneylenders from properly catering to the diverse risk profiles and needs of individuals who borrow from them. We believe the best approach is to provide specific directions, such as Registrar's Directions No. 1 of 2017 which, amongst other things, prohibit short-term loans which are repeatedly re-financed or renewed.",51,1116,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01116

On this issue of sharing of information from a licenced to a unlicensed moneylender, because they can just pass a sheet of paper at the coffee shop, it is very difficult to prove. So, may I suggest to the regulator, they consider having what we call ""mystery shopper""? That means we get somebody to approach a licensed moneylender and if soon after that, that person receives an SMS, and if it is proven through multiple mystery shoppers who approached this person, then we have circumstantial grounds to charge that the moneylender is indeed passing on information.",1,1119,2018-01-08-T-015-S-01119

2018-01-08-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"And we can see that MOH has shifted, too, over the years, as part of what some have called an evolving New Way Forward. Medifund was set up in 1993 as an endowment fund to help needy Singaporeans with medical bills. MediShield Life was implemented in 2015. It is not just an insurance policy. It is a social policy to help Singaporeans from all walks of life, in case of serious illness with catastrophic medical bills, serious illness. Importantly, MediShield Life helps regardless of whether one is very old, or whether one has a pre-existing condition from birth. There is also the Medication Assistance Fund (MAF), and MAF Plus, to help patients access new medications which may be beyond their means but which could still benefit the patients.",20,1146,2018-01-08-T-016-S-01146

2018-01-08-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"So, what I propose, Mr Deputy Speaker, is for MOH to look at how the Government can extend more support to children with rare diseases. It is a common-sense move and it is not a radical policy shift either. In fact, it is very much aligned with the deeper philosophy that already underpins our current social and healthcare policies.",22,1148,2018-01-08-T-016-S-01148
2018-01-08-T-016,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"For example, let us look at risk pooling.

As a parent, I empathise with the challenges all parents encounter and the daily struggles we have to go through to care for our children.

There was a recent example in one of our public hospitals – a patient by the name of Emily who was diagnosed with Pompe disease since she was a teenager. Emily needs to visit Changi General Hospital (CGH) every fortnight to receive an infusion of her missing enzymes, which is a costly drug. Combined with other aspects of her treatment such as consultations and tests, the monthly cost adds up to more than $50,000. Emily's father is a technician and her mother a homemaker; and she has a sister who is still schooling. Financially, it is very challenging for the family.",7,1163,2018-01-08-T-016-S-01163

Emily received subsidies for consultations and investigations, and the hospital helped her apply for funding under the Medication Assistance Fund. These covered a significant proportion of the infusion cost. The hospital also engaged a pharmaceutical company, which kindly agreed to extend financial assistance to further defray the cost of the medication she needs. More recently, after discussing her situation with the hospital, her employer helped her to claim part of her treatment cost from their group insurance policy. So, through the combined efforts by CGH, the pharmaceutical company and her employer, Emily’s monthly healthcare expenses were reduced from more than $50,000 to less than $500. I am heartened to know that Emily is coping well with her treatment.",8,1164,2018-01-08-T-016-S-01164

Like Emily, she needs to visit the hospital regularly to receive the infusion of enzymes. Her monthly treatment cost is about $40,000. This is another example of how multiple parties have come together to support the family; Government subsidies were provided for her treatment, the family’s insurance policy covered the post-subsidy costs of Chloe’s inpatient treatment, and additional Government and hospital assistance supported the other aspects of her treatment such as mobility devices and consumables. Together, these helped to reduce Chloe’s healthcare expenses from $40,000 per month to less than $500 a month.",9,1165,2018-01-08-T-016-S-01165

This is not an easy challenge to solve. Because many of the cases have unique circumstances. The needs are diverse. What is clear is that, as a caring and inclusive society, we must do our best to find practical ways to help our fellow Singaporeans who are in these difficult situations.

We are studying different options, including the use of insurance and discretionary funds like Medifund and Medication Assistance Fund to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses. Another possibility is to set up a separate fund which our public healthcare institutions can use on a discretionary basis to help children with rare diseases whose treatment costs remain unaffordable in spite of subsidies, insurance and financial assistance. Contributions to the fund can be made by the Government but also by companies, charities, community groups and individual donors, to encourage different stakeholders in society to chip in and help these families and help these patients.",12,1168,2018-01-08-T-016-S-01168

2018-01-08-T-026,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether a study has been done to analyse the benefits of central procurement for common essentials across public hospitals including software for medical documentation; and (b) whether central procurement can be done selectively to lower the cost of setting up and operating hospitals.,1,1212,2018-01-08-T-026-S-01212
2018-01-08-T-026,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"There are benefits and cost savings from the economies of scale achieved through central procurement of common essentials across public healthcare institutions. Since 2001, the public healthcare clusters have been supported by a centralised Group Procurement Office (GPO). Today, the GPO procures about 90% of standard drugs and 60% of non-standard drugs across our public healthcare clusters. It also covers certain common items such as surgical supplies and contract services. More recently, GPO procurement services have been extended to community hospitals and nursing homes.",1,1213,2018-01-08-T-026-S-01213
2018-01-08-T-026,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On IT procurement, the Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) has centrally coordinated IT system purchases to allow public healthcare institutions to benefit from volume discounts.

2018-01-08-T-027,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Law whether the Ministry will consider expanding the requirement under section 305(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code that the court must call for and consider the Commissioner of Prisons' report on an offender's mental condition for imposition of a sentence of reformative training to include an independent report from a court-appointed psychiatrist.,1,1216,2018-01-08-T-027-S-01216
2018-01-08-T-027,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"At present, the Reformative Training (RT) pre-sentencing report mandated under section 305(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code already includes an assessment of an offender’s mental condition by a Singapore Prison Service (SPS) psychiatrist. The SPS psychiatrist is a professional who is familiar with the design of the RT regime and how it works to achieve the intended outcomes and benefits for the individuals placed under the regime. He or she would make an independent assessment based on professional judgment.",1,1217,2018-01-08-T-027-S-01217
2018-01-08-T-027,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If the Court deems it necessary, it can exercise its discretion to direct that the SPS psychiatrist be cross-examined, or that further expert evidence or a second opinion be obtained, including from a court-appointed psychiatrist.",2,1218,2018-01-08-T-027-S-01218
2018-01-08-T-027,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It would not be desirable or necessary to impose a general requirement that an independent report from a court-appointed psychiatrist be obtained in all cases, which will apply even to cases where there is no disagreement with the RT pre-sentencing report. Doing so is likely to prolong the offender's remand period for the further opinion to be prepared.",3,1219,2018-01-08-T-027-S-01219
2018-01-08-T-028,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how has the Workfare Training Support (WTS) been effective in encouraging workers to upskill; and (b) how does WTS operate in tandem with SkillsFuture Initiatives to improve our workforce's overall skills level.,1,1220,2018-01-08-T-028-S-01220
2018-01-08-T-028,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Workfare Training Support (WTS) encourages low-wage Singapore Citizens to attend training to upgrade their skills by providing them with substantial course fee subsidies, monetary awards and training allowances. It also supports employers who send their workers for training. Since its inception in July 2010 till December 2017, more than 270,000 unique workers have tapped on WTS to undergo training.",1,1221,2018-01-08-T-028-S-01221
2018-01-08-T-028,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"WTS is in line with SkillsFuture, a national movement that provides opportunities for Singaporeans to develop their fullest potential through lifelong learning. For instance, Singaporeans receive up to 90% of enhanced subsidy from SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) when they access a curated set of training programmes under the SkillsFuture Series. But with WTS, eligible low-wage Singapore Citizens are supported with an even higher tier of subsidy, at 95% of course fees. Additionally, absentee payroll for employers, as well as training allowance for trainees without employer support are provided. WTS trainees can also receive the WTS Training Commitment Award, which is a cash award of up to $400 per year, for undergoing sustained training.",2,1222,2018-01-08-T-028-S-01222
2018-01-08-T-028,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Apart from generous training subsidies, the Government has worked with tripartite partners to put in place other measures to uplift low-wage workers. For example, the Progressive Wage Models in the cleaning, security and landscaping sectors provide clear progression pathways for workers to acquire new skills, take on higher responsibilities and earn higher wages. In addition, the Inclusive Growth Programme provides funding support to companies that undertake productivity improvement projects and share their productivity gains with low-wage workers.",3,1223,2018-01-08-T-028-S-01223
2018-01-08-T-029,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether there are any plans to further develop the infrastructure and programmes of the Social Service Offices.,1,1224,2018-01-08-T-029-S-01224
2018-01-08-T-029,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Our current network of 24 Social Service Offices (SSOs) was set up between 2013 and 2015 to provide more accessible and coordinated assistance to Singaporeans in need. The locations of these SSOs were chosen such that they are situated close to major transport nodes as well as to residents. Today, 95% of ComCare beneficiaries live or work within two kilometres of a SSO.",1,1225,2018-01-08-T-029-S-01225
2018-01-08-T-029,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Infrastructural improvements or relocations are considered and carried out where opportune or needed. For instance, the SSO at Tampines was relocated to Our Tampines Hub, so that its service counters can be co-located with those of other public sector agencies in the Public Service Centre.",2,1226,2018-01-08-T-029-S-01226
2018-01-08-T-029,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Apart from providing ComCare assistance, officers in the SSOs also do ground sensing and local services planning, collaborating with community partners to facilitate a coordinated approach to the planning and delivery of social services in the community. These twin purposes remain unchanged, although we are continually looking into ways to enhance service delivery and make it more client-centric.",3,1227,2018-01-08-T-029-S-01227
2018-01-08-T-029,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For instance, there are ongoing efforts to tighten inter-agency referral processes and facilitate data-sharing between SSOs and other agencies. We are also exploring the potential for more integrated service delivery by piloting at five of our SSOs1 the delivery of social assistance and employment assistance by the same SSO officer, instead of referring the ComCare beneficiary to a Workforce Singapore (WSG) or e2i officer for employment assistance. For clients who are unemployed but able to work, this provides easier and quicker access to employment assistance. We are also exploring co-locating other complementary services so that our clients can access the services and assistance they require more conveniently and meaningfully. Two of our SSOs2 have VWO-run Family Services Teams co-located with them as part of another ongoing pilot.",4,1228,2018-01-08-T-029-S-01228
2018-01-08-T-029,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"These efforts aim to bring about better coordination across both government agencies and community partners so as to provide necessary and holistic support for those who have fallen on hard times, and enable them to 'bounce back' and become self-reliant again.",5,1229,2018-01-08-T-029-S-01229
2018-01-08-T-030,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider specifying the future date for banning all petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles.,1,1230,2018-01-08-T-030-S-01230
2018-01-08-T-030,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Vehicle emissions are a source of air pollution locally.

Singapore's vehicular emission policies are technology-neutral and we seek to ensure that our air quality targets can be met in cost-effective ways.",2,1232,2018-01-08-T-030-S-01232
2018-01-08-T-030,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our air quality targets are benchmarked against standards set by the World Health Organisation. We have policy measures to achieve these targets and these include incentives to encourage the purchase of newer and cleaner vehicles, investment in public transport, support for trials of electric and hybrid vehicles, as well as mandatory requirements such as tightened vehicular emission standards. We will continue to strengthen our policies while ensuring the availability of feasible vehicle models to meet our transport needs.",3,1233,2018-01-08-T-030-S-01233
2018-01-08-T-031,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) how much has the Government invested in the biotechnology industry over the past 10 years; and (b) what is the return on the Government's investment in the biotechnology industry in terms of benefits to the Singapore economy.,1,1234,2018-01-08-T-031-S-01234
2018-01-08-T-031,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Between 2006 and 2015, the Government invested around $7.3 billion in the Biomedical Sciences (BMS) sector in Singapore. This includes funding for BMS-related research and development (R&D), developing infrastructure and human capital, and building up translational and clinical research capabilities. The private sector investment commitment to the biomedical manufacturing industry as well as the business expenditure on research and development (BERD) in the BMS-related fields during this period, totalled around $13.7 billion.",1,1235,2018-01-08-T-031-S-01235
2018-01-08-T-031,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Today, the BMS sector is an important pillar of our economy, contributing about $26 billion in manufacturing output or 4% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Singapore is home to more than 50 BMS manufacturing plants, and the sector employs more than 25,000 people.",2,1236,2018-01-08-T-031-S-01236
2018-01-08-T-031,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Singapore's sustained investments in BMS have helped to strengthen our BMS eco-system and build up our capabilities in healthcare, drug development and medical devices innovation. This has also enabled our local enterprises to capture opportunities in the rapidly growing global healthcare market, which is projected to reach US$2.7 trillion by 2025. From 2010 to 2016, at least 48 local drug-development and related biotech firms were incorporated, double the number in the preceding decade. One local biotech firm, Tessa Therapeutics, recently came into global prominence when it announced a partnership with the renowned Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Tessa is currently conducting the world's first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Phase III cancer T-cell therapy trial.",3,1237,2018-01-08-T-031-S-01237
2018-01-08-T-031,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Notwithstanding these economic outcomes, it should be noted that investments in the BMS sector typically have long gestation periods and require sustained commitment.

2018-01-08-T-032,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can give an update on the Ministry's investigation into the Joo Koon MRT train accident; (b) what are the lessons learnt and the steps taken to prevent such incidents; and (c) how serious are the injuries of those injured and whether any person is suffering from a long-term effect of the injuries.,1,1239,2018-01-08-T-032-S-01239
2018-01-08-T-032,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,LTA completed detailed investigations and released a summary of its findings on 18 December 2017. These are consistent with initial findings reported a few days after the collision on 15 November 2017.,1,1240,2018-01-08-T-032-S-01240
2018-01-08-T-032,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The root cause of the collision was a software logic issue with the new Communications-Based Train Control, or CBTC, signalling system. It failed to anticipate and hence could not handle a specific confluence of failure conditions. These conditions, in turn, occurred as a result of complications from operating two signalling systems concurrently on a single line – the new CBTC system on the Tuas West Extension and the old legacy signalling system on the rest of the East-West Line.",2,1241,2018-01-08-T-032-S-01241
2018-01-08-T-032,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The signalling system supplier, Thales, has rectified the system to address the failure conditions which led to the collision. In addition, Thales will set up a CBTC simulation facility in Singapore to strengthen the CBTC testing process. The facility will enable LTA and SMRT to perform additional simulation tests in a controlled setting which is tailored to our local environment and the infrastructural conditions of our rail network, before deploying it on our train services.",3,1242,2018-01-08-T-032-S-01242
2018-01-08-T-032,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As a precautionary measure, we further decided to separate the CBTC operations on the Tuas West Extension from the rest of the East-West Line. The separation will continue until the rest of the East-West Line has fully transitioned to the new CBTC signalling system. Meanwhile, we are speeding up the re-signalling project and the extended engineering hours from MRT early closures and late openings will enable us to complete this transition by the middle of this year.",4,1243,2018-01-08-T-032-S-01243

2018-01-08-T-033,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"Similar to public agencies, the employment agencies are also guided by the Tripartite Advisory on the Employment of Term Contract Employees, which provides workers with continuous benefits if the break in work period is less than a month3. The Public Service Division has been reminding public agencies and contractors to adhere to the Tripartite Advisory and its intent.",4,1249,2018-01-08-T-033-S-01249
2018-01-08-T-033,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"Given that the demand aggregation contract is designed to fulfil temporary needs, the service periods are generally of less than one year duration. However, the Permanent Secretary or Chief Executive Officer of an agency has flexibility to extend with the employment agency, the services of the temporary worker beyond one year, for good reasons such as when the short-term work needs to slightly exceed one year. The workers will continue to enjoy benefits from their employers throughout their engagement period as agreed in their employment contracts.",5,1250,2018-01-08-T-033-S-01250

2018-01-08-T-034,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Prime Minister what levers are available to MAS and law enforcement agencies to enforce anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws that use bitcoin currency where conventional oversight mechanisms of the real money market do not apply.,1,1252,2018-01-08-T-034-S-01252
2018-01-08-T-034,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Ms Foo asked how MAS and law enforcement agencies can enforce anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws on bitcoin currency transactions. When it comes to money laundering or terrorism financing, Singapore's laws do not make any distinction between transactions effected using fiat currency, virtual currency or other novel ways of transmitting value.",1,1253,2018-01-08-T-034-S-01253
2018-01-08-T-034,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Hence, MAS' AML/CFT requirements apply to all activities of financial institutions, whether conducted in fiat or virtual currencies. The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) is empowered to investigate and prosecute all manner of ML/TF cases. Everyone is required under the law to report suspicious transactions, which they come across in the course of their trade, profession, business or employment, to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office in CAD.",2,1254,2018-01-08-T-034-S-01254
2018-01-08-T-034,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS recognises that virtual currency transactions, given their anonymous nature, may be used to conceal illicit movement of funds. Further, the absence of a central clearing house for such transactions makes enforcement challenging, as it is difficult to identify the parties upon which enforcement orders can be applied.",3,1255,2018-01-08-T-034-S-01255
2018-01-08-T-034,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"However, at some stage, fiat currency will have to be exchanged for virtual currency, or vice versa, at intermediaries that buy, sell or exchange virtual currency. MAS therefore intends to impose AML/CFT requirements on such intermediaries. MAS is currently conducting public consultation on a proposed Payment Services Bill that will empower us to do this.",4,1256,2018-01-08-T-034-S-01256
2018-01-08-T-034,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"The virtual currency space is still evolving. Like most innovations, it presents new opportunities as well as risks. MAS is closely watching these developments and studying the approaches taken in other jurisdictions.

2018-01-08-T-036,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,Singapore has a sound system of governance that delivers good outcomes at relatively lower spending levels compared to many other countries. We achieve this by ensuring that public monies are used appropriately and properly accounted for.,1,1261,2018-01-08-T-036-S-01261
2018-01-08-T-036,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Government agencies commit to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for all programmes and schemes. These are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant, useful and fulfil their intended outcomes. Value-For-Money reviews are also centrally conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of key programmes, and often lead to recommendations for further improvements.",2,1262,2018-01-08-T-036-S-01262
2018-01-08-T-036,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,The rules in the Government Instruction Manuals and Finance Circulars require agencies to have an effective system of internal audit and financial controls. All agencies are required to report their internal control measures and key internal audit findings to their management and the Ministry of Finance.,3,1263,2018-01-08-T-036-S-01263
2018-01-08-T-036,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"For major expenditures, approval is subject to rigorous evaluation. The Gateway process for development projects, for example, involves reviews by a panel of private and public sector technical experts and approval by the Development Planning Committee at the Ministerial level.",4,1264,2018-01-08-T-036-S-01264
2018-01-08-T-036,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Government agencies are subject to independent audits, and the audit scope covers the use of the grants that are disbursed. Agencies also put in place safeguards against abuse, for example, through a system of fraud detection, checks and audits before claims are approved and paid-out.",5,1265,2018-01-08-T-036-S-01265
2018-01-08-T-036,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In addition to these controls, there are learning platforms to promote best practices and share emerging trends on governance and internal controls. For example, the Accountant-General's Department recently issued a guide to help agencies in their grant administration. The guide lays out best practices in grant design, evaluation and approval, project monitoring, and grant disbursement.",6,1266,2018-01-08-T-036-S-01266
2018-01-08-T-036,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On the whole, we have a sound system in place, managed by committed and competent staff.

2018-01-08-T-037,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Health in light of the new US guideline defining high blood pressure as 130/80 mmHg (a) what percentage of our population falls within this category; (b) why is the Ministry not adopting this more stringent guideline; and (c) what is being done to raise awareness of hypertension as the 2010 National Health Survey indicates that one in four persons is not aware that they are hypertensive.,1,1268,2018-01-08-T-037-S-01268
2018-01-08-T-037,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,The 2017 American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines have defined high blood pressure as 130/80mmHg or higher.,1,1269,2018-01-08-T-037-S-01269
2018-01-08-T-037,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"However, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has decided to maintain its definition of hypertension as blood pressure 140/90mmHg or higher in its Clinical Guidelines for Hypertension, after consulting local experts. This value remains the general consensus globally, supported by guidelines from societies such as the International Society of Hypertension, the European Society of Cardiology and the National Heart Foundation of Australia. If Singapore adopted the new AHA guidelines, our hypertension prevalence would double from 21.5%% to 43.2%4.",2,1270,2018-01-08-T-037-S-01270
2018-01-08-T-037,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Despite the differences in definition, the management approach under the MOH's current and US's newly introduced definition is broadly similar. Under both sets of guidelines, all individuals with hypertension should change their lifestyles, whereas medication is recommended for hypertensive individuals with blood pressure higher than 140/90mmHg. However, specifically for those with cardiovascular risk factors, the US guideline differs from the current general global consensus in recommending initiation of medication at a lower target of 130/80mmHg, after an individual risk assessment. We will continue to monitor developments in this aspect and fine tune our guidelines where necessary.",3,1271,2018-01-08-T-037-S-01271
2018-01-08-T-037,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Hypertension can be effectively prevented through healthy lifestyle habits, such as maintaining a balanced diet and avoiding excess salt intake, regular physical activity and not smoking. For those with hypertension, screening and early detection will facilitate prompt treatment to achieve good health outcomes. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has introduced many initiatives to encourage individuals to live healthily, as well as go for regular health screening under Screen For Life (SFL). The screening subsidies under HPB's Screen For Life were recently enhanced.",4,1272,2018-01-08-T-037-S-01272
2018-01-08-T-038,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Health (a) how many residents are currently seeking home-based nursing care; (b) what are the current support for lower income families seeking home-based nursing care; and (c) what are the long-term plans to develop affordable home-care for our ageing population.,1,1273,2018-01-08-T-038-S-01273
2018-01-08-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Over 4,200 residents are currently receiving Government subsidies for home-based nursing care provided by MOH-subvented providers. This is an increase of 15% from a year ago. Up to two-thirds of Singaporean households can meet the income criteria for receiving these subsidies. Lower income households will receive higher levels of subsidies, which can be up to 80%.",1,1274,2018-01-08-T-038-S-01274
2018-01-08-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, the Government also supports caregivers of seniors in other ways. For example, the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) provides funding to offset the cost of assistive devices and home healthcare items. Families who need to hire a Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) to care for frail seniors may be eligible for a concessionary levy, as well as the FDW Grant, to help offset the cost of hiring a FDW.",2,1275,2018-01-08-T-038-S-01275
2018-01-08-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We aim to expand home-based care service capacity to 10,000 places by 2020. We will also continue to work on the quality and affordability of home and community based care services. For example, we recently introduced ""Integrated Home and Day Care"" services where home-based care is paired with care at day centres. This flexible model enables seniors to interact with others on days when they are well, and cared for at home on other days. We are currently reviewing the Eldershield scheme to help Singaporeans better prepare for the costs of long term care.",3,1276,2018-01-08-T-038-S-01276

2018-01-08-T-039,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Traffic Police (TP) and Land Transport Authority (LTA) evaluate applications for road closures very carefully. Apart from the safety and security of the participants of the event, another key consideration is that emergency services such as hospitals must remain accessible. Also, road users and members of the local community, such as residents and business-owners, should not be overly inconvenienced. If the potential inconvenience and disruption to emergency services cannot be adequately addressed, the application will be rejected.",1,1278,2018-01-08-T-039-S-01278

2018-01-08-T-040,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The demand for APOs will grow due to the rising threat from terrorism, and major infrastructure projects that require security manpower like Changi Airport Terminal 4 and the new Tuas Port.",2,1285,2018-01-08-T-040-S-01285
2018-01-08-T-040,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Our clear preference is to recruit Singaporean APOs to meet this rising demand. The APFs have made significant efforts to do so, for example, providing signing and retention bonuses, and enhancing career progression. This has allowed the APFs to add over 300 Singaporean APOs over the past year. But this is still not enough to meet the projected demand over the next few years. There is a manpower shortage everywhere.",3,1286,2018-01-08-T-040-S-01286
2018-01-08-T-040,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Local workforce growth is slowing, and it is difficult for the APFs to find enough Singaporean candidates who meet the requirements. To meet the shortage, we have allowed the APFs to hire Malaysian APOs. But even that pool has been shrinking, and our APFs have been finding it difficult to recruit enough Malaysian officers who meet the requirements. They needed to look for officers from other countries. Thus, the Minister for Home Affairs said in this House in 2017 that we will allow APFs to recruit Taiwanese APOs.",4,1287,2018-01-08-T-040-S-01287
2018-01-08-T-040,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In deciding where non-Singaporean APOs can be deployed, MHA considers the operational needs and risks specific to each security-sensitive location. Our requirement was that land checkpoints, for example, be manned only by Singaporean APOs – and that has been said in this House.",5,1288,2018-01-08-T-040-S-01288
2018-01-08-T-040,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But operational needs are growing significantly, everywhere, including our checkpoints. Visitor numbers are growing, and at the same time, the threats of terrorism have risen substantially. The security situation has become more complex, requiring more officers. Therefore, we have decided to allow Taiwanese APOs to be deployed at the land checkpoints alongside Singaporean APOs, because there are not enough Singaporean APOs available.",6,1289,2018-01-08-T-040-S-01289

2018-01-08-T-045,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The extended engineering hours have been extremely useful for our engineering and maintenance teams. First, they have enabled LTA, SMRT and signalling system supplier Thales to accelerate the re-signalling of the East-West Line. Each weekend of extended engineering hours has allowed Thales to conduct the equivalent of five regular nights of site acceptance testing. Second, they have allowed SMRT to bring forward and intensify maintenance works and repairs of the running rails, station equipment and track circuits. They have also enabled LTA to conduct more maintenance inspections to ensure the quality of SMRT's maintenance works, especially those by outsourced contractors. Third, they have allowed LTA and SMRT to speed up the installation of noise barriers for the stretch between the Dover and Boon Lay MRT stations. On each weekend, the project team was able to make progress equivalent to four nights of normal engineering hours.",2,1310,2018-01-08-T-045-S-01310

Some companies also engaged private buses to ferry their staff to and from Joo Koon or Pioneer MRT stations during the peak periods.",2,1319,2018-01-08-T-047-S-01319
2018-01-08-T-047,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I am grateful to commuters and employers for their patience and understanding during the service suspension, and I seek their continued support as the Tuas West Extension remains segregated from the rest of the East-West Line to allow Thales to complete the re-signalling work safely and speedily.",3,1320,2018-01-08-T-047-S-01320
2018-01-08-T-048,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA has assessed the feasibility of developing a national smartphone navigation app for public transport that acquires, aggregates and analyses (i) real-time bus and train data from public transport operators (ii) end-user location and velocity data volunteered by app users' smartphones and (iii) user reports of transport delays or breakdowns.",1,1321,2018-01-08-T-048-S-01321
2018-01-08-T-048,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"There are currently a number of such smartphone apps serving commuters’ different needs. LTA's myTransport app provides commuters with essential public transport information based on real-time data, including traffic updates, bus arrival times and crowdedness. Transport operators create their own apps to serve their customers and may also pull in data from public sources to enrich their app content. For example, the SMRT-Connect travel app helps users plan their journeys by providing real-time information such as arrival timings for buses and trains. There are also third party apps such as Google Maps and Citymapper which help users plan their journeys, drawing on many data sources including information volunteered by end-users.",1,1322,2018-01-08-T-048-S-01322
2018-01-08-T-048,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"We welcome such efforts, as they can individually or collectively serve specific commuter needs. Our job is to facilitate such development by making data open through Data.gov.sg and LTA's DataMall so that private developers can co-create smarter transport solutions with us.",2,1323,2018-01-08-T-048-S-01323
2018-01-08-T-048,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In particular, there is potential to collect end-user locations and provide train service disruption notifications as suggested by the Member. As commuter needs evolve, LTA will add more data to DataMall and introduce new features to its mobile app. Transport operators like SMRT have also shared plans to enhance their own app content by providing information on platform and train loading based on analysis of data collected from wifi access points and camera feeds.",3,1324,2018-01-08-T-048-S-01324
2018-01-08-T-049,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Minister for Transport whether there are any measures in place to prevent bus drivers from reducing their driving speed and deliberately stopping at bus-stops longer than necessary so as to avoid being penalised for arriving back at the interchange too early.,1,1325,2018-01-08-T-049-S-01325
2018-01-08-T-049,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Bus bunching was a common complaint among commuters. In response, we have introduced the Bus Service Reliability Framework to get bus operators to improve the punctuality and reliability of their bus services. It requires bus captains to adjust their speeds to maintain a consistent headway between buses, thus minimising bus bunching. They do not deliberately stop at bus stops longer than necessary. More regular bus intervals will benefit bus commuters as it reduces waiting time and spreads passenger loads more evenly.",1,1326,2018-01-08-T-049-S-01326

2018-01-08-T-050,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The Civil Service continues to find it relevant to assess officers’ performance annually, as well as their readiness to take on larger responsibilities using the concept of ""Currently Estimated Potential"" (CEP) which is an estimation of the highest job level an officer can handle in the future.",1,1328,2018-01-08-T-050-S-01328
2018-01-08-T-050,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The Public Service Division periodically reviews the appraisal system to ensure it remains relevant and effective. During last year's review, PSD took into account feedback from managers and officers across the Civil Service to update many aspects of the system. For example, we are giving greater autonomy to Ministries on the appraisal of junior officers5. We are training supervisors to better understand and implement the system. These help to foster greater ownership of the system.",2,1329,2018-01-08-T-050-S-01329
2018-01-08-T-050,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"Our officers have also told us that they want more timely feedback on their performance and career development opportunities. Arising from this, we introduced the Individual Development Plan in 2014 to institutionalise regular career development conversations between officers and their supervisors. To complement formal appraisal, the Civil Service is experimenting with digital technology to enable officers to seek ""on-the-go"" informal feedback periodically or when a piece of work is completed. We have recently completed trialling a real-time feedback app for officers to more easily seek feedback from people whom they work with, be they subordinates, peers or supervisors.",3,1330,2018-01-08-T-050-S-01330
2018-01-08-T-050,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"We look out for officers who exhibit innovative thinking. Officers who exercise imagination and creativity to generate innovative solutions will be appraised more favourably. However, a culture of innovation comes from our broader practices, beyond the appraisal system. The Civil Service encourages innovation in a number of different ways. For example, many ""makeathon"" sessions have been held across the public service. These bring together public officers from within and across agencies, as well as members of the public to brainstorm new ideas to transform the public service to improve policies and better serve citizens. Officers who display excellence in innovation are publicly recognised through Public Service awards such as the Excellence through Continuous Enterprise and Learning (ExCEL) Awards.",4,1331,2018-01-08-T-050-S-01331

2018-01-08-T-051,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The best way to encourage qualified PRs who have decided to make their future here to consider applying for citizenship is to continue to ensure that our Singapore citizens are well looked after, in a Singapore that continues to do well. To reflect the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, and to acknowledge Singapore citizens' commitment to Singapore, citizens receive more support and benefits than PRs in several areas, such as parenthood, housing, healthcare, and education.",4,1336,2018-01-08-T-051-S-01336

An additional wage offset of up to 3% of monthly wages is also provided to encourage continued employment of older workers aged 65 and above. Reduced employer CPF contribution rates for employees aged 55 and above further help to moderate the costs of hiring older workers for employers.

To step up our support for active jobseekers who are unemployed and actively looking for jobs, we did a global search of employment agencies with the business model, experience and expertise suited to help such active jobseekers. We found that partnerships between government and the private sector have been successful in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, where private placement providers are contracted to place active jobseekers, including those who may face greater employment barriers.

2018-01-08-T-079,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The number of households assisted each year on either ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) or Long-Term Assistance (LTA) has generally increased over the past five years, with a slight decrease for those assisted on SMTA in FY2016 compared to FY2015.",1,1444,2018-01-08-T-079-S-01444
2018-01-08-T-079,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"This could be due to several factors, such as the widening of the ComCare eligibility criteria in 2012 and 2014, greater awareness and accessibility to social assistance through the network of 24 Social Service Offices which was rolled out between 2013 and 2015, and demographic changes.",2,1445,2018-01-08-T-079-S-01445
2018-01-08-T-079,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The proportion of older SMTA main applicants (aged 55 to 64) increased from 18% in FY2012 to 23% in FY2016. The proportion of those who were not working also increased from 48% in FY2012 to 53% in FY2016. Most of those who were not working were either medically unfit to work, or retired. The increase in proportion of SMTA main applicants who are older, medically unfit to work or retired corresponds with demographic trends such as shrinking family sizes and an ageing population.",3,1446,2018-01-08-T-079-S-01446
2018-01-08-T-079,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Government will continue to provide multiple layers of assistance for the lower-income and vulnerable through a network of government agencies and community groups.

Together, these schemes provide substantial support to those in need.",4,1447,2018-01-08-T-079-S-01447
2018-01-08-T-079,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will continue to refine and enhance our policies and approach to social service delivery, so that the low-income and vulnerable will get the support they require to cover their basic needs. But even as the Government does more, we must be careful not to erode the strong work ethic and sense of individual responsibility and self-reliance, which have been key factors underpinning Singapore's growth as a society and nation. We must also be careful not to diminish the role of the family and the community, where they are able to provide or contribute to the care and support for individuals who are disadvantaged or vulnerable.",5,1448,2018-01-08-T-079-S-01448
2018-01-08-T-079,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Today, there are many ground-up initiatives in the community, and many citizens are already giving and contributing. For example, there are community groups who reach out, befriend and support various vulnerable groups such as low-income families with children and the elderly who live alone. The Government will continue to engage and partner the community to support such vulnerable groups. Through the SG Cares movement, we hope to mobilise volunteers and bring partners with different skills and resources to work with us in caring for those in need.",6,1449,2018-01-08-T-079-S-01449
2018-01-08-T-079,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The Government also looks continually at how we can enhance client-centricity in service delivery. There are ongoing efforts to tighten inter-agency referral processes and facilitate data-sharing with other agencies. We are also exploring the potential for more integrated service delivery and co-location of complementary services so that our clients can access more holistic assistance and become self-reliant again.,7,1450,2018-01-08-T-079-S-01450
