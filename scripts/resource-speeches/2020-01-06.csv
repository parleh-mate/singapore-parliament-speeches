2020-01-06-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how will the US-China Phase 1 Trade Deal impact Singapore's economy; and (b) how can local manufacturers that export parts for US goods leverage on the new agreement to boost their businesses.,1,1,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00001
2020-01-06-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in light of local exports declining in the past nine months (a) how many businesses and employees have been affected in the past year; (b) whether outreach has been made to businesses to assess the impact and assistance they may require to stay afloat; and (c) what progress has been made on efforts to expand our export market in the past year.,1,2,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00002
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 1 and 2 together, please?",1,3,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00003
2020-01-06-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,4,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00004
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I will group the answers into two parts  first, global developments and their potential impact on Singapore's economy; second, the Government's strategies to grow Singapore's economy and create good jobs for Singaporeans.",1,5,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00005
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Twenty-nineteen was a volatile year for the global economy. The IMF downgraded the 2019 global growth forecast five successive times – in each of its quarterly reports since October 2018 – to 3.0%, down from the 3.6% achieved in 2018. Fortunately, the global economy avoided several worse scenarios including an all-out trade war between the US and China, but downside risks remain. As a small, open economy, Singapore was affected by these macroeconomic conditions. Our non-oil domestic exports declined by 10.1% on a year-on-year basis between January and November 2019. Advance estimates show that Singapore’s economy grew by 0.7% in 2019, slower than the 3.1% recorded in 2018.",2,6,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00006
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Looking ahead, MTI expects Singapore's GDP growth to pick up modestly to between 0.5% and 2.5% on the back of a slight uptick in global economic growth and a gradual recovery in the global electronics cycle. Even though we are cautiously optimistic, there remains several uncertainties in the global economy.",3,7,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00007
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The biggest uncertainty is the relationship between the US and China. This is the most important bilateral relationship for both countries, and indeed for the entire world. We welcome the announcement of the Phase 1 trade deal, especially the cancellation of further tariff hikes in December 2019. Averting further trade tensions is positive news for all countries. We hope that this is the first step towards putting the relationship back on a stronger footing. We look forward to learning about the details of the Phase 1 deal on 15 January 2020, and working with both countries to grow our economies.",4,8,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00008
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Another uncertainty pertains to Brexit, for the UK and the European Union are collectively our third largest trading partner in goods, and our biggest trading partner in services. Mr Seah Kian Peng had filed a Parliamentary Question (PQ) for the next sitting on the implications of Brexit on Singapore and Singaporean companies. I would like to take this opportunity to address Mr Seah's question as well. Based on the terms of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, the immediate impact of Brexit is likely to be limited. This is because, until 31 December 2020 at the least, the UK will functionally be treated as an EU Member State and remain a party to the EU's international agreements, including the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) which had just come into force. However, this may change depending on what the UK Parliament decides in these coming weeks. In addition, what happens after 2020 has not yet been determined. Singapore is therefore working with the UK on an economic agreement to maintain continuity in our economic relations after the EUSFTA no longer applies to the UK.",5,9,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00009
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I wish to remind Members that these uncertainties are not unrelated. What is happening between the US and China, the UK and the EU, and other economies like India, Chile and Hong Kong, are manifestations of a deeper unhappiness over the inequitable distribution of gains from globalisation, and a concern that tomorrow will not be better than today. This is why the multilateral trading system – which has underpinned decades of economic integration and free trade – is itself under significant stress.",6,10,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00010
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Since 11 December 2019, the WTO's Appellate Body has been non-functional because there are not enough appellate judges to meet the quorum. The WTO's appellate function is an existential one for the multilateral trading system, because it ensures the robust enforcement of multilateral trade rules. Without this binding and neutral mechanism to resolve trade disputes, the risk of a fragmented trading system will grow. There will be severe consequences for all WTO members, including Singapore, should trade, talent and data flows become disrupted. The strategic question confronting the world is whether we continue to turn inward and less open, or we find a new balance that enables economies to remain open and connected, while ensuring that our people benefit equitably from such integration.",7,11,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00011
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Apart from these challenges, there are also unanticipated issues that may affect the global economy, such as the situation between the US and Iran. Any escalation between the two countries may portend further instability in the Middle East which could have negative implications on the global economy, including Singapore.",8,12,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00012
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I should add that this is not all doom and gloom for the world. There are also many exciting opportunities to harness. For example, the digital economy is a major opportunity for us in Singapore. Digitalisation enables small countries like Singapore to transcend our size and geography, and helps our enterprises to penetrate new regional and global markets. Within Southeast Asia alone, the digital market is estimated to exceed US$300 billion by 2025 – almost the same size as the current Singapore economy and right at our doorsteps! And although the IMF has downgraded the global growth forecasts, Asia remains a bright spot with growth estimated at 5.1%.",9,13,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00013
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In sum, there will be both uncertainties and opportunities in the year ahead. It is incumbent on us to ensure our ship is seaworthy, set our sails to catch the wind. The Government will help Singapore businesses navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities. This includes helping Singaporean companies to expand into overseas markets, as well as providing customised support for companies to press on with productivity improvements, innovation and the training of our workers.",10,14,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00014
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Singapore has to adopt a long-term perspective in our economic strategies, even as we tackle the short-term headwinds. Allow me to elaborate on three strategies that the Government has taken to grow our economy and create good jobs for Singaporeans.",11,15,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00015
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, we are strengthening Singapore's fundamentals to distinguish ourselves amidst the uncertainties.",12,16,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00016
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In July last year, I shared with Members some of the factors that have enabled Singapore to stand out from the competition. Our stable political environment and united leadership empower us with the capacity to plan for the long term; the rule of law and pro-innovation regulatory environment provide certainty for businesses to thrive; our superior connectivity with the rest of the world allows us to look to the world for opportunities; our strong tripartite partnership and a skilled workforce that continually upgrades and generates new ideas, acquire new skillsets and knowledge that can redefine what is possible for a country with no natural hinterland.",13,17,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00017
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The international community recognises these strengths. This is why the Economic Development Board (EDB) has attracted more than $8 billion of investment commitments in 2019, despite the global economic uncertainties. These investments are in high value-added sectors, such as electronics, aerospace and pharmaceuticals. I have not included investments from other sectors in the above figure, such as the $9 billion expansion plan for the two integrated resorts. These investments will create many good jobs for Singaporeans, and they reflect the global business community's confidence in our future.",14,18,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00018
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Moving forward, we will continue to deepen our linkages with key markets, and transcend our geographical boundaries by pushing into new dimensions of connectivity that include the flows of data, talent, ideas and technology.",15,19,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00019
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, we are helping Singapore companies and workers to internationalise and turn the world into our hinterland. The preconditions are in place, thanks to our excellent connectivity and our extensive network of 25 FTAs with 64 trading partners, which collectively account for more than 85% of global GDP and more than 90% of Singapore's trade.",16,20,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00020
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Last year, as of September 2019, we gave out 800 companies grant support for their foray into overseas markets through the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) scheme. In the same period, about 1,700 companies were supported in growing their businesses both domestically and overseas through the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) programme in the areas of capability development, market access and manpower development for internationalisation.",17,21,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00021
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"These transformation efforts have translated into higher pay and better career progression opportunities for our workers. As businesses grow, they will create more good jobs for Singaporeans. To further strengthen the linkage between enterprise transformation and benefits to our workers, we will include commitment to worker outcomes as a mandatory condition for companies that apply for EDG funding from 1 April 2020. These outcomes may include wage increases, job creation, job-redesign, or hiring of older workers. It will reinforce our message of building an economy that is both pro-enterprise and pro-worker.",18,22,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00022
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Besides the EDG, there are also employee-specific schemes like the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) to help mid-career PMETs reskill and embark on new careers, and the Global Ready Talent (GRT) programme to equip workers with skills relating to internationalisation. Through these programmes, we hope to prepare more Singaporeans to compete and succeed across the region and in the world.",19,23,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00023
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The Government will announce further initiatives to help our businesses transform and build stronger capabilities at this year's Budget.,20,24,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00024
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Third, we are pursuing new growth opportunities. Through the work of the Future Economy Council (FEC) and the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), we are developing new industry niches in areas such as additive manufacturing, robotics and sensors. These build on our existing strengths in sectors such as electronics and precision engineering, and will enhance Singapore's position in the global value chains.",21,25,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00025
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We are also partnering industry players to develop new capabilities in promising growth areas such as agri-food, urban mobility and precision medicine. For example, we will be establishing the Agri-Food Innovation Park (AFIP) in Sungei Kadut, to bring together high-tech farming and R&D activities in areas such as urban agriculture and aquaculture. Through this, we hope to create new career opportunities and grow a new generation of technopreneur farmers.",22,26,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00026
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To capture opportunities in the digital economy, Singapore is co-leading the WTO Joint Statement Initiative on E-Commerce or JSI. The JSI will establish multilateral rules to help companies navigate the complex e-commerce landscape. We are exploring deeper collaborations with key economic partners like Chile, Australia and New Zealand, through a new generation of ""digital economy agreements"" to open up more opportunities for our companies.",23,27,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00027
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as a small country, Singapore cannot completely insulate ourselves from ups and downs in the external environment. But there are steps that we can take to strengthen our economic competitiveness and build stronger capabilities in our enterprises and workers. Our success has always been predicated on our will to make the best of what we have, and our resolve to turn adversity into opportunity. If we continue to stay united and work together as one people, we can all look forward to a brighter tomorrow for all of us.",24,28,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00028
2020-01-06-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like the Minister for answering both questions and covering a wide range of topics with regard to those questions. I have two supplementary questions.",1,29,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00029
2020-01-06-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"One, can the Minister share, in his view or MTI's view, whether the US-China tensions will continue to ease off in 2020 and whether it will still continue in terms in the tensed landscape as well as what its impact will be on Singapore companies?",2,30,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00030
2020-01-06-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, the Minister mentioned about multilateral agreements that will continue to be beneficial for the world. Can the Minister share with the about the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), whether there are any developments on that front and how Singapore playing on that front and whether Singapore can benefit?",3,31,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00031
2020-01-06-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me first take the question on the US-China tensions. We are encouraged by the conclusion and the impending signing of the Phase 1 agreement between US and China. I have spoken to both my counterparts in US and China. I think the significance of the deal goes beyond just the lines of agreement and the specific line items in the agreement. I think both the US and China are very clear that this is a basis for them to establish the strategic trust between both countries because a deal is a deal.",1,32,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00032
2020-01-06-T-001,,,"More important is how we implement the deal and along the way, there will be further negotiations between them. And I am quite certain of that. So, we are cheered by the conclusion of the Phase 1.",1,33,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00033
2020-01-06-T-001,,,"But having said that, we are very clear – and I think both the US and China are also very clear – that the challenges between the two countries go beyond the trade numbers. They have differences between themselves; how they see they should structure their economies in terms of subsidies; they have differences in how they see trade relationships; they have differences in how they see the subsidies for their technology, research and development, so on and so forth. So, there are deeper structural issues that have to be settled between the US and China. I think that we will have to wait for the strategic trust to be built up for them to move on to the next step of their agreement.",2,34,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00034
2020-01-06-T-001,,,"Given the political dynamics in the US in 2020, we can also expect some surprises along the way.",3,35,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00035
2020-01-06-T-001,,,"So, while we are cautiously optimistic, we are cheered by the trade, the Phase 1 trade deal, I think there are many other issues that still need to be resolved in time to come between the US and China.",4,36,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00036
2020-01-06-T-001,,,"On the second question, on RCEP, last year at the Asean Leaders' Summit, the 15 RCEP countries have essentially concluded all the tax-based negotiations. There are a few outstanding, bilateral market access negotiations between some of the RCEP countries. The leaders of the 15 countries have given their commitment to sign the agreement in Vietnam in 2020 and all the officials are working hard to realise that. In fact, the legal scrubbing for the text have commenced and our team is currently now in Jakarta working with our counterparts on that.",5,37,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00037
2020-01-06-T-001,,,The door remains open for India to join RCEP and I think that is the common position for all the 15 member states. I think every one of the 15 member states would welcome India's continued participation. We have continued to keep India in the loop for all the discussions and also the legal scrubbing.,6,38,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00038

2020-01-06-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"There has been a request to take Question No 3 and Question No 4 together, so Minister for Manpower will answer Question No 3 and the Minister for Trade and Industry, Question No 4. And we will take the supplementary questions immediately after the response to Question No 4. Minister for Manpower.",1,41,2020-01-06-T-001-S-00041
2020-01-06-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry will detail the number of new jobs filled by Singaporeans, PRs and foreigners respectively for each industry covered by the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) henceforth; and (b) whether it can provide these statistics for each ITM since the inception of the respective ITMs to date.",1,42,2020-01-06-T-002-S-00042
2020-01-06-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The 23 Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) were launched progressively from late 2016, with the majority launched in 2018. Changes in workforce profile depend on a variety of factors which can be structural or cyclical in nature. To assess the impact of ITMs, it will be more meaningful to look at employment outcomes over the medium and long terms.",1,43,2020-01-06-T-002-S-00043
2020-01-06-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Nonetheless, we can look at employment change across the 23 ITM sectors from 2015, before the launch of ITMs, to 2018. Between 2015 and 2018, total employment in these sectors, excluding foreign domestic workers grew by 19,500. This was made up of  (a) an increase in employment of Singapore Citizens (SCs) by 39,300; (b) increase in employment of Permanent Residents (PRs) by 8,600; and (c) a decrease in employment of foreigners by 28,500.",2,44,2020-01-06-T-002-S-00044
2020-01-06-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"These numbers are encouraging because we have been making the effort to secure jobs for Singaporeans. We are making progress on this front. Singaporeans have consistently worked hard to update our skills and stay relevant. Between 2015 and 2018, the training participation rate of the resident labour force aged from 15 to 64 increased from 35% to 48%, which shows that more Singaporeans are upgrading and updating their skills. From 2016 until September 2019, Workforce Singapore and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) have also helped 93,000 locals move into new jobs through the Adapt and Grow initiative.",3,45,2020-01-06-T-002-S-00045
2020-01-06-T-003,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the contribution of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) to GDP growth in each of the past 10 years; (b) what has been the growth in TFP in each of the past 10 years; (c) how does Singapore's TFP performance compare to that of other developed countries; and (d) what drivers and restraints of Singapore's recent TFP growth has the Ministry identified.,1,46,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00046
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me take Parliamentary Question No 4.",1,47,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00047
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Between 2008 and 2018, Singapore's Total Factor Productivity (TFP) grew by 0.5% per annum. This is about 12% of our GDP growth of 4.5% per annum over the same period. Since 2016, TFP growth has increased to 0.9% per annum or around 27% of GDP growth.",2,48,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00048
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Singapore's TFP performance was stronger than or comparable to most OECD countries. Between 2008 and 2018, France's TFP rose by 0.3% per annum, while Finland's TFP growth was 0% per annum. TFP growth in Germany and in the United States were similar to ours, at about 0.5% per annum.",3,49,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00049
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"The pick-up in our TFP growth in recent years can be attributed to our economic restructuring efforts, which are important to raise productivity and to transform our industries through innovation and internationalisation. Initiatives like SkillsFuture to upskill our workers and support lifelong learning would have also contributed to this.",4,50,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00050
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Transforming our economy and raising TFP are long-term efforts. We are making progress, but we must continue to focus on these areas in the years ahead, building on the strong tripartite partnership between Government, employers and the Labour Movement.",5,51,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00051

2020-01-06-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. A few supplementary questions for the Minister of State for Manpower. The first question pertains to the data that was shared. The Parliamentary Question seeks information for each of the ITMs – I understand Minister of State said that the ITMs are launched in different years so it would be more useful to provide data in a certain manner. But, there is information provided for Singaporeans, PRs and foreigners between the years 2015 and 2018. Within these years, which ITMs is the Minister of State referring to vis-à-vis the numbers  39,000 Singaporeans, 8,600 PRs and 28,500 foreigners. So, which ITM is the Minister of State referring to?",1,53,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00053
2020-01-06-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question is the statistics for Adapt and Grow, regarding the 93,000 locals. I understand ""locals"" would mean PRs and Singaporeans. Can the Minister of State confirm that? Can he also share the number of Singaporeans and PRs on Adapt and Grow between these years.",2,54,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00054
2020-01-06-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My third question pertains to how information on the ITMs is presented. The roadmaps are not consistent in terms of jobs for Singaporeans, PRs or foreigners, for example. I will give you an example. Construction ITM, if you go on the respective YouTube channels and you see reference on construction, it is very clear, good jobs for Singaporeans, no two ways about that. You go to the Retail ITM, they talk about a future-ready workforce and a professional and skilled workforce. Ostensibly, this would mean a whole range, beyond Singaporeans. Infocomm and Media ITM talks about creating new PMET jobs, 13,000 new PMET jobs and it goes on. So, every ITM is different; understandably so, but will the Ministry in future, in going forward, present that data very clearly for each ITM? PRs, this many; Singaporeans, this many. And there are obvious reasons for this. The conversation becomes more fact-based and you do not have a corrosive conversation about Singaporeans losing jobs to foreigners and so on.",3,55,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00055
2020-01-06-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"Sir, I thank the Member for his questions. The ITMs relate to all the 23 ITMs that you asked for. As I mentioned earlier, the ITMs were only launched in 2016 with the majority of them coming on stream in 2018. The data is still preliminary, so it will take time. It is more meaningful and impactful to measure them as we talked about medium term and long-term developments. Many of these developments are transformative, we are transforming industries, we are transforming companies, doing job redesign, so, it will take time. But the initial indicators look promising. But I do agree and that is why we have not gone into detail yet because it will take some time to stabilise the data.",1,56,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00056

2020-01-06-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"Currently, we need to also follow industry classification of employment statistics which follows statistical standards aligned to international convention and ensures compatibility with employment statistics that we have published in previous years so that it becomes meaningful. It is not just meaningful to put out statistics but you have to also put out comparability. So, we are making progress, but there is still a lot of work to do as we transform. It will take time for data to stabilise and it is something that we can look to and study how we can present this better in the medium and long term. So, I take the Member's point.",3,58,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00058
2020-01-06-T-003,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, perhaps I can ask three further questions on this matter of ITMs. Firstly, have the ITMs made any impact on our economic growth and our job creation? Secondly, have the economic growth and job creation benefited Singaporeans? And thirdly, have the economic growth and job creation benefited Singaporeans more than foreigners?",1,59,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00059
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me address Mr Liang Eng Hwa's three questions holistically. That is the reason why I think it is useful for us to consider both the ITM question and the Total Factor Productivity question together, because all these questions pertain to our strategies to grow our Singapore companies and create good jobs for Singaporeans. Mr Pritam Singh alluded to this issue of the benefits – in fact, asked by Mr Liang Eng Hwa as well – the benefits of our growth towards Singaporeans and on Singaporeans.",1,60,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00060
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let me take the second question first, which is fundamental. Have economic growth and job creation benefited Singaporeans? And more importantly, as Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked, have economic growth and job creation benefited Singaporeans more than foreigners?",2,61,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00061
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the short answer to both questions is a resounding yes. This Government puts Singaporeans at the heart of everything we do. We pursue growth not for growth's sake alone. We pursue growth so as to improve the lives of Singaporeans. I believe Singaporeans understand and support the Government's position.",3,62,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00062

2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To all fellow Singaporeans, I will say this  we understand your worries and we will walk this journey with you. The Government will always have your backs. This is why we have invested so much in SkillsFuture and programmes like Adapt and Grow and the Professional Conversion Programmes. This is why continuing education has been our priority. If we take 20 years to prepare for our first job, it is not enough for us just to assume that the next 30, 40 years of our career lifespan, we do not need any fresh new injection of training and skills.",7,66,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00066

And as I have always said when I was in NTUC, we are not satisfied to put today's unemployed into today's job. Neither are we satisfied to put today's unemployed into tomorrow's job.

Many of them may not have done any upgrading since they started working 20 years ago after their studies. And I want to assure this group of Singaporeans that the Government will do more to support them in staying skilled and employable, not just for now but also for the future. We will talk more about this in the Budget. It is not just about lifelong employment; it is about lifelong employability.",9,68,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00068
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The crux of the Members' questions is this  have we gotten the local-foreigner workforce balance right, not just in terms of quantity but also in terms of quality? These are questions that the Government and our economic agencies constantly ask ourselves. Too few foreign workers, especially PMETs with skills required for our growth sectors, mean that our businesses cannot seize the opportunities out there and, in the process, create better jobs for all Singaporeans. Too many and there will be a push-back, especially if Singaporeans feel unfairly treated. It is a never-ending balancing act with difficult trade-offs. I often ask Singaporeans when I meet them  if we can only bring in one more foreigner to complement the Singapore workforce – one more – who will we bring in? Someone who is above our national average or someone who is below our national average?",10,69,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00069

2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,We know we need the above average foreigner to complement our domestic workforce so that we can build a more competitive economy and to provide better jobs and better pay for all Singaporeans. But we also know that foreigners will compete with us and we need to provide some safeguards for our people. This is an evergreen challenge. How do we grow our existing companies and bring in new investments that can create good jobs for Singaporeans?,12,71,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00071
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let us suppose a Singaporean worker is earning $5,000 today. And we have an option to bring in a new investment that will create two new jobs  one paying $7,000 and another paying $10,000. The Singaporean can only get the $7,000 job today because he does not yet have the skill or experience for the $10,000 job. Should we take the investment?",13,72,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00072
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Singaporean may feel frustrated. He may think that he is being unequally treated because the foreigner earns more than him now. We understand these sentiments. We also want the $10,000 job to go to the Singaporean. But if we do not accept that investment for this reason, it will go elsewhere and both the $7,000 and $10,000 jobs will disappear from Singapore. The Singaporean will continue to earn $5,000 and he will have fewer opportunities to rise to a higher paying job. But what is even more important is that his son or daughter currently in school receiving one of the best education in the world will not be able to aspire to the $7,000 or $10,000 job. So, which is the better outcome and what should we do and do right by Singaporeans, not just for this generation but for the next?",14,73,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00073
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Now, is this story very far-fetched? No. It has happened before. Indeed, in every generation throughout our history as an independent nation. We can learn from how the previous generations deal with this challenge and dilemma. In the 1970s, this happened when we went out to attract the electronics industry. Over a span of three years, the first three semi-conductor companies in Singapore – National Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor and Texas Instruments – created more than 7,000 jobs, but our people did not get the best paying jobs immediately. They certainly did not get all the best paying jobs immediately.",15,74,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00074
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Indeed, many of our Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Singaporeans worked under higher paying foreigners. This was because, at that point in time, we lacked the skills and experience to take the highest paying jobs. But we did not reject those investments as a result. Instead, we worked hard. We learned, upgraded our capabilities, but at no time did we fear. And in time, we took over many of these higher paying jobs, including the better trained and educated children of the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations. Many of those early engineers and technicians went on to become senior executives in this sector and, in turn, they mentored a new generation of Singaporean technicians and engineers in the semiconductor industry that we have today.",16,75,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00075

We have raised our intake of Computer Science students in our Universities in recent years, but there is a limit to further increases. Not every student has the interest or aptitude to study computer science and we also need to groom talent in other sectors for our economy.",18,77,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00077

Colloquially, as we say, our future generation does not need to take over the jobs of the previous generation, earning the salaries of the previous generation. So, do we go out and attract these investments like Google, Grab and Facebook not just for this generation, but, more importantly, for the next generation?",19,78,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00078

Create those jobs in Singapore first. Otherwise, we will lose the $7,000 job and we may never get the $10,000 job. Work hard, train our people, upgrade our skills to take over that $10,000 job as soon as possible.

2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I think most Singaporeans understand and accept why we cannot reject such investments on that basis. Singaporeans are fair-minded. What Singaporeans want is a fair chance to get that $10,000 job as time goes by, if not as soon as possible. What Singaporeans do not want are unfair employment practices where Singaporeans are passed over for non-meritocratic considerations. The Government understands these concerns and we stand together with fellow Singaporeans on this matter.",22,81,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00081

This is our commitment to Singaporeans. MTI and our economic agencies will watch over the enterprises to get them to train up and groom Singaporeans as part of this commitment to Singapore. I believe the vast majority of our companies know the deal. They play ball. They groom Singaporeans not just because we asked them to but because it makes business sense for them to localise and avoid concentration risks for business continuity as well as to grow the Singapore eco-system and win the support and respect of fellow Singaporeans and for generations of Singaporeans to come.

Between 2015 and 2018, local employment increased by nearly 60,000 for the whole economy. The PMET share of local employment increased to 57%, one of the highest rates in the world. It means that for every 100 locals in the workforce, 57 of them are in PMET jobs, one of the highest in the world. And the trend is continuing to grow in that way because we understand the aspirations of our next generation.

The answer is yes. We have done the right things by getting that balance right and the Government will continue to calibrate this balance carefully. That balance is struck by considering three factors  the needs of our industries and enterprises, the needs of our workers of this generation and the opportunities for our children in the next generation. If we get this balance right, as we strive for this Goldilocks balance, we must firmly reject extreme positions, one extreme position being to open the floodgates and drown Singaporeans.

The second question is  now that we have the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) as well as other employment pass criteria in place and the FCF has started since 2014, is MOM considering reviewing it and looking at tighter measures to ensure that recalcitrant companies who do abuse that, are watched carefully?",2,99,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00099

2020-01-06-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Deputy Speaker, o ur manpower policies have benefited many Singaporeans over the years. We have also benefited from the international trade flows and international flows. As shared by the Minister for Trade and Industry earlier on, the calibrated flow of foreigners to supplement our workforce has also been useful, especially as it takes time to build skills that emerging industries need. I use the term ""calibrated workflow"" because we know",1,101,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00101
2020-01-06-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"We are also reducing the Services sector dependency ratio ceiling (DRC) and S Pass sub-DRC over 2020 and 2021 to push businesses to become more manpower-lean and improve job quality. As a result, local PMET employment, as the Minister has shared, has risen. The PMET share of local employment rose from 54% in 2015 to 57% in 2018. Citizen unemployment is 3% in 2018 and has averaged 3.1% since 2015. We have also seen growth in median income at 3.8% per annum since 2015, which is higher than the 3.3% in the preceding three years.",2,102,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00102
2020-01-06-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"So, I think it is important that as we look at these outcomes, while we talk about headline outcomes, it is also the individual work that we do on the ground, like the Adapt and Grow where we manage, support and help job-match Singaporeans to all these new jobs. These are also important aspects in which all these things play a role on how we upgrade our workers, how we invest in them, how we put in place infrastructure to ensure that our workers are trained to sufficiently perform in these jobs.

But we must not be blind to the needs of businesses as well and how good jobs are created today. So, I hope that Members in this House, too, will agree that we all need to be honest with our people that the competition for jobs and for investments is out there; it is international.

2020-01-06-T-003,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thirdly, the Minister also spoke about PMETs and I think one problem that many Members of the House do come across in our work is this phenomenon of under-employment of PMETs who lose their jobs for whatever reason in their 40s or 50s and end up taking a job at a substantially lower pay which may or may not fully utilise the qualifications they have. Would the Minister consider looking into creating an under-unemployment indicator to measure how we are doing in terms of under-employment? There is currently a time-based under-employment indicator, but that just measures part-time work. Will some thought be given to a measure of under-employment in terms of pay and qualifications, so that at least we know how well we are doing on this front, going forward, given that this may be a structural issue that Singapore and other economies face as well?",3,108,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00108
2020-01-06-T-003,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Lastly, the Minister spoke about youth unemployment. What is the Minister's sense of how we are trending in terms of the time taken for our youth who come out of Universities, Polytechnics, ITEs on the time that they take to find permanent employment, as opposed to contract employment, as opposed to internships? Anecdotally, we do hear that there are some challenges there. For example, one resident I encountered said that his daughter, who graduated from one of our Autonomous Universities six months ago, is still looking for a job. Of course, that is just one data point, but what is the trend that the Minister sees on this front, going forward?",4,109,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00109
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you do not mind, maybe let me complete the answers for Mr Patrick Tay's question, and then, I will go on to the four supplementary questions from the Member Mr Leon Perera.",1,110,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00110
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Patrick Tay asked whether the economic agencies will put Singaporeans front and centre in our search for investment and the creation of quality jobs. The answer is Y-E-S, in capital letters. Yes, we do that. We have always done, we are doing that and we will continue to do that. Yes.",2,111,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00111
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let me just share a bit about the work of EDB, ESG and so forth.",3,112,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00112
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"People have asked me, ""Why do we not go and take all the investments that are queuing up at our doors?"" And that is a simple way to do so. But for every investment that we take into Singapore today, we not only consider the land constraints, the carbon constraints, the energy usage and all that kind of things but, most importantly, as the Member has said, we ask ourselves – is this going to create a good job for Singaporeans? Can our Singaporeans take on this job? If not now, if not immediately, can it be in the near future? If not this generation, can it be the next generation, in the fastest possible time? And we have always abided by that principle. Because what is the point of creating the jobs in Singapore if Singaporeans do not have the chance of ever doing it? What is the point of having a good job in Singapore if Singaporeans never have a chance to do it? But how long will it take? It depends.",4,113,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00113
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Edwards Lifesciences, making heart valves. When they wanted to make heart valves, they needed seamstresses. We do not have many seamstresses in Singapore anymore. We went out to search for many homemakers who at least still know how to sew. Train them. Heart valve is not a joke. Each one is $20,000 to $30,000, with high quality control. So, we look at the job and see whether Singaporeans can do it.",5,114,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00114
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I will give Members another example on the other side of the spectrum. ExxonMobil and Shell, they have been in Singapore for decades. Today, we are very proud, the Heads of ExxonMobil and Shell operations in Singapore are both Singaporeans. But they did not get to the top job to head the ExxonMobil and Shell operations in Singapore in one step. Mr Gan Seow Kee and Ms Goh Swee Chen went around the world, took on various appointments in ExxonMobil and Shell, acquired the skills and experience and, today, these top jobs are helmed by Singaporeans. We are very proud of them.",6,115,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00115
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But we never feared, because when ExxonMobil and Shell first came to Singapore, we were far away from taking any of those top jobs. But today, we have people there. So, that is my assurance to Mr Patrick Tay and all the brothers and sisters in the Labour Movement. You have an ex-Secretary General as Minister for Trade and Industry now.",7,116,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00116
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To the four questions that Mr Leon Perera asked, first, outliers. Indeed, we look at all the outliers. We look at everyone that does better than us and ask ourselves  why are they doing better than us? But I want to caution against reading too much into some of the statistical anomalies. Because, statistically, the TFP is a residual, after you take away the capital and the labour inputs. In fact, as an example, during the Global Financial Crisis, when we rebounded from the Global Financial Crisis, that particular year, our TFP was over 9%. It cannot be accounted for by all the labour and input factors. It is probably accounted for, largely, by the growth momentum and economies of scale, not even just by R&D and so forth.",8,117,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00117
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But we are highly cognisant of the fact that, going forward, for us to improve our productivity, we need to emphasise much more on research and development, and not just research and development but the translation of the outcomes of research and development into commercial enterprises. And we are going to do that. That is why I talked about, just now, the revamping of our business models, internationalisation and so forth. All these will add up to strengthen our Total Factor Productivity beyond a residual of what can be accounted for by capital and labour inputs. So, that is the answer to the first question.",9,118,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00118
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second question  do we look at forward indicators? Of course. MTI looks at all sorts of indicators and, definitely, forward indicators. But having said that, the Member asked what is the outlook for the economy this year. We can take a leaf from the economic performance last year. How did we avoid a recession last year? Last year, a large part of our economy was actually under the water. The downturn in the global electronics cycle has hit our Semiconductor and Electronics sectors. The structural and cyclical factors have also pulled down our performance in the Retail sector.",10,119,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00119
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the other hand, there are three sectors, three shining examples holding up the economy – Banking and Finance, Professional Services, ICT. By design – this is a design feature of our economy – we have diversified our economy. And because we have diversified our economy, we have avoided the extremes of either recession or very sharp ups and very sharp downs. That is how we have to continue to navigate carefully. Diversification gives us resilience but diversification also comes with a cost. When the global electronics cycle goes up, if we have just depended on the global electronics cycle, we might get a 20% growth in that sector. But that is not sustainable. So, we have diversified our economy as we matured over the years and, today, our performance is much more stable, providing a stable platform for us to continue to invest to create good jobs for Singaporeans tomorrow. That is the answer to the second question.",11,120,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00120
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To the third question, let me amplify what I have just said. We spent 20 years of our life preparing for the first job. We spent 20 years of training and education preparing every Singaporean child for the first job. But let us ask ourselves, how much do we invest in the next 40, 50 years for the subsequent second, third, fourth, fifth job? This is a challenge which the whole world is waking up to, but not the whole world has the means and the organisation to tackle this. We will announce more plans to tackle this in the Budget.",12,121,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00121
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We know that people in their 40s and 50s, including those in the ICT sector, they need a skills top-up, they need a refresh. In fact, when I was in Switzerland some years back as the NTUC Secretary-General, I learned one thing from the Swiss. They never plan to top up their skills at 55 and 60 years old to extend the career lifespan of their people. They told me it is too late. The correct approach is that every 10 years or so, if we can afford it and have the organisation, we should top up the skills of each and every one of our workers. This is the same thing I challenged the Public Service to do. Even if someone wants to join the Public Service for 50 years, we cannot assume that the same skill sets will be necessary and sufficient for the 50 years.",13,122,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00122
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Continuous training must be in our DNA and then we can get into lifelong employability and not lifelong employment. So, we will do more because we understand and I would say that we would start with the 40s and 50s but, if we have the chance, to extend it to even the 30s, as time comes.",14,123,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00123
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Youth unemployment. It is a theoretical argument as to how to calculate under-employment. But what is even most important is not how we calculate under-employment. What is most important to get people out of under-employment is to grow the job opportunities for them to go on and take on better-paying jobs. This is why, in MTI's strategy, we are spending so much effort to strengthen the mid-sized companies, so that they can create more and better-paying jobs, more opportunities, for the rest of Singaporeans who are not in such high-paying jobs to get into those jobs.",15,124,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00124
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, yes, we will look at how to get the statistics but I will go beyond what the Member suggested. And, in fact, we have done that. We will go beyond to make sure that we create those good jobs to pull Singaporeans out from the lower productivity sectors, so that they can enjoy the good wage growth that is commensurate with our economic growth. That is our promise to all Singaporeans.",16,125,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00125
2020-01-06-T-003,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Last question, Mr Pritam Singh.",1,126,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00126
2020-01-06-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, my original Parliamentary Question really was a question seeking data. The Minister for Trade and Industry spoke of the local PMET share going up from 54% to 57%. My question really is, can we expect in future, either by way of Parliamentary Question or by the Government on its own accord, dividing that into Singaporeans and PRs? If the Government's approach is, ""No, we are not going to provide that data"", can the Minister please share that detail with us here? Because it is pointless for us to keep asking for the data if the Government is not going to provide it.",1,127,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00127

2020-01-06-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Sir, if that is the case, then for the 60,000 local jobs, how many were for Singaporeans and how many went to PRs?",1,130,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00130
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We can get the Member the numbers but let me say this. What is the point behind the questions? First, has local unemployment increased with all these efforts? The answer is a resounding no. Our people are getting good jobs. Are our wages going up? Yes, and it is faster than many other countries. Those are the proof points to show that we are doing right by Singaporeans. I am always very cautious about this constant divide – Singaporeans versus PRs. The insinuation seems to be that somehow Singaporeans are not benefiting. I have just spent the last half an hour explaining and sharing with this House how we are working hard to make sure that Singaporeans do so.",1,131,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00131
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"It is not the data. It is the point of the question. And I would like to remind this House, the ultimate competition is not pitting Singaporeans against the PRs; it is about Team Singapore comprising Singaporeans and PRs, and even the foreign workforce complementing, competing to give Singaporeans the best chance possible.",2,132,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00132
2020-01-06-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,How many of the increased jobs go to Singaporeans? Enough for us to keep the unemployment rate at the level which many countries would say it is fiction. And that is how we have done it.,3,133,2020-01-06-T-003-S-00133
2020-01-06-T-004,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,"asked the Minister for Transport given the ban on users of personal mobility devices from all footpaths, whether there are plans to distinguish the different types of public paths so as to avoid confusion.",1,134,2020-01-06-T-004-S-00134

2020-01-06-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Government has committed additional resources to police the ban of PMDs from footpaths from January 2020 such that the public will not witness the same level of day-to-day flagrant breaches of law by errant e-scooter users as seen prior to the announcement of the ban.,1,137,2020-01-06-T-004-S-00137
2020-01-06-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Transport in light of some food delivery riders switching from e-scooters to electric bikes (a) whether the Government is putting in place additional measures to ensure that the increase in electric bike riders will not lead to more accidents or road traffic or active mobility offences; and (b) whether such riders will be given sufficient training sessions to encourage all to ride responsibly and considerately.,1,138,2020-01-06-T-004-S-00138

2020-01-06-T-004,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The decision to ban e-scooters on footpaths is to restore footpath safety. Since the implementation of the ban on 5 November 2019, the number of accidents involving e-scooters on public paths has dropped by about 30%. As we step up enforcement, we can expect further reduction in such accidents. From a recent telephone poll commissioned by REACH, two out of three respondents agreed that safety on footpaths had improved since the ban.

Amongst them, about 34%, or 2,100 do four deliveries or more per day. As of 31 December 2019, LTA has received 3,550 applications from eligible riders and approved all applications after accounting for duplicates. Twenty percent of these applicants have already transited to alternative devices.

Can I ask how many of these are for e-bicycles and others? The second supplementary question is about the bicycle lane that he had announced. He has not announced how many more kilometres; he has just announced that it is being accelerated. But what are the planned parameters?

And would the Member also not agree that the law should apply even if those who have put out the falsehoods thus far happen to have political affiliations?",4,162,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00162
2020-01-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Furthermore, POFMA requires that the Minister provide the basis in accordance with existing laws for her or his determination that a statement is a falsehood. In the recent cases, the falsehoods and the reasons for using POFMA were made clear in the clarifications that were issued by the respective Ministries. If the recipient of the POFMA Direction disputes the facts, quick and inexpensive recourse to the Courts is available. These provisions ensure transparency and accountability in the POFMA process.",5,163,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00163
2020-01-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, the Nominated Member also asked if there are plans to create a central listing of POFMA Directions. All Government Corrections issued under POFMA are already compiled in a section of the Government’s fact-checking website, ""Factually"". In addition, the POFMA Office website has a list of the press releases issued together with the POFMA Directions.",6,164,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00164
2020-01-06-T-005,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister for the very considered responses. The Minister had assured the House and the public in May last year when we were debating on the POFMA Bill that the Bill will not be far-reaching using the example of the 39 take-down orders under the Broadcasting Act since 1996. I think he mentioned that it was an average of one a year. POFMA has been used five times within a month, and just two months after coming into effect. Will the Minister please clarify if this considered far-reaching or not?",1,165,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00165
2020-01-06-T-005,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),The second question I have is  the Minister has clarified that POFMA has a central listing on its website. But could I ask the Minister to clarify if the POFMA Office will provide a full description of the public interest rationale each time that POFMA is used according to section 7(1b) of POFMA. There are actually six specific public interest thresholds that are listed there in the Act.,2,166,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00166
2020-01-06-T-005,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Last but not least, could I ask the Minister  we all agree that we are seeing an alarming rise of fake news. Can the Minister enlighten us on the number of fake news that are monitored and flagged by the POFMA Office and the various Ministries every month? I know that Thailand's anti-fake news centre talked about 8,000 fake news that were monitored and flagged just within the month of November 2019 alone. Can the Minister assure the House and Singaporeans that the Ministries and the POFMA Office are also monitoring and flagging news to use POFMA on, whether non-partisan or partisan? For example, the fake NUS Facebook group ran for a while without being ""POFMA-ed"" until Facebook, itself, took it down.",3,167,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00167
2020-01-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member asked several questions. Let me try and deal with them. First, is the use of the legislation appropriate, measured and fit for purpose? And I think the question is yes. I do not think that you should go by the sheer number of times that it has been used in this period. I think it is a confluence of factors that has led to that. But if you look at the facts of the matter, it is very simple.",1,168,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00168
2020-01-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In each and every case, the Minister, advised by his officials, has had to ascertain that there was a falsehood in accordance with our existing law. Second, he or she has had to be satisfied that there is a public interest requirement. Third, they have explained clearly – each Ministry in each of its Directions, it has issued a clear clarification as to what the falsehood is and why POFMA is being used, and that includes, therefore, a broad explanation as to what is the public interest consideration, which is encompassed in there. And thereafter, avenues of appeal are available to the Minister, as indeed some have chosen to exercise and the recourse to Courts is also available.",2,169,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00169
2020-01-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, if you look at it in its totality, I think there is proportionality, there is fit for purpose and we have taken actions according to the situation as warranted.",3,170,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00170
2020-01-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Member has asked about the public interest rationale according to section 7. The fact of the matter is, and if you read the section carefully, it starts by saying ""without detracting from the generality” of the point of “public interest"", and then proceeds to list a few examples. Those are intended to be illustrative but they are not exhaustive. What that means therefore is when the Act is exercised, the clarification and the explanation given in that clarification notice by the Minister will have the evidence to support the public interest case. [Please refer to ""Clarification by Minister for Communications and Information"", Official Report, 6 January 2020, Vol 94, Issue No 115, Correction by Written Statement section.]",4,171,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00171
2020-01-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I think the final point is on tracking and numbers. We do track but I do not think we have the resources to go around policing this in great degree. But I would add, if indeed the numbers are anything like what the Member has cited for Thailand, if it runs into thousands, then four or five POFMA cases is, I think, quite proportional and not at all far-reaching.",5,172,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00172
2020-01-06-T-005,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister. I just have two supplementary questions. The first one is  does the identity of the person making the false statement matter for the public interest test, that is independently of other factors? And I would hope that the Minister could make clear that it is virality, the damage that the statement causes that matters and not who says it. Otherwise, I am very worried that it might look as if the Government is setting up speed traps where perhaps Opposition politicians drive but not elsewhere. And that is a real concern, I think.",1,173,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00173
2020-01-06-T-005,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Second, would the Minister agree that for the falsehoods which are not viral or rapidly damaging – the slow drip problems – could it be more effective to combat these with education and information rather than a Correction Order? And Parliament had agreed that these powers under the POFMA were necessary to quickly correct falsehoods that might turn a spark into a flame. But those powers do not seem as well-suited for educating the public about our financial reserves or about our labour market policy.",2,174,2020-01-06-T-005-S-00174

2020-01-06-T-007,,,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how is the public interest threshold of online statements of falsehoods determined and measured under the Protection From Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA); (b) whether the Ministry will consider recommending that Ministers state which public interest criteria under section 7(1b) of POFMA are met and how so, when requesting for a direction to be issued; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider creating a central listing of all issued directions on the POFMA website.",1,185,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00185
2020-01-06-T-007,,,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the Ministry's position on perceptions of a partisan political bias over the recent applications of POFMA and how this may impact public trust in objectivity and independence of the Government's instruments of combatting online falsehoods; and (b) what steps are being taken to maintain public trust in light of such perceptions, especially given the critical role of public trust in buttressing society against coordinated, malicious fake news.",1,186,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00186
2020-01-06-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"Much obliged, Mr Deputy Speaker.",1,187,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00187
2020-01-06-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"I think the Member had a few questions on first the question was the identity of the person or entity who puts out the falsehood matter. As I have explained very clearly the process, and I think this was widely convassed during the debate on the Second Reading, the focus is on the fact, or falsehood as it were, in accordance, and do we have the existing legislation that backs that assessment and secondly, whether there is a public interest concerned that merits action. That is a judgement made by the Minister, the domain Minister advised by his officials.",2,188,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00188
2020-01-06-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"Therefore, the answer is, and I think what the Member is alluding to, is the fact that the first few POFMA actions appear to have been issued against individuals who are either politicians or affiliated with political party or political parties. I would say that that is a convergence, some might say unfortunate convergence or coincidence, but also indicate to a certain pattern of communication that exists out there. But whatever the case may be that is the situation today but it does not mean that that is going to be the situation going forward. Because ultimately whether there is a falsehood, there is a public threshold and if so, then what is the appropriate course of action.",3,189,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00189
2020-01-06-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"The point was also made about falsehoods that are not viral whether we can use alternative mechanisms. I think in talking about, in discussing this matter we have to look by virility, which was one of the points, but remember we also talked about the virulence of the falsehood. And you have to take both into account, because there will be instances where the nature of the falsehood is such that it goes to the core of the credibility and the standing of our institutions and it deserves a response under POFMA. And such a response has the additional impact of ensuring that future such commentary would be guided or advised by this action. So, there is a multiplicty of factors and I think it would be a too blunt to just look at it in terms of one criterion like virility.",4,190,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00190
2020-01-06-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"Having said that I think the Member's point was do we have alternative mechanisms, and I want to assure him that we continue to be actively involved in the education of our citizens on this matter. In fact, both Ms Anthea Ong and Mr Walter Theseira have raised this point before during the Second Reading. It is an important point that we have an educated, discerning citizenry, we must ensure they are well informed.",5,191,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00191
2020-01-06-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"I would add that we have also, if Members would have noticed, in some cases issued statements rather than a POFMA direction. And that has also occurred in the last several weeks. So, I think if you look at it in totality, we have to take into account the overall impact and then we have to consider what is the proportionate response and then, be prepared to take it and if it so happens that some of the people involved are politically affiliated, well, that is the consequence of their actions.",6,192,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00192
2020-01-06-T-007,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"I thank the Minister again. In terms of the thousands of fake news that are possibly floating around the Internet – and you have turned my question around to answer my other question which is pretty brilliant, I must say – yes, it does not seem far reaching when you turned it around to say that way. But my question was actually given there are thousands of fake news floating around in the Web, does the POFMA Office monitor and flag the non-partisan news and statements that are made. Because there are so many out there, one of which that came to my mind was the fake NUS group and we did not do anything until Facebook took it down themselves. So, my concern is – and the Minister could be right it could just be a convergence of consequences and circumstances – but to have four or five directions POFMA that so partisan in nature, you would understand why there are really genuine concerns from the ground, especially like I said, there are actually thousands of fake news out there that could also be in the public interest to actually POFMA them.",1,193,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00193
2020-01-06-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I did not mean to turn it around. I was merely using the facts that the Member cited to make the case. But having said that I think the key point here is first do we monitor. As I said the resources are limited but yes there is some effort to monitor because we have to ensure that having set out this legislation and its intent, we do follow it through in practice. But in some ways it is no different for the other kinds of activities that we have too. If you take, for example, things to do with online gambling and so on, we try to do some pre-emptive, but we also have to to rely sometimes on reports or inputs coming in and our POFMA Office people combined with several other agencies make the assessment and so on.",1,194,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00194
2020-01-06-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, the answer is yes there is some effort to monitor but, primarily, I think we are looking at those cases which are egregious and those that are egregious will pop up quite naturally and we know what they are and we can deal with it.",2,195,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00195

2020-01-06-T-007,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"That is an interesting point because the Member seems to be making the argument that, if instead of four against the previous four cases, we now had eight and four were non-partisan, that would look better?",1,198,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00198
2020-01-06-T-007,,,"Well, I beg to differ. But I would say that I think basically we monitor. I think if the Member's point is, are we only training our sights on certain types of people or organisations, the answer is no. The Member can actually see that from the kind of actions that are being taken. And I think, as I have said and I am prepared to re-state this, which is that our response will be targeted and proportional. I think we have to look at it in the context of all that we have described and we have to take appropriate action.",1,199,2020-01-06-T-007-S-00199
2020-01-06-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,asked the Minister for Communications and Information what is the rationale for the obligations placed on digital advertising intermediaries and internet intermediaries under the Code of Practice for Transparency of Online Political Advertisements issued by the POFMA Office on 2 October 2019.,1,200,2020-01-06-T-008-S-00200

2020-01-06-T-008,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"The Code requires these prescribed intermediaries to ensure that online political advertisements carry disclosure notices to inform readers of the person or organisation that had placed or paid for the political advertisements. Intermediaries are also required to put in place other accountability measures, such as the maintenance of a database of online political advertisements, and the provision of channels for members of the public to report advertisements that are undisclosed.",2,202,2020-01-06-T-008-S-00202

2020-01-06-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. A few Supplementary Questions for the Minister. First, let me clarify that I have no issue with public disclosure of the originator of any online advertisements and so I agree totally that the public deserves to know who is behind the advertisement.",1,206,2020-01-06-T-008-S-00206
2020-01-06-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"My concerns are a few. One, the Code of Practice is issued under POFMA which presumably means that the concern is fake news but would the Minister confirm really that this Code of Practice will apply to all online advertisements whether or not the contents contain any news alleged to be fake or not. That is the first question.",2,207,2020-01-06-T-008-S-00207
2020-01-06-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question, if you look at the Code of Practice at 6(c), this is the part where the companies have to maintain records for viewing by the POFMA Office. That means not for public viewing but by the POFMA Office and the details of the information include copy of the advertisement, name of the originator, the amount paid for the advertisement, description of the advertisements' intended target audience or viewers reached, number of views and so on. So, my question is if the advertisement has nothing fake or alleged to be fake in it, what is the interest of the POFMA Office to know these things.",3,208,2020-01-06-T-008-S-00208
2020-01-06-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for agreeing that disclosure is important. I think that is a good starting point. The question is then whether this disclosure requirement applies to all advertisements because it is a code under the POFMA Act and the answer is yes, it does. And I think if the Member read the POFMA Bill, she would know that there is an over-arching coverage to the Bill which includes amongst other things a need to have disclosure and, or requiring disclosure in advertising because this is an important part of the way communication is conducted today. In the event that there is falsehood in the advertisement, POFMA can be potentially be applied as well.",1,209,2020-01-06-T-008-S-00209
2020-01-06-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Then, I think the Member asked about under 6(c), there is a list of details that are required and why the POFMA Office needs these. This is a requirement imposed on the intermediaries to keep the information. It does not mean that POFMA Office has to have access to this information but the information must be available so that in the event that action is required, the relevant information is available.",2,210,2020-01-06-T-008-S-00210
2020-01-06-T-008,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I would add that the Member might want to look at practices, for example, by Facebook which today in fact has the same kind of disclosure requirement and they make them publicly available and they have a register on it, including almost everything that the Member just described.

I would like to ask the Minister despite his allusion to the fact that the POFMA Office will only go back if there is a suspected falsehood in the advertisement, the fact is that there is nothing in the Code that stops the POFMA Office from going back at any time to look at their record, even if the advertisement has no problems.

But the fact of the matter is, if you think about today's, let us just take it in practical terms. Today, if you want to take out political advertising through, let us say, the English social media platforms. Google is not taking them; Twitter is not taking them; and it is a global policy not to take political ads; and Facebook is making full disclosure – more than the disclosure that we require through this Code.",1,216,2020-01-06-T-008-S-00216

2020-01-06-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"Section 26D of the Penal Code was introduced under the CLRA to codify the common law definition of knowledge. Its current form reflects the Penal Code Review Committee’s decision not to provide for the concept of ""wilful blindness"" as part of section 26D. The Committee had assessed the case law, and especially the Court of Appeal’s decision in 2011 in Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor [2011] 4 SLR 1156, and concluded that ""wilful blindness"" was simply an evidential tool used to infer that an accused had knowledge. The Committee concluded that there was thus no need to provide for the concept of ""wilful blindness"" in section 26D.",19,253,2020-01-06-T-016-S-00253
2020-01-06-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"After the passage of the CLRA, however, the Court of Appeal delivered its decision in Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor [2019] 2 SLR 254. The Court of Appeal held that ""wilful blindness"" is properly described as a mental state falling short of knowledge but which is legally deemed to be equivalent to knowledge. The Court described this as an ""extended conception of wilful blindness"", where ""it can almost be said"" that the accused persons knew the fact in question. This position represents the law today.",20,254,2020-01-06-T-016-S-00254
2020-01-06-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"Therefore, if section 26D is brought into force as it was originally drafted, this would abolish the ""extended conception of wilful blindness"" under this case authority.

2020-01-06-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"For completeness, Mr Deputy Speaker, I should point out that the Court of Appeal had explained that there are three elements to the ""extended conception of wilful blindness"", and these are namely  one, the accused must have had a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion of the fact to which he is said to have been wilfully blind; two, there must have been reasonable means of inquiry available to the accused person, which, if taken, would have led him to discovery of the truth, at least in the context of the fact of possession; and three, the accused must have deliberately refused to pursue the reasonable means of inquiry so as to avoid having such negative legal consequences as might arise in connection with his knowing that fact.",23,257,2020-01-06-T-016-S-00257
2020-01-06-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"The Court of Appeal limited this ""extended conception of wilful blindness"" to the context of knowledge for the purpose of proving possession under section 18(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act in this case, and recognised that it may be different with respect to knowledge of the nature of the drug under section 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.",24,258,2020-01-06-T-016-S-00258

This is to allow for further development of the doctrine of ""wilful blindness"" by the common law. This is important because the Court of Appeal had suggested that the doctrine might apply slightly differently in practice, depending on what specific fact an accused is said to have been wilfully blind towards.",25,259,2020-01-06-T-016-S-00259

2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Foreign banks that wished to participate in the Asian Dollar Market through their ACU had to meet high standards of admission and have reputable home regulators exercising oversight of their global operations. Those that also engaged in domestic businesses in Singapore through the DBU were then subject to additional prudential requirements from MAS, such as limits on large exposure and equity investment.",12,294,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00294
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The DBU-ACU divide provided a way to safeguard domestic financial stability, without unduly impinging on the growth of offshore banking activities conducted out of Singapore.",13,295,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00295
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),It also provided a simple basis for awarding developmental incentives to encourage the growth of offshore banking activities out of Singapore.,14,296,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00296
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"While the DBU-ACU divide has served us well for decades, it is no longer relevant and will be removed because of the following reasons",15,297,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00297
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, regulatory reforms since the Global Financial Crisis have put all banks around the world on a sounder footing. These developments mean that there is less need to distinguish between banks' offshore and domestic banking activities. All home regulators including Singapore will now require their banks to meet enhanced standards on a group-wide and global basis, which includes their branches and subsidiaries in Singapore. So, for example, new global rules have raised the amount and quality of capital with the introduction of a minimum 4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio requirement, and have introduced minimum standards on the amount of liquidity buffers that banks need to hold. Global regulators have also agreed on a common framework to control large exposures to a single counterparty or a group of connected counterparties, limiting these exposures to 25% of Tier 1 capital.",16,298,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00298
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Second, MAS has also enhanced its regulatory framework over time which has made the divide less meaningful. For example, banks in Singapore are required to meet liquidity requirements based on all-currency and Singapore dollar criteria, rather than DBU or ACU. MAS has also introduced the framework for domestic systemically important banks. Designated banks are subject to additional supervisory measures covering both their domestic and offshore businesses. So, a lot has changed in terms of the regulatory environment.",17,299,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00299
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Globally, you have higher standards now after GFC that covers all banks, offshore as well as onshore. Secondly, within domestic regulation, standards have risen and also blurred the lines between what is DBU and what is traditionally ACU. And the third reason is MAS' developmental incentives have also broadened. In the past, MAS' incentives were focused on the ACU to encourage the growth of offshore banking activities out of Singapore.",18,300,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00300
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Today, MAS assesses the developmental merits of an activity much more broadly, and no longer based on domestic versus offshore distinction. As a result, the DBU-ACU divide is no longer useful, and will impose a compliance burden on banks with little benefits to prudential soundness or systemic stability.",19,301,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00301
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Therefore, the Bill will remove DBU-ACU divide and make corresponding consequential amendments to the relevant provisions in the Banking Act. These include amendments to – (a) rank uninsured non-bank deposits in insolvency by the currency denomination of the deposits, that is, Singapore dollar or a foreign currency, rather than by DBU or ACU; (b) apply asset maintenance ratios on Singapore dollar non-bank deposits, instead of DBU non-bank deposits; and (c) remove the regulatory limits imposed on the Singapore branches of foreign banks for equity investments, immovable property and large exposures. These limits are no longer necessary. MAS will rely on the consolidated supervision by these banks' home supervisors to manage such risks at the bank group level.",20,302,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00302

2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, expand grounds for revocation of bank licence. In line with the international regulatory standards and practice, MAS has the power to revoke bank licences under certain circumstances, such as when a bank – (a) is carrying on its business in a manner likely to be detrimental to the interests of the depositors of the bank; (b) is contravening the provisions of the Banking Act; or (c) in the case of a foreign bank branch in Singapore, has had its licence in its home jurisdiction withdrawn by its parent supervisory authority.",28,310,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00310

So, ACRA is the auditor of the auditor. So, we are amending the Third Schedule of the Banking Act to allow ACRA access to complete bank audit working papers, which includes customer information, and that would enable ACRA to review the auditors more effectively. For example, ACRA can evaluate if the external auditor has assessed the credit quality of customers and the adequacy of provisions appropriately, against market information.

2020-01-06-T-017,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"First, measuring risks. We know that bookkeeping carbon emissions produced by assets on a bank' balance sheet is always a challenge. However, here in Singapore, existing avenues, such as the Carbon Pricing Act, already allows banks to obtain carbon emissions-related data and estimate their borrower's exposure to carbon regulation and transition risks. Facilities with higher than 2,000 tCO2 emissions report their emissions to NEA. Such data should be used for carbon risk assessment and be mandated for reporting by SGX-listed companies. Jurisdictions like Hong Kong already require this. We should institute this so that our banks have clear and comparable data to measure the risk exposure of their public-listed clients.",5,346,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00346
2020-01-06-T-017,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"As a former corporate banker myself, I would even push for data collection beyond just carbon emissions data. Our bankers must also obtain information from borrowers to understand where business value could be at risk. The 2011 floods in Thailand are a critical example of how risks could be embedded in the supply chain and may not be obvious through a carbon data metric. Operating loss from the floods incurred by Toyota and Honda increased by 37% and 55% respectively in 2011.",6,347,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00347

Credit risk metrics have historically been insufficient in addressing tail-end risks. Metrics that simply average potential risk across multiple years underestimate potential impact. Solely focusing on high-carbon assets is a good first step but still insufficient. Stress testing portfolio risk is also an important part of risk management. Stress test scenarios should be centrally-developed, not individually designed, to ensure that there is alignment to the Paris Agreement target and geographically-relevant worst-case scenarios.",7,348,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00348

2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Louis Ng asked why the considerations for revoking a bank licence on the ground of public interest are not set out in legislation, given that revocation is a drastic step. Mr Ng also sought confirmation that MAS would only revoke bank licences on the ground of public interest for the most serious of cases.",2,367,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00367
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Revoking a bank licence is, indeed, a very drastic measure. MAS is very cognisant that it is the most severe regulatory action that it can take with respect to a bank. MAS, therefore, has a strong and inherent incentive to use this power judiciously, as a licence revocation means the bank will have to stop business, affecting its customers as well as other stakeholders, such as shareholders and employees. If it is not done right, or not based on strong grounds, it will affect our credibility and reputation as a global financial centre.",3,368,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00368
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Therefore, as far as possible, MAS has set out specific grounds on which it may revoke a bank licence in the Banking Act. These include situations where a bank has contravened the Banking Act or is carrying on its business in a manner likely to be detrimental to its depositors' interest.",4,369,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00369
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In all cases, MAS will consider the circumstances for licence revocations set out in the Enforcement Monograph, which provides guidance to the industry on the underlying principles guiding MAS' use of enforcement actions.",5,370,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00370
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"That said, as the banking sector will continue to evolve, it is not possible to anticipate all circumstances under which MAS may revoke a bank licence. The ground of public interest thus provides MAS with the option to take timely action in unanticipated circumstances to protect the public interest.",6,371,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00371
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me cite an example. In 2016, MAS withdrew the merchant bank status of BSI Bank and Falcon Bank – both were merchant banks – because both banks had committed serious breaches of MAS' anti-money laundering requirements and there was gross misconduct by their management and staff.",7,372,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00372
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,MAS also considered at that time the wider public interest in closing these banks in order to safeguard Singapore's reputation as a clean and trusted financial centre and to send a strong deterrent message that such breaches and misconduct will not be tolerated. Those powers were provided under the MAS Act in relation to merchant banks. This latest amendment to the Banking Act will extend the use of the public interest ground to the revocation of bank licences.,8,373,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00373
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I have mentioned earlier that the public interest ground is in line with practices in other jurisdictions, such as Australia and Hong Kong. This ground is also not unique to banks, as MAS already has the same revocation power on public interest grounds for other classes of financial institutions it currently supervises. Mr Ng can be assured that the proposed public interest ground for bank licence revocations will be reserved for the most serious of cases.",9,374,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00374

Mr Louis Ng asked why the approval requirements for credit card or charge card licensees differ from that of banks.",10,375,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00375
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MAS calibrates its licensing and regulatory requirements to be commensurate with the risks posed by financial institutions. Credit and charge card licensees conduct limited business activities, while banks conduct a wider range of activities, such as deposit-taking and lending, in addition to credit and charge card issuance. Hence, the thresholds for MAS to approve controllers and key appointment holders are tiered accordingly.",11,376,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00376
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Ng also requested more information on the enforcement of the ""fit and proper"" requirement by MAS. The requirement is an essential component of MAS' regulatory framework. Applicants must declare their fitness and propriety when they apply for MAS' approval. MAS conducts checks on these individuals before approval and may take action to remove such individuals where necessary. So, it is actually actively being implemented.",12,377,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00377
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Louis Ng also asked whether MAS would consider prescribing a list of executive officers in subsidiary legislation to prevent banks from circumventing MAS' requirements on related party transactions. As Mr Ng has rightly pointed out, an executive officer of a bank in Singapore and his or her family members would be considered as related parties of the bank. ""Executive officer"", in relation to a bank, is already defined in section 2 of the Banking Act. This qualitative definition is familiar to the industry. The term is also used in other sections of the Banking Act as well as other MAS-administered legislation.",13,378,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00378
2020-01-06-T-017,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This approach is preferred to a listing of job titles or designations as it is able to better capture persons holding managerial roles and responsibilities and is less likely to be affected by differences in nomenclature among banks or changes in specific designations over time. In fact, if we are too definitive in spelling out all the designations, our worry is, it makes it even easier to circumvent. It is much better that the industry, which already understand the definition, live by the definition and the spirit of the definition. MAS assesses that the risk of circumvention now, based on the banking industry's understanding of the definition, is low, given the common understanding of the scope of an executive officer.",14,379,2020-01-06-T-017-S-00379

These are all matters of paramount importance. Today, premises which are used as hospitals, medical clinics, nursing homes and clinical laboratories in Singapore are licensed under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA). The PHMCA was enacted in 1980 and sets minimum standards for licensees' premises, personnel as well as processes to safeguard patient safety and welfare. The PHMCA was last amended in 1999 and the regulatory framework needs to be refreshed and updated to address today's rapidly-evolving healthcare landscape.",2,397,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00397

Hence, to provide more appropriate and accessible healthcare to our ageing population, there needs to be a shift in care models to align ourselves with one of my Ministry's ""Three Beyonds"" – ""Beyond Hospital to Community"". There will, therefore, be more vertical and also horizontal integration across traditional healthcare settings. For example, nursing homes may now be able to also provide dementia care and geriatric clinical services within one location.

This may be possible today when hospitals or medical clinics provide telemedicine or mobile medical services, on top of their premises-based care. In other words, they provide premises-based care and, on top of that, also provide telemedicine or other mobile medical services. There is, therefore, a need to move beyond just regulating premises or to be premises-based in the regulation framework, to also be able to look at regulating services delivered beyond the premises, if we want to ensure the safe delivery of such services into the community or done remotely, as I have mentioned, through telemedicine.",5,400,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00400

Moreover, there are a variety of new services since then on offer and things have changed, for example, medical transportation, video conferencing, tele-conferencing and even tissue and bone banking.

2020-01-06-T-018,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Sixth, can the Minister also explain with some details of the Quality Assurance Committee? How is it going to work? What are the main objectives and desired goals and how will they function?",7,465,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00465
2020-01-06-T-018,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Seventh, with the move from premises-based to service-based licencing, many are concerned with the rise in the costs they have to pay. What will be the framework or formula for this conversion and can the Minister ensure that the hike will be within reasonable limits? This is especially so with the current economic climate, as we update this Bill to execution.",8,466,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00466
2020-01-06-T-018,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Eighth, pertaining to the process of mapping services at the healthcare premises, how fast can the request for new services be processed? Also, will the spectrum of point of care tests permissible be reviewed from time to time to incorporate the latest and the updated?",9,467,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00467
2020-01-06-T-018,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Finally, the ninth point, on the co-location of licensed and unlicensed services within the same premises, can the guidelines be made clear and succinct? This is because I feel that this can be a potential area for abuse and also misinterpretation. Take, for example, the beauty and wellness industry. It is not within the scope of this Bill. Neither is Traditional Medicine and Complementary Medicine. But these are exactly some of the services which may potentially co-exist on the same premises as a licensed service. So, therefore, there could be some loopholes there. Notwithstanding these clarifications, Sir, I do support this Bill.",10,468,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00468
2020-01-06-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Deputy Speaker, Sir, I note that MOH has proceeded cautiously in presenting this Bill. According to the MOH website, it started consulting on this matter in 2016 and published a draft Bill two years ago for scrutiny and feedback.",1,469,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00469
2020-01-06-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The Bill today is quite different from the draft Bill in some respects, which the Senior Minister of State explained briefly earlier.",2,470,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00470
2020-01-06-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"While I agree that Government oversight of healthcare services is necessary to protect patient welfare, I have some queries and concerns about the Bill. These concerns relate to the Bill's phased coverage, price transparency, quality assurance and the National Electronic Health Records System (NEHR).",3,471,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00471
2020-01-06-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, the Bill's phased coverage. Clause 5 states that the Bill does not apply to any healthcare service provided by the Government. And earlier, the Senior Minister of State did explain that Government-provided services included those under the Singapore Armed Forces and the Singapore Civil Defence Force. So, I take it that restructured hospitals, polyclinics and also primary care providers will be covered under the Bill. It is a question of at which phase they are included.",4,472,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00472
2020-01-06-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Again, related to the issue of coverage, I was originally a little puzzled by the First Schedule because it stated only certain specific types of healthcare services which will be required to licensable, particularly clinical support services and some specialised laboratory-type services. I was puzzled because I had previously raised concerns about the private ambulance services used by consumers and also the feedback from residents about poor quality service and also hidden charges not being feasible at the time of booking. But I believe that, if I heard the Senior Minister of State correctly, he mentioned that this would come under phase 2 of the implementation. So, I would like him to confirm that emergency ambulance services and such related conveyance services would be actually included for regulation under phase 2.",5,473,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00473
2020-01-06-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Related to that, in last year's Committee of Supply when I raised this issue, the Senior Minister of State mentioned about price transparency that the Healthcare Services Bill would include this issue in its regulation and it would mandate the publication of common fees charged, as well as give more transparency to the bill components to be paid by consumers so that they would know upfront what those costs would be. So, do I take it then that with regard to private ambulance services, this would be actually done under phase 2? If that is the case, then when would that be done? And in the meantime, would there be anything put in place to protect consumers? For example, are we still relying on the Voluntary Accreditation Scheme to try to get some standards into that industry?",6,474,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00474
2020-01-06-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Sir, I move on to the important issue of quality assurance for consumers. The Bill states upfront in the explanatory statement and the Minister also mentioned earlier that one of the Bill's aims is to strengthen safeguards for the safety and welfare of patients who receive healthcare services.",7,475,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00475
2020-01-06-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Since the day I became an elected Member of Parliament nine years ago, I have, from time to time, come across families who have been devastated by unsuccessful medical procedures. Some of their family members died unexpectedly while others sustained permanent disability in their prime and have been lying in rehabilitation hospitals for years. Of course, it must be said that the cause of such tragic outcomes may not be the inadequacy of healthcare services but other causes, such as the nature of the illness itself or inherent risks of certain medical procedures. Nevertheless, healthcare is an area where there is asymmetry of knowledge, with patients placing high trust in professionals. It is critical that the public must be assured that investigations into complaints are fair to the consumer and independent of professional and institutional interests. At the same time, professionals need justice as well. And we recall the High Court's decision in July last year to reverse the conviction on an orthopaedic specialist by the Singapore Medical Council. To this end, can the Senior Minister of State elaborate on how this Bill will enhance confidence in the fairness of the quality assurance processes for all parties?",8,476,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00476
2020-01-06-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"My final point, Sir, concerns the implementation of the NEHR system. I note that during the public consultation on the Bill, a lot of time was spent dealing with the issue of potential data leaks. This is understandable in view of recent incidents.",9,477,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00477
2020-01-06-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In responding to the feedback, the Ministry stated that patients concerned about the confidentiality of their medical data could possibly opt out of having their data inputed into the NEHR by healthcare service providers. Could the Ministry please update the House on the status of this opt-out option.",10,478,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00478

In the 39 years since the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act was enacted, the healthcare landscape has seen significant changes, including a shift toward digital and online services.",1,485,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00485
2020-01-06-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"At the same time, Singapore faces an ageing population and an increased prevalence of chronic diseases. The demand for healthcare services is set to increase.

2020-01-06-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"We cannot take for granted Singapore's high quality healthcare infrastructure.

2020-01-06-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The mandatory nationwide healthcare records database will also ensure continuity of care for patients across service providers. Sir, I have four clarifications.",4,488,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00488
2020-01-06-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, plans to mandate the contribution of data to NEHR have been in the news as early as 2017. However, these plans were deferred in the wake of the SingHealth cyber attack in 2018, which highlighted the risks posed by weak spots in the system.",5,489,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00489
2020-01-06-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Since then, disciplinary action has been taken against top management and key individuals, the NEHR has been subject to reviews, and Minister Gan has assured this House that the Ministry is ""taking many precautions"" to ensure that the system is ""robust before everyone is required to submit (data)"".",6,490,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00490
2020-01-06-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Under the Bill, NEHR data can only be accessed for the provision of healthcare services, or with the approval of the Government. Third parties such as employers and insurance providers cannot access the data unless the patient permits.",7,491,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00491
2020-01-06-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The Ministry has also said it will implement safeguards to ensure the confidentiality of patients' NEHR records. These include the provision of access logs to patients, regular audits on NEHR access and penalties for unauthorised access. However, as with all electronic databases, the NEHR faces a risk of data breach. From a national security perspective, it would also be dire should NEHR data fall into the wrong hands. This was demonstrated by the Singhealth cyber attack. On an individual level, patients may fear having their sensitive medical information leaked since this could have repercussions on their employment prospects or social lives.",8,492,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00492
2020-01-06-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister clarify how the use, access and transfer of patient data will be monitored by the system?

2020-01-06-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, given the concerns with data privacy and protection, there are understandable reasons why certain patients may not want their data uploaded onto the NEHR. These patients must submit a request to the Ministry, and requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Can the Minister share the criteria for assessing these requests? Would it be possible for Minister to decline a patient’s request and if so, on what grounds?",13,497,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00497
2020-01-06-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I understand that there must be a balance and must be struck between encouraging participation in the NEHR and upholding patient choice and confidentiality. Can the Minister provide assurance that the opt-out process will not be unduly difficult for patients?

However, I do have a few questions and suggestions.",1,508,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00508
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"First, I support the proposed services-based licensing framework, as it addresses the limitations of the current Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, which only regulates services provided at brick-and-mortar healthcare facilities. The introduction of Industry 4.0 and 5G telecommunications is already beginning to disrupt existing modes of healthcare delivery. New healthcare services can now be delivered entirely through mobile and online channels. The Bill’s new licensing framework is therefore timely as it will provide healthcare providers with the flexibility to ""modularise"" and apply for relevant licenses based on the services that they provide, rather than be confined to a physical premise.",2,509,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00509
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"However, while the new framework provides much needed flexibility, I am concerned with the corresponding licensing costs – how will they be impacted under the new regulatory regime? Can the Ministry provide licensees with a way to cluster and package their applications, to help them manage their licensing costs? We should bear in mind that the end-consumers would inevitably bear the brunt of any cost increase, and businesses often have an easy excuse to raise prices once regulatory costs increase. Even if the switch to the new framework will only result in an increase in licensing costs for a small number of operators, there is still a strong case to be made for the Ministry to consider absorbing the increase, as it is not uncommon to see prices increase across the industry just because someone in the market has raised their charges.",3,510,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00510
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad to note that the Ministry will provide ample flexibility in the Bill to help with the on-boarding of newly regulated services, such as the creation of a regulatory sandbox for telemedicine services. The sandbox will be beneficial to help us in adapting our regulations as telemedicine technologies evolve.",4,511,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00511
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"The introduction of 5G technology will see telemedicine and tele-surgical services become the next key growth drivers in the healthcare sector. Already, news reports out of China have emerged, claiming that doctors in the Chinese PLA General Hospital have carried out China's first 5G-based remote surgery on a patient 3,000 km away. I am sure that it is only a matter of time before such technologies are trialled here in Singapore, and having our own telemedicine regulatory sandbox will help strengthen our position as one of the leading healthcare hubs in the region.",5,512,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00512
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"However, new technologies will also bring about new questions pertaining to liability. Will the scope of the telemedicine regulatory sandbox be wide enough to provide a sandbox liability regime? With the introduction of artificial intelligence revolutionising how illnesses are diagnosed, will our sandbox regulations differentiate between decisions made by human doctors and those made by Artificial Intelligence? If so, who will be liable for decisions made by AI? With this sandbox, we have the opportunity to actively shape telemedicine regulations and answer the tough questions surrounding AI-related liability questions in the healthcare sector. I urge the Ministry to do so, so that we can pave the way for our businesses to remain as innovative leaders in the region.",6,513,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00513
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Another opportunity for adaptive regulations under this Bill is to create a sandbox for the regulation of the entire spectrum of professions who provide Mental Healthcare Services. Industry practitioners within the mental healthcare space, such as psychologists and psychotherapists, have been providing me with feedback on their wish for the entire industry to be fully regulated as a healthcare service.",7,514,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00514
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"From what I can understand, only psychiatrists are fully regulated today, as they are considered doctors. But mental healthcare services span across a wide spectrum of professions, many of which lack full regulations. An example of this are psychologists. Although classified by the Ministry as allied health professionals, psychologists are yet to be regulated under the Second Schedule of the Allied Health Professionals Act which was passed in 2011. Other professions within this industry that are unregulated include counsellors and psychotherapists. The lack of regulation among the many professions within the industry is troubling, as members of the public do not know the differences between counsellors and psychologists, and may seek treatment from someone without the proper certification and expertise.",8,515,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00515
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"We should support the industry's call for fuller regulations. Perhaps the Ministry could consider regulating the entire industry as an allied health service under a sandbox, to be implemented in the final phase of the Act's implementation. The Labour Movement stands ready to work with the Ministry to engage mental healthcare practitioners working across the entire spectrum of the mental healthcare industry, and work towards drafting the implementation and regulatory details, and to park this under a sandbox regime to provide all parties with the necessary flexibility.",9,516,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00516
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill's proposal to strengthen governance over licensees by ensuring that they have competent and effective governing bodies.

2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"However, while bigger companies will be able to easily adapt to the new governance measures, smaller players, such as our local General Practitioners (GPs) will find it much harder to comply. Under the new measures, licensees must appoint those with the appropriate skills and competencies in the areas of finance and business management. How will this new regulatory requirement affect the operations of our 1,700 GP clinics, many of whom might just be a small team of one doctor and a few clinical assistants? Will GPs be allowed to double, or even triple-hat, as the Licensee, Principal Officer and Clinical Governance Officer?",11,518,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00518
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Another new area of regulation which may impact smaller players more disproportionately than larger players, is in private ambulance services. Under the Bill, private ambulance services will have to classify themselves either as Emergency Ambulance Services or Medical Transport Services and comply with the respective sets of requirements. Medical transport ambulances, for example, will not be allowed to be fitted with sirens and blinkers, while emergency ambulance services will be held to higher standards of emergency care.",12,519,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00519
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"While I commend the Ministry's on-going efforts to provide a voluntary accreditation scheme to facilitate a seamless transition to the new licensing framework, how will the introduction of the new regulation affect the supply of ambulance services in Singapore? Will regulations be too onerous for smaller players to invest and upgrade their existing fleet of ambulances to serve as emergency ambulances? What will happen in cases where someone calls for a medical transport service, but the patient’s condition worsens along the way and it becomes an emergency?",13,520,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00520
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Finally, I would like to voice my support for the Bill's proposed safeguards to apply background checks for certain licensees, to protect vulnerable patients and those who require long-term stay. This is certainly important, as any case of patient abuse would severely damages the trust that the public has for our healthcare industry. I would like to clarify if the provisions under section 28 will apply to all professions of workers employed or hired by the licensee, or will the safeguards only apply to those directly involved in the delivery of healthcare services. Also, how will the background checks be conducted if the worker in question is a foreigner?",14,521,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00521
2020-01-06-T-018,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the healthcare sector is poised to undergo disruptions, brought about by the advent of new technologies. The proposed licensing framework and measures under the Bill are timely and will help to strengthen Singapore's position as the premier healthcare hub of the region. However, as we transit to the new framework, it is important that we ensure that we keep regulatory costs low and not overly onerous to smaller players. We should use this as an opportunity to ambitiously widen our regulatory sandbox and tackle the tough questions on liability that will inevitably arise. With that, I support the Bill.",15,522,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00522

2020-01-06-T-018,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I note that the Bill would introduce a services-based licensing regime to replace the one that is premises-based licensing.

2020-01-06-T-018,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"With the proliferation of new healthcare services, how do we ensure that patients are only treated by qualified persons? Should we educate patients to always ask to see a license? For example, if they are doing medical consultations online, or if they are being treated by someone other than a doctor or nurse such as a technician operating certain equipment. Or if they are getting their blood drawn by someone who goes clinic to clinic, whose responsibility is it to check for a valid licence – the clinic or the patient?",4,526,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00526

2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Healthcare Services Bill seeks to accomplish a number of things. To introduce a services-based licensing regime for providers of healthcare services replacing the old premises-based licencing regime; to strengthen the safeguards for the safety and welfare of patients; to improve the governance requirements for providers of healthcare services; to enhance regulatory powers in relation to providers of healthcare services, including allowing intervention in failing providers in order to stabilise operations and ensure continued patient care.",1,531,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00531
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"These are all steps in the right direction. Member of Parliament Ms Sylvia Lim, my party Chair, has made a number of points about the Bill with which I agree and which I shall not repeat here. My speech will focus on what else can be done to contain healthcare inflation.",2,532,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00532
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Part 57 2(R) of the Bill empowers the Minister to regulate the sector so as to require price transparency towards patients and customers. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to Mercer Marsh Benefits 2019 Medical Trends Around the World Report, based on surveys of insurers regarding types costs and frequency of medical conditions that were claimed for by company employees in 2018. Singapore's medical Trend rate, which measures medical cost inflation was 10% in 2018, 10 times the Singapore economy's estimated 2018 inflation rate of 1% at that time.",3,533,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00533
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In a parliamentary reply from 2018, the Government figure for healthcare inflation measuring the growth rate of prices for healthcare related goods and services paid by patients after Government subsidies was about 1.2% between 2013 and 2016. A media report from late 2018 quoted the Life Insurance Association of Singapore (LIA), have been found that average private hospital bills were increasing by 8% a year compared to less than 3% for public hospital bills. Though I note, that the 3% figure is still far higher than general inflation.",4,534,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00534
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Medical or healthcare inflation is a challenge faced by many countries around the world. It is partly driven by the increasing availability of advanced, cutting edge drugs, treatments and diagnostic techniques, which are expensive. How do we control medical inflation and curb any tendency towards over-treatment and over-prescription without shutting the door to Research and Development and innovation in the medical sphere? So, the rest of my speech will focus on ideas to answer this question. I will speak on several themes related to this question.",5,535,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00535
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, I would like to speak on price transparency, which is one thrust being explored around the world. The movement towards price transparency aims to make market mechanisms work to curb healthcare inflation through market competition. In November 2018, MOH started publishing fee benchmarks for private sector professional fees, which are not mandatory caps, but which place some onus on healthcare service providers to justify their fees. And prior to this, MOH has been providing similar guidance to public hospitals since – I believe – 2017. MOH now publishes information on 222 common surgical procedures like hip replacement and colonoscopy, comprising 85% of all procedures. Details include, depending on the type of data set, the public or private setting, hospital wards type, bill size, operation fee, surgeon fee, anesthetist fee, facility, average length of stay and implant breakdown.",6,536,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00536
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Data is in some cases published according to the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile. However, it is not clear what causal effect these measures have had to date – this publishing. I would like to ask, since MOH started the publication of this data, does MOH have any evidence or indications as to what the effect has been to assess the return on that investment.",7,537,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00537
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"At the level of theory, a few observations can be made. Not all patients would have the skills, time and inclination to study prices and make informed decisions on that basis. This problem gets compounded when that patient is faced with a medical emergency or pressing problem where familiarity with one healthcare provider or physical proximity may weigh on the decision more than any prior study of pricing.",8,538,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00538
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Moreover, many patients may be confused as to the link between pricing and quality. That may not only be willing to pay more for better quality but may misunderstand higher pricing to mean higher quality. Many patients who are more broadly consumers may use price as a surrogate for quality in the absence of other information. Would the MOH consider the following further measures? Firstly, publishing data by hospital, but also with data on the outcomes for those procedures at those hospitals where relevant and where there are sufficient data points. By outcome measures, I mean for example, but not necessarily, re-admission rates, safety of care, mortality, patient experience, waiting times and so on and so forth. This will help patients make the link between price and quality.",9,539,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00539
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),I am aware that this needs an investment in data systems and expertise to capture data well and risk adjust to take into account the differential complexity of patients. This will take time. Doctors need to be reassured the system is fair or everyone will start to turn away or decline to treat complex or poor pre-morbid patients. But it could well be worth the investment and at the very least should be studied since what we want is value and this means price or fees as a function of outcomes.,10,540,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00540
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, can MOH consider creating a simple app or website for patients to key in the counselled projected charges broken down by facility, doctor and so on, so that patients can see in simple charts the variation from norms and can such price comparisons be made a mandatory part of the financial counselling? Under pressure of time or stress a patient may not shop around when initially choosing a healthcare service provider, but this idea may give them some food for thought for considering their healthcare service provider the next time they have the same complaint.",11,541,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00541
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, I turn to mechanisms to curb over-treatment and over-testing. There may be a natural tendency to over-prescribe, over-treat or over-test, in lieu of strong controls and pressures from customers and regulators. Earlier, I touched on how patients, as customers, may not always be in the best position, be well-incentivised or sufficiently resourced to exert pressure on healthcare providers to keep prices in check in a skillful way. Insurance coverage may also distort choices by both providers and patients.",12,542,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00542
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"What can regulators do? MOH's Agency of Care Effectiveness has been issuing care and drug guidance since 2017. However defining over-treatment is notoriously complex, as some cases require more extensive – and expensive – testing and treatment than others. Having said that, can we do more to monitor and publish trends relevant to curbing unnecessary treatment by focusing on specific kinds of procedures?",13,543,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00543
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"For example, according to the ""Health at a Glance  Europe 2018"" report by the OECD and European Commission, Portugal created a national commission to monitor C-section rates and indexed funding to hospitals partly to C-section rates. Italy has similar financial incentives to hospitals with lower C-section rates and publishes information on C-section rates at different hospitals.",14,544,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00544
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The same report details how Denmark, Sweden, the UK and Finland have high day surgery rates for a number of common procedures. Studies have shown that day surgery can reduce the cost of surgical procedures substantially compared to in-patient surgery.",15,545,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00545
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The report states  ""In Sweden, one of the main factors that has contributed to the expansion of day surgery over the past few decades has been clinical leadership in the adoption of evidence-based guidelines to streamline pre- and post-operative surgical procedures and promote safe and effective use of day surgery. Nationwide collaboration and support from national authorities have helped to set up and disseminate new standards, while leaving sufficient autonomy to enable adaptation to local circumstances. The expansion of day surgery has helped achieved substantial savings...A 2016 review by the National Board of Health and Welfare showed that the costs of the 11 most common types of procedures would have been 14% higher if the share of day surgery had not increased between 2005 and 2013.”",16,546,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00546
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Sir, I would like to ask if the government could consider publishing data on lower cost procedures at major healthcare service providers and perhaps even making tweaks to funding models to incentivise these lower cost approaches where relevant. This can be done initially by focusing on procedures where there is the most volume vis-à-vis potential to impact on cost.",17,547,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00547
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The issue of day-surgery or outpatient surgery is a good case in point. It would seem that only medical care is covered by insurance and patients then have to pay out-of-pocket for transport, home nurse visits, perhaps some tele-monitoring and even meals. Can insurance funding models be changed such that cash is paid to cover these costs pegged to but not equal to what it would have cost to do this on an inpatient basis, so as to incentivise outpatient surgery?",18,548,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00548
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Also, ambulatory or outpatient surgery centres need a formal arrangement with the hospital for transfer in case of adverse events. In terms of the regulatory regime, is there a sufficient nudge for hospitals to embrace ambulatory care for surgery?",19,549,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00549
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I would also like ask if the MOH's Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) looks into flagging out cases that, for want of a better term, can be termed ""unnecessary innovation"". For example, an NPR article from 2017 in the US recounts how one pharmaceutical producer marketed a single pill that combined two over-the-counter (OTC) drugs as an innovation because it was easier to take one pill than two. A month's supply of the two inexpensive drugs cost about $40. The company billed insurance $3,252 for the new pill.",20,550,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00550
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thirdly, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will turn to the promotion of generics and biosimilars. In the Mercer Marsh study quoted earlier, it was noted that Singapore's medical inflation is partially driven up by supply-led factors such as high-cost pharmaceuticals and biologics. I ask a Parliamentary Question on the use of generics in the public healthcare system last year. The reply stated that, and I quote, ""in 2017, to better guide institutions and doctors in use of generic drugs, we introduced a basket of clinically and cost-effective generic drugs, which can replace a more expensive branded equivalence. MOH and the Health Sciences Authority monitor new generic drugs that enter the local market and add them to the basket on a regular basis.""",21,551,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00551
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I have two suggestions. Firstly, can healthcare providers be required to include in bills information about the cost of treatment, had a generic been used? Alternatively, a simple app or website could provide information on HSA-approved generics in respect of differential pricing. Secondly, can the proportion of use of ACE-endorsed bio-equivalent, lower cost alternative drugs for key conditions and procedures, be these generics or biosimilars, also be made public, broken down by healthcare provider?",22,552,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00552
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Fourthly, on waste reduction. One expert at an event in Singapore on healthcare costs said that waste in OECD countries amounts to as much as one-fifth of healthcare expenditure. I would like to discuss one example. The US FDA has long known that many drugs remain safe and potent for years longer than their published expiration dates. The FDA and the US Department of Defense created the Shelf Life Extension Program (SLEP) to test the stability of drugs in the federal government stockpiles and then extend their expiration dates where justifiable. A 2006 study of 122 drugs tested by the programme showed that two-thirds of them were stable every time a lot was tested. Each of them had their expiration dates extended on average by more than four years. But the same type of drugs in hospitals or pharmacies get thrown away when they expire.",23,553,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00553
2020-01-06-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Does our healthcare system destroy significant quantities of drugs due to expiry? If so, could we consider something like that US Shelf Life Extension Program, to use clinical data to extend the life of drugs.",24,554,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00554
2020-01-06-T-018,Irene Quay Siew Ching,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I laud MOH's move to repeal the current PHMC Act and replace it with the upcoming Healthcare Services (HCS) Bill, which aims to transit from a premises-based licensing framework to a service-based one.",1,555,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00555

2020-01-06-T-018,Irene Quay Siew Ching,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching (Nominated Member),"Furthermore, I would like to ask how MOH plans to transit healthcare institutions from the PHMC to the HCS Act.

How will the consequences affect licensed sites which are currently co-locating with the non-licensed services such as Traditional, Complementary and Alternative medicines or Allied Health services?",6,560,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00560
2020-01-06-T-018,Irene Quay Siew Ching,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching (Nominated Member),"Next, I refer to part 1 of clause 5 of this Bill which states that the Bill does not apply to and is not related to any healthcare service provided by the Government. Can the Minister explain the rationale for this exclusion and how can we be assured that healthcare services not governed under this Bill will provide similar patient safety and governance standards, for example, ambulance services provided by SCDF and medical services provided by MINDEF? Would an inclusion instead enhance safety and align standards across the country with MOH providing an independent oversight as a ministry with expertise in healthcare?",7,561,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00561

2020-01-06-T-018,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Since patients are not physically examined in person by the physicians, there is a higher risk of the doctors missing the detection of certain symptoms, resulting in misdiagnosis. As it is, it is already a challenge for the accurate detection of many illnesses and diseases as they manifest similar symptoms. How will the Minister ensure the quality of diagnosis? Should something go wrong, how can patients seek help and redress?",8,579,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00579
2020-01-06-T-018,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),This leads to another issue. Will doctors be held to the same standard for telemedicine? I think it is important that medical personnel and the patients have a clear understanding of their responsibilities and their rights for this nascent service.,9,580,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00580
2020-01-06-T-018,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"I am also curious whether there will be pre-requisites before a doctor can proceed with the provision of tele-medical communication. For example, should the doctor and the patient have a pre-existing relationship, that is, the doctor had seen the patient in a face-to-face consultation at least once before?",10,581,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00581
2020-01-06-T-018,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),(In English)  Another concern is the prescription of medications. Will remote prescriptions be permitted and what is the Ministry’s assessment of the risks of abuse and fraud?,11,582,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00582
2020-01-06-T-018,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Since telemedicine can be practised wherever there is Internet connection, I would like to ask if this Bill will regulate cross-border consultations. Just as the Internet facilitates international trade of goods and services, will this occur in our healthcare? We can order almost everything from food to furniture, participate in courses, receive legal advice and accounting services online without taking a step out of our homes. Will telemedicine proceed similarly and what controls will the Ministry put in place to protect Singaporeans?",12,583,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00583
2020-01-06-T-018,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Next, I would like to enquire about the tightening of naming restrictions. Approval will be required for terms such as ""Singapore"" or ""National"" for new companies but existing entities do not have to make any changes to their names. In order to get around this constraint, new companies may buy out or take over existing ones with the coveted terms. This is a loophole which must be plugged. May I suggest that a certain time period, such as five to 10 years, be given to such companies to continue operating, after which the terms ""Singapore"" and ""National"" must be removed from the name, unless they receive fresh approvals from the Ministry.",13,584,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00584
2020-01-06-T-018,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"With this, I conclude with my support for the Bill.",14,585,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00585
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the aims of the Bill for the reasons articulated by the hon Senior Minister of State Mr Edwin Tong in his speech. I commend MOH for extensive public consultation on the Bill for two years before presenting it in Parliament.",1,586,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00586
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I have five queries and I will take them in sequence. First, the scope of the definition of ""healthcare services"" under the Bill. Healthcare Services is defined under clause 3 quite widely and it also includes services provided not for reward. I would like to know if the intent is to also to ""capture"" services provided by voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) or non-profit organisations (NPOs) running senior activity centres, eldercare centres and neighbourhood link centres.",2,587,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00587
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As the hon Senior Minister of State knows, there is a wide diversity of services provided at these centres. Some focus on social well-being which is quite clearly outside the ambit of the definition. Where it gets a little more difficult is where elderly residents are offered frailty assessment, advice on physiotherapy or rehabilitation. Sometimes, this is done not just at centres but during house visits too. If the intention is to include these corporations, how many of these centres are not currently licensed under the PHMCA? What form of assistance can be given to these organisations to help them subscribe to the new licensing regime under HCS.",3,588,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00588
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next, suitability of key personnel running the licensee's business. Clause 23(1)(a) of the Bill provides that a licensee must ensure that every key appointment holder of the licensee is, in the opinion of the Director, a suitable person to act in that capacity in relation to the licensee. This is, as the hon Senior Minister of State mentioned, to ensure that high governance standards are observed. The wording in the clause however introduces a subjective test because the operative word is ""the opinion of the Director"". Not only that, in addition to the above requirement, under clause 23(1)(b), the licensee must also ensure that the composition of key appointment holders satisfies the skills and competencies requirements prescribed or specified in a code of practice.",4,589,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00589
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In contrast, for the appointment of a Principal Officer or Clinical Governance Officer under clause 24, there is no requirement imposed to ensure that these officers are suitable in the opinion of the Director.",5,590,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00590
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Clause 23(2) would allow the Director to direct a licensee to remove a key appointment holder who he is satisfied is either  (a) not suitable; or (b) does not possess the skills or competencies prescribed or specified. May I please ask why is it necessary to have a subjective test imposed under the clause? How will licensees be given notice of the Director's approach to the issue of suitability? How will appeals to the Minister on such decisions under clause 48 be determined? Would the Minister be able to revisit the issue de novo? Or should he decide based on the reasonableness of the Director’s opinion, even though he may personally disagree with it?",6,591,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00591
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next, how does the Bill assist in relation to ensuring that licensees adhere to reasonable levels of corporate governance and financial management to ensure that the entities are going concerns? Is it contemplated that the principal officer or key appointment holders take personal responsibility? This is the case in the financial services industry. The hon Senior Minister of State made reference to essential services in his speech. In the financial services industry, they have a senior manager's regime and key appointment holders have specific responsibilities. Or will it be a licensing condition imposed on the licensee?",7,592,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00592
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Fourth, Exclusion of Traditional Medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medicine from licensing requirements under the proposed HCS. I understand from the Senior Minister of State that the decision is made, on a risk-based assessment, not to license these practitioners at this point in time. I also note that the TCM practitioners continue to be regulated under the TCM Act. However, there are other disciplines of traditional medicine, such as homeopathy or Ayurvedic medicine, which are not currently regulated. Bringing Traditional Medicine, and Complementary and Alternative Medicine within the HCS regulatory framework may promote integration of services with mainstream medicine which may be beneficial to patients.",8,593,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00593
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The hon Senior Minister of State mentioned that the industry would be monitored on a risk-based approach going forward. I suggest the enlarging of the monitoring to also include an assessment of the potential for providing integrated services to patients.,9,594,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00594
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Finally, regulatory burden and costs. I understand that during the consultation phase, there were fears expressed that there could be increased regulatory burden and fees. I further understand that the Ministry will not be collecting more revenue from existing providers. Hence, this Act is meant to be revenue neutral. May I please ask whether under the HCS, the regulatory costs attributable to the Government is anticipated to go up. If so, should it not be recovered from the licensees?",10,595,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00595
2020-01-06-T-018,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Notwithstanding my queries, I support the Bill.",11,596,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00596
2020-01-06-T-018,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Deputy Speaker, Sir. This Bill is timely in view of the developments and breakthroughs in the medical sector. Technological advances are accelerating changes in how our healthcare services are delivered and the types of treatments available. The updated legislative framework will enable the Ministry to better govern our healthcare sector and ensure quality of care.",1,597,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00597
2020-01-06-T-018,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),I have only one concern for this Bill and this is regarding the National Electronic Health Records (NEHR).,2,598,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00598
2020-01-06-T-018,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Going forward, all healthcare institutes, including laboratories, must input patient data into the NEHR. While this will ensure continuity in terms of treatment for patients and allow medical professionals to have a holistic grasp of their health conditions, there are also potential downsides. For example, if any physician were to arrive at an erroneous conclusion and make a wrong diagnosis, this may have an impact on subsequent consultations or any follow-ups by other medical practitioners referencing the patient's medical history. The consequence of such a mistake may be serious, leading to more issues down the line.",3,599,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00599
2020-01-06-T-018,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Would the Minister share what preventive measures are in place to minimise such incidents? In addition, I am also concerned about the security of the database and potential system failure. I would like to ask the Minister for an update on measures to boost the robustness and resilience of the NEHR.",4,600,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00600
2020-01-06-T-018,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"With that, I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill.",5,601,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00601
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, this Bill introduces a new regime of regulating healthcare services in Singapore. Previously, the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act was the principal act governing the regulation of clinics and hospitals in Singapore. While it worked in a time where medical services were bound by space and time, an expanded regime is necessary with the advent of telemedicine and other similar healthcare services. Instead of licensing by physical location, the licences under this Bill are based on the kind of services provided.",1,602,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00602
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Even though there is increased flexibility in the kinds of services that can be packaged under a licence, clause 29 prevents the public from being misled by the name of the healthcare service provider.",2,603,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00603
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Also, as evinced by the First Schedule, not all healthcare services are licensable healthcare services. How will non-licensable healthcare services be regulated? This is important to protect those who may use or need such services. In this period of transitioning from the old regime to the new regime, how will the Ministry help healthcare providers whose services straddle, for some time, the old and new regime?",3,604,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00604
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"While this modular service-based system provides more flexibility, compliance with regulations may become more difficult as licensees need to look through more regulations to know which are applicable to them and which are not. The exercise may also increase the time needed to scan through a code of practice to pick up and implement relevant or salient points. Given enhanced regulation, how will the Ministry help to keep the costs of running healthcare services down? This is crucial as it was reported in June 2019 that healthcare cost inflation in Singapore in 2018 was 10 times that of the economic inflation rate.",4,605,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00605
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Part 3 of the Bill also sets out positions the licensee has to have, that is, the Principal Officer and Clinical Governor Officer. The requirements for these will be set out in the code of practice per clause 23(1)(b). These positions do not appear in the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act. How does the new system compare with the current system? Would the Minister please explain the rationale and thinking behind the structure and change to this governance model?",5,606,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00606
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Also, in the course of my work as a lawyer, which I now declare, I have worked alongside CEOs of hospitals. They have much to deal with in the day-to-day running of the hospital and regularly attend to unprecedented situations. Given their plate is already so full, I would ask MOH not to require that the CEO of the hospital be the Principal Officer or the Clinical Governor Officer, and that the CEO be able, if appropriate, to delegate the role to a suitably qualified colleague.",6,607,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00607
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Also, will current licensees with leaner manpower such as general practitioners struggle to meet this criteria?",7,608,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00608
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides changing the mode of regulation from locale to service-based, this Bill also puts in place measures to ensure the quality of care provided. One such measure are committees. There are three committees mentioned in this Bill – the quality assurance, service review committee and the clinical ethics committee. The quality assurance committee is also present under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act. Sections 11(3) to 11(5) of that Act is similar to clauses 51(3) to (5) of the Bill. It provides that the quality assurance committee is not competent nor compellable to disclose information in court or produce documents requested or produced solely for the purpose of the quality assurance committee. This appears to be a form of privilege which protects information and reports, preventing them from being used in medical negligence lawsuits for instance. The quality assurance committee needs to be able to assess the true state of affairs with candidness and transparency, this provision allows healthcare service providers to be candid with them and work together with them to ensure that healthcare attains a degree of standard. As this committee is not novel, would the Minister share with us how well these committees have worked in the past regime and what can be done to improve its function in the new regime?",8,609,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00609
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Another committee is the clinical ethics committee. Clause 26 requires a case to be referred to a clinical ethics committee where a patient is recommended to go for a service in a prescribed category. To prevent committee-shopping, clauses 26(3) and (4)(b) specify that a person must not provide the proposed prescribed service if any clinical ethics committee to which the individual’s case is referred is not satisfied that it is ethically appropriate.",9,610,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00610
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides having committees, another measure designed to protect the public in the provision of healthcare services is step-in orders. From clause 33(1), step-in orders are used to prevent a disruption in care of the patients due to financial matters such as insolvency, lack of licence after a suspension or revocation, or where the licensee carries out things against public interest or in contravention of the Act. This order by the Minister allows partial or total takeover to protect the public's interest.",10,611,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00611
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As the powers are intrusive and the threat of a step-in being invoked pre-emptively can cause uncertainty for all involved, would the Minister provide some examples to illustrate the severity involved in circumstances of public interest? Essentially, what is the threshold required?",11,612,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00612
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In addition to the committees and the possibility of step-in orders, the Codes of Practice provided for under clause 38 allow for greater flexibility. This is particularly valuable where technology is rapidly changing.",12,613,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00613
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, similar to the current Private Hospitals and Clinics Act, the Bill also provides for powers of inspection, search and seizure and other investigative power. Clause 41(6) of the Bill did not appear in the Act and requires any person present at any premise to render all necessary assistance and cooperation for entry, inspection, investigation. This is especially important where the data or information is stored electronically. This is because in such circumstances, human assistance through the provision of passwords can greatly aid the speed and ease of accessing important information, allowing for better enforcement with less resources.",13,614,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00614
2020-01-06-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In conclusion, Sir, health is important to every person. Healthcare services are often not ""good to have"" but necessary. As healthcare services impact us directly, a good healthcare network is an important line of defence for the people of Singapore. This Bill changes the landscape and expands the horizon of the regulation of healthcare services. No longer bound by locale, this modular system provides more flexibility to adapt to rapidly-changing technology. Besides ensuring that our regulatory regime is able to cope with and harness the benefits of technology, this Bill also puts in place measures to protect public interest in the provision of healthcare. And therefore, I support the Bill.",14,615,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00615

2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"These entities, including Senior Activity Centres, provide services which are predominantly social in nature and they will, to that extent, not be regulated under the Bill. But sometimes these centres also provide services that are clinical in nature.

In such a situation, where the patient is not coming from the hospital where he would have had a prescription and had been seen by doctors, different standards would apply. In fact, we would expect that different standards should apply.",18,634,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00634
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"If a pharmacy is part of a hospital and only serves in-hospital patients, then its licence will be part of the hospital's. The hospital being the primary licensee. The pharmacy would not need a separate one. Hence, I should clarify that the scenario that Ms Quay contemplates occurs only when a hospital pharmacy also chooses to serve walk-in customers in addition to serving the hospital's patients. That being the case, the pharmacy would be expected to abide by the retail pharmacy standards set out under the HPA.",19,635,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00635
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"That said, I have taken on-board Ms Quay's comments about the rationalisation and MOH and HSA will continue to streamline our processes to seek to avoid duplicative work by licensees to comply with the requirements of both this Bill as well as the HPA, including for tele-pharmacy services, and will no doubt consult with Ms Quay and the Society further on this point.",20,636,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00636
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, to give an example to Ms Quay, the 2019 Singapore Standard for Supply and Delivery of Medication is a common national standard for all healthcare providers and retail pharmacies if they want to supply and deliver medications.",21,637,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00637
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Dr Chia, Mr Yong and Ms Joan Pereira have asked about services that will be regulated for the first time under the Bill – in other words, not previously or hitherto regulated, but introduced for the first time under this Bill – and these include services like telemedicine and ambulance services, and asked how these services will be regulated prior to the roll-out and implementation of this Bill.",22,638,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00638
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To Dr Chia and Ms Pereira's questions on telemedicine, we should view telemedicine as an extension of the practice of medicine, provided through a platform different from the traditional clinic setting. Nonetheless, this is the practice of medicine and it remains regulated by existing standards such as the ECEG. In addition, the National Telemedicine Guidelines set out specific guidelines relevant to telemedicine that registered doctors and healthcare professionals would have to abide by.",23,639,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00639
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I would reiterate that the broad principle is that doctors are expected to provide the same quality and standard of care as in-person medical care. The fact that there is now, or there could be, a more convenient medium by which the care is delivered or the patient is communicated with, should not be a reason in itself to lower that standard. The doctor should clearly indicate the limitations, in an appropriate case, of the telemedicine services at the start of the consultation, and might in fact need also to refer that patient to a face-to-face consultation if he forms the view that he is unable to take proper history, to assess the patient properly and to form a sufficient judgement in order to discharge his expected standard of care.",24,640,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00640
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Moving forward, we will continue to refine the telemedicine regulations, have them tested, looked at and assessed in the context of the industry as well, to make sure that they are as appropriate and as relevant to the ground practice as possible. On this score, MOH has set up the Regulatory Sandbox to work closely with telemedicine providers to co-develop service-specific regulations. This will not only ensure that we remain in tandem with the practice of telemedicine, but that also patient safety and welfare would be adequately safeguarded.",25,641,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00641
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Some Members have asked about cross-border healthcare services including the use of telemedicine. Let me clarify that the Bill does not have extra-territorial powers, but if the telemedicine provider provides services, from wherever he might be, where such services are received in Singapore, then those services must be licensed under the Bill, and all foreign doctors working for the provider of those services, must be registered with SMC.",26,642,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00642
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"There is, of course, this question of how do you enforce and how do you deal with potentially errant providers who exist outside of Singapore. MOH will continue to improve patient engagement and education on the benefits and some of the obvious limitations of telemedicine, including consuming healthcare services provided from abroad where, as I have said, oversight and regulatory enforcement is not as readily available, so that patients will know. They can make an informed decision as to which healthcare services to use or to consume for their treatment.",27,643,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00643
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Melvin Yong raised questions on licencing for new healthcare services, cutting edge healthcare services like through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). MOH is of course aware of the increasing role and importance of AI in healthcare. It is nonetheless an evolving area, and we are monitoring this space closely and also engaging the relevant stakeholders – those who develop the AI, those who use the AI – to try to find the best possible guidelines and also to develop them in tandem with the industry to assure patient safety.",28,644,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00644
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Melvin Yong made valid suggestions on the prospect of expanding the regulatory sandbox to these cutting edges areas to explore new frontiers and to test the boundaries, and to see what works and what does not work in the safe context of the sandbox. We will do so, so that we can then introduce these regulations after they have been found to be workable and, most importantly, safe for the patients.",29,645,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00645
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Moving on to the private ambulance sector, Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Melvin Yong raised questions about this. As Mr Melvin Yong mentioned, it is an area that was not previously regulated. As such, progressive efforts have been made to ensure that private ambulance operators will be able to ramp up and be regulated under this Bill. The point is, if overnight, everyone is subject to this Bill, you might then find, as I think one of the Members mentioned, some questions as to whether every ambulance operator will be able to deliver the same level of services. So, we take a more gradated and calibrated approach on this. Let me just elaborate on a couple of the measures.",30,646,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00646
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In 2017, we issued standards for emergency ambulance and medical transport services so that operators will have clarity on the regulatory requirements that they must meet. This process where we expect to see ambulance operators come into scope in the second phase, in fact, started some years ago so as to socialise these requirements to them, to acclimatise them to the standards that they would have to meet.",31,647,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00647
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"MOH recognises that private operators may require support to ramp up their capabilities and to meet these standards. Hence, a year later, in 2018, the Voluntary Accreditation Scheme (VAS), which Ms Sylvia Lim referred to in her speech, was launched to help familiarise private operators with the applicable standards for clinical governance, for personnel, and also for vehicles early, so that steps can be taken to raise the clinical service standards, and they know what the benchmark and the bar would be. Further, training schemes have also been introduced and facilitated by MOH to upskill the existing manpower to meet the new requirements for paramedics and also emergency medical technicians.",32,648,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00648
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At present, more than 50% of private ambulance operators have come on-board the VAS. MOH will continue to work with other operators to prepare their vehicles, as well as skilling up their manpower. As such, ambulance services will be licensed in the second phase, as I mentioned at the opening speech, of implementation, and ambulance operators under VAS will be seamlessly ported over as licensees under the HCS Bill.",33,649,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00649
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Ms Sylvia Lim asked questions about costs and fees of private ambulance operators. We understand and we share those concerns. MOH will be working with the VAS ambulance operators to develop and publish an appropriate range of fees charged, so that consumers can have more transparency and can better make up their minds and have informed choices of the providers to use. We intend to publish those fees before these ambulance operators are phased in under the second phase. And, in fact, we target to do so in the course of this year.",34,650,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00650
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Melvin Yong have asked how the Bill impacts existing PHMCA licensees and whether its requirements to enhance governance will place an unnecessary burden on licensees.",35,651,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00651
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Members will, of course, know that that is not the intention of this Bill. But at the same time, healthcare services, especially those that are newer, will need to be properly regulated. The rationale for introducing the enhanced governance requirements is to ensure that the licensees are well managed, so that they can effectively and safely serve their patients' needs.",36,652,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00652
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At the same time, we recognise that the scale and complexity of licensees and the kind of services that they offer, the scale of their operations and their set-up will differ. The requirements will, therefore, be attenuated to take into account the nature of the licensee's business, so as not to unnecessarily increase regulatory burden on all of them in equal proportions.",37,653,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00653
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me first address the queries from Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Christopher de Souza, and I think, indeed, also from one or two other Members, about the officeholders stipulated under this Bill.",38,654,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00654
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Bill requires all licensees to appoint a Principal Officer (PO), and certain licensees providing more complex and technical services must also appoint a Clinical Governance Officer (CGO). The PO is akin to the manager appointed by the licensee under the present PHMCA regime and is responsible to assist the licensee in ensuring compliance with the requirements of this Bill. The PO is required to have sufficient organisational authority and management skills to adjust operations and make decisions, while the CGO is intended to oversee the technical and clinical aspects of the service. MOH will be satisfied as long as the PO and CGO are able to discharge their duties appropriately and we will not require specific personnel, such as the CEO, to be the PO or CGO in each case. Similarly, for small GP clinics that likely do not provide any complex specialised services, one individual can fill the role of the licensee and the PO, and a separate CGO will also not be required in those cases.",39,655,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00655
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Murali Pillai queried on whether there are objective criteria to determine the suitability of key appointment holders. Mr Murali Pillai would have seen clause 2(3) of the Bill which sets out the factors that will be considered in deciding whether a person is suitable to be appointed as a key appointment holder, PO or CGO. It provides, what I would regard as the no-fly zones, the broader outliers. So, there is financial suitability, there is the question of whether there is a prior conviction, antecedents and so on. But, at the same time, we also do not want to be overly prescriptive in the quality of the candidate that comes forward. So, to that extent, there is an interplay between the criteria that are set up here and what the Director of Medical Services might subjectively determine as to their suitability in each case.",40,656,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00656
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We also intend to provide clear guidance of instances where persons will be found to be unsuitable, so that licensees will be apprised of the applicable criteria. This can be done through regulations and, as Members know, clause 38 of the Bill also provides for a Code of Practice as regards the relevance of all licensees to these requirements. It can be published in the Code as well.",41,657,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00657
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Should a licensee appeal to the Minister against any decision to reject the appointment of his key appointment holders, the PO or CGO, the Minister will consider each case based on its own facts. I think Mr Pilliai raised the point about the appeal and how the Minister will consider it. Clause 48(7) (b) of the Bill, which provides for appeals to the Minister, allows the Minister to vary, substitute the decision of the Director, as the case might be appropriate, upon the appeal.",42,658,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00658
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As for Mr Murali Pillai's point on ensuring that key appointment holders are competent in corporate governance and financial management, we agree. That is the reason really to ensure there is a PO and a CGO that deal with the technical and clinical aspects of the practice. And MOH plans to include such requirements in the Code of Practice, as I have said, under clause 38 of this Bill, which will guide licensees with a bit more specificity on the levels of skill and competencies required. But as I have said, at the same time, not being overly prescriptive so that it becomes something that you just have to tick all the boxes. That is not the intention.",43,659,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00659
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Christopher de Souza and Prof Fatimah Lateef have asked for details on specified committees for quality assurance and clinical ethics.

2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"QACs are already an existing requirement under the current PHMCA. They provide a protected environment, as Mr Christopher de Souza said, without prejudice, for healthcare professionals to be open about an adverse event to identify the problems, learn from it, and correct errors without fear of being sued based on the materials that are discussed there or the discussions or candid sharing at those occasions. Through the learning environment that the QACs foster, proper root-cause analysis can be conducted and professionals can come up with solutions that will prevent the recurrence of such errors. That, after all, is the intention.",45,661,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00661
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Over the years, QACs have served their functions well in reviewing adverse clinical events. Ms Sylvia Lim asked specifically on the functioning of the QACs – how they are performing, and whether, ultimately, they will provide proper oversight of the way in which procedures are handled or the way in which patients might then raise complaints. I think I heard Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned also the case of Prof Lim that went before the Court of three Judges a few months ago.",46,662,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00662
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The QACs' function is in reviewing adverse clinical events and recommending initiatives to improve the quality and the standard of care. That is quite different, and it does not affect the other avenues available to a patient, either through SMC's disciplinary proceedings or, should the need arise, for civil compensation under the civil Courts. Those still exist and nothing in this Bill prejudices that or changes the options available to a patient. Therefore, the oversight of a case or oversight of professional misconduct or conduct of a medical practitioner still falls with the SMC and the rubric and the regime that are there still exist. The QACs exist separately and, as I have explained, for a different purpose and outcome.",47,663,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00663

They review ethically-challenging cases and ensure that ethical care and treatment are provided in the context of the facts of that case and the treatment, modality or options that have been considered. There will be a list of prescribed medical treatments that require CEC review, where the care management of patients is likely to be complex; where societal values could be either undermined or challenged; and where the values of the medical practitioners might be challenged as well.",48,664,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00664

We will consider these in implementing the Bill. And I would add to Ms Joan Pereira's point that should an entity today already be using one of these otherwise prohibited names, if the licensee does not change, the ownership does not change, and it is simply carried over into the new Bill, we will be prepared to allow them to continue using the name. But, of course, that will have to be revisited if they either sell the business or change the ownership in a material way.",75,691,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00691

Concerns regarding the impact of the Bill on healthcare costs and, of course, passing on of these costs to the patients were raised, and I think those were valid concerns. Let me address them.",76,692,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00692
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Let me start by saying that no single measure can really tackle the issue of healthcare affordability and I have taken on board Mr Perera's various suggestions. I will address them in a moment.,77,693,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00693
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For now, let me just very quickly outline the various initiatives that have been done to keep healthcare costs low and sustainable for all Singaporeans. As I had mentioned, we adopt a multi-tiered approach – multi-tiered, multi-pronged, and I would say also multi-faceted approach – to controlling costs, with the basic assurance that no Singaporean would be denied access to basic healthcare due to financial difficulties. That is the assurance that would be given. The multi-tiered approach that we take will include enhancing the 3Ms – which we have done at various stages and which we will continue to do – MediSave, MediShield Life and MediFund; and also extending significant subsidies, including the CHAS scheme.",78,694,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00694

2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We have also put in place other measures to curb the increase in healthcare costs. These include requirements under Integrated Shield Plan insurers for new rider plans. We have also developed and published fee benchmarks, as Mr Perera himself noted, for private sector professional fees for common surgical procedures.",80,696,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00696
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Finally, the Agency for Care Effectiveness also publishes guidances on clinically and cost-effective patient care. Mr Perera no doubt has cited a number of different studies. I think, at various juncture he mentioned studies from various places, data published from various sources, some experts speaking at a conference, delivering a paper and some results from programmes and studies somewhere. I am not prepared at this stage to agree to the conclusion of these studies because they need to be contextualised. We need to look at the details, we need to look at who studied it and what the assumptions might be. If Mr Perera would be happy to share these studies and the other details that he had mentioned in his speech with us, we can do a more careful study and look at the options open in terms of adopting some of these measures in Singapore.",81,697,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00697
2020-01-06-T-018,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"But where I think we are on common ground between Mr Perera and the Bill, is the need to ensure that we promote price transparency. As Mr Perera mentioned at the outset, indeed, that is specifically provided for in the Regulations. The Bill supports this by seeking to improve price transparency, such as requiring licensees to display common charges; by mandating financial counselling and itemisation of bills for certain settings, such as procedures conducted by hospitals or specialist clinics; and also establishing the Service Review Committee to monitor utilisation and clinical outcomes of certain high-cost and more complex services, such as proton beam therapy, for example, to ensure that not just is the care provided appropriate but it is also cost-effective, to take into account and to assuage Mr Perera's concern that not all high cost procedures are necessarily good quality procedures and, perhaps, not all good quality procedures are also at the same cost-effective level.",82,698,2020-01-06-T-018-S-00698

2020-01-06-T-021,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, the point that Members raised about cost and that it be not transferred, ultimately, to patients is a point that we are indeed concerned about. To give one example, to reduce the administrative workload for all existing providers as we implement the Bill, MOH conducted extensive stakeholder engagements – part of what we did in that two years leading up to the preparation of this Bill – to understand and do a deep dive of their licensing needs and map these, as far as possible, to the new Bill licences and the requirements in this new regime.",1,713,2020-01-06-T-021-S-00713
2020-01-06-T-021,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Mr Christopher de Souza’s query on how we will help providers, specifically the smaller ones, transition from the current PHMCA to the future HCS Bill, let me assure the House that MOH will support and guide all licensees to ensure a seamless transition to the new licensing regime.",2,714,2020-01-06-T-021-S-00714
2020-01-06-T-021,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"This will be done at each implementation phase, where PHMCA licences will be swapped out for equivalent licences under this Bill, without the need for existing licensees to file any applications or pay additional fees.",3,715,2020-01-06-T-021-S-00715
2020-01-06-T-021,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"MOH will continue to provide clear instructions and appropriate channels for stakeholders to ask questions, clarify their doubts or come and seek assistance from us on the transition to the new regime.",4,716,2020-01-06-T-021-S-00716
2020-01-06-T-021,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Various Members – Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr Christopher de Souza, Ms Irene Quay, Mr Murali Pillai, Mr Melvin Yong and also Dr Lee Bee Wah – have asked how this Bill impacts operating costs and in particular whether licensees will pay more fees as a result of the new landscape. Again, let me assure the House, and I think one of the Members said, and I echo that, that this is not intended as a revenue generating mechanism. It is necessary because of the measures that I have set out at the opening speech, that the new regulatory landscape is necessary to deal with evolving changes to the healthcare landscape. MOH would not, under this new regime, overall be collecting more licensing fees on an aggregate basis, compared to the position today.",5,717,2020-01-06-T-021-S-00717
2020-01-06-T-021,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The general principle is that licence fees are pegged at a level commensurate with the cost of manpower and resources incurred from the expected inspections and the audits to be done. MOH has and will continue to streamline our licensing processes to keep our regulatory costs down, as well as reduce excessive regulatory burden on licensees.",6,718,2020-01-06-T-021-S-00718
2020-01-06-T-021,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In fact, based on our preliminary assessment as we map the services across to the new HCS Bill requirements, based on our assessment, more than 95% of existing providers today will see either no change or a decrease in the amount of fees that they will have to pay. So, there is really no reason or basis for providers to pass on any of these costs to patients. The remaining providers who will see an increase are mainly providers who will be providing new licensable services regulated under this Bill.",7,719,2020-01-06-T-021-S-00719
2020-01-06-T-021,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For existing providers facing higher fees, MOH will put in mitigation measures to support the transition and this would include implementing the increase gradually over three licensing renewal cycles. So, we will space out as far as possible the increase, spread it out over three renewal cycles.",8,720,2020-01-06-T-021-S-00720
2020-01-06-T-021,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, let me conclude. The Bill introduces a regulatory regime that is sufficiently nimble and flexible to protect patient safety and welfare, but at the same time, take on board the rapidly evolving changes to the healthcare landscape. At the same time, it will accommodate new healthcare services, new care models and also nurture innovation. This will ensure that healthcare services provided in Singapore will be able to address the existing and also the future needs of our population.",9,721,2020-01-06-T-021-S-00721

2020-01-06-T-023,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Mr Terence Ho for his suggestions to improve the vibrancy and sustainability of the arts and culture in Singapore. MCCY and our cultural institutions recognise the importance of fostering the sustained and sustainable growth of Singapore’s arts and culture over the longer term. We have been and are committed to working closely with partners from the private and people sectors towards this end.",1,755,2020-01-06-T-023-S-00755
2020-01-06-T-023,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","I will start by addressing Mr Ho's first and third suggestions on the use of spaces for the arts and culture. I agree that it is important to ensure efficient use of physical spaces in land-scarce Singapore. The Gross Floor Area (GFA) that is dedicated to artists and arts companies has grown almost five-fold over the last 30 years. Venues such as the Goodman Arts Centre (GAC), Stamford Arts Centre (SAC), Aliwal Arts Centre, and the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre, currently provide our arts community with many creation and presentation spaces. However, demand for art spaces continues to increase and remains high. Given our limited resources with rising rental costs and increasing competition for space, co-location initiatives and shared spaces are necessary to ensure that our existing spaces are effectively used for the benefit of more arts practitioners.",2,756,2020-01-06-T-023-S-00756
2020-01-06-T-023,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","Multi-purpose studios, performance venues, office spaces and storage rooms are co-shared at our arts centres. This arrangement not only maximises available spaces but also allows the arts community to strengthen their networks, facilitate exchange of ideas, and increase opportunities for collaboration and partnership. For example, the GAC offers arts practitioners the use of facilities such as a Black Box, dance studio, and acoustically-treated music studios. GAC's multi-disciplinary tenant mix was a purposeful design by the National Arts Council (NAC) to catalyse diverse and quality artistic works, create greater synergies and collaborations amongst the various art forms, and introduce appreciation of different art forms and genres to audiences. Today, GAC is an energetic arts enclave, drawing in the public interested in experiencing the diverse range of art forms and arts activities on offer. We agree with Mr Ho's suggestion that NAC can grow the Stamford Arts Centre's potential to similarly develop into a vibrant and attractive arts venue with the mix of performing arts groups which share its spaces.",3,757,2020-01-06-T-023-S-00757
2020-01-06-T-023,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","NAC will continue to review arts spaces under its care and will prioritise shared and common spaces that benefit more groups. As Mr Ho mentioned, there are two co-working spaces for arts freelancers at GAC and SAC. They will be officially launched in the coming weeks, which would further contribute to the dynamism of our arts spaces. Mr Ho's idea of a shared warehouse is a good one that NAC will explore as a way to diversify our art space offerings. Given our limited arts GFA, however, we would also encourage our arts practitioners to consider how they can pool their resources to rent commercial spaces, or for members in the arts community with existing facilities to open them up for sharing with or rental to others.",4,758,2020-01-06-T-023-S-00758
2020-01-06-T-023,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","Aside from arts spaces under NAC, we also work closely with corporate and community partners to unlock new space for arts practitioners. One such partner is the Urban Redevelopment Authority, which encourages developers to allocate space in malls for arts, sports and social groups with strong community links through its Community Sports Facilities Scheme. Arts groups like Wild Rice, Singapore Dance Theatre and The Rice Company Limited are examples of organisations that have successfully benefited from this scheme through retail operators like CapitaLand, Far East Organisation and Frasers Centrepoint. We hope that more developers and venue owners could support this scheme and provide space for artists to flourish and contribute to their communities.",5,759,2020-01-06-T-023-S-00759
2020-01-06-T-023,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)",Other partners are the Community Centres and Clubs (CCs). Mr Ho would be familiar with community orchestras and bands that have been formed and housed at our CCs such as Keat Hong Chinese Orchestra at the Chua Chu Kang CC and West Winds at the Bukit Batok CC. These groups are dedicated to developing young talents and are useful platforms for many to continue pursuing their passions even after leaving school.,6,760,2020-01-06-T-023-S-00760
2020-01-06-T-023,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","In addition, NAC also works with the People’s Association (PA) to facilitate co-location of arts groups within community facilities such as Our Tampines Hub and Wisma Geylang Serai. As Mr Ho noted, the arts groups in such venues can contribute to the vibrancy of their neighbourhoods and grow their community stakeholders. NAC and PA are open to considering more of such co-location opportunities if there is a good fit between our CCs and the needs, priorities, and commitment of arts groups, including alumni arts groups. On their part, arts groups should be responsive and adaptive to the needs of local audiences and community stakeholders such as grassroots organisations and space owners.",7,761,2020-01-06-T-023-S-00761
2020-01-06-T-023,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","Mr Deputy Speaker, let me now turn to Mr Ho's other suggestion, namely the reinstatement of a radio station and TV channel to promote the arts. I agree with Mr Ho that it is important to promote the arts to as wide an audience as possible and to give everyone the opportunity to experience our vibrant culture and for it to become a part of all Singaporeans’ lives.",8,762,2020-01-06-T-023-S-00762
2020-01-06-T-023,Baey Yam Keng,"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)","NAC already works with mainstream media platforms to showcase the arts. For example, Hear65, a national movement launched in 2018, partnered with local radio station UFM 100.3 in 2019 to present six shows profiling our local artists, drawing an audience of over 1,500 and 80,000 views online. In addition, Mediacorp as our national broadcaster continues to make arts content accessible and enjoyable to the public across its free-to-air and digital platforms, where appropriate. Arts and culture-related programming that have been broadcast recently include SPOP Sing!, Lights. Camera. Singapore., and Singapore Talent Night, which showcased performances by local artists who performed at River Hongbao 2019.

As Minister Grace Fu announced at the 2019 Committee of Supply debate, MCCY, NAC and NHB are developing new digital initiatives such as the one-stop online Cultural Concierge for arts and culture activities and content and the Cultural Resource Ontology to facilitate easier public access to our cultural resources.

2020-01-06-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The monthly cash payment for primary schools is – $6.50 for miscellaneous fees, with another $6.50 which is payable by Edusave. So, out of pocket expenses on fees is $6.50.",2,774,2020-01-06-T-024-S-00774
2020-01-06-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The amount is low because school education is highly subsidised. But a small payment is still required, to demonstrate that as parents and families, we have a part to play.

2020-01-06-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Many of us in the House will remember our school days when we queued up to pay miscellaneous fees to our form teacher. In my case, it was $3 per month. My teacher would always remind me that what we paid was not enough to buy chalk, but still we should do our part. I would then collect the chit – a different colour for each month – and show it to my parents. I think that whole ritual had inculcated some good values in many students, and certainly me.",4,776,2020-01-06-T-024-S-00776
2020-01-06-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Notwithstanding, some parents accumulate arrears for various reasons. I do not agree with the view that this is because MOE and schools are uncaring.

2020-01-06-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Some of us in our community work come across such families, and wonder why assistance has not been extended to them and whether we are doing enough outreach. But please remember we are all part of the solution, and cannot place the onus solely on schools and teachers. When we know of such cases, surface them to the school, or our community partners, and help will be extended to them. Parents can step forward and request for help if they need financial assistance.",6,778,2020-01-06-T-024-S-00778
2020-01-06-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"There is a view that it is difficult to apply for financial assistance in school. However, the application process is not difficult.  When families need assistance, teachers and staff would help in filling up the forms.",7,779,2020-01-06-T-024-S-00779
2020-01-06-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) covers not just the school and miscellaneous fees, but also meals, uniforms, textbooks and transport – a large portion of the form is in fact to tick the menu of assistance required. Further, if parents produce a ComCare approval letter, MOE FAS will be automatically granted without the need for any further supporting documents. If one child is granted the MOE FAS, the child’s siblings in our schools will automatically benefit from FAS too.",8,780,2020-01-06-T-024-S-00780
2020-01-06-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"If after all the above steps have been taken and the parents still accumulate arrears, that is when the original PSLE results slip will be withheld as a last resort.

2020-01-06-T-024,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Further, the current practice of withholding the original results slip may not be fully effective in urging all parents to pay miscellaneous fees.

Put simply, it will enable countries with limited mitigation potential to buy carbon credits from countries where the cost of mitigation is lower. The latter countries are usually those with green lungs and such a system will incentivise them to maintain them. The Article 6 framework can also generate much needed funding for vulnerable developing countries to cope with the impacts of climate change in the future.",2,789,2020-01-06-T-025-S-00789

Countries successfully adopted the overarching decisions at COP25, which I was pleased to co-facilitate with Spain's Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera, at the request of the Chilean COP25 Presidency. Amongst other things, the decisions recognised the role of multilateralism, at a time when it is under strain. They will serve to keep countries, with diverse interests, united in their resolve to work together to address challenges of the global commons, like climate change. They called on countries to consider the emissions gap and to submit their updated climate pledges. The decisions also acknowledged the role of climate finance by the developed countries, which is essential for concrete action. Beyond the call for action, discussions will be convened in new areas of concern like the Ocean and its climate impact.",4,791,2020-01-06-T-025-S-00791

The continued momentum on global climate action is especially important for small countries like Singapore, which depend on a strong global response to tackle climate change. I was particularly struck by the support and energy of our civil society, particularly the youths, private sector representatives, and academics, who were all united in their efforts to address climate change. As we head towards the next COP in Glasgow, the challenge will be to maintain this spirit of inclusive multilateralism in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC.",5,792,2020-01-06-T-025-S-00792

Singapore has implemented an economy-wide carbon tax last year – the first in Southeast Asia to do so – as a key plank of our mitigation strategy. The revenue will be used to support emission reduction projects and help businesses become more resource and energy efficient. Despite limited access to alternative sources of energy, we will leverage long-term planning, innovation, and international cooperation to address climate change. By pursuing circular economy approaches, and rallying stakeholders towards sustainable growth, we can continue to create opportunities for our businesses and our people, in an increasingly resource- and carbon-constrained world. Last year, we launched a Zero Waste Masterplan and enacted a Resource Sustainability Act to design waste and wastefulness out of our economy. Our efforts to promote a circular economy, where materials are retained and reused in the value chain for as long as possible, will help to reduce our carbon footprint and complement our efforts to address climate change.

Both the elderly and the young have fallen prey to such scams.",4,802,2020-01-06-T-026-S-00802
2020-01-06-T-026,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Criminals are constantly evolving their methods to deceive people into parting with their money. No amount of Police resources will be enough. The key to the fight against scams is a discerning public. We should be sceptical of incredulous inducements promised by scammers, transact only on reliable platforms, and develop a habit of checking with the actual authorities when approached by dubious entities purporting to be officials.",5,803,2020-01-06-T-026-S-00803
2020-01-06-T-026,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To this end, the Police partner the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) to raise public awareness. For example, there is a regular ""Scamalert"" segment on ""CrimeWatch"" dedicated to educating the public on scams. A Scamalert.sg website was launched in 2014 to inform members of the public about the latest scam types. The website has had over 1.7 million visits to date. In 2016, the Police and NCPC launched an Anti-Scam Helpline (1800-722-6688) for the public to seek scam-related advice. Direct mailers containing scam-related information are sent to households.",6,804,2020-01-06-T-026-S-00804

One such CSSP focusing on the elderly is the Silver Watch Group. Launched in 2013, the initiative aims to impart elderly residents with crime prevention knowledge by keeping them informed of the latest crime situation and encouraging them to share relevant advice with their peers.",7,805,2020-01-06-T-026-S-00805

To date, Singapore has not received any formal proposal from Malaysia.",2,809,2020-01-06-T-027-S-00809
2020-01-06-T-027,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Johor Bahru – Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link Project is suspended up to 30 April 2020. In October 2019, Malaysia conveyed to Singapore its intention to proceed with the RTS Link Project, but with some changes. However, Malaysia was not ready to formally share all the details of its proposed changes with Singapore. We are nevertheless in close discussions on Malaysia’s proposed changes, including the consequential changes to (a) the RTS Link Bilateral Agreement between the two Governments, (b) the Agreement between Singapore's SMRT Corporation and Malaysia's Prasarana Malaysia Berhad to constitute a joint venture Operating Company or ""OpCo"", and (c) a Concession Agreement for the two Governments to appoint this OpCo as the RTS Link operator. When the details of their complete proposal are made available to Singapore, we will make a thorough assessment and give it serious consideration.",3,810,2020-01-06-T-027-S-00810
2020-01-06-T-027,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"While Singapore is not obliged to accept Malaysia's proposed changes to the two projects, we keep an open mind and will assess them objectively when we receive them to ensure that they meet Singapore’s requirements, including financial and operational considerations.

2020-01-06-T-028,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The Government is committed to strengthening social mobility in Singapore. This is why our approach has not been to rely narrowly on redistribution to reduce inequality, but also to put in place a broad range of measures to maximise opportunities for all Singaporeans, and enable them to earn their own success.",1,813,2020-01-06-T-028-S-00813
2020-01-06-T-028,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Our first priority is to ensure a strong, dynamic and resilient economy.

We are therefore continuing to help our businesses restructure and succeed in new markets through innovation and enterprise.",2,814,2020-01-06-T-028-S-00814
2020-01-06-T-028,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Beyond the economy, we are addressing social mobility holistically by intervening upstream. This means investing heavily from the preschool years, enabling multiple pathways to success both in the schooling years and working life, and integrating and rejuvenating our neighbourhoods.",3,815,2020-01-06-T-028-S-00815
2020-01-06-T-028,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We are starting early to give every Singaporean the best possible start in life, regardless of family background, because the first few years of a child's life are critical.

We are broadening and enhancing our learning pathways through new Work-Study Programmes in our Polytechnics and ITE. Polytechnic graduates can upgrade their skills and earn more through the SkillsFuture Work-Study Post-Diplomas, while ITE graduates will be able to upgrade beyond a Nitec over the course of their career. At the same time, we have recently increased the quantum of bursaries for University and Polytechnic students from lower-income families.",5,817,2020-01-06-T-028-S-00817
2020-01-06-T-028,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,We have also embarked on SkillsFuture to build a culture of lifelong learning and skills mastery. Individuals and companies have stepped forward and training participation rates have increased in recent years. But there is still much more work to be done. We will continue to invest in SkillsFuture to help our workers prepare for the rapid transformations that are taking place across all industries.,6,818,2020-01-06-T-028-S-00818
2020-01-06-T-028,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We are paying closer attention to lower-wage workers, and those who are at risk of being displaced.

For lower-wage workers, we will continue to enhance their skills and productivity through various measures including the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme, and the Progressive Wage Model.",7,819,2020-01-06-T-028-S-00819
2020-01-06-T-028,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Our neighbourhoods are a key pillar of social inclusion and mobility.

2020-01-06-T-028,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Growth, mobility and inequality are key concerns for all advanced economies. In Singapore, we have put in place a holistic set of measures to enable everyone to move up the ladder. We have achieved broad-based income growth. Over the last five years from 2013 to 2018, real income growth averaged 3.3% per annum for our low-income households1 and 3.4% for our middle-income households. We have also done better than many other countries in social mobility  14% of those with parents who were in the lowest income quintile when they were growing up, managed to move up to the top quintile of income earners by their early 30s.",9,821,2020-01-06-T-028-S-00821

2020-01-06-T-029,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is the assessment on the impact of the data leak which occurred at ST Logistics and the ransomware attack on HMI Institute of Health Sciences to confidential operations of MINDEF and SAF; and (b) what is the follow-up action that is in place following the two incidents.,1,823,2020-01-06-T-029-S-00823
2020-01-06-T-029,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"asked the Minister for Defence with regard to the personal data leak affecting 2,400 MINDEF and SAF personnel (a) when did ST Logistics first discover the phishing attack; and (b) when did MINDEF come to know about the leak.",1,824,2020-01-06-T-029-S-00824
2020-01-06-T-029,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"On 10 October 2019, MINDEF discovered that emails received from ST Logistics contained malware, and alerted their management, whereupon ST Logistics as a first precautionary move blocked outgoing data and emails possibly affected by the malware. The company’s IT team and external support teams then carried out forensic investigations to provide MINDEF with the affected data for an impact assessment. It was established on 13 December 2019 that personal data of 2,400 MINDEF/SAF personnel could have been leaked. The affected personnel were notified from 21 December 2019.",1,825,2020-01-06-T-029-S-00825
2020-01-06-T-029,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In the second incident, HMI Institute discovered a malware infection in one backup server on 4 December 2019, and alerted MINDEF on 9 December 2019. With the help of a cybersecurity firm, HMI investigated the infection and ascertained the individuals from MINDEF/SAF and other organisations whose personal data were on the affected backup server. Although the likelihood of data leak to external parties was assessed to be low, the 98,000 MINDEF/SAF personnel were informed from 21 December 2019.",2,826,2020-01-06-T-029-S-00826

2020-01-06-T-029,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"MINDEF takes a serious view of these cases. We expect our vendors to protect all personal data that has been entrusted to them. Prior to these incidents, MINDEF had begun including personal data protection clauses in all new contracts involving personal data. We had also been working with vendors, including HMI Institute and ST Logistics, to progressively apply such clauses to existing contracts.",4,828,2020-01-06-T-029-S-00828
2020-01-06-T-029,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We will further strengthen oversight of our vendors. Taking reference from the recommendations of the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee (PSDSRC), we will implement a framework to ensure that vendors protect our data well. MINDEF will also implement a tiered cybersecurity framework to ensure that vendors handling more sensitive data are subject to more stringent cybersecurity standards, which may include regular audits. As the risks will continue to evolve, we will continually monitor developments and enhance our cyber and data security measures.",5,829,2020-01-06-T-029-S-00829

2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Anthea Ong have also filed questions on addressing homelessness for the next sitting. I will address them together with this reply.,1,831,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00831
2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"MSF considers a person to be homeless if he does not have access to housing. This includes people who have no home. It also includes rough sleepers who have homes but face difficulty returning for various reasons such as serious hoarding, or conflict with family members or co-tenants. We seek to assist all homeless people and rough sleepers in need of help, to ensure their safety and well-being.",2,832,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00832
2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Homeless people often grapple with multiple complex issues that require Government and community support. However, some of them may not know where to seek assistance; while others may decline help or avoid contact with social services and Government agencies. Therefore, MSF adopts a community-based social work approach to assisting the homeless. Since late 2017, MSF has been partnering various community groups1 and Government agencies in regular night walks so as to better reach out to and engage homeless people and rough sleepers, and share with them that there are shelters and services available. We would refer them to appropriate help agencies that can work with them on their immediate needs as well as underlying issues, so as to improve their circumstances. This collaboration led to the formal launch of the PEERS Network, which stands for Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers Network, in July 2019.",3,833,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00833
2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Partners in the PEERS Network refer homeless people that they have reached out to and befriended to help agencies and shelters to help them attain stable housing and address other longer-term issues such as employment and family conflicts. MSF funds Social Service Agencies to provide shelter and social support at Transitional Shelters2 to homeless persons who require social work intervention to address their underlying issues. Social workers at the Transitional Shelters work with residents on their financial, employment, health and family issues, and help them to secure long-term stable housing. We aim to help residents at Transitional Shelters move into stable long-term accommodation within six months. An extension of stay can be granted if social workers assess that the residents need more time to work on their issues.",4,834,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00834
2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,I would like to thank all our partners for working closely with us to provide better support for the homeless.,5,835,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00835
2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"A small proportion of rough sleepers encountered by MSF have no family support and are unable to care for themselves, and may be considered to be destitute. We offer them care and rehabilitation at Welfare Homes, with the aim of reintegrating them back into the community. Statutory powers under the Destitute Persons Act are exercised only as the last resort in instances where the individual's safety has been assessed to be at risk, or the individual lacks mental capacity to make informed decisions for his welfare.",6,836,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00836
2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"MSF has also collaborated with our PEERS partners to set up ""Safe Sound Sleeping Places"", or S3Ps, to provide rough sleepers a safe environment to rest for the night. S3Ps are ground-up initiatives set up with the goodwill of our community partners. They are sited in the premises of our community partners, which are located near to where the homeless persons sleep rough. To ensure the safety of others resting at the S3Ps, our community partners generally require rough sleepers to meet some basic conditions, such as refraining from consuming alcohol. Rough sleepers can stay at S3Ps until their issues have been resolved, they have been referred to Transitional Shelters, or they have secured longer-term housing options. S3Ps complement existing shelter and residential options, making it easier for government and social service agencies to engage homeless people and rough sleepers in a timely manner.",7,837,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00837
2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are currently seven S3Ps with space for up to 56 individuals, with two more S3Ps in the pipeline. About 1 in 5 of all rough sleepers whom we reach out to on joint night walks with PEERS partners have accepted shelter at S3Ps. For the others who decline shelter, MSF and our partners continue to engage them, to persuade them to take up shelter.",8,838,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00838
2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"MSF has also strengthened coordination between Government agencies to ensure that all rough sleepers whom we encounter are offered assistance. An inter-agency taskforce, consisting of 11 Government agencies3, was set up in May 2018. It reviews policies, programmes and protocols to address issues faced by homeless persons and rough sleepers. It also looks into upstream measures to prevent those at risk of losing their homes from becoming homeless. The taskforce builds on MSF's ongoing work to strengthen social service delivery, as well as the work of an earlier taskforce which had been set up in 2007 to strengthen inter-agency coordination on rough sleeping issues.",9,839,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00839
2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Ms Anthea Ong asked about the joint tenancy requirement for HDB's public rental housing. Minister Lawrence Wong will address this in his reply to Assoc Prof Daniel Goh's other Parliamentary Question on this same issue.,10,840,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00840
2020-01-06-T-030,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Our strong partnership with the PEERS network partners has enabled us to reach out to more homeless persons and rough sleepers in need, and to offer our support. MSF will continue to bring together more community partners into the PEERS Network, and support those who are willing to open up their premises as S3Ps for homeless people and rough sleepers.",11,841,2020-01-06-T-030-S-00841

2020-01-06-T-031,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,asked the Minister for National Development whether the rationale requiring co-tenancy for public rental flats is still relevant today in light of its contribution to homelessness.,1,843,2020-01-06-T-031-S-00843
2020-01-06-T-031,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,HDB requires two singles to share a rental flat under the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS) to ensure prudent use of our limited land and fiscal resources. This allows our rental flats to serve more low-income Singaporeans who require housing assistance.,1,844,2020-01-06-T-031-S-00844
2020-01-06-T-031,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There are multiple complex issues behind homelessness, and co-tenancy is not the only contributor. In fact, HDB's recent survey indicates that the vast majority of its single tenants under JSS are able to live together amicably. Many of these tenants have no family support. By living together, they can benefit from companionship and provide mutual support. Rent is also more affordable, as it is shared.",2,845,2020-01-06-T-031-S-00845
2020-01-06-T-031,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB offers partitions in the JSS rental flats to provide more privacy for the single tenants.

2020-01-06-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Defence what are the facts and interim findings surrounding the training accident involving Pte Joshua Quek on 18 December 2019.,1,848,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00848
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"PTE Joshua Quek undertook a night static line parachute jump as part of the Basic Airborne Course on December 18, 2019 when the training incident occurred. The jumpers' parachutes are attached to the aircraft by a cord called a ""static line"". As jumpers exit the aircraft, the static line becomes taut, and deploys the parachutes automatically. This training activity is standard airborne training conducted by militaries to teach soldiers the fundamentals of parachuting for combat deployment.",1,849,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00849
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"PTE Quek successfully landed within the designated landing area but sustained injuries to the neck during the course of that jump.

2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"A formal Board of Inquiry, supported by the SAF Inspector General's Office (IGO), has been convened by the Army for a full investigation of this incident. In the meantime, all static line parachute jumps has been suspended, pending the findings of the BOI.",3,851,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00851
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Without prejudicing the ongoing formal inquiry, let me now share findings from investigations thus far, with the caveat that these findings are preliminary and the BOI's report will be the final and conclusive one.",4,852,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00852
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The cause of PTE Quek's injury occurred when the static line swept across his neck when he exited the aircraft. This is a known risk for static-line parachute training and termed ""static line interference"". It occurs when the line is too slack and interferes with the jumper's exit from the plane. The SAF conducts about 6,000 static line parachute jumps every year. Since its inception in 1974, the SAF has graduated approximately 27,000 BAC trainees. This is the first known ""static line interference"" incident resulting in serious injury.",5,853,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00853
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"To ensure that static line interference does not occur, there are established drills and safety protocols in the training manuals and TSR for both the jumper and the jump-master. For all jumps, a qualified jump instructor is required to be on board the plane with two qualified Jump Masters (JM) at the exit door to check that these measures and other safety aspects are adhered to.",6,854,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00854
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,Preliminary findings suggest that the static line was not pulled taut as required and interfered with PTE Quek's exit from the plane causing a neck injury. Detailed investigations are underway to determine why this occurred and if adequate supervision was given during PTE Quek’s jump.,7,855,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00855
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Thus far, we know that PTE Quek had successfully undergone the requisite pre-jump qualifications, training drills and safety briefs prior to taking part in the series of live static line parachute jumps and the specific jump on the night of 18 December. The incident occurred during PTE Quek's fifth and final jump for the course. He had completed the previous four static-line jumps successfully in the days prior to the incident.",8,856,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00856
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Upon arrival at the hospital, a Magnetic Resource Imaging (MRI) revealed a cervical spine injury. In the morning of 19 December, PTE Quek successfully underwent surgery to relieve the pressure on his spine. A planned second surgery on 21 December to stabilise his cervical spine was also successfully completed without complications. PTE Quek is currently still in the ICU for close observations.",9,857,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00857
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The cervical spine injury sustained by PTE Quek had resulted in neurological deficits including weakness of his upper and lower limbs. Some partial recovery of motor functions has taken place since the second surgery, but PTE Quek will require continued rehabilitation and physiotherapy for long term recovery as well as to reduce the damage from the injury. Currently, he is able to breathe on his own, conscious and alert and able to talk with his family.",10,858,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00858
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"PTE Quek's family was informed of the incident on the night of 18 December and his mother was flown to the hospital the next day. His father and brother joined him a few days after. SAF personnel are also on site to provide PTE Quek and his family medical, counselling, logistical and other forms of support.",11,859,2020-01-06-T-032-S-00859
2020-01-06-T-032,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Board of Inquiry will comprehensively ascertain the detailed circumstances and possible contributory factors for the incident.

2020-01-06-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Today, many preschools already strive to adopt a more inclusive approach and enrol children with mild to moderate developmental needs. To support this inclusion within pre-schools, the Government funds the provision of the Learning Support (LS), Development Support (DS) and Development Support Plus (DS-Plus) programmes. Under these programmes, professionals, such as Learning Support Educators, Early Intervention teachers, therapists and psychologists, provide intervention for children with developmental needs in their pre-schools once or twice a week.

2020-01-06-T-041,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Law (a) whether the Ministry will review Grab's Upfront Cash Programme offered to their delivery riders to determine whether the administrative charges are reasonable; and (b) how do the charges compare to rates offered by moneylenders and banks for unsecured lending.,1,914,2020-01-06-T-041-S-00914
2020-01-06-T-041,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Grab's Upfront Cash Programme has been brought to the attention of the Ministry of Law. We are engaging Grab to find out more about this programme. Let me provide a brief description of the UCP based on what we have gathered from Grab.,1,915,2020-01-06-T-041-S-00915
2020-01-06-T-041,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The UCP is a programme offered to selected Grab's third party service providers, which include GrabCar and GrabTaxi drivers and delivery partners. These service providers derive their income from two sources. First, they earn fees paid directly by users. Second, Grab pays out incentives when they complete certain requirements. For example, a delivery partner may earn an incentive upon completing a certain number of trips within a stipulated time period. Under the UCP, such a selected delivery partner can request to receive their incentive payments in advance, before completing the requirements. If Grab accedes to such requests, it charges the delivery partner an upfront administrative fee before disbursing the balance incentive payment.",2,916,2020-01-06-T-041-S-00916
2020-01-06-T-041,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Member asked how the charges for Grab's UCP compares. As there are differences in the features, terms and conditions of various products, we would like to caution against making direct comparisons. Nevertheless, let me share briefly the rates offered by Grab. According to Grab, the administrative fee ranges from 5% to 10% of the advance incentive payments granted, and no further fees or interest charges are imposed. Under the regulatory framework for moneylending, licensed moneylenders are permitted to charge an upfront administrative fee of not more than 10% of the loan principal, as well as a nominal interest of up to 4% per month and other prescribed fees. Banks offer a wide range of credit products and charges vary, according to the tenor, risk and other features of the product concerned.",3,917,2020-01-06-T-041-S-00917
2020-01-06-T-041,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,We will study further with Grab before assessing what measures need to be taken. We strongly encourage individuals to review the terms of the UCP carefully and assess their ability to complete the requirements and meet the financial commitments before participating in the programme.,4,918,2020-01-06-T-041-S-00918

2020-01-06-T-042,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, we have provided incentives to help defray the higher cost of PPVC adoption and build industry capabilities. The Productivity Innovation Project (PIP) scheme, which funds up to 70% of the qualifying cost for innovative technologies, is one such initiative. To date, nine firms have tapped on the PIP scheme to support PPVC-related projects, with more than $15 million disbursed. We have also provided $5 million for PPVC-related training.",3,922,2020-01-06-T-042-S-00922

2020-01-06-T-044,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To ensure affordable childcare for all families who need them, pre-school subsidies are provided for enrolled Singapore citizen children. The requirement is that they attend pre-school at least one day in the month, and not the 75% attendance rate as mentioned by the Member. The vast majority of children enrolled in pre-schools meet this very basic attendance requirement.",1,930,2020-01-06-T-044-S-00930
2020-01-06-T-044,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Regular pre-school attendance is important so that the child can fully benefit from the pre-school experience. This goes beyond learning to read and write, and extends to other aspects of child development, such as social and emotional learning and motor skills development.",2,931,2020-01-06-T-044-S-00931
2020-01-06-T-044,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Based on ECDA's interactions with preschools, reasons for low attendance are mostly non-financial in nature. Examples include parents' work arrangements, poor child health, lack of awareness on the importance of regular pre-school attendance, and competing priorities, such as the need to send multiple children to different schools.",3,932,2020-01-06-T-044-S-00932
2020-01-06-T-044,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For children with low or irregular attendance, pre-schools are strongly encouraged to engage the parents to understand the family's circumstances, and where needed, refer them to Family Service Centres and Social Service Offices which can assist the families who may benefit from social services support. Under KidSTART, selected pre-schools are supported with additional resources to help children from lower-income families address barriers to pre-school attendance and their overall socio-developmental needs. KidSTART currently supports 1,000 children across all KidSTART programmes, and will expand to reach another 5,000 children over the next three years.",4,933,2020-01-06-T-044-S-00933

2020-01-06-T-045,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"MOM publishes annual statistics on local and foreign workforce numbers. However, MOM does not provide a breakdown of the number of foreign workers by nationality as it is not in Singapore's interest to do so.",1,935,2020-01-06-T-045-S-00935
2020-01-06-T-045,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Malaysian workers can be found across all sectors.

2020-01-06-T-046,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Manpower on the sudden surge of workplace fatalities in November 2019 (a) what industries do these workers work in; (b) what are the reasons behind the spike in fatality numbers; and (c) what more is the Ministry doing to prevent such workplace fatalities.,1,937,2020-01-06-T-046-S-00937
2020-01-06-T-046,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"There were nine fatal workplace accidents in the month of November 2019, compared to an average of four per month in the past three years. The unusually high number of cases is a cause of concern for the Ministry. Therefore, we had probed deeper to uncover if there were any specific reasons or trends for the spate of accidents.",1,938,2020-01-06-T-046-S-00938
2020-01-06-T-046,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Of the nine fatalities, four were from the construction sector, two from marine, two from services, and one from manufacturing.",2,939,2020-01-06-T-046-S-00939
2020-01-06-T-046,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"There was no dominant trend that contributed to the spate of accidents in November. Nonetheless, MOM, together with the industry partners, stepped up on engagement and enforcement efforts in November. We worked with the Singapore Contractors Association Ltd (SCAL) and the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council to organise an Industry Safety Timeout as a reminder to all contractors and workers to remain vigilant while at work. To send a strong signal to the industry, Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad led a team of enforcement officers on a surprise visit to a worksite, where the officers uncovered multiple WSH lapses. In response, we issued a full Stop Work Order. MOM's Stop Work Orders stay in force for a minimum of three weeks to ensure that the company's leadership appropriate actions to correct their safety practices and risk assessments. We expect companies to rectify all unsafe conditions and demonstrate to us their ability to better manage WSH on site before MOM lifts the Stop Work Order.",3,940,2020-01-06-T-046-S-00940
2020-01-06-T-046,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We will ramp up inspections by conducting 400 inspections until February 2020, targeting high-risk industries, such as construction, marine, as well as manufacturing. We will also conducted checks on similar equipment that were involved in two of the fatal accidents to prevent recurrence. These unfortunate accidents highlight the need for occupiers and employers to be more diligent in their risk management and mitigation, and not take WSH for granted.",4,941,2020-01-06-T-046-S-00941
2020-01-06-T-046,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Beyond the immediate-term engagement and enforcement efforts, we need longer-term measures to motivate more employers and occupiers to take greater ownership of risk awareness and mitigation. In 2020, we are progressively implementing the recommendations set out in the WSH 2028 Tripartite Strategies Committee report. They include publishing the safety performance of firms, and establishing a framework for public sector developers to disqualify unsafe contractors, including first-level sub-contractors. These moves will align businesses' commercial interests more closely to workplace safety. This will spur companies to be more serious in risk management and preventing accidents.",5,942,2020-01-06-T-046-S-00942

Such cases are generally challenging to address as the causes are usually multi-faceted and complex, and require multi-stakeholder support and involvement. Nonetheless, there have been cases where persons involved in disputes and, suspected to have mental health conditions, were successfully supported through multi-agency efforts between AIC, community mental health partners and healthcare institutions and other agencies such as the Singapore Police Force, Housing and Development Board and grassroots organisations. The government cannot address such issues, which are usually not just medical in nature but may also involve social issues, alone.

We have been proactive in our approach to social integration, especially in Singapore's multi-racial, multi-religious context. Our housing policy on ethnic integration and our national education system are examples of how we bring people together – regardless of their backgrounds – in public housing estates and schools. Our parks, libraries, hawker centres, sports facilities and museums are important common spaces open to all, so that Singaporeans from different walks of life mingle easily together.",1,957,2020-01-06-T-049-S-00957

More recent immigrants to Singapore might differ from earlier immigrants in terms of education, skills or countries of origin, but by continuing to be open and inclusive, we can sustain the social harmony we enjoy today. By and large, Singaporeans value this approach. A recent Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) study showed that almost 90% of respondents felt they could learn a lot from foreign cultures and appreciated people of different nationalities living in the same neighbourhood.

2020-01-06-T-052,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Bankruptcy refers to the legal process whereby the debts that a person who is unable to pay are resolved. It provides an orderly regime for the resolution of unpaid debts, and seeks to balance the interests of debtors, creditors and the wider society, by  (a) Ensuring that bankrupts are held accountable for their debts, but allowing them to make a fresh start in their financial matters after a period of time; and (b) Providing incentives for creditors not to over-extend credit and for debtors to not borrow more than they can repay.",1,974,2020-01-06-T-052-S-00974
2020-01-06-T-052,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Under the bankruptcy regime, the Official Assignee, or OA, serves as the trustee of the estate of bankrupt individuals, assisted by the Insolvency Office.

2020-01-06-T-052,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The debt recovery rate is the ratio of the total dividends paid to creditors over the total debts owed, and depends on the bankrupt's ability to pay. In general, bankrupt individuals have limited ability to pay their debt. Hence, the OA will make reasonable efforts to realise assets for creditors as long as it is financially viable to do so. The OA has to exercise prudence as any cost incurred by the OA is paid out of the bankruptcy estate or the public purse for shortfall. The debt recovery rate for bankruptcy cases averaged 4% over the last 10 years.",3,976,2020-01-06-T-052-S-00976
2020-01-06-T-052,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Less than 1% of bankruptcy cases administered by the OA involve overseas assets. For such cases, the OA will adopt a pragmatic approach in deciding whether to embark on recovery work, as this can be resource-intensive and often have little or no likelihood of success. In general, the OA will only proceed in attempting to recover the assets if information provided about the assets is complete and not speculative. If creditors prefer, they may also choose to appoint a Private Trustee-in-Bankruptcy to carry out the recovery and realisation of assets.",4,977,2020-01-06-T-052-S-00977
2020-01-06-T-052,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In 2009, the Ministry introduced the Debt Repayment Scheme, which is a pre-bankruptcy scheme, to provide an alternative approach for debtors to pay off all or some of his debt through a repayment plan over a period of time. Debtors with a regular income and whose unsecured debt do not exceed $100,000 can be considered for the scheme. The scheme benefits both the debtors, who can avoid bankruptcy if he meets his obligations under the Scheme, and the creditors, who will receive no less than what they would have otherwise received had the debtor gone into bankruptcy. Around 30% of debtors in bankruptcy proceedings are referred to the DRS. The recovery rate has averaged 85% since the scheme’s commencement.",5,978,2020-01-06-T-052-S-00978
2020-01-06-T-052,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"While the OA will make reasonable efforts to help creditors recover debt, the amount recovered depends on how much the bankrupt is able to pay, and it is necessary to balance the creditor's interest against allowing bankrupts to make a fresh start in their financial affairs.

For such cases, allowance is given for the member to transfer ownership and make the required CPF refund six months after he has taken possession of his new flat. This transition period could stretch to a few years if the member is buying a Build-To-Order flat. Similar to flat purchases, the refund can be made using the parents' CPF savings, or by taking up a HDB or bank loan if eligible. The monies refunded to the member's account can also be used to pay for the new matrimonial flat.",2,982,2020-01-06-T-053-S-00982

For members who are unable to make the CPF refund in time, CPF Board and HDB will work with them to explore their options, which will depend on the specific circumstances of their family. For example, they may have a sibling who can take over their share of the co-owned flat, or their parents may wish to right-size to a smaller flat that is within their budget.",3,983,2020-01-06-T-053-S-00983

2020-01-06-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Under the Government-Paid Child Care Leave (GPCL) scheme, employers pay for the first three days of leave taken by their employees, while the Government reimburses employers for the fourth to the sixth day of leave taken. We therefore track take-up of the scheme by the number of people who take four or more days of leave. This is to strike a balance between collecting data for analysis, and avoiding excessive burden on employees and employers to submit more data than is necessary to qualify for childcare leave.",1,988,2020-01-06-T-055-S-00988
2020-01-06-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As employers only claim reimbursement from the Government for employees who take four or more days of leave, we do not require them to submit information for employees who only take one to three days.",2,989,2020-01-06-T-055-S-00989
2020-01-06-T-055,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We also do not require employers to track the number of children that employees taking childcare leave have, as employees are eligible for childcare leave as long as they have at least one citizen child under the age of seven years old.",3,990,2020-01-06-T-055-S-00990

In terms of specific categories of food, the prices of chilled pork fell by 0.3% while the prices of vegetables rose by 2.3% over the same period. The increase in vegetable prices during this period could be due in part to weather-related disruptions in Malaysia, a key import source.",1,1015,2020-01-06-T-059-S-01015

There were mixed views on this and on balance, we decided that P2P fare regulations should focus on fare transparency. This will allow commuters to make informed decisions based on the fares set by operators. There are two safeguards to protect commuter interests. First, we only allow dynamic pricing for flat fare bookings, where fare levels must be displayed upfront, before the commuter books his ride. Second, commuters will continue to have the option to street-hail, or book taxis, according to the metered fare system, for which the fare structure, including the booking fee, requires PTC's approval.",1,1022,2020-01-06-T-061-S-01022

This is why dynamic fares are more effective in ensuring that commuters can find rides during peak hours. There are many forms of P2P services, each requiring different fare levels, for example, larger or premium vehicles for higher fares. Given the range of service offerings and the dynamic nature of market conditions, it is best to leave fare levels to market forces.

2020-01-06-T-063,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,asked the Prime Minister in the past five years (a) how many virtual private network tokens and info-communications equipment have been reported lost or stolen by the various Ministries and Government agencies annually; (b) how many police reports have been made; and (c) whether there have been unauthorised accesses or attempts made resulting from the loss of such security devices.,1,1026,2020-01-06-T-063-S-01026
2020-01-06-T-063,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"Central tracking of lost ICT equipment was implemented from 2017 onwards, with GovTech's formation in late 2016. From 2017 to 2019, there was an average of 182 reports of lost ICT equipment per year, including Public Service access cards, laptops and about 55 virtual private network (or VPN) tokens. There are over 140,000 public service officers, most of whom are issued ICT equipment for work.",1,1027,2020-01-06-T-063-S-01027
2020-01-06-T-063,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"All cases are reported to the Police. User account and VPN access are disabled once the ICT equipment is lost. Data in Government laptops, thumb drives and portable hard disks are also encrypted while tablets and mobile devices are password protected to prevent unauthorised access. There has been no known unauthorised access to Government systems arising from the loss of ICT equipment.",2,1028,2020-01-06-T-063-S-01028
2020-01-06-T-064,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Prime Minister with the recent MAS consultation paper on the regulation of crypto derivatives for Approved Exchanges (a) whether MAS will establish a timeline for eventually imposing regulations on non-approved exchanges; and (b) whether MAS will issue guidelines to financial institutions offering crypto derivatives for retail investors and, if so, whether these guidelines will apply to crypto exchanges or other intermediaries.",1,1029,2020-01-06-T-064-S-01029
2020-01-06-T-064,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),Our basic consideration for crypto-derivative products is that they are not suitable for most retail investors because they do not have intrinsic value and are subject to sharp price swings driven by speculation.,1,1030,2020-01-06-T-064-S-01030
2020-01-06-T-064,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Hence, MAS took a calibrated step to regulate crypto derivative products that are listed and traded only on Approved Exchanges, which are subject to regulatory requirements and supervisory oversight. But we do not extend the regulation of crypto-derivative products beyond Approved Exchanges. This would confer misplaced confidence in these highly volatile products, and lead to a wider offering of such products to retail investors. Our approach has worked so far as trading in crypto products in Singapore remains limited and only a small number of retail investors are involved.",2,1031,2020-01-06-T-064-S-01031
2020-01-06-T-064,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Notwithstanding, MAS has issued circulars to all financial institutions to comply with additional measures if they offer crypto products to retail investors. These include requirements for warnings tailored to the risk of transacting in crypto products in informational materials provided to investors, restrictions on advertisement, and additional margins to be collected from retail investors to mitigate the risk of large losses from trading in volatile and leveraged products.",3,1032,2020-01-06-T-064-S-01032
2020-01-06-T-064,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Investors should, however, be aware that these measures do not apply to entities which are not regulated by MAS. Many trading platforms operate online and are situated overseas. These are outside of MAS' regulatory oversight. Investors that trade on these platforms need to exercise caution and understand the risk of such products.",4,1033,2020-01-06-T-064-S-01033
2020-01-06-T-064,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),MAS has also issued advisories to warn members of the public of the risks of investing in crypto products. We will continue to work with the media to highlight these risks and to raise public awareness of potential scams.,5,1034,2020-01-06-T-064-S-01034
2020-01-06-T-064,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),International regulatory standards in the area of crypto products are still evolving.

2020-01-06-T-065,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Energy Market Authority (EMA) monitors Open Electricity Market providers to ensure that customers who have switched understand the full terms governing their new billing arrangements; (b) whether EMA has received complaints from customers regarding difficulties in making payment arrangements and avoiding penalty charges; (c) why providers are not required to offer the same payment mechanisms that SP Services offers; and (d) what can be done to ensure customers can seamlessly transfer their billing arrangements.,1,1036,2020-01-06-T-065-S-01036
2020-01-06-T-065,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,A key priority for the Energy Market Authority (EMA) when rolling out the Open Electricity Market (OEM) is to ensure that the terms and conditions of retailers' price plans are clear and easy for household consumers to understand.,1,1037,2020-01-06-T-065-S-01037
2020-01-06-T-065,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Thus, EMA requires all OEM retailers to provide a Fact Sheet using a standard template for every price plan that they offer to household consumers. The Fact Sheet highlights the key features of a price plan, including the billing arrangement and any penalty charges, such as late payment or early termination fees. All OEM retailers must make their Fact Sheets easily available on their websites and on EMA's online Price Comparison Tool. They also need to obtain the consumer's explicit acknowledgement that he has read and understood the Fact Sheet during the sign-up process.",2,1038,2020-01-06-T-065-S-01038
2020-01-06-T-065,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"EMA monitors the situation via consumer complaints, Mystery Shopper Audits and Consumer Satisfaction Surveys. Thus far, the overall level of satisfaction has been high. There has been very few complaints about payment arrangements.",3,1039,2020-01-06-T-065-S-01039
2020-01-06-T-065,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Retailers are given the flexibility to offer different payment arrangements to meet the needs of their customers. The more traditional payment arrangements offered by SP Group, such as GIRO, credit card and AXS Stations, are usually available. Some provide new payment methods such as PayNow, which is not offered by SP Group. Others have chosen to engage SP Group to bill and collect payment on their behalf, thereby saving their customers the need to change their billing arrangement. We encourage consumers to consider all these options and choose one that best suit their needs.",4,1040,2020-01-06-T-065-S-01040

2020-01-06-T-067,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Various Government agencies worked together with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and food delivery companies to come up with the Transition Assistance Package, or TAP for short, to help food delivery riders transition to using alternatives to e-scooters, or to other jobs.",1,1046,2020-01-06-T-067-S-01046
2020-01-06-T-067,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As riders do not need to inform the food delivery companies when they have decided to stop taking deliveries, there is no clear-cut way to track the number of affected riders who have become unemployed. Instead, our approach has been to proactively reach out to those who may be looking for other jobs.",2,1047,2020-01-06-T-067-S-01047
2020-01-06-T-067,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"For affected food delivery riders who are looking to change jobs, Workforce Singapore (WSG) and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) have deployed career coaches on-site at food delivery companies on more than 70 occasions, and have organised a curated job fair to assist affected riders with their job search efforts. The food delivery companies have been helpful in disseminating information on these career events to their riders. Affected riders can also tap on various employment facilitation programmes under the Adapt & Grow initiative such as the Place-and-Train Programme, which provide opportunities for jobseekers to be hired and receive training for new jobs.",3,1048,2020-01-06-T-067-S-01048

2020-01-06-T-068,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for Law whether the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) has been effective since its formation and what steps can be taken to improve its processes to make it more expedient and to produce outcomes that can be more effectively enforced.,1,1050,2020-01-06-T-068-S-01050
2020-01-06-T-068,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) were established on 1 October 2015. The CDRT is an avenue to a variety of remedies for persons whose enjoyment or use of their place of residence has been unreasonably interfered with by their neighbours.,1,1051,2020-01-06-T-068-S-01051
2020-01-06-T-068,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The CDRT was established as an alternative to other avenues of recourse for disputing neighbours. These other avenues include  (a)	recourse under the criminal law such as filing a Magistrate's Complaint for offences under the Protection from Harassment Act or Penal Code; (b)	obtaining private law remedies, such as injunctions or damages, through the tort of private nuisance or applying for a Protection Order; and (c)	mediation.",2,1052,2020-01-06-T-068-S-01052
2020-01-06-T-068,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The CDRT processes are designed to be efficient and accessible. It costs $150 to file a claim before the CDRT. Simplified procedures are used. Proceedings employ a judge-led approach and representation by lawyers is generally disallowed.,3,1053,2020-01-06-T-068-S-01053
2020-01-06-T-068,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Between 1 October 2015 and 30 September 2019, 349 claims were filed in the CDRT. Three hundred and nineteen claims were disposed of by the CDRT within this period. Two hundred and thirty- five of these claims were resolved amicably – these comprised 167 claims which were withdrawn/discontinued, and 68 claims where Consent Orders were granted. As for the remaining 84 claims that were disposed of, these comprised 38 claims where the CDRT granted orders after trial and 46 claims where the CDRT dismissed/struck off the applications.",4,1054,2020-01-06-T-068-S-01054
2020-01-06-T-068,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"CDRT orders – like any other court orders – are to be taken seriously. If a party does not comply with a CDRT order, the CDRT may issue a Special Direction for the offending party to comply with the order within a specified time. A person who does not comply with a Special Direction commits a criminal offence punishable with a fine of up to $5,000, a term of imprisonment of up to three months, or both. Non-compliance can also result in a court order excluding the offending party from his or her place of residence. These are very serious consequences, and rightly so.

2020-01-06-T-070,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Pet licensing primarily serves to enable the traceability of animals for the purposes of disease control and to protect public health. At present, NParks only requires dogs to be licensed as they are the most common cause of rabies transmission from animals to humans globally. All pet dogs, whether they reside in HDB flats or otherwise, must be licensed for this reason. NParks is intending to strengthen the traceability of pets, including cats, as part of its broader review of the pet sector. It recently concluded a public consultation exercise that invited suggestions from stakeholders and members of the public on this issue, and will review its licensing policies accordingly.",3,1064,2020-01-06-T-070-S-01064

2020-01-06-T-071,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We recognise the importance of having diverse and well-integrated residential estates across the island, and are looking at various ways to achieve this.

2020-01-06-T-071,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Aside from this, we are using other urban planning levers to achieve a better mix in our private estates. For example, we intend to inject more public housing in the city centre, which largely comprises private residential estates today. In addition, our strategy to inject more industry and jobs outside the city centre will also help to spread out the non-citizen resident population across the island.",3,1068,2020-01-06-T-071-S-01068

2020-01-06-T-074,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Habitat modification involves the directional pruning of trees to discourage mynas from roosting in the affected areas and shepherd them away from residential areas. Roost trees may also be replaced with tree types that are less preferred by the mynas. These are trees with crowns that are less dense, but will still provide greenery and shade. These measures have been effective in reducing myna roosts in Potong Pasir and Ang Mo Kio.

This reduces the land costs and thus the selling prices of EC projects, compared to private condominiums of similar size and location.",1,1085,2020-01-06-T-075-S-01085
2020-01-06-T-075,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Since second-timer EC buyers benefit from this subsidised price, they are subject to a resale levy like second-timers who buy a new flat from HDB. This reduces the subsidy that second-timers receive compared to first-timers, thus ensuring a fairer distribution of housing subsidies.",2,1086,2020-01-06-T-075-S-01086
2020-01-06-T-075,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The resale levy payable depends on the prevailing policy applicable to a second-timer buyer at the time they sold their first subsidised flat. Those who sold their first subsidised flat before 19 May 1997 but opted not to pay a graded resale levy at the point of sale would have to pay a premium on the purchase price of their next subsidised HDB flat or new EC unit.,3,1087,2020-01-06-T-075-S-01087
2020-01-06-T-076,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of reported dislodged tiles in HDB flats in December 2019; (b) whether the cooler temperature in December has resulted in more cases; and (c) how can HDB assist to keep the repair costs affordable.,1,1088,2020-01-06-T-076-S-01088
2020-01-06-T-076,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The total number of reported cases of dislodged floor tiles has come down in 2019 compared to the previous year. On a monthly basis, there were indeed more cases reported in December compared to the other months of the year. Specifically, HDB received about 580 reported cases in December compared to the monthly average of 247 cases for 2019. This was likely due to the colder weather and temperature fluctuations during that month, which could have caused the tiles and the substrate to contract and expand at different rates, resulting in the loss of adhesion between the tiles and the substrate.",1,1089,2020-01-06-T-076-S-01089
2020-01-06-T-076,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Flat owners are responsible for the maintenance of their flats, including repairs for general wear and tear. Nevertheless, HDB will help flat owners repair dislodged tiles originally provided by HDB for a period of up to 15 years.",2,1090,2020-01-06-T-076-S-01090
2020-01-06-T-076,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For cases beyond 15 years, flat owners will need to do their own replacement of tiles. HDB can provide owners with a list of registered repair contractors, whom they can then engage on a private basis. HDB can also help owners with the removal and disposal of the affected tiles and if necessary, with the laying of protective sheets over the affected area. Residents who need financial assistance with the cost of dislodged tile repairs can seek assistance from grassroots organisations and Community Development Councils (CDCs). HDB will assist such residents by referring them to these community organisations.",3,1091,2020-01-06-T-076-S-01091
2020-01-06-T-077,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the various initiatives to reach out to and monitor the well-being of elderly persons living alone, particularly those in the lower income brackets; and (b) whether these programmes have been effective in reducing the number of lonely elderly deaths where bodies are undetected for extended periods of time.",1,1092,2020-01-06-T-077-S-01092
2020-01-06-T-077,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Government works with community partners on multi-pronged interventions to support our seniors, especially those living alone and with low income, to age well in the community.",1,1093,2020-01-06-T-077-S-01093
2020-01-06-T-077,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"First, we reach out to seniors proactively to check on their well-being. As part of regular home visits, Silver Generation Ambassadors (SG Ambassadors) assess seniors' health and social needs, and inform them of the various Government policies and schemes to support them. The SG Ambassadors also encourage well seniors to take part in active ageing programmes, and refer frail seniors to relevant agencies for their care needs. SGO's engagements complement the efforts of Senior Activity Centres (SACs) that reach out to seniors in the community, particularly those in the lower-income group.",2,1094,2020-01-06-T-077-S-01094
2020-01-06-T-077,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Second, programmes are in place to support seniors' needs, especially for seniors who live alone or are low-income. A key focus area is befriending. The network of SG Ambassadors, grassroots leaders and social service agencies connects seniors at risk of social isolation to community befrienders. The befrienders visit seniors at least twice a month, supplemented with phone calls. Seniors may also be referred to CareLine, a 24/7 hotline that provides tele-befriending services as well as emergency response to seniors in distress, which is especially helpful for those living alone. There are also various community-led initiatives which complement formal befriending services, such as the ""Neighbour Cares"" programme in Jurong East. Under this pilot, resident volunteers keep a lookout for any visible signs of distress from vulnerable seniors in neighbouring units.",3,1095,2020-01-06-T-077-S-01095
2020-01-06-T-077,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Third, seniors with complex needs will receive more intensive follow-up. Community case management services coordinate services required by seniors who have weak social support or complex social-health needs. The Social Service Offices work closely with community partners to provide financial support to needy seniors. Community outreach teams provide seniors at risk of dementia or depression with basic emotional support and coping strategies, including where to seek help if needed. Family Service Centres also provide counselling and support services to families with seniors to help them with relationship problems, as well as financial and emotional difficulties. Seniors with care needs, and who have no or little family support, are also supported by Senior Group Homes, Sheltered Homes and Nursing Homes, which provide residential and socio-emotional support.",4,1096,2020-01-06-T-077-S-01096
2020-01-06-T-077,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We do not track the number of lonely elderly deaths where bodies are undetected for extended periods of time. Building communities of care is a whole of society effort. The efforts outlined above aim to enable our elderly to live well and leave well in the community. MOH will continue to work with our community partners, Government agencies and fellow Singaporeans to support our seniors.",5,1097,2020-01-06-T-077-S-01097
2020-01-06-T-078,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Communications and Information what are the considerations behind the current arrangement of making the Government eGazette only available for the past five days and requiring a paid subscription to access the archive online.,1,1098,2020-01-06-T-078-S-01098
2020-01-06-T-078,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Previously, documents that were electronically published in the Government Gazette on the e-Gazette website were available for free access by members of the public for five days. This was an agreement between the Government and Toppan Leefung Pte Ltd (Toppan), formerly known as the Singapore National Printers Pte Ltd, that had been in place since September 1998 when the e-Gazette website was implemented. Toppan was granted a non-exclusive licence to publish documents in the Government Gazette in electronic form. As Toppan had invested in procuring, configuring, maintaining and operating the system which was used for the publication of Government Gazettes on the e-Gazette website, it was allowed to recover costs by imposing subscription fees for access to the e-Gazette archives.",1,1099,2020-01-06-T-078-S-01099
2020-01-06-T-078,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,The documents on the e-Gazette website are mostly legislation. Current and earlier versions of all legislation are also available on the Singapore Statutes Online website hosted by the Attorney-General's Chambers. This website provides 24/7 free public access.,2,1100,2020-01-06-T-078-S-01100
2020-01-06-T-078,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In this digital age when citizens get most of their information online, Government notices should be made more easily accessible to the public. We have reviewed our arrangements with Toppan. By the end of January 2020, all publications on the e-Gazette website will be made available to the public without charge, including publications that have been published for more than five days.",3,1101,2020-01-06-T-078-S-01101
2020-01-06-T-079,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Government has responded to Senoko Energy's request for a rescue package and whether our energy market is in trouble.,1,1102,2020-01-06-T-079-S-01102
2020-01-06-T-079,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Senoko Energy Pte Ltd (Senoko) has clarified publicly that its current financial situation does not require additional funding from the government in the foreseeable future, and that its outlook on the local power industry remains positive.",1,1103,2020-01-06-T-079-S-01103
2020-01-06-T-079,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Power generators have long asset lives of about 30 years. During this period, the investment of power generating companies (gencos) are subject to cyclical fluctuations in demand and supply, given that Singapore's electricity market is a competitive one. We are currently in a situation where there is an excess supply of generation capacity. Over time, this oversupply should ease as demand rises and old capacity is retired.",2,1104,2020-01-06-T-079-S-01104
2020-01-06-T-079,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To help the gencos weather the present circumstances, EMA has introduced several measures. For instance, since August 2018, flexibility was provided for gencos to retire their steam plants. EMA also worked with the gencos to reduce their contracted Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) supply and divert their excess LNG purchases. The LNG terminal tariff payable by the gencos was also lowered, which would provide gencos with cost savings. In addition, EMA developed a scheme to support gencos to maintain high operational reliability and adopt good labour management and capability building practices.",3,1105,2020-01-06-T-079-S-01105
2020-01-06-T-079,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Over the longer term, to ensure our electricity market remains economically efficient and resilient, EMA is also working on initiatives such as introducing a Forward Capacity Market to procure in advance the generation capacity we need to ensure reliable electricity supply. This should also provide a more steady income stream for gencos.",4,1106,2020-01-06-T-079-S-01106
2020-01-06-T-079,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Ultimately, EMA's primary responsibility is to maintain a well-functioning and sustainable market that promotes competition and an electricity supply that is efficient, reliable and secure. EMA cannot be responsible for the commercial viability of individual firms. EMA will continue to work with the gencos to ensure that information is available to help them make the best decisions, and ensure that our energy market remains resilient and competitive.",5,1107,2020-01-06-T-079-S-01107
2020-01-06-T-080,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Ministry will consider matching Singaporeans senior in age with young Singaporeans in their teens such as to mentor them so that both the elder person and the young person can benefit through a mentor-mentee relationship.",1,1108,2020-01-06-T-080-S-01108
2020-01-06-T-080,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"MCCY recognises the importance of mentoring. Youths who receive mentorship are more likely to be active in the community, more resilient when facing setbacks, and have higher levels of self-esteem and self-confidence. We also recognise that many seniors have the life experience and wisdom that could make them good mentors to youths. Hence, increasing mentoring opportunities, including mentoring of youths by older persons, is one of the key actions we are developing under the SG Youth Action Plan.",1,1109,2020-01-06-T-080-S-01109
2020-01-06-T-080,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"For example, MCCY and the National Youth Council are supporting the Mentoring Alliance, a ground-up initiative comprising 11 youth sector organisations that aims to promote a local mentoring movement and foster positive youth development. Mentoring Alliance has recruited about 200 mentors, including seniors, who mentor youths in areas such as resilience building, pro-social skills and marketplace exposure. We support these efforts through the National Youth Fund.",2,1110,2020-01-06-T-080-S-01110
2020-01-06-T-080,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As part of the SG Youth Action Plan, we are also partnering with Young NTUC's Youth Career Network (YCN). Young NTUC's YCN aims to provide young polytechnic and university graduates with career support and guidance in Singapore, and has recently expanded its focus to include ASEAN. This is an area where the experience of our seniors in ASEAN would benefit a new generation of Singaporeans seeking out opportunities in our region.",3,1111,2020-01-06-T-080-S-01111
2020-01-06-T-080,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Inter-generational mentoring can also go both ways, where youths aid our seniors in areas where our youth have expertise. For example, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has launched digital experiential learning journeys since 2018, where youths guide seniors to become more digitally ready. During these tours, youth volunteers from Youth Corps Singapore (YCS) personally teach seniors on using e-Payments, banking apps and cyber security tips.",4,1112,2020-01-06-T-080-S-01112
2020-01-06-T-080,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Beyond these current initiatives, MCCY has funding for good ideas that bring Singaporeans together, such as Our Singapore Fund.

2020-01-06-T-081,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon,"asked the Minister for Defence whether he can provide an update on the efficacy of ""Platoon Commander Interviews"" as an avenue to address mental health concerns of National Servicemen and whether such interviews can be extended to enlistees holding the rank of officers.",1,1114,2020-01-06-T-081-S-01114
2020-01-06-T-081,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The SAF has a support system in place to monitor our national servicemen's mental well-being and extend support to those facing challenges in their personal lives or adjustments to military life.

2020-01-06-T-081,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Platoon Commander (or PC) Interview is one example. Carried out at regular intervals during Basic Military Training (BMT) and in units, this is a platform for one-to-one conversations between servicemen and their commanders. Based on our experience, it has helped our commanders to identify servicemen under their charge who are experiencing NS-related or personal problem or other mental health concern. The commanders would then extend first level advice and support or refer the servicemen for counselling or other professional interventions where necessary.",2,1116,2020-01-06-T-081-S-01116

While regular interviews are not mandated for officers, all commanders engage their officers regularly to identify and support those who require assistance, including those with mental health concerns. Apart from these informal interviews with their superiors, the whole support network of counselling and helplines is available and accessible to officers. As part of our overall support system, there are trained para-counsellors in every unit to provide frontline counselling services as well as a 24-hour counselling hotline for all servicemen.",3,1117,2020-01-06-T-081-S-01117
