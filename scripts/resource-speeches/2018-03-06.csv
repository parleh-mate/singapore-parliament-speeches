2018-03-06-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mr Speaker, Sir, on 1 March, Ms Sylvia Lim questioned in this House the Government's motives in announcing the increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) some three to seven years before the increase is implemented. She said, and I quote, ""we do note that in the run-up to the Budget discussion, there were some test balloons being floated out about the fact that the Government needs to raise revenue. And immediately the public seized on the fact that Deputy Prime Minister Tharman and, perhaps, other leaders had earlier said that the Government has enough money for the decade. So, the public pointed out, 'Hey, you know, is this a contradiction?' And I rather suspect, myself, that the Government is stuck with that announcement. Otherwise, if the announcement had not been made, perhaps, we would be debating a GST hike today.""",1,8,2018-03-06-T-002-S-00008
2018-03-06-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Ms Lim was suggesting that the Government would have raised the GST immediately if not for the adverse public reaction when it ""floated"" the suggestion late last year and if it had not been ""stuck"" with the previous statement that it had enough money for the decade.",2,9,2018-03-06-T-002-S-00009
2018-03-06-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Ms Lim was, in fact, accusing the Government of being untruthful when it said that it had planned ahead and that its proposal to raise the GST between 2021 and 2025 was the result of such planning.",3,10,2018-03-06-T-002-S-00010
2018-03-06-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Law had responded to Ms Lim to explain that there was no basis for her allegations. The first mention of the need for the tax increase was in the Prime Minister's National Day Rally in 2013, more than four years ago. The Minister for Finance reiterated this in his 2017 Budget Statement and again at a Constituency function a few months later. The Prime Minister spoke again of the likelihood of a tax increase last November, and had expressly referred to the Finance Minister's earlier statements.",4,11,2018-03-06-T-002-S-00011
2018-03-06-T-002,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Indeed, in the previous term of Government, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman had said during the 2014 Budget Statement and in the 2015 Budget Statement that while the Government had taken steps to ensure that it had sufficient revenue to meet spending needs till the end of this decade, I quote, ""we will run into structural deficits if we did not raise revenues in the next decade.""",5,12,2018-03-06-T-002-S-00012

The Government has enough money till the end of this decade but beyond that, it would have to raise taxes to meet rising expenditure needs, especially in healthcare.",6,13,2018-03-06-T-002-S-00013

She decided to install a mobile ordering and payment solution, which allowed her customers to review the menu and order even before arriving at the restaurant, so they can avoid the queue. This way, the customer is happy, and she was able to improve her operations with the data generated. Most importantly, the added convenience made work more enjoyable for Shakila’s wheelchair-bound employee, Suzy, who can now manage the ordering platform online, from home.",2,32,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00032

2018-03-06-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, let me begin with the digital economy. Digital transformation is the most important issue facing businesses today. Singapore Business Federation’s recent study showed that the majority of our businessmen fully appreciate the importance of digitalisation because the payoffs are enormous. Microsoft’s recent study estimated that the digital economy would contribute another US$10 billion to our GDP by 2021. This is the context for our Smart Nation initiative – good jobs and opportunities for our people.",5,35,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00035
2018-03-06-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked what the Government is doing to ensure that Singapore businesses and workforce can thrive in the digital future. My answer is “ABC” – Accelerate the digitalisation of existing sectors, Build up our infocomm media or ICM companies, and Create future digital technology sectors. Let me explain.",6,36,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00036
2018-03-06-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Firstly, ""A"" – Accelerate the digitalisation of existing sectors. Digitalisation affects every sector. But not all of the sectors have responded equally quickly. Some sectors like banking and finance, and retail have done relatively well. During my recent visit to NTUC Fairprice’s new “living lab” supermarket at SingPost Centre, I saw how Fairprice had transformed its traditional supermarket using innovative retail technologies to revolutionise the shopping experience to meet changing consumer expectations and habits in the digital age, while boosting workers’ productivity. But there are other sectors that are finding it more difficult to keep up.",7,37,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00037
2018-03-06-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Members asked how the Government can help SMEs benefit from digitalisation. Allow me to first share the common challenge that SMEs face in going digital. One reason why some sectors are unable to transform digitally is knowledge. Even if companies are keen to embrace digital, they do not know how to, or where to start. This is particularly true for SMEs, which sometimes lack the resources and scale to deploy digital solutions. That is why we launched the SMEs Go Digital Programme last year, which for a start, focuses on key sectors where digital technologies can improve productivity significantly. This includes providing step-by-step guidance under the Industry Digital Plans (IDPs) to make digitalisation simpler for SMEs. We have since launched the Retail and Logistics IDPs last November and we aim to do more this year.",8,38,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00038
2018-03-06-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Members asked about the outcomes of our initiatives to help SMEs digitalise.

More than 650 SMEs have benefitted from the programme, with many more waiting in line.",9,39,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00039
2018-03-06-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"A beneficiary of the pre-approved digital solution under the Programme, is House of Seafood, a restaurant chain and food manufacturer. It exports its products to many countries. However, each country has its own import requirements, and it was difficult to track them all efficiently. So, the company installed a digital tagging solution to automate the compliance checks for its many products. House of Seafood is now able to export its products more easily, and has grown its sales by 20% and productivity by 25%.",10,40,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00040
2018-03-06-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Another example, Sir, is OKH Logistics. The complexity of the logistics business cannot be underestimated. So the company adopted an intelligent vehicle monitoring system to operate its vehicles better. By analysing the data collected, it was able to significantly reduce the number of vehicle accidents by 50%. Fewer vehicle accidents mean better utilisation of assets. This led to about 10% increase in the number of deliveries handled a day.",11,41,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00041

2018-03-06-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Another way we are accelerating the sector digitalisation is to put in place common infrastructure that will raise business productivity. One such project is e-invoicing. Invoices are critical functions for businesses – without an invoice, businesses do not get paid. But invoicing can be very tedious and manual, with many inherent errors. E-invoicing can change that. It can help businesses cut costs, ensure companies are paid faster and open up new financing options. We are currently studying this with companies and will announce more details later.",19,49,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00049
2018-03-06-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, I shall move on to ""B"" – Build up our ICM companies.

Under our ITM, we aim to create 13,000 new PMET jobs, and the industry’s value-added is expected to grow at around 6% annually.

Thanks to its proprietary software, it now has 24/7 visibility of all customer orders, can handle a larger volume of orders and reduce incidence of wrong delivery. It has also used its analytics software products to diversify into complementary areas, such as e-commerce.

What are the expected success indicators of the funding and collaboration that was announced just now with other players like Mediacorp and SPH? In the Ministry's view, how are they performing compared to authentic influencers for readers and viewers, such as Toggle versus YouTube, Netflix; mainstream news apps versus other alternatives; or TV content providers versus cable operators?",1,194,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00194
2018-03-06-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,Is the Ministry also concerned that some companies like SPH last year had to scale back and retrench? Will that impact their role in public communications?,2,195,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00195

2018-03-06-T-004,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Chairman, I thank Mr Zaqy Mohamad for his clarifications. First, we need to understand that viewership and readership of mainstream media - Mediacorp, SPH - have not been reduced. What happened is in the case of SPH, instead of reading the hardcopy newspapers, more of their readers are now shifting online and getting their news through mobile devices, through their iPads.",1,197,2018-03-06-T-004-S-00197

There is always a gathering of the volunteers, with the NLB team to share expertise and success stories. Our team is very small, our ambitions are very large.

So, we have been recruiting a lot of volunteers. My own experience in Kolam Ayer − we are blessed with a lots of young volunteers coming forward. NLB runs a training programme for them and then, they do the outreach and do the reading programme.

If I heard correctly, 30% of households are still on the analogue TV signal. It sounds like a very big number. So, it translates to a few hundred thousand households which come next year will not receive the TV signal. I am quite happy to mobilise our grassroots volunteers to reach out. But I think I, myself, struggle to translate some of the terms because ""analogue TV signal"", I google translate it and the Chinese word that pops up, I do not even know how to read.

Would these downward adjustments to Budget caps have an impact on planned investments by Ministries and agencies who have wanted to enhance and upgrade their systems to improve efficiency and effectiveness; but now would have to shelf their plans due to Budget caps?",4,220,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00220

For Budget 2018, total spending by the Government is estimated to be $80 billion, representing an increase of 8.3% year-on-year, mainly on the back of increased spending in transport, trade and industry and home security. Even though our Government’s spending, at 19% of GDP, is considered lean when compared to other developed countries, the expenditure growth has been on the rise and cost management discipline is more important now than ever. It is critical that we consider our expenditure growth very carefully and take every step to ensure we get best value for the money we spend.",1,231,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00231
2018-03-06-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"In the private sector, it is common strategy to consider cost cutting in other areas to fund new investments and increases in expenditures. I call on the Government to take a bottom-up analysis of each Ministry’s expenditure needs, scrutinise and prioritise costs items. The Finance Minister has introduced the discipline of moderating the pace of Ministries’ Budget growth in the last two budgets. What more can the Government do to work smarter and more efficiently.",2,232,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00232
2018-03-06-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"First, I would like to ask the Minister if the operations of Ministries and Statutory Boards are subject to productivity reviews to establish their operational efficiency and goals for improvement.

2018-03-06-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Second, with significant infrastructure spending and Government programmes yet to come, I would like to ask the Minister what mechanisms are in place to evaluate and monitor spending to ensure value-for-money and accountability on outcomes and spending. How will public officers be rewarded for cost savings they manage to secure against the allocated Budget for projects? There should be incentives to recognise public officers' efforts and cost saving. We do hear of stories of public sector officers rushing to spend allocated funds toward the end of financial year, about this time, often on programmes they could have done without. The understanding is that they fear being penalised in future Budgets if they under-utilise the current Budget.",4,234,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00234
2018-03-06-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Third, with increasingly complex challenges facing the Government, it is critical that the public sector agencies adopt a coordinated whole-of-Government response, and work collaboratively to avoid duplication of efforts and costs.

Respondents were asked if they had done the following in the past month  first, helped a stranger or someone they did not know who needed help; second, donated money to charity; third, volunteered their time to their organisation. In terms of donating money, Singapore was the 19th most generous country in 2016.

This proposal will mean that instead of a flat rate of 250% for all donations, the tax deduction rate increases with a quantum of donation given. Much like how incomes are broken down to bands to compute income tax rates, the same can be done for donations.

During that Budget, the NTP was also presented as an example of an ""industry-level transformation"". It was then mentioned that the initiative will cost an estimated S$100 million, while it could bring about man-hour savings of about S$600 million to Singapore's firms.

2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"On our fiscal position, Mr Cedric Foo asked about the proportion of capital investment compared to recurrent spending or operating expenditure. Let me start by elaborating on our overall funding approach. In fact, this is what the Minister for Finance had explained in his Budget speech that we fund recurrent needs through taxation and we will consider borrowing for major infrastructure projects.",4,318,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00318
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But even as we look at borrowing, we will only do so prudently and on a selective basis. We should borrow for the right projects ‒ those that are bankable and generate adequate future revenue streams to repay the borrowing. One example that we are looking at is Changi Airport Terminal 5. If we do not do this, if we are not careful and selective in borrowing, we may end up over-burdening ourselves with rising interest costs. And that is not what we intend to do. So, therefore, even as we borrow, there will still be capital projects that we continue to fund through development expenditure from the annual Budget.",5,319,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00319
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"For FY2018, the share of development expenditure of the total Budget is around 28%. It is slightly higher than what it used to be, but it is in the ballpark. Looking ahead, we expect development expenditures to rise as we continue to invest in more capital projects. But at the same time, operating expenditures are also going to increase, especially in areas that were highlighted in the Budget like healthcare, security and other social spending. So, overall, both will go up but we expect the share of development spending to continue to rise slightly in the coming years.",6,320,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00320
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We will continue to monitor this share between operating and development spending. It is an important balance. Because if we spend too much on recurrent, then we are not investing enough for the future; we are not building capabilities for the future. If we spend too much on capital, then we may end up with a long tail of future spending for maintenance and replacement. So, it is critical to get the balance right, and that is what we are doing.",7,321,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00321
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Many of the capital projects in the Government are undertaken by our statutory boards. Mr Pritam Singh asked about the harmonisation of accounts because our statutory boards use the accrual basis for their accounts and the Ministries use cash. This is the approach we have taken because we believe that cash accounting allows for better control of spending, and it is a more prudent way of fiscal management. That is not just us. Many governments also do cash accounting for their Ministries. But for statutory boards, they use accrual for their accounts because statutory boards are set up as separate legal entities with their own financial accounts. Some statutory boards even go to the markets to borrow. So, we want our statutory boards to be subject to the same discipline as the private sector, and that is why they use accrual accounts, like what private sector companies do.",8,322,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00322

However, this is still not sufficient to fully cover the $4 billion that PUB will be investing in additional water infrastructure between FY2017 and FY2021. And because there is this gap in its financing cash flows, PUB borrows for its capital investments. So, this is what happens within the PUB accounts.",11,325,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00325

Within the budget given to them, each agency optimises its spending and channels resources to worthwhile programmes. The 2% reduction to the budget cap announced at the last Budget, and the reduction to the annual growth of the block budgets announced recently by the Minister for Finance will further encourage fiscal discipline among Government agencies. We have the Budget Utilisation Framework which encourages Ministries to budget as closely as possible to their expenditure needs. This is to ensure that they do not set aside more than they require and, as a result, deprive other meritorious needs of funding. But I would assure Ms Foo Mee Har that Ministries do not spend for the sake of spending or meeting the budget, especially during the end of the year.

We do not look at each project in isolation, but we consider how they affect one another, and the potential synergies of multiple projects collectively. We look for opportunities for infrastructure integration, which allows us to achieve better outcomes or reap savings. The Ministers for Finance and Transport have shared one example, which is the LTA's innovative 4-in-1 depot that saved the Government $2 billion. Another example is the integration of PUB’s Tuas Water Reclamation Plant with NEA’s Integrated Waste Management Facility which brings about a number of synergies while optimising land use. Within this integrated facility, the co-digestion of food waste from NEA’s facility with the used water sludge from PUB’s facility generates more biogas and enhances energy production. This allows both facilities to be self-sufficient in energy. The two plants will also enjoy other synergies, like the sharing of common administrative facilities.

Since the app was launched in October last year, about 250,000 vehicles have used it on more than two million parking sessions.",38,352,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00352

2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"One example is IRAS’ hackathon to crowd-source solutions to make it an easier experience for companies and individuals to file their taxes. Filing taxes is never a pleasant experience. But we can make the process streamlined and convenient for everyone. A group of individuals, who called themselves TinkerTax was one of the winners in the hackathon. It is an online application that helps SMEs prepare for the submission of their corporate income tax return. With TinkerTax, companies can convert accounting income to taxable income for their income tax returns in three easy steps. This innovative solution helps small companies as it allows them to complete their tax return filing more easily.",40,354,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00354

2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Firstly, the Public Service operates on a common procurement policy framework.

2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Secondly, we consider both price and quality factors when we do procurement. There is a perception out there that Government purchases only on price alone. But that is not the case. About half of all Government procurements today are not awarded to the lowest-priced bidder because they are put out on a price and quality methodology. Quality factors would include reliability, innovativeness, expertise of the vendor, track record and much more.",45,359,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00359

This provides a quality feedback loop to recognise firms that have performed well in previous projects.",47,361,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00361
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Thirdly, the public sector seeks to centralise our procurement wherever appropriate. One way is by aggregating demand for common purchases across agencies. One agency calls a bulk tender on behalf of others. This minimises administration costs and enables quantity discounts.",48,362,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00362
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Today, there are over 70 types of bulk contracts, accounting for about one-third of Government spend in goods and services.

2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"There is, however, a limit to how much centralisation or standardisation is optimal.

2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We also need to be mindful of providing sufficient opportunities for SMEs.

If we have too large a contract, it is more likely to be taken up by the big suppliers only.",51,365,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00365
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),Too much centralisation or standardising also limits flexibilities or variations to meet the unique needs of agencies or situations. So we need to strike a judicious balance.,52,366,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00366

Actually, this cut may be better filed under MND. I am not sure if I am taking this as MOF or MND. We can discuss further in the MND COS coming up later. Mr Yee asked if we can require foreign companies to form a joint venture with local firms to bid for our construction contracts. This is not permitted under WTO rules. He talked about price-diving by foreign firms. We are aware that this happens, but it is not limited to foreign firms. The fact is that the construction industry is in a downturn. Many companies are bidding for projects and there is price-diving. But, as I have highlighted earlier, price is not the only factor used in evaluating Government tenders. We are placing greater emphasis on the quality factors.",55,369,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00369
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We have also introduced measures to deter ""price-diving"" because we want to avoid the situation where a company, local or foreign, tries too hard to secure a contract, dives the prices and then ends up not being able to deliver, or worse, compromise on quality just to get the project done within that price. So, for construction tenders, various agencies have adopted practices to identify abnormally low bids and scrutinise the contractors’ ability to deliver the projects at such prices.",56,370,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00370
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We also continue to ensure our construction contracts remain accessible to local companies that may be smaller in size.

2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Finally, let me address Mr Azmoon Ahmad’s suggestion to share more of FY2017’s Budget surplus with Singaporeans. I should say we should not look at the SG Bonus in isolation. In fact, the entire surplus is given back to all Singaporeans in different ways, not just through the SG Bonus. The $5 billion we set aside for the Rail Infrastructure Fund to build future MRT lines, this will benefit all MRT commuters. Another $2 billion is for subsidies on ElderShield premiums and other related support when the ElderShield review is complete, and that will be happening soon. These premium subsidies for lower- and middle-income Singaporeans will ensure that the enhanced ElderShield scheme remains affordable, and the premium subsidies will directly benefit individuals and families.",60,374,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00374
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, you have to look at the surplus in totality. We do not save surpluses. We give them all back to Singaporeans, but we give back in different forms. Some will be for spending for future needs, some will be for spending for current needs like the ElderShield Premiums, and some will be through a direct transfer like the SG Bonus. And if we look at the direct transfers, we should also recognise that, besides the SG Bonus itself, there are other social transfers in the Budget, like the GST Voucher, the U-Save rebates and the S&CC rebates. In fact, the support we provide to Singaporeans who need help goes beyond the SG Bonus and these direct transfer schemes. In various areas, like housing, healthcare, education and childcare, we have enhanced the support provided by our permanent schemes over the years with more assistance targeted at the lower-income.",61,375,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00375

2018-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"I just want to echo what Dr Tan Wu Meng and Mr Henry Kwek have said about designs, how important is design, when we look at building design, to make sure that it does not cost more to maintain thereafter. We have many examples on that. So, perhaps, can I ask the Minister whether, in the whole process, we should also seek inputs from town councils and NEA who will be there to maintain the building thereafter, to give inputs whether these designs are indeed practical? They may look very nice from afar, but is it practical to maintain on an on-going basis?",1,447,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00447

Like what I have said in my speech, to leverage on the private sector to achieve better value-for-money. There are many examples. For example, in my constituency, we have an Integrated Transport Hub (ITH), and next to it is a commercial shopping centre. If we could have in the planning requirements that require the developer to also build better connectivity to the ITH, for example, that would have saved us some money to build subsequent features to enhance walkability and connectivity. So, maybe this question is best directed at the Second Minister for Finance who is also the Minister for National Development.",2,448,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00448
2018-03-06-T-005,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Chairman, I am happy to take both questions in both capacities, too. Seeking inputs for design, I think it is an on-going process. We already do that and we want to continue to do that to improve design, not just for aesthetics, like I have said, but for functionality and maintainability. It is an on-going process. There will always be areas for improvement, I am sure, and we will continue to get feedback from all stakeholders, different agencies, town councils, different building users, so that we can continually improve. And this improvement is not, as I have said earlier, specific only to Government projects. There are many other buildings that are being developed by the private sector. So, we really have to get the whole architectural profession to start paying greater attention to designing for these purposes.",1,449,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00449

The Member would realise we have made some adjustments to some of the requirements. URA has required private developers now, for new buildings, to put in place more connectivity, linking up buildings to another, and then enabling some of the last-mile connectivity within the building development. That is already being done. It was not done previously, but we have stepped up our efforts to do this. Again, it is an area which we will continue to improve.",2,450,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00450
2018-03-06-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Chairman. I have got three clarifications for the Senior Minister of State on the role of Temasek and also MOF. Earlier on, in her reply, she mentioned that Temasek was very active in promoting good governance, for example, by conducting seminars, training and so on. I think that is more on a general level. But she did not touch on whether Temasek had been active in, for example, querying suspicious practices in the companies that they invest in. So, I would like to ask her whether she is aware whether Temasek has been playing that role, specifically to query what has been going on in some of its portfolio companies. That is the first clarification.",1,451,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00451
2018-03-06-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The second clarification is, in my speech as well as in her response, she did mention the Chinese New Year lunch sharing that the Chairman of Temasek had recently, where it was quite clear from his speech that corruption is an OB marker now specifically expressed as something that Temasek would not want to tolerate. Is she aware of any other unethical practices that are OBs for Temasek? For example, do they avoid investing in companies that promote unclean energy or promote tobacco, for example? Is she aware of any other OB markers for Temasek to invest in?",2,452,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00452
2018-03-06-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"And, finally, the third clarification is  on the role of the Ministry itself, as the sole shareholder of Temasek, I think at least Mr Lim Boon Heng accepts that Temasek is flying Singapore's flag and, if anything were to happen that affects the reputation of its portfolio companies, our country's reputation would be affected as well. So, I would like to ask her whether MOF actually has any specific parameters for Temasek as to certain things that should or would not be condoned as investments. I understand, by comparison, the Norwegian Government has got certain excluded investments. I would like to ask whether MOF also has something similar with its investment companies.",3,453,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00453
2018-03-06-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Chairman, if I may just take the last question first. Essentially, as the shareholder of Temasek, we do not get involved in their commercial decisions. But the Ministry of Finance's expectation of Temasek is that it must uphold the highest standards of integrity, highest standards of governance, do not get involved in anything illegal, and make sure that they adhere to the highest standards of corporate governance. That is our expectation of them. They are a professional team and we expect them to live up to that expectation. So, in terms of the specific question  do we get involved in what they should invest in, what they should not invest in? The Government does not step into that. But our expectation is that Temasek must act properly, and have good compliance with governance and highest standards of integrity. And they, in turn, I think expect that, too, of their investee companies, as you would have seen from the discussion that the Chairman had with its investee companies.",1,454,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00454
2018-03-06-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Ms Lim's second question was where she said that corruption is now an OB marker ‒ actually corruption has always been an OB marker, not just now, it has been that case for a long time. But she asked whether I was aware of specific investment principles. I will come back to what I said earlier which is that, obviously, Temasek will not condone anything that is illegal, anything that is in breach of international regulations, basically anything that constitutes bad conduct or improper governance. I think if one reads the speech given by Mr Lim Boon Heng to the investee companies, it really sets out or outlines what his expectation is. I would not go through the whole thing but let me just give some excerpts where he said",2,455,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00455

2018-03-06-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"And the third question was whether I was aware if Temasek is querying suspicious things. I think it really depends on what the scenario is. I do not have information on what Temasek's information on specific portfolio companies is. But I think I can say this much with confidence. As shareholders, when you have your shareholders' meetings, obviously the audited accounts are placed before the shareholders. I would certainly expect Temasek, as a shareholder, if it sees anything in the accounts that look suspicious, to query it. Do I know or have any personal knowledge what their representatives do at their shareholders' meetings? I do not, but does the Ministry of Finance expect Temasek, when it sees something suspicious in audited accounts, to raise it at shareholders' meetings? The answer is ""Yes"".",6,459,2018-03-06-T-005-S-00459

And, indeed, when you look at future investment plans, PUB is committed to setting aside or investing $4 billion in additional water infrastructure.

It would certainly be welcome by these families as it would cut down on their electricity bills. Will the Ministry consider giving help to these families? May I suggest changing all bulbs of 1- and 2-room flats to energy saving bulbs? Do not just give vouchers or the bulbs. Can Ministry do one step further, that is, install the bulbs for them with the help of some corporations? This is good corporate social responsibility (CSR). By doing so, Ministry would know if the bulbs are installed, or not, whether the bulbs could fit into old light fittings or not.

2018-03-06-T-006,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I am interested in the updates for a couple of PUB programmes which tap upon technology to help households conserve water. One is a trial by PUB to install smart water devices for 10,000 new homes. These devices provide real-time information on water consumption during showers. What has been the feedback on these devices and are the monitors effective in helping the families improve the management of their water consumption during showers? If so, can these devices be made available to all households in Singapore?",9,532,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00532

These principles shape our pricing policy, where we peg our water price to its Long-run Marginal Cost (LRMC). This has been our consistent policy. The LRMC is not a theoretical price – we will actually have to pay it when we spend on infrastructure. Hence, we cannot subject the price of water to market distortions. There are commercial sensitivities to the specifics of our pricing. By not revealing them, we ensure market competitiveness and the best possible bids in tenders.

2018-03-06-T-006,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Second clarification is  Minister mentioned that if we get our policies right, there is no need for Day Zero campaign. I certainly hope so. My question is  having a campaign, having a water rationing exercise island-wide, would this not nudge us, bring the entire population towards this goal and, in the process, also build our water, physical or mental resilience? So, I see a lot more benefits, I do not see any downside. So, I would urge Minister to review this decision.",2,763,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00763

2018-03-06-T-006,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The first question is whether we will revise the target or do we have a target. Yes, we do have a target. We have a target of 140 litres per capita per day, as inferred by Mr Pritam Singh, by 2030. I am glad it is going down, and what we would like to see is that it will go down sustainably and not just episodically. So, over the next one or two years, we will watch this figure. We will put in water conservation efforts to help our residents, our citizens to save water and then look at whether we need to revise it one or two years down the line. But, certainly, there is a lot of scope for us to put in technologies, to put in measures that will, hopefully, get us better than 140 litres per day, as we targeted.",2,765,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00765
2018-03-06-T-006,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Secondly, whether we should do a national water rationing campaign. Right now, what we have started is a school-based water rationing campaign. We started with only about 10 schools. Now, a lot more schools have come on board. And even as we try to do this at both the Primary and Secondary schools, there are issues in ensuring that it is safe. Basic hygiene is still something we want to ensure, particularly the aged, and, in this case, they are very young. Let us go through that exercise and then, over time, not make a water ration exercise become a disaster for individuals. So, I think, for the moment, let us just do this at the school level first and, over time, if there is ever a need for us to have that national consciousness tilt up again, probably we will need to do that. But not for now.",3,766,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00766
2018-03-06-T-006,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"Thank you, Chairman. I have just got a question for the Minister. Water conservation affects all. The objective affects all. And the low pressure that is experienced by households affects only certain households on certain levels of a HDB block. So, for PUB to cite water conservation objective as a reason for not setting a minimum water pressure, to these affected households, it is a bit unfair because everyone else in the block is enjoying good water pressure. So, would the Minister be doing something about this or would be reviewing this?",1,767,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00767
2018-03-06-T-006,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The professional bodies, PUB as well as the industry came together after the Member raised this issue in 2015 to actually see whether they need to revise the CP48 to see whether we should actually put a minimum level. Water conservation issue is only one of them. There are many other issues ‒ how reticulation will be laid out, the kind of appliances that would be used, the sizes of the rooms, the number of people in the room ‒ fairly complicated. So, it is not just one factor. It is a number of factors. Therefore, the decision of this body of professionals, engineers, the industry, consultants, as well as PUB, finally decided that we should not put up a particular number. It is just not sound engineering-wise, and let the PE set it out, design it at the start, and make sure it is right.",1,768,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00768
2018-03-06-T-006,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As a former Town Council Chairman, I have addressed some of these issues in the households who complained about the water pressure, and it can be done. You have to work with PUB, work with plumbers. Sometimes it is a problem inside, sometimes it is a problem outside, sometimes it is the booster pump. There are many issues that we can try to address for the residents individually. It can be overcome.",2,769,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00769

2018-03-06-T-006,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, just two clarifications for the Senior Minister of State Amy Khor. I just wanted to ask the Senior Minister of State whether she thinks that the state of cleanliness in Singapore, is it better today compared to five years ago. Second clarification  why does NEA feel that issuing a CWO is a more serious offence as compared to imposing a fine? When you impose a fine on a litterbug, he pays the fine, five minutes later, he forgets about it, but he walks away complaining that the Government is trying to make money out of him. But if you impose a CWO on a litterbug, you take one hour away from him, make him pick up litter, he will realise better the effect of the litter that other litterbugs have thrown on the ground, and the lesson will stay with him for a much longer period of time and, hopefully, that will deter him from littering again.",1,771,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00771
2018-03-06-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for his questions. I am also pleased that he is extremely passionate about keeping Singapore clean. Asking me whether I think Singapore is cleaner now or not, I may not be the right person to ask. I might be biased. Actually, we have done some surveys. We had done a public cleanliness perception survey between late 2016 and early 2017 with 2,000 respondents. In the public cleanliness perception survey, it actually showed that 82% of the respondents said that they were satisfied with the overall cleanliness of Singapore ‒ hard as it may be for you. But it is a properly done survey, 2,000 respondents, 82%. But, of course, their satisfaction with different areas vary. So, they were most satisfied, for instance, with transport nodes, MRT stations, and so on. They ranked that ‒ they were most satisfied, in terms of cleanliness. Areas where they were not satisfied with, which I think we all have some idea of, would be like HDB void decks, F&B establishments, that is, the eating establishments, as well as places after public events. They scored about 59%. So, it varies. I think NEA does work on having more enforcement, for instance, at hot spot areas, and also getting volunteers to turn these hot spot areas into Bright Spots.",1,772,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00772
2018-03-06-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to the efficacy, for instance, of enforcement, as I have said, we couple enforcement as a deterrence with education, and I agree with the Member that we need to start young, from schools. And that is what the Public Hygiene Council and Singapore Kindness Movement have done. If you look at enforcement, for the 30,000-odd littering offenders caught in 2017 for instance, about 5% are repeat offenders. So, there is a deterrent effect. Of those who have done CWOs before, repeat offenders are about 10%. So, I think there is some deterrence. As regards why not CWO on everyone, I think we also need to realise that there may be people who, for medical reasons, cannot do CWOs, for instance. CWO is actually harsher because if it is a fine, they just pay. But CWO, they all have to take leave, they will have to go and do their CWO, and it may be in public places where they do not want to be seen.",2,773,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00773

Can I ask if MEWR will be studying the issue of the usage of single-used plastic bags further, especially with regard to implementing the usage plan? It has been proven effective in other countries. It has resulted in the reduction of the use of plastic bags, which is exactly what MEWR's role is. So, I want to stress that we should look into that further and to stress also that this is not a ban on the use of plastic bags.",1,779,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00779
2018-03-06-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Secondly, does MEWR have data on the number of plastic bags used in Singapore? If not, does MEWR intend to collect such data so that we can measure the effectiveness of the current retailers' schemes?",2,780,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00780
2018-03-06-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have said, the lifecycle assessment study did show that for plastic bags, it has got the highest greenhouse gas emissions and energy used. But on the other hand, other disposable bags, for instance, biodegradable bags which are so-called more eco-friendly also actually have some environmental impact in terms of production. Paper bags require lots of water to produce and, of course, there is this issue of land deforestation. We have to plant trees to produce paper pulp, and so on. Another example with the oxo-biodegradable bag which actually is made of plastic additives that will help to accelerate the degradation of the bag and that is supposed to be more eco-friendly. But actually, because we incinerate our waste, including plastic, these oxo-biodegradable bags will still have the same environmental impact as plastic bags. If we actually place a charge or ban, where we have a ban on bags, what will happen is there will be substitutes for using other bags. So, what we are saying is that because we incinerate waste, we do not have the same issue as many of these other countries who actually land fill directly. But we agree that we should curb or tackle the issue of excessive use of such plastic bags and other disposables. What we want to do is to tackle it at source. So, we will have mandatory reporting of packaging waste, as well as the waste reduction plans by businesses by 2021. In addition, we will work with the VWOs and other organisations to raise awareness and encourage people to reduce their use of such disposables. In our new hawker centres, for instance, we have already disallowed use of disposable crockeries, and so on, for dine-in.",1,781,2018-03-06-T-006-S-00781

Most new flats will be built in new estates and to further encourage the elderly to move near their children, one of the best ways is to allow them to live together under the same roof.

Hence, for families who had to sell their homes due to financial setbacks, this can be especially difficult and emotional at times.

Without a permanent shelter in which one can call their home, it is inevitable for individuals or families to feel much anxiety and stress. Indirectly, this has broader implications on the society and can result in weaker social cohesion. Over the years, MND had been introducing different options to cater for home ownership of Singaporeans at different stages in their lives. This effort is encouraging and must continue to ensure everyone has a place to call their own.

Divorce is unsettling for those who have to undergo the unfortunate situation. It is not for us to judge the basis that triggered it. But for many who have children to care for, it is pertinent that they can provide a roof over the head of their young ones, especially if they are still schooling. For this, I am asking if interim housing over a short period of months can be provided to those who do not benefit from the sale of their matrimonial home, or if one party has been forced to leave the matrimonial home on short notice. It is increasingly difficult with small family units to assume that the divorcee can rely on their parents, siblings or relatives to help provide accommodation for them and their children.

Without a Lasting Power of Attorney or living will, they cannot downsize nor go for regular housing options to better finance their remaining years. HDB has advised for them to rent their flat out. But for those with a mentally incapacitated spouse, indeed, it is difficult to have another stranger or another family living in the same flat, be it for safety or emotional reasons. So, how can seniors like them be better prepared for the situation, given the likely increase in dementia amongst our seniors?

Some seniors living in such properties are not well off. They might have inherited the property while others bought it when they were much younger. With a declining lease of the property, it poses a challenge for some to dispose of the property in the market.

In the earlier years, this is common for some family units to have only a single name listed as the sole owner of the HDB flat. Usually, the flat occupier happens to be the wife, who typically is the home maker. Having lived in Singapore and raised their children here, some, to date, still remain as a foreigner due to different reasons. As they aged, it becomes even more difficult for them to convert to a PR or Singapore Citizen. The luckier ones may have children who have moved out to start their own family and are still able to support them. Others may not have any children or dependants. In the cases when the owner spouse passes on, the plight of the living spouse will be quite tough. Finding a place to live in will become a tall order for many, especially if the women have little or no savings, having not worked throughout their life.

The fact that the single's premium remains at $15,000, even with a shorter lease being chosen, is another loophole that we can address for more affordable housing for our single seniors.",5,879,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00879
2018-03-06-T-007,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"To reduce the heavy burden of the single's premium on our elderly poor singles, we should consider an additional scheme reducing the premium for any individual aged 55 and above purchasing a 2-room flexi flat for the first time on a shorter lease. The premium reduction of upwards to $5,000 based on their income level and length of lease upholds the rationale the single's premium but reduces its impact for elderly poor single who can then use their savings for their retirement.",6,880,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00880

2018-03-06-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Chairman, many residents look forward to the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) as it address long-time gripes such as pipe leaks, ceiling leaks and spalling concrete, the last of which occurs due to corrosion of steel reinforcement bars over time. While this is a natural wear and tear process, many elderly residents in particular are unable to mitigate the problem with regular painting for financial reasons and a relative lack of mobility for some.",1,882,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00882
2018-03-06-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the course of house visits to homes where HIP works have already been undertaken, it is not surprising for residents to identify a re-occurrence of spalling concrete or a new occurrence in another area of the flat within a few years after HIP works are concluded. Although residents can request for the Goodwill Repair Assistance scheme, the cost for such repairs can come up to a few hundred dollars in some cases.",2,883,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00883
2018-03-06-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Would the HDB bear a greater part of the repair cost in view of the fact that the spalling concrete is fundamentally caused by the deterioration of the concrete floor slab in question? This view can be correlated with the point that spalling concrete repair is deemed to be an essential improvement under the HIP. Would the Ministry look to reduce the resident’s component from spalling concrete repairs particularly for flats that have already completed their HIP?,3,884,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00884
2018-03-06-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, as the HDB winds down its HIP programme, what are its plans going forward for next few years? Does it plan to call for a new HIP programme for flats built after 1986? In addition, can the Ministry share whether it is exploring how it can collaborate from a whole-of-Government perspective with agencies like the Smart Nation Office, the PUB and even MTI’s initiatives under the Built Environment ITM to incorporate future technologies with its future upgrading programmes? Is there a possibility of pneumatic waste disposal conveyance systems to be part of future upgrading programmes at older HDB estates?",4,885,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00885
2018-03-06-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To my second cut, Chairman, public rental housing remains an important feature of our public housing system. The HDB recently announced that from May this year, the maximum number of tenants allowed in 4-room and larger Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats will be reduced to six, from the current nine. One of the reasons for this is to prevent overcrowding in HDB estates.",5,886,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00886
2018-03-06-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"There are times when rental flat applicants share that crowded conditions at home make family living difficult, complicating already existing problems that are amplified in a low-income setting. Part of the public rental flat assessment process includes an HDB enquiry into whether an applicant has other means of family support. Very often, for rejected cases, the HDB seeks the cooperation of the Family Service Centre to address disputes between family members. However, not all cases can be resolved, with some issues particularly intractable.",6,887,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00887
2018-03-06-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Would the HDB in line with a tacit acknowledgement that overcrowding can affect the living environment consider the number of individuals residing in a current place of residence for rental flat applicants as a factor for consideration at the point of application?,7,888,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00888
2018-03-06-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Secondly, can the HDB clarify if it intends to raise the income ceiling criteria of HDB rental flat applications in line with rises in real income as revealed by the Budget so that applicants who are in dire straits are not dissuaded from applying for such rental flats if their situation calls for it. Can the Ministry share how many rental flat applications it has approved for applicants whose gross income has exceeded $1,500.",8,889,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00889

2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Thank you, Mr Chairman. Sir, many residents living in older estates welcome the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) for good reasons. The spalling concrete and water seepage problems I have seen in some of the older flats in Hougang are serious.",1,892,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00892
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"In the past, HIP would replace the main waste and soil discharge pipes in the toilets for all units as water seepage usually starts from the joint failure between floors. However, the last two HIPs I came across in Hougang would not touch these pipes unless they leaked. A number of residents I spoke to would like to change the pipes in the toilets and for good reason ─ their flats are more than 35 years old and the pipes, though not leaking, are due for a change.",2,893,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00893
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),I hope HDB can allow residents an option to replace those pipes as part of the essential improvement work.,3,894,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00894
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Next, many residents also wanted to do more for their ageing flats since HIP is going to disrupt their living environment for the next 10 days. The type of additional work some of these residents asked for common home improvement work, things like changing the windows, changing water piping for the entire flat or upgrading the ELCB, to name a few.",4,895,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00895
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I am not asking the Government to subsidise this work but to provide an option to residents under the framework of HIP to change these common items in their flats at the same time. The cost of such improvement work can benefit from economies of scale sourcing if they are included in the HIP tender. While residents can make arrangements on the side with sub-contractors, some sub-contractors may not want to do such improvement works for the fear of breaking any contractual terms under HIP.",5,896,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00896
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Finally, I have spoken about this before. I hope HDB would seriously look into re-designing the clothes drying rack offered by HIP. The current impedes repair and repainting work using gondolas and is an eyesore to see so many metal structures sticking out of a single HDB block. Would HDB be open to tap on Polytechnic and University to re-design the clothes drying rack for a change?",6,897,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00897
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The second cut. Sir, the HDB void deck despite its namesake is anything but void in the memories of many Singaporeans. Unfortunately, these open spaces we knew and grew up with are shrinking in many new estates. In its place are rooftop gardens and multi-purpose halls (MPH) about the size of two 5-room HDB flats. Some of the MPH unfortunately were not designed with much thought and consideration for the very activities they were meant to cater for.",7,898,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00898
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"At a recent briefing conducted by URA, I shared with the team some of the observations and actual feedback from the ground on the MPH in Hougang Meadow, a relatively new estate with studio apartments. Let me share a few anomalies about the design of the MPH.",8,899,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00899
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"First, the MPH in Hougang Meadow is built on top of a car park. To do an event at the MPH, the only way to load and unload equipment and stuff for the event is via a narrow passage way connecting the sheltered compound to the multi-storey car park beside. Next, because of the proximity of the MPH to the nearby blocks, residents living on the lower floor can see the casket clearly from their windows whenever a funeral is held there. In one wake that I attended, the bereaved family shared that there is no place around the MPH for the contractor to place portable toilets. For a start there are no manhole discharge points. Even using chemical portable toilets is an issue as these toilets need to be clean every day, and there is no way for the service crew to do in a hygienic manner on the roof top garden beside the exercise area and children's playground. The only place to locate the portable toilets would be under the block where the bereaved family lives. It is highly unusual for a wake at an HDB estate not to have sanitary convenience located on-site for bereaved family and friends who have to guard the wake throughout the night.",9,900,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00900
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The design of the MPH also makes the sending off procession on the last day of the funeral very challenging. The passage on the MPH at Hougang Meadow to the waiting hearse can barely accommodate the pall bearers and mourners. They would also have to navigate the narrow passage way, pass the lift lobby at the entrance to the multi-storey car park and then make U-turn down a deep ramp to a connecting car park and then to the waiting hearse at Level 1. The alternative route to take would be a longer walk along the same narrow walkway cutting through other void decks and surrounding blocks and to a busy stretch of Upper Serangoon Road. The same design issues are also present at Hougang Dew Court, another new estate with studio apartments. But the saving grace is that the MPH is located on the ground floor.",10,901,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00901
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I have shared the above concern with URA in the hope that future MPH design for new estates would take into consideration the various requirements of the activities these sheltered pavilions are meant to cater for. As for the existing MPH, I hope HDB can look into correcting the design soonest as the void decks in these estates are too small and not suitable to hold any events like a funeral.",11,902,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00902
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"My third cut. Sir, the issue concerning heavy vehicle parking was brought up a few times in Parliament. We have a strange situation in Singapore in that we have more lots than there are heavy vehicles. But yet drivers are still facing inadequate parking lots in or near their estates.

In the interim what can the Ministry do to help alleviate the issues faced by heavy vehicle drivers on the ground?",13,904,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00904
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"In the development plan for Defu Industrial Estate, is there plan to build a multi-storey heavy vehicle car park as some resident drivers I spoke to continue to face parking problems in the heavy vehicles parked along Tampines Road and Hougang Ave 7. A driver told me he has to wait a long time for a vacant lot. Each time when he works late, the chances of finding a lot would diminish greatly. He said he had to resort to illegal parking at times although he did so without causing obstruction or danger to other road users.",14,905,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00905
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),Can the Ministry put up some temporary heavy vehicle parks in Defu Industrial Estate in the interim? There are spots of vacant land there and these temporary heavy vehicle parks require minimal construction works and enforcement as all heavy vehicles have valid parking permits.,15,906,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00906
2018-03-06-T-007,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),I hope the Ministry will continue to take a light touch approach in its enforcement of parking rules and regulations when these drivers have to resort to desperate measures to park their heavy vehicles so that they can go home early to get enough rest to drive the next day.,16,907,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00907

2018-03-06-T-007,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Chairman, public housing is not just something that is a part of our national landscape. It is a part of our national psyche. With more than 80% of Singaporeans living in public housing and the fact that almost every Singaporean would have been to a public housing estate at some point in time. Many visitors to our country are always amazed when I point out some of the more modern HDB blocks to them, saying that they look like private apartments. Indeed, such is the quality of design today that there are times when I myself cannot tell the difference between public housing and private condominiums when the two are side by side until I come much closer.",1,939,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00939
2018-03-06-T-007,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"As much as the Government has continued to build modern, stylish and affordable new generation flats, it has also rolled out a variety of schemes and measures to enhance and improve the older flats at mature estates as well. I would like if the MND can share what plans it has to continue to improve public housing, especially for older flats and in the mature estates in the future.",2,940,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00940
2018-03-06-T-007,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Next cut, please. Singapore imports more than 90% of the food we eat. Although our limited farming lands and fishing grounds have made it impossible for us to be self-sufficient in food supply, we should nonetheless support our local farmers to adopt new farming technology to enhance our food supply resiliency.",3,941,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00941

2018-03-06-T-007,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I understand that AVA has in recent months tendered out several plots of land to vegetable farmers to experiment with new farm and farming technologies.

2018-03-06-T-007,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The third cut, Mr Chairman. From glow-in-the-dark trees, a solution that makes use of bio mimicry technology and saves on street lighting; to the foot traffic electricity in London’s Heathrow airport; to parklets that have sprung up in urban areas to make city life more vibrant – much is being done all around the world for urban sustainability.",6,944,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00944
2018-03-06-T-007,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Parklets, for example, are very effective in increasing both green space and communal spaces in a city. Essentially, parklets convert curb-side parking spaces into small scale public parks where people can sit and relax. People get the chance to meet friends for a chat while enjoying the city, thereby increasing community engagement. Also, parklets replace parking spaces, reducing accessibility for cars and discouraging driving in the city, as part of a wider car-lite initiative.",7,945,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00945

These works involve breakaways from another house.",1,948,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00948
2018-03-06-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I have observed a few cases in my ward where such breakaway works have caused significant difficulties and anguish to neighbours, that is, the houses that are exposed after the detachment. One problem would be water seepage, as a party wall that formerly separated two adjoining houses would now become an exposed blank wall. Another concern that has arisen is whether works done by one party have affected the structural integrity of the neighbour’s remaining party wall.",2,949,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00949

Last year, we encouraged our residents to take part in the public consultation held by URA and NParks. Media reports have highlighted some of the feedback.

For example, America’s Atlanta Beltline is one of its largest, wide-ranging urban redevelopment programmes. The 22-mile loop is based on the former railroad corridors encircling the city of Atlanta. It aims to ultimately connect 45 neighbourhoods and is now transforming the present landscape with multi-use trails and parks, modern streetcars or light rail transportation and affordable housing. The Beltline has also in its pipeline plans to conserve history, create jobs and contribute to public health.",3,955,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00955

So, I would like to ask is MND reviewing Government land sales in this area to capture or enhance the vitality of this development. I ask this because new residences or the introduction of commercial or community activities may release economic prospects that will energise the project’s offering. In addition, the historical significance and lush nature of the Rail Corridor makes it an inviting spot for tourists to appreciate a lesser-known side of Singapore.",4,956,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00956
2018-03-06-T-007,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretaries to the Ministers for Education and Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"For all this to happen, and key to the Corridor’s success is accessibility and also good transport infrastructure. Sir, I would like to ask how will the needs of transportation to the Rail Corridor be met. What are MND’s plans with the LTA? Can this high-profile development be better served with an MRT nearer than current ones?",5,957,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00957

For instance, I just went to Summerhill Condominium last weekend. The backyard of the Summerhill Condominium lies next to the fringe of the Rail Corridor. So, the residents from 20 over condominiums lying along Hillview Avenue hope that MND will allow a route to be constructed so that they can have a direct access to Railway Corridor instead of having to do a big detour. They are looking forward to the upcoming Coast-to-Coast Trail and also the new Nature Park Network announced by MND and NParks recently. Other attractions that will be at the doorstep of the western part of Singapore and also Bukit Gombak residents are – a heritage gallery at the old Bukit Timah Railway Station and F&B outlets at the former station master’s quarters.",6,958,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00958

The large number of MCSTs would involve a large amount of resources and significant supply chains. The administration of such a large volume of resources by the MCSTs can have an impact on the output and productivity of industries involved. Some attention should be paid to encouraging the MCSTs to streamline their operations, adopt digital technology where possible, and improve outcomes in general. Hence, I have the following specific questions.",2,963,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00963

2018-03-06-T-007,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Last year, the Tampines Town Council reduced the corridor washing frequency from monthly to once every two months. Besides saving water, this frees up the cleaners to undertake more essential conservancy duties. In fact, as corridors are mostly just used by residents themselves, they are unlikely to be very dirty if residents play their part by keeping their own surroundings clean. So, I am appreciative of Tampines residents accepting this new arrangement and doing their part. Besides public cooperation, we need to think about how we can better organise the work that needs to be done.",4,979,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00979

Unfortunately, the first finger that they point will always be at the Town Council. I am not saying that the other agencies are not doing their work. The fact is that various agencies are structured differently and we can do better by working together.

The daily removal of litter, which is done by DPC, could be outsourced to the Town Council, which already takes care of most parts of the HDB estate. Maintenance and repair of defects could still be handled by the respective agencies which own the land. Obviously, there will be operational details like contracting, budget and public liability that need to be looked into, but I believe these could be sorted out among the different agencies.",7,982,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00982

2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We want to do more to help young couples like them with their first home. This is why we launched BTO flats with a shortened waiting time, not by compressing the construction, but by bringing it forward. So, we build ahead and, therefore, the waiting time for the couples is shorter.",8,998,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00998

I am happy to announce that we will double the number of such flats in 2019 ‒ another 2,000 flats. The waiting time for these flats is around two to three years, as opposed to the normal waiting time of about three to four years.",9,999,2018-03-06-T-007-S-00999
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested to further reduce the waiting time.

2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"It is physically not possible for HDB to produce instant flats to meet all of the demand. So, one way for those with more urgent needs is to buy from the resale market. And that is why we have taken steps to enhance the grants for resale flats. We enhanced the CPF Housing Grant for resale flats last year. We introduced the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) in 2015 to help families live closer together and, this year, we enhanced the PHG.",11,1001,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01001

Stefanie has just graduated; Gerald is still studying because he had to do his NS, so he is still studying. They are a young couple who have decided to settle down and would like to get married. In fact, they had been planning to buy a BTO flat since last year, but because Stefanie only started working in August last year, she did not have sufficient period of employment to apply for grants.",15,1005,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01005
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Young couples like them may find themselves delaying their flat application for one or two years, and then waiting another four years for the flat to be ready. I think that is a bit too long a wait.",16,1006,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01006
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Buying a flat is a serious commitment. But for young couples who have considered it carefully, I think we can exercise some flexibility to support them in their marriage and parenthood journey. So, we will now allow such couples to apply for the flat first, and defer the assessment of income for housing loans and grants till just before key collection. For example, if a young couple wants to settle down early, and are confident they can finance the purchase of the flat, they can apply for the flat first. They only need to pay half of the downpayment; this is already possible today. We allow them to pay half the downpayment. The remaining half is paid at key collection.",17,1007,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01007
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The flat will typically take up to four years to build, so during that period, the couple can have time to build up their finances, and just before key collection, we will assess their income for purposes of determining the loan quantum and housing grants that they are eligible for.",18,1008,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01008
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This deferred assessment of income will apply to eligible couples from the May 2018 Build-To-Order (BTO)/Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise. We are also studying how we can further streamline processes to make buying a HDB flat much quicker and easier. I think the comments that Er Dr Lee Bee Wah made. And in fact, we have already made several moves on this front. HDB has revamped the Resale Portal. All the eligibility checks are now done on one single platform. We cut down the appointment from two to one and as a result, the application time is reduced from 16 weeks to eight weeks.",19,1009,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01009
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We have also made changes to our sales process and we started with the Re-Offer of Balance Flats (ROF) last year. Under ROF, all the unselected balance flats are pooled together in one common pool. They are not sorted out by flat types or by towns. So, applicants are put on a single queue and based on their queue number, they can choose any ROF unit that is available.",20,1010,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01010
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"By doing so, we have been able to shortened the flat selection process. A typical SBF exercise, as Er Dr Lee mentioned, takes about eight months. It sounds very long, I can understand, but please understand that in a typical SBF exercise, there could be more than 100 different flat type, and estate combinations. So, you have more than 100 different queues to manage. But with the ROF, we have one single queue because all of the balance flats are pooled together.",21,1011,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01011
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, because of that, we were able to shorten the flats selection process from eight months to six months. Our inaugural ROF exercise in August last year was a success, with more than 90% of the flats on offer being taken up. And just six months after the launch, about 400 families have already collected the keys to their new homes. So, we will continue to learn from this experience to see how we can improve.",22,1012,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01012
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Another area that we are looking at is the balloting process for BTO flats. This used to be much simpler and faster in the past. The applicants would attend a balloting ceremony. There were two bowls in front. The Member of Parliament would draw out two pieces of paper – one with the applicant's sales registration number, the other with a house number, and they match and this is it. After they get this, sometimes behind the scenes, they swap. Because if you did not like it, you can go and swap, but that happened without our knowledge. This was a simple process that used to happen in the past. This was Mr Phua Bah Lee doing the balloting in the past. And that was how we used to do it. It was simple, it was possible, because the number of flats and applicants were much smaller.",23,1013,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01013

As a result, it takes about six weeks to work through the entire balloting process. HDB has to check applicants' eligibility, sort out the requirements of the various schemes and quotas, and ultimately ensure that the ballot is fair.",24,1014,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01014
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Still I think, the time taken can be reduced. So, I have challenged the HDB team to see if they can halve the balloting time to three weeks. HDB has taken on this challenge and they are working through the processes and I hope they will be able to announce some good news before too long.",25,1015,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01015
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We are also very mindful that children and parents would like to live near each other to provide mutual care and support – that is something that we want to encourage. HDB offers various priority schemes, for example, the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS), Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS) and Senior Priority Scheme (SPS). These all help give priority to families who live closer together. Mr Gan Thiam Poh also suggested building larger flats so that families with more children can stay together.",26,1016,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01016

2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There is also the PHG which I mentioned earlier to help families to stay together and live near one another. Besides enhancing the grant quantum this year, we have also simplified the proximity condition to a distance-based one, within 4 km. This will apply to both the PHG for resale flats as well as the proximity-based schemes for new flats like the MCPS and SPS, which I have mentioned earlier, from the May 2018 sales exercise. This will give home-buyers more choices of flats in neighbouring towns.",28,1018,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01018

2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"While we help couples and families to settle down, we are also mindful that there is a diverse range of home-buyers. There are second-timers, elderly looking to right-size, singles, divorcees, and single unmarried, unwed parents.

For those with difficulties, we are prepared to look at them and consider incorporating the levy into the purchase price. Many of them who are second-timers are also looking to get the flat urgently. And in fact, for them, the better option is really to consider the resale market. The PHG can help in this respect because that grant is available to second-timers too. So, even if you are a second-timer, you buy from the market, first of all there is no resale levy to pay; secondly they may get to purchase the resale flat with PHG. For those in rental, we have put in place a new Fresh Start scheme to support them in their home ownership journey.",31,1021,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01021
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For the elderly, I touched on this in last year's COS, we have many schemes to help them. We have built 2-room Flexi flats for them. Again, they are priced with a significant subsidy to make sure that they are affordable. For first-timers, they too are eligible for grants, which will make the 2-room Flexi flat very affordable for them. For second-timers, there is a levy to be paid, but we have capped the levy amount and adjusted it for the shorter lease. So, the maximum levy that would be paid on a 2-room Flexi on a 45-year lease is $18,000. Much lower than what a normal resale levy would be.",32,1022,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01022
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We have also made other enhancements last year, including deferring the downpayment until key collection for the elderly, when they right-size. Providing a temporary loan, one-to-one counselling and an elderly priority queue at the HDB Hub. All these measures have helped, and we will continue to see what more we can do to support our elderly.",33,1023,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01023
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For the singles, that is another group that many Members talked about – Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Alex Yam. So far, more than 12,000 singles have bought new 2-room flats. The application rates are still high, I recognise that and we are doing our best to build more 2-room flats to clear the backlog.",34,1024,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01024
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Singles can also consider resale flats. Over the last five years, 27,000 have bought resale flats; more than the ones who have bought new flats. And again, the enhancements to PHG will make this a more attractive option. Because with the changes to the PHG, as Members here have recognised, we are giving a higher grant of $15,000 for singles who buy a resale flat to live with their parents and now they are eligible also for a $10,000 grant to buy a resale flat near their parents.",35,1025,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01025

He mentioned that Singaporeans are marrying later, but the marriage rates are still high among singles under the age of 35, so I think the age of 35 is still valid today. In any case, as I have mentioned earlier, we still have a backlog to clear, and I think we should focus on that and make sure that for those who are on the queue, we will build enough 2-room flats to help them get the 2-room flats first.",37,1027,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01027

This is a rule put in place in 1997, whereby during the time bar, a divorced couple can only own one subsidised flat between them. So both sides have to agree on who should be allowed to buy the subsidised flat. This is what we call the ""mutual consent"" agreement or requirement. The time bar was set at five years initially, and we have reduced it to three years. Since 2012, we have waived the mutual consent requirement for the parent with sole care and control of young children to buy a subsidised flat, in order to prioritise their housing needs. This has helped the majority of divorced couples with children, but there are others still subject to the time bar.",42,1032,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01032

We typically select about 14 NRP projects a year and I am happy to announce that this year, we will increase the number and launch 20 NRP projects across the island. It is part of our efforts to provide support for the construction industry. So, we are bringing forward projects particularly to help the industry during this period.",66,1056,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01056

2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Several Members have asked about expanding the scope of HIP, and extending it to flats built after the existing cohort. As I have shared in this House previously, any upgrading programme is a major commitment that spans many years, and would cost billions of dollars. We had just had a major debate on the Budget about fiscal sustainability and how government spending is rising sharply, and how we need to raise revenues to meet these future needs. Any future upgrading programme has to be studied very carefully in this context. So, we are studying this very carefully. Eventually, when the proposals are put forward, I hope Members will support more resources for MND to do upgrading in existing estates as well.",68,1058,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01058

2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Importantly, it is also about how you design the block to maximise opportunities for social interaction. Some of these things, I would acknowledge, happen more through serendipity than deliberate design. I give an example of how in the past, we did not have lifts on every floor. So, the lift landing somehow became a place where neighbours get to meet one another. I say this from personal experience because my HDB apartment was on the 21st floor on a lift landing, just next to the lift. So, the neighbours come and we get to meet them all the time, and you can have a chance to talk to them.",74,1064,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01064
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Today, lift landings are on every floor, so you do not have as many opportunities for interaction. It is meant for barrier-free access, I think it is a good thing, but you do not have that many opportunities to meet. So, we have to use other design methods to encourage neighbourly interaction. That is why in some of the new BTO flats, for example in Dawson, HDB has tried out more seating areas in the common spaces near lift lobbies. We are trying out more greenery and rooftop spaces for residents to get together. These are different designs that are being piloted, that we are trying out. Again, it is something that we have to learn by doing, and from that experiences and feedback that we get, we can improve for each new project that we embark on.",75,1065,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01065

Recently, we launched a pilot in Sembawang called Build-a-Playground. We build new playgrounds all the time. All of us see this in our estates but this one was different. We spent time engaging the residents. They worked together on the project from conceptualisation to design, to even the final assembly of the playground on site. It took longer than usual – about two years to build this playground. This is much longer than the normal time it would take to build a playground. But the end result was worth it – residents shared that they love the project, they take pride in it. Because they take ownership of the playground, they were involved in it, they appreciate and enjoy it much more.",87,1077,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01077

It seemed like a simple request but there were complications. The area was earmarked for future public housing development and hence the staircase had to be planned with future developments in mind. NParks dealt with the presence of high tension cables underground by using light weight precast slabs to minimise deep excavation works. A ramp was also thoughtfully added at the side of the staircase for cyclists to access the Park Connector.

As Mr Ong had rightly pointed out, MSO focuses heavily on improving inter-agency processes which are not apparent to the public. Pigeon-related nuisance is one such example. TCs oversee the cleaning of common areas, AVA takes enforcement action against pigeon feeders, while NEA takes enforcement action in instances where high-rise littering is involved. Residents’ Committee of PA are often roped in to counsel the feeders. These agencies work together in order for pigeon-related issues to be resolved holistically. To support their efforts, MSO has helped to formulate end-to-end workflows to clarify roles and responsibilities, and tighten coordination in their handling of such pigeon-related nuisance.",6,1089,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01089

For example, the “Facilities in HDB Estates” and “Shared Bicycles” categories introduced last year allow members of public to report municipal issues in HDB estates to the TCs, and indiscriminately parked “Shared Bicycles” to bike operators. This makes it more convenient for residents to report on issues they encounter, and also enable government agencies and TCs to collect data more systematically to guide future planning and operations through studying trends and analysing hotspots.

2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As Mr Saktiandi has described, BIM helps firms visualise detailed building designs in virtual 3D form before they are actually built, thus minimising potential issues during construction. IDD builds on top of BIM to connect various project parties through digital information. It also provides useful information about the building, for future maintenance or retrofitting.",6,1111,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01111
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Since 2015, building plans for developments larger than 5,000 sq metres have to be submitted to BCA and other regulatory agencies using BIM. Eighty-six percent of our large consultants and 65% of our large contractors now make good use of BIM. We will also drive IDD adoption so that our built environment sector can reap further benefits from the entire construction and building life-cycle. To facilitate this, we will develop shared platforms and standards to increase IDD interoperability across the entire environment value chain. By 2020, we target to have between 40 and 60 projects adopting IDD, compared to five projects today.",7,1112,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01112
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Sir, adoption of these technologies is not just for big companies. Many smaller firms are also building up their capabilities in DfMA and IDD. And one such example is a local firm called Tong Hai Yang, which is a home-grown construction and interior firm. The firm set up a sub-division to explore DfMA and this led it to develop its modular Prefabricated Bathroom Units (PBUs), as well as customised solutions to improve the fabrication and on-site deployment of its product.",8,1113,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01113
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Another example is Shin Construction, a local SME specialising in plumbing. As a plumbing sub-contractor for residential developments, Shin’s adoption of BIM helped eliminate potential clashes between mechanical, electrical and plumbing pipes and air-conditioning ducts. This helped the project team avoid abortive works and delays during the construction phase.",9,1114,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01114
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah noted, local contractors also need to build up their capabilities and track record to succeed both locally and abroad. In this regard, Er Dr Lee said that stringent pre-qualifications in Government projects could prevent local firms qualifying and hence building up relevant experience.",10,1115,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01115
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We should clarify that pre-qualifications are not intended to limit opportunities, but to ensure that tenderers have the ability to tackle important and complex public works, such as MRT or deep tunnelling projects. While it is up to agencies to set their own requirements, they certainly have to be fair, and not be unduly onerous. They should also ensure that their tenders obtain an adequate number of bids, to ensure fair competition.",11,1116,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01116
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Our approach to help firms is to give them the resources they need to build up their capabilities, so they become more competitive. For example, contractors can tap on various schemes under BCA’s Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF), to build up their capabilities and to upgrade their workforce. About $530 million in funds have already been committed under the CPCF, benefiting over 9,000 firms, 90% of which are our SMEs. In tandem, we also reviewed our procurement framework to place more emphasis on quality and this will facilitate healthier and more sustainable competition. With improved capabilities, local contractors will better their chances of qualifying for more construction projects.",12,1117,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01117
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In addition, we will also try to help our local firms internationalise, if they wish to do so, by finding opportunities for them to team up for large overseas ventures. If our firms can offer together a unique “Singaporean” way of undertaking the entire development cycle, such as through BIM and IDD, this will certainly enhance their competitive edge. One example of an opportunity is in Amaravati, it is the new capital city of the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. A Singaporean consortium comprising Ascendas-Singbridge and Sembcorp has secured a start-up area to kick-start the new city’s development. Singapore companies with the relevant expertise should consider whether they can export their services there as part of the consortium.",13,1118,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01118
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Sir, we also launched the Real Estate ITM last month, focusing on two areas  one, property transactions; and two, facilities management (FM).",14,1119,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01119

2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For facilities management (FM), our goal is to transform the way we maintain our infrastructure so that we can be more efficient and effective. Assoc Prof Randolph Tan is quite right when he said that we need to make good use of technology and better streamline our building management operations. This is especially important as our buildings and infrastructure age, and as we continue to face manpower constraints.",16,1121,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01121
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will therefore encourage building owners and MCSTs to invest in better and more effective FM solutions, such as real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This will streamline their processes, enhance user experience, and reap long-term cost savings. This, of course, will depend also on demand that the buyers of these services such as condos, industrial properties and commercial buildings recognising the value and the savings that can be reaped through having smart FM capabilities.",17,1122,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01122
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will also encourage consultants and developers to systematically consider maintainability outcomes in the design and construction phase. This will enhance the sustainability of our buildings, by reducing life-cycle maintenance costs arising from inefficient design. To operationalise this, BCA will be bringing industry, unions and the Government together in a Tripartite Facilities Management Implementation Committee (FMIC) to formulate, oversee and review the implementation of the plans for this sector.",18,1123,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01123

And employers need to provide their employees with opportunities to do so.",23,1128,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01128
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Sir, I met Mr Muhammad Shaban at the launch of JTC’s J-Ops Command Centre last month. After graduating from ITE, Shaban joined JTC in 1995 as a lift technician carrying out lift maintenance work. With JTC’s encouragement, he expanded into more complex areas, such as Building Management Systems. Eventually, his expertise enabled him to start taking on greater responsibilities, including supervising less experienced technical staff. He is now a key member of JTC’s Building Management Division, overseeing day-to-day operations in the J-Ops Command Centre, which is a centralised command nerve centre that monitors building operations and performance across JTC’s buildings. There, he works with building managers and engineers in building diagnosis and fault detection. We have invited Shaban to contribute to the improvement of the facilities management sector at the national level through the Tripartite FM Implementation Committee or FMIC. And I am glad that he has agreed to take up this challenge.",24,1129,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01129

2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Mr Chong Kee Hiong has asked how we ensure that buildings are designed and constructed to be structurally safe; enforce regular maintenance and checks; and grow a sustainable pool of local skilled technical staff to support this.,29,1134,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01134
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are already measures to ensure building safety. For example, developers must appoint a Qualified Person (QP), who is a registered Professional Engineer (PE), to carry out structural design. And for more complex works, the design must be checked by independent Accredited Checkers. A QP and site supervisors must supervise building works to ensure that they are done in accordance with the approved plans. Building materials must also comply with prescribed standards and be tested by accredited laboratories. BCA will conduct site audits to ensure compliance with requirements.",30,1135,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01135
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,BCA also requires regular inspections to ensure buildings remain structurally safe.,31,1136,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01136
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As Mr Chong pointed out, it is also important to ensure that non-structural aspects like building facades are well maintained, especially as the city grows older.",32,1137,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01137
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have studied this, and will be introducing façade inspection requirements. The regime will focus on buildings taller than 13 metres and older than 20 years, as they may pose higher risks. Inspection must be carried out by trained personnel and be conducted once every seven years.",33,1138,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01138
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Now, this takes into consideration the expected lifespan of some common façade materials, allows for detection of façade deterioration to facilitate timely repairs and aligns this with the typical length of Repair and Redecoration (R&R) cycles for HDB estates and the majority of condominium developments, to save costs. We aim to finalise the relevant legislation by end of this year. Building owners will be given about one year’s lead time to prepare, before the requirement comes into effect. BCA will continue to engage stakeholders on implementation details, to minimise the burden of cost.",34,1139,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01139
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will also support the new façade inspection regime, by introducing inspection guidelines; and strengthening R&D efforts to look into more effective and productive ways to carry out façade inspections. This could include the use of camera-equipped drones to check building façade conditions, which I understand has been used overseas, by companies like Industrial Skyworks in Canada and Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates in the US.",35,1140,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01140
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,I also agree with Mr Chong that proper lift maintenance is important and that is why we earlier tightened BCA’s maintenance regime for lifts to ensure their safety and functionality.,36,1141,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01141
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For HDB lifts in particular, we have also put in place additional procurement and maintenance processes to improve lift safety and performance. We are continuing to improve these processes, and are now studying how to better evaluate downstream maintenance costs in the procurement stage, so that HDB can better differentiate between lift suppliers. For example, we are studying the evaluation of tender pricing over a longer time period via longer lock-in maintenance period for lift suppliers, as well as placing higher weightage on quality score as compared to price score in tenders.",37,1142,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01142
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The other part of the equation is to build a sufficient pool of competent personnel to conduct the required checks and servicing.,38,1143,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01143

And I understand that the STC will provide its full recommendations later this year. But one recommendation being seriously considered is a voluntary progressive wage model (PWM) for local lift technicians. The PWM will be competency-based. Each wage level will be defined by specific skillsets and responsibilities. This sets out clear progression pathways for lift technicians, and ensures they are remunerated appropriately for their skills and effort. We hope that companies will come on board, and work together to build up a sustainable pipeline of skilled local lift technicians.",39,1144,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01144

2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked if designs could be improved to mitigate noise pollution from vehicles in multi-storey carparks. Sir, noise mitigation is a consideration when HDB designs and plans HDB estates. Specific to carparks, HDB considers the orientation and distance between them and residential blocks, and the placement of physical barriers such as communal facilities as well as greenery to screen the noise. We will continue to incorporate good planning considerations and make use of technology where appropriate, such as noise modelling, to mitigate noise impact.",51,1156,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01156

So he brought in Mr Desmond Khoo, a technologically savvy 25-year-old entrepreneur with strong marketing skills. Mr Khoo also owned a few vegetable stalls in wet markets, as well as a fresh food import business. Through this complementary partnership, the farm began exploring innovative ways and technologies to increase their productivity. I am happy to note that Eden PurelyFresh farm won a plot of land in the last tender exercise with a proposal to grow vegetables using greenhouses with innovative monitoring systems. This shows that with the right partners and mind-set, farmers can indeed take their businesses to the next level. In fact, this on-going series of tenders will provide existing farmers with a clean slate of sorts to bring in new technology and transform the way they operate, without the encumbrances of previously existing operations.",4,1169,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01169
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"There are also opportunities for farming in unconventional spaces. Rooftops are interesting possibilities in our highly urbanised environment. In 2014, we piloted Singapore's first rooftop farm – Comcrop – at SCAPE mall in Orchard road. We saw its potential to scale up and facilitated conversations between Comcrop and JTC for a 35,000 square feet rooftop space on one of JTC's food factories in Woodlands. With space the size of seven basketball courts, Comcrop has now finalised plans to develop eight high-tech greenhouses with environmental controls. We will continue to push for such innovative projects to optimise our land-use and to grow our urban farming movement.",5,1170,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01170
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"But farm transformation can only succeed if the industry takes the lead to embrace innovation as well. So, in this regard, I am glad that a few members of AVA's Industry Consultation Panel came together last October to form the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation, or SAFEF for short. SAFEF aims to represent, advance, and promote the agro-food sector in Singapore for economic development and for export. As a ground up initiative, SAFEF's founding members collectively contribute more than 50% of our locally grown produce and represent some of our most productive food farms. Having these progressive farmers band together to walk this journey with us makes me confident that we can raise the sector's productivity and improve our food security. I look forward to more farmers joining SAFEF and working closely with us.",6,1171,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01171
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Indeed, we want to do even more together. We have worked closely with the industry and taken on board their feedback to review existing schemes and develop new initiatives to better support our farmers.",7,1172,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01172
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Let me highlight three key initiatives. First, we will further enhance the Agriculture Productivity Fund (APF). Many farmers have told us that they are happy to adopt more productive technology. However, new farming systems require heavy capital investments. Advanced greenhouse systems with environmental controls and automation, which can double their production, can cost around S$4 million. We appreciate that this poses challenges for many of our farms. So to help farmers take this leap, we are increasing the APF Productivity Enhancement component's co-funding cap from $700,000 to $2 million for our strategic food farms. This is a significant enhancement.",8,1173,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01173
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Beyond the capital cost of implementation, farmers have told us that they need assistance in testing these new systems prior to a larger-scale deployment, to ensure that the technology can be adapted to our local conditions and produce. Several rounds of trials are usually necessary before farmers can commit to a particular technology or a system at a commercial scale. Hence, we will now introduce a new test-bedding component to the APF to co-fund up to $500,000 for food farms that want to testbed new solutions.",9,1174,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01174
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Secondly, we will develop a Singaporean workforce for our farms of the future, in partnership with our Institutes of Higher Learning. It will provide a talent pipeline to ensure our farms have skilled manpower to undertake transformation and innovation. For a start, Temasek Polytechnic will launch its new ""Earn and Learn"" work-study programme to attract ITE graduates into the aquaculture industry. Under this programme, participating farms can enjoy up to $15,000 worth of incentives for each graduate to defray their training costs. I am glad that six of our food fish farms have already pledged support for this programme. The graduates will start their 12-month attachment programmes from April this year. I hope that our farmers will indeed take this opportunity to create a positive learning experience for the graduates. This will help encourage our young talent not just to enter the industry, but also to stay and contribute more to the industry.",10,1175,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01175
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Third, we will do more to help increase demand for local produce. As our farmers become more productive, they will naturally need more consumers to support them. In this context, we organised the first SG Farmers' Market last September at myVillage mall in Serangoon Gardens. The event generated plenty of interests. More recently, we co-organised the second Farmers' Market last month with SAFEF. More than 25 local farmers participated and I am happy to say that most of them sold out all their products to the crowds that visited the Market. This was a very good response.",11,1176,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01176

This takes into account also the sales proceeds from their previous property, if any. We have updated the eligibility criteria for public rental to make these considerations much clearer.",21,1186,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01186

2018-03-06-T-007,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,The first is with regards to rental and this is directed to the Senior Minister of State. Many of our rental precincts tend to be a little bit sparse in terms of facilities and design. A number of Members spoke about the impact the living environment has on families as well as their children. Is there more that the Ministry can do to provide better facilities for some of these existing precincts because the newer ones are seeing better facilities.,2,1208,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01208
2018-03-06-T-007,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"The second one has to do with our older, single Singaporeans living in rental flats.

Since 2012, our new building plan already put in some facilities, like partitioning, in the rental flats. And in the newer ones, I think beyond 2013 to 2014, for example, the partitions also include separate doors and a separate window so that there is a lot more privacy for these tenants co-sharing a unit.

I would like to know whether is there an increase in the number of Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) projects? Secondly, is there a delay to HIP completion because I remember during Minister Mah Bow Tan's time as well as my favourite Minister Khaw Boon Wan's time, it is mentioned that it will be completed by 2021 but now I heard it is 2022. Is there a delay and, if there is, why is there a delay?",1,1214,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01214
2018-03-06-T-007,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"The next two questions are addressed to Minister Desmond Lee. For infrastructure projects that I mentioned where, when it comes to prequalification, the local contractors do not qualify. It is because they specify that they must have completed projects of certain size, very big size, so none of the local contractors qualify. So, I would like to ask Minister in situations like that, can BCA consider breaking down the project to smaller parcels so that the local contractors can have a share in it and to build up the track record. Otherwise, we can never have track record and go overseas.",2,1215,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01215
2018-03-06-T-007,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,The second question is about the feeding of the stray cats. Why is it that NEA said they cannot take action until it is left there for two hours or more? Why we waste time and resources to monitor that two hours? The moment they walk away it should be littering. Can Ministry work with NEA to sort this out?,3,1216,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01216

We have kept to that commitment; we will finish the selection by then. I have given an estimate on when these projects will be fully implemented because the implementation varies. It depends on so many different factors  sometimes, you need more time for consultation and so on. So, that is an estimate. It may be 2021; it may be 2022. But that is really an implementation process rather than selection. The selection, we have committed to doing it this year, and we will do it by the end of the year.",2,1218,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01218

2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Sir, may I respond to Er Dr Lee's two questions. The first is with regards to infrastructural projects where there are pre-qualification requirements. We have to strike a balance between ensuring that projects are carried out by builders who have capability and experience in doing so. And, on the other hand, ensuring that the local contractors are given the opportunity to build track records. So, these are tensions we have to deal with every time when we call a tender, including a pre-qualification tender.",1,1220,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01220
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Certainly, we make sure that the requirements and the pre-qualification stage do not unfairly prejudice local firms. Because if you have never done a project before, you will never have the track record to other projects of similar kind. This is limited, therefore, to complex projects, involving a lot of technical expertise such as, as I have said earlier, MRT and the deep tunneling works. Having said that, even for MRT works, if you look at how LTA has done it, they parceled the projects in order to give local contractors an opportunity to learn how to do this.",2,1221,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01221
2018-03-06-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For certain complex projects, you will find that our local contractors also partner foreign firms who have that technical expertise and in that respect, a certain degree of tech transfer and learning comes about. Certainly, we have impressed upon our agencies that in setting these requirements, they have to be mindful that these are indeed necessary for the project and do not unfairly prejudice our local firms.",3,1222,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01222

2018-03-06-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Secondly, could he provide an update on MND's efforts to mitigate the risk of plankton blooms, oil spills and so on which may affect fish farmers? What they are doing on water quality issues.",2,1226,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01226
2018-03-06-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Thirdly, on the land tendering system, I think the Senior Minister of State talked about the changes to the system. Would the Ministry give some consideration to whether the tendering system, whether it is a fixed price tender or a more traditional tender. Does that disadvantage start-ups and SMEs versus a large agri-business or corporations? We may have an interest to ensure that at least some of the land go to start-ups or entrepreneurs. Because whether it is on track record or financial resources, large agri-business corporations may have an advantage. So, I just wanted to know the Senior Minister of State's thoughts on that going forward.",3,1227,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01227
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Chairman, the first question on how much of APF has been disbursed, unfortunately, I do not have the numbers on hand right now. But I think many of the farmers whom we had spoken to, as I said in my speech earlier, were keen to tap on the fund for technology to enhance their operations. Some of them may have held back because of the on-going land tender. They wanted to wait for the certainty of lease. That is why the 20-year lease that we put out for these new plots of land are extremely helpful for them to see how they can best amortise their investments over a longer timeframe. And hopefully, the enhancement to the APF that we announced earlier, from $700,000 to $2 million, will allow them to more seriously invest in useful technology spread over a 20-year timeframe, and take on really productive technology to move the sector forward.",1,1228,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01228
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"On the Member's second question on the aqua-culture, fishery sector and what AVA and the Government are doing to help them mitigate the risk of plankton blooms, now, we know that there were a couple of serious plankton blooms that happened in the recent past. What AVA has done is that they have stepped up water quality monitoring, checking on the plankton count and also on the oxygenation level. They are also looking at water temperature. And when any of these parameters exceed a certain comfort level, AVA will send out SMSes to all the farmers on their mobile phones so that the farm operators or the owners will be alerted to a potential plankton bloom and take necessary precautions and remedial actions.",2,1229,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01229
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,AVA has also put up some R&D grants a few years back and encouraged fish farmers to use some of these grants to test-bed solutions that will help them develop systems that protect their fish stock from harm. I think about three to five local fish farms have used the funds quite well to adopt and create new technology like the close containment systems for which they can rapidly deploy and protect their fish stock when a plankton bloom does occur.,3,1230,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01230
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Having said that, they are still a very small portion of all the fish farms out there in the coastal areas. And I think no one would be able to prevent a plankton bloom because these are exogenous factors relating to weather, relating to water conditions. What it means is that more of our fish farms ought to tap on the grants to develop systems that mitigate some of these risks that are quite unpredictable. We want to encourage more of our fish farmers to use this and to do so, but they have to make the move. We can provide the grants, we can provide the conditions, the expertise as well, but they must do so.",4,1231,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01231
2018-03-06-T-007,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The third thing is on the fixed price tender. This is the first time we are doing the fixed price tender method. What it does is that we are no longer looking at bidding as a main determinant of who gets the plot of land. What this means is that any farm or any industry player who wants to put up a good proposal with productivity enhancement, with good technology adoption and more importantly also with a good track record of having been successful locally, producing in good quantity of local produce that is accepted by our market, will stand a better chance of winning this tender. So, it is based on a fixed price, the price of the fair value of land rather than a bidding war. What it means is that it will not disadvantage smaller players compared to a big player which has got deeper pockets. This is the intent of why we go on to a fixed price model for this particular tender exercise.",5,1232,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01232

Can I confirm that the removal of the mutual consent requirement is with immediate effect? Second, does it apply to people who were divorced before the announcement today?

2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The third question is AVA's resources whether more will be given to AVA. We manage with the allocated resources that MND has. AVA is given a budget like all of the agencies under MND. We spoke earlier in the MOF's COS, that every Ministry is striving to do more with less. So is MND. Just because I am the Second Minister for Finance does not mean that I get special pass. We do the same across the board. All Ministries are trying to manage with more limited resources and the same applies to us and to our agencies within MND's purview. Within the resources that we have, we encourage all agencies to do more. If there is a need, a new function or new value that is created, new projects that they deem are worthy, then there is a central pool within our Ministry which we can re-allocate from, so that these meritorious projects are funded. And that is what we will continue to do.",2,1236,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01236

2018-03-06-T-007,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"The second question is, what help can be given to those who are having financial difficulty who are renting a flat outside while waiting for their BTO flat? They cannot afford to pay the market rate. Hopefully, they can get it slightly cheaper through the HDB's Interim Housing scheme. Can that be looked into?",2,1239,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01239
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Chairman, on the LUP, we gave an update not so long ago in a Parliamentary Question. I do not have the information with me now but we gave an update on those that have already been implemented. For the outstanding ones, we have tried out a few options, they have not been effective. So, we will continue to study these options, whether there are newer technologies that will help. I think there are not that many blocks left and these are more difficult designs which are very hard for us to put in the list in a cost-effective manner. We have already said if there is anyone living in these sorts of blocks that need help particularly with medical needs or mobility needs, then we can look at this and see how best to assist them.",1,1240,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01240
2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second question, for those who have applied for a BTO flat and need rental, there is the PPHS to help them. That provides them with rental in the interim while they wait for their new flats to be ready. And as the Member would recall, we reduced PPHS rental rates last year, and that would make it even more affordable.",2,1241,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01241

2018-03-06-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As I have mentioned earlier, in the HDB team, there is an in-house architecture design team but they also work with private architects. They are continuously seeing how we can improve our designs. They may not always get it perfect because each time they do something in a particular new estate, there are site constraints and they have to work within all these constraints to put in place the BTO units as well as the amenities and facilities, sometimes in a quite constrained manner especially if the site is not big enough. So, for this particular area, let me ask HDB to check and see if there is anything that can be done to address Mr Png's concerns.",2,1245,2018-03-06-T-007-S-01245

2018-03-06-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"The introduction of the Bus Contracting Model (BCM) has transformed our public bus industry and professionalised the job of bus captains. BCM has benefitted bus captains tremendously, as they now earn salaries that are almost equal to the national median wage, and enjoy better benefits and working conditions. New bus depots and interchanges are now designed with the welfare of our bus captains and station staff in mind, and these are very much appreciated by our bus workers.",2,1291,2018-03-06-T-008-S-01291
2018-03-06-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Chairman, BCM did not just benefit bus captains. It has benefitted commuters too. The PTC’s latest survey on commuter satisfaction has shown that a record 96.7% of commuters are happy with our public bus services. Under BCM, public bus operators are incentivised for good service reliability and reduced bus bunching. Can MOT provide an update on the performance of the respective public bus operators? Have they met their KPIs under BCM? Are there any plans by LTA to further tighten these KPIs? How much incentives have been paid out to the operators since the introduction of BCM?",3,1292,2018-03-06-T-008-S-01292
2018-03-06-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"I ask because ultimately, the ones who are tasked to fulfil these KPIs are our bus captains. With BCM, our bus captains have had to adapt to new performance indicators – and this has added new pressure to an already challenging job. Fatigue can occur in all industries but numerous studies have focused its effects on shift workers and drivers, and our bus captains are both shift workers and drivers. The union hopes to have the support of LTA and our public bus operators to conduct a joint fatigue study of our bus captains. This would allow us to identify stress points and work together on early interventions.",4,1293,2018-03-06-T-008-S-01293
2018-03-06-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Another key reason behind the high commuter satisfaction in bus services can be attributed to the Bus Service Enhancement Programme, which saw the injection of 1,000 new buses over the past two years. However, the existing bus depots and interchanges, especially the older ones, were not designed to accommodate the increased number of buses. Can MOT provide an update on the plans for new depots and interchanges, and if there are any plans to upgrade existing ones? I do hope that LTA will continue to work with the union to factor in worker-centric designs when building new bus facilities or upgrading the old ones.",5,1294,2018-03-06-T-008-S-01294
2018-03-06-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"To drive these new buses, the operators hired hundreds of new bus captains who are trained at the Singapore Bus Academy.

With the conclusion of BSEP, it is unlikely that we would see a large influx of new bus captains in the coming years. With the recent launch of the Land Transport Industry Transformation Map (ITM) and the risk of displacement from autonomous vehicles, it is timely that we now cast an eye to the future of the industry. Are there any plans by the Academy to develop new training programmes focused on up-skilling existing bus captains?

During my dialogues with residents of the private estates, I received so many complaints about bicycles that are parked in a haphazard manner and which obstruct others. Residents complain about bicycles which are left just outside their homes; bicycles left outside the gate of the condo; bicycles strewn on the middle of the footpath, left at HDB void decks, by the grass verge and so on.

Pending the Second Reading of the Bill, may I ask Minister how does LTA intend to ensure that there are adequate parking places for the shared bicycles? The current advantage of the current bicycle sharing scheme is the ability to find a bicycle almost anywhere as compared to the systems in Europe, Taiwan and other countries where cyclists must walk to a bicycle rental station to rent a bicycle.",4,1366,2018-03-06-T-008-S-01366

Will it be that they will provide parking place for the bicycles next to the condo, next to the bus stop or next to the MRT station?

This will ensure the hirer has an incentive to park the bicycle properly. Further, if the hirer of the bicycle dumps the bicycle in an indiscriminate manner, or obstruct others, I would urge LTA to work with the BSO to identify the hirer and thereafter prosecute the hirer for illegal dumping of bicycles.",7,1369,2018-03-06-T-008-S-01369

I have said it before and I will say it again – without licensing and plating of bikes and PMDs, we cannot identify the culprits.

When I went to Copenhagen, I saw dedicated cycling lanes parallel to the roads. They are often on both sides of the road, so cyclists only move in one direction following the flow of traffic. The Copenhagen way also enables cyclists to go quite fast, making cycling a more attractive option. There are proper stop signs and zebra crossings where the cycling lane intersects with footpath.

If the authority is going to such length to implement QR code geofencing to ensure bicycles are properly parked within a designated area, why not just implement a docking station?

However, with the setting up of more designated bike parking zones near bus stops and drop-off points, this has improved. In anticipation of more bike-sharing companies setting up here and a larger bike fleet size from existing incumbents, it leads to a concern on whether there will be sufficient designated bike parking. Failure to provide a sufficient number of designated bike parking zones could worsen the situation. To address this concern of large influx in bikes but inadequate parking zones, authorities can consider imposing a cap on the number of bikes allowed under each bike-sharing firm.",1,1410,2018-03-06-T-008-S-01410

During my house visits, a sizable number of residents have related horrific experiences with irresponsible PMD users. There were many near-misses and in some cases, there were injuries and the injuries were quite serious. In one case, one of my resident’s toes were fractured by a passing e-scooter in the Chinese Garden. The user of the e-scooter was in uniform and was wearing a big bag belonging to a food delivery company. There was CCTV in the area and these residents made a complaint to the company that provide food delivery, made a police report and also requested NParks for the CCTV images. But all his requests were ignored.",1,1416,2018-03-06-T-008-S-01416

As we promote the use of PMD, we can expect more of such incidents and I would like to urge MOT to work with the Police and related agencies to devise a framework to better regulate the use of PMD and consider setting up a dedicated unit to prosecute irresponsible PMD users.
