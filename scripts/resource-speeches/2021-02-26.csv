2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Speaker, the Minister for National Development will also be replying to a Parliamentary Question (PQ) on the same issue. May I seek your permission for us to take the supplementary questions after he delivers his reply?",1,2,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00002

2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, if I may continue. Let me start by explaining the background of the site and development. The former Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) railway line used to run through the Kranji Road/Kranji Close site. When the KTM land was returned to Singapore in 2011, the said site comprised mainly disused scrubland. This is shown on page 3 of the handout.",1,7,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00007
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As the site was earmarked for future development works, it was left vacant. More non-native Albizia trees then sprouted over the years. In 2015, following URA’s review of the plans for the KTM land parcels, the Rail Corridor was realigned out of the Kranji parcel so that the site could be redeveloped for industrial use. The plan was publicly exhibited, and community stakeholders were generally receptive to the proposal. This is shown in page 6 of the handout.",2,8,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00008
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The site was later earmarked for the development of the Agri-Food Innovation Park (AFIP) as part of the larger Sungei Kadut Eco-District (SKED) development, which will support Singapore’s 30-by-30 food security goals. In its development plans for the AFIP, JTC recognised the importance of retaining greenery, and therefore proposed to preserve the original alignment of the former KTM railway line within AFIP as a green corridor with additional green buffers on each side. JTC’s development plans for AFIP with the green corridor were publicly exhibited in URA’s Draft Master Plan 2019 and the SKED Master Plan exhibition in February 2020.",3,9,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00009
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I will now go through the development works at the Kranji site. In response to Ms He Ting Ru’s question, page 9 of the handout provides a background on the roles and responsibilities of the various parties involved in a typical development project, including that of AFIP. Besides the contractor, an important party is the consultant, who acts as the Qualified Person (QP). In particular, the QP is responsible for ensuring that the project’s design meet the statutory requirements, and obtaining approvals from the authorities for the design.",4,10,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00010
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Seah Kian Peng, Mr Xie Yao Quan and Mr Dennis Tan have asked about the sequence of land clearing activities. JTC’s chronology has been reported widely in the media, and Members may refer to pages 10 to 15 of the handout for the chronology. I will therefore just highlight a few key points.",5,11,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00011
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In 2019, JTC appointed CPG as its consultant to carry out planning and design works for the site. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was not required then, given that the site was previously dominated by scrubland vegetation and later non-native Albizia trees as I had explained earlier. The site is also not close to sensitive nature areas.",6,12,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00012
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Thereafter, CPG submitted building plans for AFIP to NParks, including proposals to fell trees. On 29 August 2019, NParks issued a Written Direction to approve the tree-felling for three plots within the site, namely Plots 4, 5 and 9 indicated on page 11 of the handout. Following this, tree felling for Plot 9 started in March 2020.",7,13,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00013
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In August 2020, CPG submitted updated building plans to NParks, which included a new drain with discharge and flow into Sungei Pang Sua.",8,14,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00014
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As the drain could potentially cause sediments from the site to flow into Sungei Pang Sua and impact wildlife in the vicinity, NParks instructed JTC and CPG to conduct a fauna baseline study and Environmental Monitoring and Management Programme (EMMP). The consultant for the fauna study and EMMP was engaged in December 2020.",9,15,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00015
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Between end December 2020 and 13 January 2021, the contractor conducted further clearing without approval. These areas are edged red in page 14 of the handout and amount to a total of 4.5 hectares.",10,16,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00016
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"There are on-going investigations on why the contractor did so, since there was no approval. I seek the House’s understanding that I cannot say more at this point in time, pending the outcome of these investigations.",11,17,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00017
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The further land clearing by the contractor was discovered by JTC’s project manager on 13 January 2021 during his site visit. All clearance works onsite were suspended immediately and remain suspended today.,12,18,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00018
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,Mr Xie Yao Quan and Ms He Ting Ru asked how we will ensure such incidents do not recur. JTC has commenced an internal investigation to ascertain what had happened and why. The investigation will be led by JTC’s Senior Management who are not involved in the project. It will check if JTC’s current processes for land clearance works were followed by both the public officers and private contractors involved. JTC will also review how it can better supervise the various personnel involved in its development projects. NParks is separately investigating whether there were breaches to the Parks and Trees Act and the Wildlife Act. We will not comment further on the respective investigations at this point to not prejudice the outcomes.,13,19,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00019
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Till today, all clearance works on the Kranji Close/Kranji Road site remain suspended. After the fauna baseline study and EMMP are completed around April 2021, JTC will engage key stakeholders, including nature interest groups, to discuss its development plans. Findings of the studies will be made publicly available when ready.",14,20,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00020
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We can and must do better. As Minister-in-charge of the Public Service, I have instructed all agencies involved in land clearance projects to conduct an immediate check to ensure their project supervision and implementation processes are in order. Minister Desmond Lee and I have also asked Permanent Secretary Joseph Leong, who is not involved in this matter, to lead a review of the lessons arising from this development at Kranji. In the course of his review, he will consult representatives from the public, private and people sectors. The outcomes from the various investigations and review will be shared with the public when ready.",15,21,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00021
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, let me conclude by summarising the key points  the said piece of land was meant for industrial development. It was scrubland that has become overgrown in recent years. In developing this piece of land to strengthen our food supply chain resilience, JTC and NParks had on their own accord proposed retaining the original alignment of the former railway line to preserve its heritage, with a green corridor that would provide an ecological connection between Sungei Pang Sua and Sungei Mandai. The project was carefully planned, incorporating and balancing the considerations of economic development, job creation and environmental protection.",16,22,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00022
2021-02-26-T-001,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The execution of the land clearing could be improved. That is the subject of on-going investigations. We should not speculate or prematurely apportion blame without a full understanding of the timeline of events, scope of responsibilities of the various parties involved and the motivations of various parties or pressures faced that could have contributed to the outcome. We will investigate the pertinent issues thoroughly, share the lessons learnt and improve as a system.",17,23,2021-02-26-T-001-S-00023
2021-02-26-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for National Development whether environmental baseline studies or environmental impact assessments are currently done for all industrial developments.,1,24,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00024
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to address the House comprehensively on the issue of the site clearance at the Kranji site, my response today will also cover issues raised by Members who had filed related Parliamentary Questions (PQs) for subsequent sittings. To be specific, this includes PQs filed by Members Mr Dennis Tan, Mr Louis Ng",1,25,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00025
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"As the details of the site clearance at the Kranji site have been shared publicly by JTC at a press conference on 22 February, I will focus my response today on  (a) environmental considerations in the planning process, (b) on-going investigations into the incident at the Kranji site, and (c) steps that we plan to take to strengthen our processes, including the EIA framework.",2,26,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00026
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),Let me start with the planning process.,3,27,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00027
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Under URA’s Planning Act, development proposals require planning permission from URA before they are allowed to proceed. As part of this process, every development proposal goes through a thorough screening process, which reviews not only its potential environmental impact, but also other aspects such as its impact on traffic, public health and heritage.",4,28,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00028
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Developments projects that  (a) are near sensitive areas such as Nature Reserves, Nature Areas and other areas with significant biodiversity; or (b) which are in marine and coastal areas; or (c) which have potential trans-boundary impact, are subject to greater scrutiny. The developers of such projects will be required to undergo an in-depth consultation process with relevant Technical Agencies, namely NParks, National Environment Agency (NEA), the Maritime Port Authority (MPA) and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA).",5,29,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00029
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Depending on the context of the site, the scope of the project works, and its potential impact on the environment, more detailed studies may be required. This can be an Environmental Baseline Study (EBS), or in some cases, a more detailed Environmental Impact Study (EIS), which sets out the environmental baseline, expected impact and mitigation measures.",6,30,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00030
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"The studies enable agencies to better assess the possible environmental impact of the development plans and the adequacy of the proposed mitigation measures, to guide the planning and potential development of the site. For instance, NEA assesses the potential for noise, water or air pollution, MPA assesses impacts on navigation and SFA on sea-based farms, NParks assesses impacts on terrestrial and marine biodiversity, covering both flora and fauna.",1,31,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00031

2021-02-26-T-002,,,"While developers can call tenders for works while the environmental studies are on-going, activities on site can only proceed when the developer has received the necessary approvals from relevant agencies. This applies for both private and public projects.",3,33,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00033
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"Let me give an example of site clearance which involves the felling of trees. Under the Parks and Trees Act, the felling of any tree more than one metre in girth either on vacant land or in Tree Conservation areas can only proceed with the Commissioner's approval. NParks will require a tree survey, in order to assess the potential impact of the tree felling plan. If NParks assesses that conducting a further environmental baseline, or other forms of study, is not required, it may allow for some types of works to begin. However, NParks may require mitigation measures, such as the installation of hoarding or an Environmental Monitoring and Management Programme (EMMP) to be in place.",4,34,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00034
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"For past incidents of tree felling without prior approval, NParks had conducted investigations and penalties ensued. The environmental impact of such incidents varies depending on the site context and the extent of works undertaken.",5,35,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00035
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"Planning permission for the project to go ahead is only granted after a project has met the requirements imposed by the respective regulatory agencies. These include completing necessary detailed technical studies, such as environmental and traffic impact assessments, as well as putting in place mitigating measures.",6,36,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00036
2021-02-26-T-002,,,Let me move on to the clearance of this Kranji site. Many Members have asked for updates on the investigations and the possible penalties on the site clearance at Kranji site.,7,37,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00037
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"As I have said on 22 February, in the press conference, NParks is currently investigating whether there had been breaches of the Wildlife Act and/or the Parks and Trees Act. We therefore cannot go into more detail at this point, and we ask that Members not speculate further. After investigations are complete, NParks will refer the case to the Public Prosecutor for directions, before sharing the findings with the public.",8,38,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00038
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"There are penalties for breaches of the Parks and Trees Act and the Wildlife Act.

2021-02-26-T-002,,,"Members have also asked if the site clearance at the Kranji Road/Kranji Close site had affected the fauna baseline study. Thirteen hectares of vegetated areas, which includes the safeguarded green corridor and vegetated buffers along Sungei Pang Sua, remain. All clearance works onsite are currently suspended, while the study is underway. The results of the study will be made public when ready. Thereafter, JTC will engage relevant stakeholders on the findings, including the measures to enhance the greenery and connectivity of the site and its surrounding environs. The study findings will be used to design measures such as enhanced habitats, buffers and connectivity for wildlife.",10,40,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00040
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"Now, I move on to the third part of the presentation which is on steps to strengthen processes. Members have asked how we will seek to prevent such incidents from happening again. As Minister Chan Chun Sing had announced on Monday, a review will be undertaken of this incident, to identify gaps and learning points for project management, supervision and execution, as well as inter-agency coordination. Agencies involved in site clearance projects are conducting checks to ensure that their project supervision and implementation processes are in order.",11,41,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00041
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"In parallel, MND will continue our efforts to strengthen the Environmental Impact Assessment, or EIA, framework, in close consultation with the nature community and partner agencies. We are currently working to implement the following enhancements which we had announced publicly last October, namely  (a) increase the vigour or rigour of our environmental studies through a set of Biodiversity Impact Assessment Guidelines; (b) strengthen our enforcement regime through the amended Wildlife Act; (c) build up local expertise on ecological matters; and (d) make all environmental study reports publicly available, unless there are security considerations.",12,42,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00042
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"In our discussions with the nature community last year, we had identified several other ways to further strengthen the EIA process beyond what we had just rolled out in October. We will develop a more comprehensive picture of the islandwide eco-system and connectivity, so that we can better consider how the specific sites connect to our nature cores, buffers and corridors. We will do this in a science-based manner, on an islandwide scale, and we will conduct baseline studies for specific sites to understand their ecological profile and role in ecological connectivity. Members of the nature community will be invited to join us in this upstream work. The findings from these studies will add to the data and connectivity models that NParks has built up over the years, and help guide Government in carrying out longer term planning.",13,43,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00043
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"In addition, we have been reviewing whether it would be better to centralise the management of EIA consultants, instead of having individual developers or agencies manage their own. We are still studying this. Separately, we will explore how we can make better use of technology to strengthen project management.",14,44,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00044
2021-02-26-T-002,,,"Sir, Members may recall that we had negotiated for the return of the KTM railway line to Singapore in 2011, to meet, among other things, our land use needs. The land that we got back included the 24-km railway line, from North all the way South to Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, as well as adjacent parcels of land at various points along the track. These parcels of land were used by the railway for storage, for housing and for other purposes.",15,45,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00045

Until the detailed plans were finalised and works begun, the site was left vacant, with vegetation and trees allowed to grow to provide green cover until the time of development. Non-native Albizia trees sprouted in recent years – and biologists would know that Albizia trees grow at a very quick rate, they self-sow and they grow as fast as four to five metres a year and can mature in as fast as five years or less – and in Singapore's hot and humid climate, progressively dominated the site within a few years.",21,51,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00051

2021-02-26-T-002,,,"As I have explained in this House recently, we adopt a science-based approach to identify which areas of significant biodiversity to conserve. For instance, the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat, just further north of the Kranji site, was once a fishing village. It had initially been planned for industrial use, for factories. Yet, after careful study through biodiversity surveys and ecological modelling, we decided to keep it as a Nature Park given its high ecological value, both domestically as well as internationally as part of a flyway. Agencies, therefore, had to forego development plans for the area.",23,53,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00053

2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, three quick replies to Mr Seah Kian Peng's three supplementary questions.",1,65,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00065
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Is there a schedule? Yes, there is a schedule where JTC officers are required to regularly visit the site. Whether that schedule has been adhered to, is the subject of an on-going investigation at this point in time and I will not further comment on this.",2,66,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00066
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, on the nature of the investigations, as I have laid out on Monday, there are the internal NParks and JTC investigations as to whether the current processes have been followed. And I expect the respective agencies will want to do a thorough review to see whether the processes have been followed. In addition to that, we have appointed Permanent Secretary Joseph Leong to look at how these processes can be tightened, especially the inter-agency processes. Joseph will have access to both the views from the public sector, the people sector and also the private sector.",3,67,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00067
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the third question about the stern warning that was issued by JTC immediately to the contractor involved, at this point in time, NParks and JTC will do their investigations and subsequent to that, if there are any other wrongdoings uncovered by NParks' investigations, NParks will have the statutory powers to take the responsible parties to task. The penalties for those are laid out in the respective Acts. So, it does not mean that the stern warning is the end of all there is to be.",4,68,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00068

2021-02-26-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two supplementary questions for the Minister for National Development and one supplementary question for the Minister for Trade and Industry. I thank both Ministers for the answers.",1,70,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00070
2021-02-26-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"For the Minister for National Development, I would like to ask the Minister whether he thinks that it is now time to consider codifying Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and other similar assessments like the Environmental Baseline Study (EBS) into our legislative framework. That means to have a law that codifies all these assessments, quite akin to what they have in the UK, where it prescribes when the EIA must be done, and when it does not have to be done, the legislation will state that it is because it is provided for in a differently scheduled provision under a separate area of law.",2,71,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00071
2021-02-26-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Related to this, under such a proposed framework, I would like to ask the Minister for National Development whether or not, in the proposed review that he is looking into, to consider a more holistic approach in assessment. At the moment, it is different types of assessment that we are doing – EBS, EIA, and the assessment that Minister Chan has mentioned because of the different conditions. So, I wonder if we can have a more holistic approach. And I say this because, for example, in this case, both Ministers mentioned about scrubland, that this Kranji woodlands being scrubland —",3,72,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00072
2021-02-26-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Dennis Tan, if you could keep your supplementary questions short. There is a number of Members who would like to ask supplementary questions.",1,73,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00073
2021-02-26-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Sorry, Mr Speaker. There is some value in scrubland. Currently, it provides for our biodiversity – there is wildlife, there is floral and fauna. But eventually, it can also develop into something even better over time. So, if we have a holistic approach that can look into land of such a nature, it is in-between, it may not be secondary forest, but nonetheless, it is important biodiversity.",1,74,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00074
2021-02-26-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Next, I would like to ask the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Minister can confirm that Huationg has been paid for the land clearance that it carried out in December last year and January this year.",2,75,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00075
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I thank the Member for the questions. I will address the questions he has asked about the EIA framework, and then, my colleague Minister Chan will respond.",1,76,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00076
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The first is whether we want or need to codify the Environmental Impact Assessment framework into legislation. I think we need to see what the framework is in place, currently, today, as augmented by recent developments, both in June last year and October last year; as well as the plans we have going forward. We look at EIA framework as a whole; and legislation is a tool as are other levers such as guidelines, incentives, processes, standards. They all are different tools with which we use to ensure that the framework is holistic, rigorous and comprehensive.",2,77,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00077
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I said previously, no development, public or private, may take place without planning permission. URA is the gatekeeper with the Planning Act and related planning legislation, as that legislative gateway. As I said earlier, there is not only a masterplanning process in which multiple agencies representing the diversity of needs of Singaporeans, both present and future, but also representing the different constituencies and causes and concerns out there, come together regularly as part of the masterplanning process to look at our land use needs, including sites that we may need for connectivity, for biodiversity, for nature, for recreation. But also, when development plans are surfaced, way in advance of even the first works beginning onsite, there is a screening process.",3,78,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00078
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, URA acts as a gateway; the Planning Act and related planning legislation are the legislative tools which URA uses to provide that gatekeeping role. And a variety of Technical Agencies will then scrutinise the plans specifically. Each site will have its own variances, its own habitat, its own set of issues. Some of it could be traffic, some of it could be hydrology, some of it could be water quality, some of it could be issues of sedimentation, some about noise, some about biodiversity.",4,79,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00079
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Where nature and biodiversity are concerned, NParks together with the professionals and scientists and arborists and horticulturalists and conservationists, with the support of the nature community whom we consult regularly, we will look at those sites. We will look at those sites for which a development plan is put forward for approval, and then, make an assessment and screen it – notwithstanding the upstream masterplanning phase when plans arrive.",5,80,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00080
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The different agencies, depending on the specific context of the site, impose or require the necessary consultations, studies, which are then pegged onto that planning approval legislative framework.",6,81,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00081
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"This kind of approach allows for greater dexterity, greater responsiveness to the site in question. And so, it is a professional assessment, involves specific understanding of the site and the different considerations, both environmental and human.",7,82,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00082
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And then, in June last year, in a Private Member's Motion by Member Louis Ng, together with agencies, the Wildlife Act was brought into force. And if Members may recall, some time back there was some question about whether there is legislative teeth for NParks to enforce in relation to biodiversity environmental management and monitoring. And so, now under section 10 of the Act, there is significant legislative power for the Commissioner to impose the requisite studies, to impose the requisite measures, and penalties are as I have articulated earlier in my speech.",8,83,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00083
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And of course, there are other legislation involving, say, the pollution of waterways, pollution of water bodies, rivers, earth streams, so and so forth. And so, there is a legislative framework and they all come together, not just codified, and frozen in time, but responsive, allowing gatekeeping roles, allowing agencies to come in to making impositions, to impose studies, to then look at those studies and impose the EMMP and other plants.",9,84,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00084
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, the approach is holistic having said that last October last year, we sought to strengthen the capability of the sector, strengthen the capability that we have locally, strengthen both the understanding of developing agencies as well as EIA consultants. Our nature community tells us that actually what needs to be done is we need to bootstrap, up the standards and ensure consistency in our biodiversity impact assessment capability.",10,85,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00085
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And hence, a very comprehensive approach in our new BIA guidelines which were launched in October last year. I am not quite sure how you can codify something like the BIA guidelines which will be used across different agencies, because it is very comprehensive from a scientific basis, looking at different habitats. So, when there is a mangrove habitat, whether it is intertidal, whether it is whether it is a secondary forest, whether it is scrubland, whether it is a mature forest, whether you look at the benthic habitats. All these are specifically set out in very detailed guidelines, put together by conservationists and in deep consultation with our nature community.",11,86,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00086
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And of course, when development is about to begin and is in progress, there are powers under the Parks and Trees Act, powers to require a tree and flora survey, for which then you can decide whether to grant approval for the clearance of trees or the salvage or the conservation intitule of trees onsite that are of significance. As well as under the Wildlife Act, the imposition of EMMPs, as well as fauna surveys.",12,87,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00087
2021-02-26-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Can I also request that the Ministers keep their responses as succinct as possible? Thank you.,1,88,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00088
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir,  the answer to Mr Dennis Tan's question is, no. Huationg has not been paid for the over clearance in January and December.",1,89,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00089
2021-02-26-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Thank you. Mr Xie Yao Quan.,1,90,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00090
2021-02-26-T-002,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have two supplementary questions for Minister Chan. The first is in terms of the timing of the announcement by JTC on 16 February, can the Minister provide an explanation on that timeline? The discovery of the erroneous clearance was on 13 January and it would seem the announcement came after a member of the public – a private citizen – first shared about this on social media.",1,91,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00091
2021-02-26-T-002,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"The second question is to just pay recognition to the fact that this land is ultimately for agri-technology. And so, does the Minister have any assessment of whether the delivery of this capacity and industrial development will be delayed as a result of this incident?",2,92,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00092
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to the first supplementary question, the error was discovered on 13 January, and immediately, the stop work order was given to the contractor on the ground. Internal investigations commenced immediately within JTC. We made the information public in February, on 16 February as Mr Xie Yao Quan said, because there was public interest in this.",1,93,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00093
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As a general rule as to when we make investigations public, a few considerations will have to be taken into account. First, will it affect the course of the investigations, will it prejudice the course of the investigations? Second, the nature of the incident and which aspect of it will be of public interest.",2,94,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00094
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our focus from January to February, within JTC, was to make sure that they can conduct the investigation thoroughly and fairly, without prejudice to the parties concerned. And we can all understand that once things come out to the public, certain evidence or certain investigations might be prejudiced. So, that is why we have not made public earlier the investigations.",3,95,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00095
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But when there was public interest in this, we were also careful to make sure that we come out quickly with the facts that we have established, so that the public does not need to speculate, so that we can proceed with the investigations.",4,96,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00096
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second point as whether there will be a delay in the execution of the project, there will already be a delay in execution of the project because of COVID-19. Now, we will complete the EMMP study, and then, we will consult the necessary stakeholders, and then, we will try to progress the project as originally planned in order to deliver, not just the economic benefits, the jobs, the food resilience, but also to deliver as part of the masterplan, the environmental enhancement in the area that will allow us to enjoy the place, live in the place, work in the place and play in the place.",5,97,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00097

2021-02-26-T-002,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Ministers for their reply. I have one supplementary question. Many agencies are involved in land clearance works involving greenery. This includes LTA, HDB, PUB, JTC, SLA and so on. As part of the follow-ups, will the Government consider appointing a lead agency to oversee and overall coordinate land clearance activities, such that we can minimise the possibility of such an incident from happening again?",1,99,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00099
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Yip Hon Weng for his observations and suggestion. Indeed, it is true. Often, in a complex project, there will be many agencies involved and this is the reason why both Minister Desmond Lee and myself have asked Permanent Secretary Joseph Leong to look into the inter-agency process to see how we can strengthen this.",1,100,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00100
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At this point in time, I want to qualify. When we say strengthen the process, we mean to make it better, we mean to streamline it, and it does not necessarily mean that we must add on more processes.",2,101,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00101
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"If I may seek your indulgence, Mr Speaker. I grew up in the SAF. And in the SAF, once in a while, sometimes, accidents happen. And very often when accidents happen, we ask ourselves how we can do better. And very often, sometimes, we will come to a quick conclusion that we need more supervision.",3,102,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00102
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I have grown up learning that, that may not necessarily be the best solution. Because when more parties get involved, ultimately, who is responsible? If a soldier did not do his job well, we ask whether there were factors that affected his concentration, whether his training was adequate or whether there were other complicating factors. When a supervisor did not do his job well, we ask the same questions and at the end of the day, we want a streamlined process whereby there are clear lines of responsibilities for each of the parties involved in any complex project. And that is what Permanent Secretary Joseph Leong will help us look into.",4,103,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00103
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I thank Mr Yip Hon Weng for the observations. And that, indeed, we should be careful that in trying to improve the processes and streamline the processes, we do not unnecessarily add on processes that might either diffuse the responsibility or make project coordination even more difficult going forward.",5,104,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00104
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As we know, the contractors currently working on the ground are already facing various kinds of challenges from adhering to regulations to the challenges posed by COVID-19. And we should all try to come together to see how we can streamline the processes to improve the processes so that everyone is clear about their lines of accountability.",6,105,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00105
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"If I may just add, there will be many diverse interests in a complex project like this. There are developmental interests, there are contractors' interests, there are environmental groups' interests. And in all that we do, we seek to find a balance amongst all these interests, so that as much of the interest can be accommodated as possible. And that is how we will move forward. So, it is not either one or the other, it is not binary. It is always about working together to find the best way forward, so that we can achieve multiple objectives from environmental protection to development. They are not mutually exclusive.",7,106,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00106

2021-02-26-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have this question for the Minister for National Development. I would like to ask if Minister can share from an urban planning perspective. Have there been plots of land that was earmarked earlier for industrial or housing development, that is under the masterplan, and was actually traded off in the interest of nature and also environmental protection over the years.",1,108,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00108
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The answer is yes. You know that as part of the concept plan or now what we call the long-term planning process, we identify the broad strategies for Singapore and therefore, flow through the land use requirements into the masterplan. Agencies come together to look at the different sites, look at the needs that they have for housing, recreation, healthcare, nature, conservation, for heritage, so on and so forth. And then, they work out the masterplan, which is then exhibited and publicly consulted on, including by specific stakeholders and interest groups.",1,109,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00109
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But having said that, over the years, this is not a static process. It is an iterative process, a dynamic one. Because our land use needs, population needs, our natural spaces also evolve and change, and therefore we have to be flexible and nimble and agile, and continuously relook at our masterplan.",2,110,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00110
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Therefore, as I have said in my presentation earlier, there have been sites which have been zoned for other uses, but which, after discussion between agencies, after the use of scientific approaches, have had their plans changed and agencies forgo their initial intentions for that land. For example, where the Kranji site is, it was once railway land. The parcel was made complete by agreed re-routing of the rail corridor, but then, JTC then decided to put it back in again, because they felt that it was important to have that within an Agri-food Innovation Park, in consultation with NParks.",3,111,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00111
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But just further north, is the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat, which is a key habitat; it is ecologically linked to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and also important as part of the East-Asian Australasian Flyway for migratory birds. What was therefore originally planned for industrial purposes has been changed to Nature Park. Likewise, a little further east would be Sungei Khatib Bongsu. Once, it was for prawn farming and fish farming as well as housing, kampong and some human use; subsequently, kept fallow for future development, specifically housing; and those plans were forgone after we evaluated the site and decided to keep it for nature areas.",4,112,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00112

2021-02-26-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"For the Minister for Trade and Industry, was this erroneously cleared 4.5 hectares of land, would it have been eventually cleared anyway and if so, when would that have been done?",2,115,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00115
2021-02-26-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"And for the Minister for National Development, the Minister, I believe, said that the developers can start planning works while environmental studies are on-going but they have to wait for approval before proceeding. However, if detailed requirements for developments are drawn out and multimillion-dollar tenders are issued before the studies are completed, is there a risk that the clearance of natural vegetation becoming a fait accompli by the time the environmental studies are completed?",3,116,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00116
2021-02-26-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to Mr Gerald Giam's question is that if you refer to the slide, there is a plan for the  Agri-Food Innovation Park (",1,117,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00117
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I think the Member makes a very good point. Our position from a regulatory and planning point of view is that works cannot begin until necessary approvals have been obtained; and this may require detailed studies. But ultimately, the developer has to make a call whether they wish to proceed to call those tenders, and if so, then they run the risk of having to make major adjustments along the way.",1,118,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00118

2021-02-26-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. Just two quick questions for Minister Desmond Lee. One, I think Minister mentioned about the BIA guidelines earlier. Could I just ask, whether these are just guidelines or are they mandatory for developers to follow? Two, I do hope we can codify the current EIA framework into law because I think that will send a strong signal that we take the protection of forests seriously here in Singapore.",1,120,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00120
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I recognise the Member's longstanding advocacy for the legislative codification of the EIA process. As I said previously, there is legislative gatekeeping and legislative empowerment in the entire process, but this is not just a legal process. It is an environmental process, a conservation process, a scientific process and it requires flexibility depending on the habitats and on the ecology of the area. And therefore, I think what we have today is an evolving system with recent enhancements. So, let us work on that and continue to study how we can improve.",1,121,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00121
2021-02-26-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for the Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA) guidelines, if Member has gone through them, they are very, very comprehensive. We hope through this process for developing agencies, including public developing agencies, to have a consistent baseline standard in carrying out these processes. Let us see how it is put into process and then decide what next steps to take.",2,122,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00122

2021-02-26-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),I have two quick supplementary questions – one to the Minister for National Development; it is more factual. It relates to part of my question on how many such unauthorised clearances have occurred in the last 12 months and what were the actions taken to them?,2,124,2021-02-26-T-002-S-00124
2021-02-26-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The second is for the Minister-in-charge of the Public Service. As mentioned by a number of Members, many public officers are involved in any large scale and complex project, and often resulting in cross responsibilities. How does the Minister-in-charge of the Public Service plan to look into the processes and into this incident as a learning point, so that such unauthorised actions do not occur again?

2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mr Speaker, I will focus on two topics in my speech  climate change and COVID-19. One is the most important long-term threat the world faces; and the other, the most immediate threat that is on the minds of world leaders and people around the world. The one thing they have in common is that both address concerns that can only be addressed by concerted effort on the global scale. These problems must be addressed collectively and individual efforts are not going to be enough.",1,142,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00142
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Climate change is getting more and more attention. There is broad consensus that climate change is caused by carbon emissions. As more carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses are emitted, the faster global temperatures rise. The drivers of carbon emission include the industrial development and agriculture, which are in turn driven by consumption. On the other end of the equation, carbon sinks, which are largely forest and plants that absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, are being increasingly destroyed as forests are cleared to make way for development.",2,143,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00143
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The effects of climate change are going to be felt by everyone. As global temperatures rise, the arctic ice caps will start to melt and sea levels will rise. Singapore has already started to make plans for dealing with this in the previous Budgets. At the same time, there will be increased desertification as temperatures rise, and more and more eco-systems and species face the risk of dying out as temperatures rise. There will be extremes of weather, droughts and floods. While people may continue to make adjustments to survive, quality of life will definitely get more harsh and difficult.",3,144,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00144
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Another casualty in this process is the natural world. I was very much moved by Sir David Attenborough’s documentary ""A Life on Our Planet"", which is really a sad reminder of what we have lost in the course of just one lifetime. Some of the frightening figures there include 15 billion trees are being cut down each year and that more than half our rainforests are gone. Coral reefs, which also absorb heat, are dying at an alarming rate because of rising water temperatures and pollution. There are also reports that 60% of invertebrates have been wiped out since 1970. There are large numbers of species going extinct and the current age is being referred to as the Sixth Great Extinction.",4,145,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00145
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Yet, our journey down this path has been paved with good intentions. People want better quality lives and development generally entails clearing land and development. We had a microcosm of this discussion just earlier. This is also why the greatest carbon emitters are the biggest economies, namely the US and China. The greatest carbon sinks are in the developing world. The developing world wants to develop and be more like the developed world, and this entails clearing land.",5,146,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00146
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One area where this is being very publicly debated is the clearing of the Amazon rainforests in Brazil, where land is being cleared at one of its fastest rates. President Jair Bolsanaro has publicly defended his country’s right to clear land for development, while the rest of the world insists it should not.",6,147,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00147
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Brazil's view is understandable. Brazil does not see why it has to forgo its own development for the benefit of the rest of the world. On the flipside, it views the developed world, where countries already benefited from deforestation, are not being fair in telling the developing countries not to develop. Not only that, but the developed world still continues to have a significantly higher carbon footprint than the developing world.",7,148,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00148
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In my view, the only sensible solution to this is that we have to pay countries to conserve their forests. And in order to make this payment, there must be a price on pollution and carbon emissions. These ideas are not new; they have been developed in various international treaties like the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol.",8,149,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00149
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Ideally, if we can have a global carbon trading market, we may be able to have a fair system where countries that create carbon sinks to absorb carbon get payments for doing so, and countries that emit carbon pay for the same. This way, countries will be incentivised to reduce emissions, in which case they pay less. And countries that may be engaged in reforestation and absorb more carbon can get paid more. This will hopefully create a virtual cycle where countries can be incentivised to reduce emissions and, if possible, even to engage in reforestation.",9,150,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00150
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Of course, this is ideal. In order for this to work, the countries emitting carbon have to acknowledge they have a problem.",10,151,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00151
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"So, what can Singapore do? Singapore is a small country. We cannot really move the meter very much on the global scale. Our own emissions are probably a drop in the ocean. But I think our Budget measures show a clear commitment to reduce our own carbon footprint and to maintain and manage our own development in a sustainable way.",11,152,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00152
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"We had a very long discussion earlier on on the clearing of land in Kranji. The fact that land clearing gets so much attention in this House, to me, is a good sign of how seriously we take this commitment. We recognise the need for development but we also recognise the need to do so sustainably.",12,153,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00153
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I think what we also could do is to lend our voice and continue to do so on the international sphere, and to the extent we can aid in the assistance of working out global solutions.",13,154,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00154
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The two most important players in this space are the US and China. While they are rivals on some fronts, hopefully, on this front, there is an opportunity for them to take the lead in unison. Both President Xi and President Biden have publicly voiced their commitments to reducing emissions, have taken measures, and the next step is to do so in the international scene.",14,155,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00155
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"If we reduce emissions and ideally, incentivise and promote reforestation, the effects of climate change may be reversible, but we must work collectively to take effort.",15,156,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00156
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second topic I will discuss is COVID-19. Just a little over a year ago, in the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 was a little known virus which had been spreading in China in the province of Wuhan, but had little footprint elsewhere. Singapore anticipated the seriousness of this threat and set up its Ministerial taskforce as early as January 2020 with both strategy and tactics coordinated at a high level. We have had our ups and downs in dealing with this virus, the most difficult stretch being the two-month circuit breaker, the period when the virus was spreading rapidly in our foreign worker dormitories.",16,157,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00157
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Notwithstanding the challenges, we have generally managed well and kept our fatality rate amongst the lowest in the world. We have also managed to absorb a large part of the economic impact because of the emergency financial measures we put in place – companies were supported in their payroll, rentals were reduced and managed, and workers who lost jobs or lost income were given compensation.",17,158,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00158
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Many people played a part in this process. Frontline workers kept essential services like hospitals, food supplies and transport running, parents and teachers played their part in helping with home-schooling and later the opening of schools. Today, the situation is under control again, and our journey here was enabled because of collective effort and cooperation. But the situation can change rapidly. All it takes is one or two clusters and it will spread again.",18,159,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00159
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The most important next step in this battle is the vaccination. Happily, Singapore is in a position where we have adequate supply of the vaccines coming in the course of the year.",19,160,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00160
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"According to the BBC, vaccine efficacy based on data coming in is actually quite strong, with Pfizer, Modena, even Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine all having efficacy levels of above 90%, which is a measure of how much they reduce the risk of coming down with symptoms of COVID-19. Although no vaccine has 100% efficacy, even for those people who do come down with COVID-19 symptoms after taking the vaccine, it had generally not been fatal. So, the symptoms are usually more mild. So, what this means is there is close to 100% protection against serious effects of COVID-19.",20,161,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00161
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The benefits are definitely there to the individual for taking the vaccine. But we have a slight problem in Singapore. The slight problem we have is that our community spread rates are low and most people are less afraid of getting the virus. So, a number of the people I have spoken to have suggested they would prefer to take a wait-and-see approach; there is no urgency to take it, so let other people take it first. Of course, if everyone does this, there will be a risk that our vaccination rates do not go up as quickly as we would like them to.",21,162,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00162
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Other Members in this House have spoken on how we should incentivise people to take vaccines, with Dr Lim Wee Kiak suggesting that vouchers be given out, and Mr Alex Yam suggesting it be made mandatory.",22,163,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00163
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"My suggestion is a variation on the scheme but I would suggest that what we should do is give incentives to people who take the vaccine but not monetary incentives. We should give them more liberties. So, for example, if you have a group of people who are all vaccinated, they may be allowed to meet in groups of larger than eight. Workplaces may be allowed to operate at higher than 50% occupancy if everyone who is attending in the office has taken the vaccination. So, these are sort of gentle ways to, I think, nudge people into taking the vaccine, to give them very tangible, immediate benefits.",23,164,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00164
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Ultimately, it is my hope that we will be able to get all people vaccinated as soon as possible. Vaccines can remain optional but I think if benefits are linked to it, liberties are linked to it, people will take it up more.",24,165,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00165
2021-02-26-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"It is my hope that all eligible people will take the vaccine soonest, as this will probably have the greatest impact in getting back to as close to normal as possible. Mr Speaker, in Tamil.",25,166,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00166

Last year was described to be an unprecedented year in which Singapore suffered one of the worst recessions in our nation’s history. However, when I read the real estate statistics shared by URA in January this year, I was surprised to find that prices of private properties still managed to increase by 2.2% last year. Sale of private properties by developers and in the resale market did not slow down at all despite this recession. And despite the fact that there are many unsold properties in the market, URA tells me that there are 52,783 unsold units in the market which have already obtained planning approval. Despite so many unsold units, residential property prices remain high as developers did not reduce their prices. In fact, agents tell me that some new developments which were launched recently in my constituency are priced at between $2,100 and $2,800 per square foot.",13,184,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00184

I did not believe that people could be as productive when they are in the comfort of their home, and surrounded by distractions. But what I saw during the circuit breaker period made me a convert.

2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"To get a sense from actual businesses on the ground whether working from home is here to stay, I conducted a survey of over 30 of my fellow CEOs in the private sector, ranging from large companies to SMEs. They include MNCs, law firms, architectural firms, financial institutions and manufacturing companies and so on. I asked them if working from home would be a permanent feature at their companies after the pandemic. About 58% said it would not and citing reasons such as lower productivity, majority of the staff are operational staff, lack of opportunities for building camaraderie, for not endorsing working from home. The bright spot is that the remaining 42% said they would embrace working from home in the long run and they said about 20% of their staff would likely be working from home at any one time.",9,196,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00196

2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),Indeed a report from the International Energy Agency states  “Research has shown that disruptions can be a catalyst for shifts towards more sustainable transport behaviours but avoiding a return to pre-crisis behaviours requires governments to take decisive action.”,13,200,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00200
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"In the same report, it notes that most people are shifting to cycling, in order to avoid potentially crowded buses and trains. The same is happening in Singapore, though to a lesser extent, as sales of personal bicycles go up and bike-sharing companies report an increase in ridership. An example of the Government taking decisive action would be to invest in new and improved cycling networks to make sustainable transport more attractive and safer.",14,201,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00201
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"On sustainability, I would like to move on to the topic of whether our bus services are sustainable.

2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat also informed us that out of the 356 bus services in Singapore, only 11 services were profitable in 2019. The Government had to subsidise $1 billion to operate the remaining 345 services. In 2020, only two bus services were profitable as bus ridership plunged during the pandemic. I could not be sure how much subsidy was given out in 2020, but logically, it would be over $1 billion.",16,203,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00203
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"At the same time, we have made a huge investment into the MRT network. Our current MRT network is about 230 km and MOT plans to increase the network to 360 km by 2030. In the last Budget, it was already announced that the Government would be spending more than $60 billion this decade to expand and renew the rail network. After spending so much money, it is natural to encourage more people to use the MRT for longer distance travel, which are more comfortable and efficient, instead of taking buses running parallel to the MRT lines. What do I mean?",17,204,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00204
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"The three longest bus routes in Singapore are service numbers 30, 51 and 61. Let me us service number 61 to illustrate. For service 61, the bus ride from Bukit Batok takes more than two hours, calling on 19 MRT stations in between. If you take a train from Bukit Batok to Eunos, the travelling time is only 46 minutes – 120 minutes bus ride as compared to 46 minutes train ride.",18,205,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00205
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"The above example shows that it is better for bus services to connect people to the train stations within a town, and that is for the first and last mile connection. It is more efficient to travel between towns using MRT. Thus, I would like to propose a radical idea.",19,206,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00206
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Currently, many duplicate bus services ply through the Central Business District or CBD. And yet, the CBD is well-served by the MRT. Most buildings in the CBD are within 400 metres of an MRT station. Hence, I propose that LTA consider having bus services terminate at MRT station bus stops just outside the CBD and have dedicated feeder bus services to ply within CBD, connecting all the interchange MRT stations. There are many benefits associated with this proposal.",20,207,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00207
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Firstly, we can drastically cut the number of duplicate bus services and number of buses plying within the CBD, without compromising the service level. We can even allow only electric buses to ply within CBD. This will help to reduce air pollution within the CBD and contribute to the Green Plan 2030.",21,208,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00208
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Secondly, having all existing cross-town trunk services to terminate just outside the CBD will naturally cut short the trunk services, making bus services more reliable and cheaper to run.

2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"I am sure many Members in this House have received feedback from their residents on the need to enhance bus connectivity within their respective divisions. The most common grouses among my Nanyang residents is the inconvenience of getting to the polyclinic and back home. It is not uncommon that residents have to walk a total of 700 metres plus a bus ride or change bus services to reach the polyclinic. When one is unwell, a 700-metre walk is not pleasant.",23,210,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00210
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Reforming bus routes is not new. Seoul has done it successfully, by re-organising its bus system to create safer, more comfortable and efficient rides. I am not advocating we reduce the $1 billion subsidies for the bus services. I think it is necessary to subsidise public transport just like we subsidise healthcare. I am advocating making bus services more efficient, complementing the train network and adjust to changes in transport behaviour, including the trend of working from home. The worst option is to raise public transport fares significantly to cover costs if ridership remains low.",24,211,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00211

2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Many car owners are wondering, why is the Government so eager to raise the petrol tax this year while the new incentive measures for electric vehicles will only be implemented next year?",27,214,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00214
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Moreover, there are few charging points for electric vehicles today and they can barely satisfy the existing 1,000 or so electric vehicles. This is not enough to encourage Singaporeans to buy electric vehicles. URA and LTA have already put up tenders to invite operators to install charging points to cater for 600-odd electric vehicles at more than 200 public carparks island wide. Most of the charging points will only be installed next year, in other words, water from afar cannot put out fires nearby.",28,215,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00215
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"For taxi drivers and private hire drivers, the pandemic has significantly reduced their income. The increase in petrol tax at this time is like adding frost to snow. As the Government has said, taxi and private car hire car owners will enjoy a 15% road tax rebate of up to one year and an additional $360 in a four-month period. The total rebate for these two types of rebates is about $513. For taxis that travel 400 km a day, the additional $1 per litre of petrol tax amounts to $663 additional cost a year. The rebate of $513 is not enough. Fortunately, the Government has heard the taxi drivers' appeal and announced yesterday that full-time relief taxi drivers will also enjoy the additional $360 petrol tax rebate to further reduce the impact of the petrol tax hike.",29,216,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00216
2021-02-26-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"As far as taxi drivers and private hire drivers are concerned, I would also like to mention that it is unlikely that their income will improve before the end of this year. It is because it is unlikely that tourism will recover and nightclubs will reopen within this year. The trend of working from home will continue. Hence, I urge LTA to consider extending the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund to the end of the year.",30,217,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00217

The countries have very different carbon intensities, with Indonesia accounting for more than 60%.

Many of us in this House have made our green resolutions – from metal straws to collecting rainwater to planting trees. In the Budget, the Government will partner Singaporeans and support ground-up projects. I hope, I know, our wonderful youths will pick up the baton and push the boundaries. But we cannot just preach to the converted. For the ambivalent or the sceptical, it can be hard to make climate change relevant. It can be harder still to get Singaporeans and Singapore companies to pay more to go green. We cannot simply tout statistics. We cannot simply tell people they must pay more, we cannot simply tell them to stop doing something. But we can provide a vision of a sustainable Singapore in a way that appeals to both reason and emotion. I believe that one way is through stories, poetry and literature.

Many developing countries, especially in Asia, are still industrialising – iron, steel, cement will be needed for years to come. Developed countries have been able to mitigate their emissions partly because global manufacturing has migrated to emerging markets that have invested heavily in energy, in particular, coal. The average age of coal plants in Asia is only 12 years versus a useful life of 50 years. The cost to transition is, therefore, huge. China, perhaps, can do it. But many emerging markets will need help – aid, debt assistance, technical assistance. Singapore can advocate for their voices to be heard, not to give them excuses, but to get them help from the advanced economies.

Many of my colleagues have talked about them today. The petrol duty hike is an immediate hit to their pockets when many are already struggling. One resident told me that he needed to drive the equivalent of an extra day to make up for it. The rebates help but, may I ask, for how long will this be extended for this particular segment? The duty hike comes when alternatives do not yet really exist, certainly not for this segment. Actually, I take that back. There is one alternative – e-bikes that many switched to after the PMD ban. But Mr Speaker, it was with despair that I learnt that e-bikes are being financed in the market at exorbitant interest rates. We have got to stop these predatory behaviours. It is just not fair. Further, as technology continues to accelerate, driverless cars will become a reality.

2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, we are at an important part of our nation’s recovery from one of the deepest economic downturns ever experienced, due to COVID-19.",1,305,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00305
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"While we have steadied the ship, this storm is far from over. Although the wind is still not behind our sails, we are making headway. However, we face significant headwinds when, all around us, the pandemic is still raging. Turbulent times still lay ahead on the horizon.",2,306,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00306
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In my maiden speech last year, I spoke about strengthening connections and the building blocks of our society in these uncertain times. Hence, I welcome this Budget which focuses on strengthening our people, our businesses and our reserves for the future as we emerge stronger together.",3,307,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00307
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I will be elaborating in the Committee of Supply debates but, for now, I will broadly outline three areas that we should strengthen  first, our relations with neighbouring countries; second, our social fabric as one united Singapore; and third, sustainability for our future generations.",4,308,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00308
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"The first part. The Council of Foreign Relations stated in April 2020  “Singapore, one of the world’s wealthiest and most trade-dependent countries, punches above its weight in regional and global affairs”. This does not happen overnight or by chance, but by deliberate design, decisive actions and purposeful policies over the years.",5,309,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00309
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Singapore’s economy depends heavily on trade. In times of crisis, however, some nations tend to look inwards, preferring protectionism over partnerships, sheer competition over collaborations. We cannot afford to do that. COVID-19 has reinforced how important it is for Singapore to continue to play an active role internationally and deepen our interactions with key stakeholders and other countries.",6,310,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00310
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I think that maintaining and strengthening relations with our immediate neighbours will be more critical than ever to overcome the socio-economic impact of COVID-19, particularly in ASEAN. I have two proposals here.",7,311,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00311
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"First, we should look and work towards having more travel bubbles with strategic countries as the situation improves. This promotes not only more business travels and encourage more Singaporeans to take advantage of overseas opportunities, but it would also allow the flow of people and reconnection of families who have been kept apart in this pandemic.",8,312,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00312
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Second, we have to invest in Singapore’s long-term infrastructure to prepare ourselves against future pandemics even after we see the end of this one, which may be another four to five years away. For instance, with Connect@Changi, quarantine-free business travel is made possible. It is hoped that aviation, tourism and retail businesses can benefit from it, thereby enabling gradual economic recovery.",9,313,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00313
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"The second part – strengthening our social fabric. We have started living life more normally with less restrictions, at an earlier time compared to other countries. And as we recover and adapt ourselves to a post-COVID-19 world, we have to engage and empower Singaporeans to play an even greater role in our Total Defence.",10,314,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00314
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"We should tap on our strengths as a multi-racial society. An SMU study had found that people living in more racially diverse neighbourhoods are more likely to lend a helping hand to others in need. Their surroundings made them appreciate that they are all members of a collective and broadened their sense of identity, enabling them to see others as their own.",11,315,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00315
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I am thus happy that Budget 2021 focuses on strengthening our social compact, with the expansion of ComLink, greater support for children with special needs and assistance to lower income households through various schemes.",12,316,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00316
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"There are some groups, however, that still require more targeted assistance than others.",13,317,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00317
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"First, ex-offenders, upon prison release, face not only social stigma but real struggle to obtain and retain jobs in this already harsh economic climate.",14,318,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00318
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Second, our youths are now exposed to more radicalised views and deliberate efforts of disinformation around the world. We need to actively engage them and have them invested in their stake here in Singapore.",15,319,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00319
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"And third, families, due to significant economic pressures, are more exposed to domestic violence. We must do what we can to protect vulnerable groups, like children under the age of 12 or those with mental and physical disabilities.",16,320,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00320
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I welcome the greater resources for these vulnerable groups and those facing domestic violence. Rehabilitation and reintegration efforts for ex-offenders, especially those with drug offences, must be done in concert with their families and strategic social and business partners. We can also adopt technology to tackle recidivism. For instance, a US-based app called Pokket SM, facilitates information sharing and coordination among case workers, probation officers and ex-offenders. Through connecting justice agencies and human service providers, it encourages and sustains self-sufficiency and accountability.",17,321,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00321
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"The third part of my speech is on sustainability for future generations. If COVID-19 is a crisis of a generation, then climate change is a crisis for all generations. I applaud the Government’s Green Plan 2030, particularly on agri-food technology, green financing and electric vehicles.",18,322,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00322
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Keat Hong is home to many of our local farms in Lim Chu Kang and Kranji. Hence, the $60 million fund to boost production in the agri-food sector is welcomed. I hope that this will spur adoption of technology and make our food security more resilient.",19,323,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00323
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Next, the plan to support green financing with up to $19 billion of public sector green projects is a good start.",20,324,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00324
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"The green bond market is a growing and innovative market, which has grown from US$1.5 billion in 2007 to surpassing US$100 billion in 2019. Green bonds attract a new base of investors and it can advance adoption of innovative new technologies and finance projects that provide green jobs.",21,325,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00325
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Last year, Keat Hong CC played host to a Sustainable Job Fair organised by South West CDC, SembCorp Industries and e2i. It was the first-of-its kind sustainable jobs discovery in the heartlands and part of the South West CDC’s efforts to aggregate jobs in the growing sustainability sector, such as the solar and clean energy. Many thanks to Mayor Low Yen Ling for this.",22,326,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00326
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"On green financing, I propose a public awareness campaign on the Singapore Green Plan and building strong partnerships with banks and investors in the region. Green bonds in our region, also extend to non-conventional bonds, like Green Sukuk as well.",23,327,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00327
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Lastly, on electric vehicles or EVs, as stated in my previous filed Parliamentary Question, we should not only look at the infrastructure, but also the legislation and regulatory framework to mandate possibly the installation of more EV charging stations in private residential and commercial carparks. Other possible incentives can be to lower ERP rates for EVs and, with future technology, there can be a ""progressive"" road tax model that charges vehicles not only on time spent on the roads but also on actual carbon emission.",24,328,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00328
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"On adoption of EVs, I suggest the Public Service should lead the way by having more EVs and EV charging stations in its premises.",25,329,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00329
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to say a few words in Malay before I conclude my speech.",26,330,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00330
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] This Budget aims to build on last year’s efforts. We are not yet free from this pandemic. In fact, without last year's budget and support schemes, our economic situation and employment rates this year would have been much worse, unlike the current situation. So, we are not only grateful for the effort, toil and sweat of our frontline workers, but we should also thank all segments of society who have come together to pool their energies and ideas with the Government, to face and combat this pandemic together.",27,331,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00331
2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"One of the focus areas of this Budget is to further strengthen the social compact of our country.

2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),This quatrain depicts a highly regarded Malay warrior who is seen as a beacon for those who are struggling to stay afloat or need support to survive.,29,333,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00333

Hence, I am glad that there are targeted schemes to help them. We cannot allow disappointment of laid off workers to turn to despair. Hence, we should work to reskill them. We cannot stand for vulnerable groups in our society to be devoid of hope. Hence, we should speak up for them. We cannot kick the can down the road for our children to tackle climate change. Hence, we should tackle it now for them.",31,335,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00335

2021-02-26-T-003,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"The theme of this Budget 2021 ""Emerging Stronger Together"" resonates with me.

2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mr Speaker, last year, through the four Budgets, we assisted many Singaporeans in their time of need.

2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, Singaporeans have risen up to the occasion and taken ownership and responsibility in this crisis, helping their neighbours and friends, and giving to those who need it more than themselves. I believe that COVID-19 has shown the world the best of Singapore and how we have stood together to overcome. The pandemic has revealed our common humanity. It is with this spirit – of a common humanity and our common identity as Singaporeans – that I wish to speak today.",3,341,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00341
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"My first point is how we should strive towards becoming one united Singaporean family. Multi-culturalism is a significant ingredient in our Singapore tapestry. Unity does not mean homogeneity. In fact, as we continue to embrace multi-culturalism and diversity, and the more we understand the differences and the richness of each culture, the tighter our social fabric becomes.",4,342,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00342
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We do value the diversity in our ethnic heritages. The self-help groups, such as CDAC, SINDA, Mendaki and the Eurasian Association, play important roles in keeping ethnic heritages alive in modern day Singapore. It shows that we value the different cultures inherent in our society and aid each subsequent generation to become familiar with the traditions and outlook of each ethnic group. These self-help groups help their individual communities while also carrying out joint inter-racial events. This helps foster both the bonds within each individual community and also the bonds in the larger Singaporean context.",5,343,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00343
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),Another example is the Ethnic Integration Programme within HDB estates. I support this as it is in line with the spirit of enhancing ties between people of various ethnic backgrounds who become neighbours and who then share common environments.,6,344,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00344
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I believe that as we continue to strengthen and understand different ethnic communities, and as our diverse culture and heritage become more and more a part of Singapore, race will become less and less a factor in evaluating a person. In fact, I would dare say that race matters less in the minds of Singaporeans, especially those who are younger, in comparison to their nationality, than that of being Singaporean. I think the identity marker in my age group of Singaporeans and younger is  Singaporean first, and ethnicity second.",7,345,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00345
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"But what does that mean for politics? I think that means that when choosing a candidate to lead the Government, the choice must be the best man for the job, regardless of race. Instead of being evaluated based on race, we can evaluate based on more robust factors, such as the person’s character, abilities, values and experience. Politics is about leadership. In my personal view, ceteris paribus, when it comes to leading the Government, I think it should be the best man for the job, regardless of race.",8,346,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00346
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, if there is a Singaporean Chinese candidate of the right age and with the right character and the right skillset making him the best man for the job, he should be chosen for the job. If there is a Singaporean of a minority race of the right age and with the right character and right skillset to be the best man for the job, I think he should be chosen for the job.",9,347,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00347
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Leadership within the Government comes with years of experience and years of being an elected Member within this House. It could easily be 20 years before an elected Member becomes a Prime Minister and, by that time, the familiarity and connection that people would have with the Minister would count for more than just his race. COVID-19 has shown, more than ever, the need for good government and good leadership of and in government.",10,348,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00348
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I know many people my age and younger do want the best man to lead the Government, regardless of race. Some may say I am being overly idealistic, to the discount of pragmatism. I beg to differ. Why? Because the very idea of a multiracial, multicultural Singapore was an ideal, an aspiration, born, literally, from the tears and the sweat of our founding fathers. And inch by inch, year by year, we grow closer to making it a reality. Are we there yet? I believe we have some way to go. But my wish for Singapore is that, one day – perhaps when deciding the 5G or 6G Prime Minister – race is not used as a trump card or a disqualifying criterion. We are too small a nation to discount a man based on his race. This is my view, based on my personal belief.",11,349,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00349
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mr Speaker, I hope this House can understand the point I am getting at. I am not saying race is not important. Neither am I saying race should be used to dichotomise and polarise. I am firmly of the view that multi-racial Singapore is important and we should not dilute the significance of race and what it can bring to the table. In fact, it brings such a rich tapestry such that many parts of the world can see themselves in us, in Singapore.",12,350,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00350
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"But when it comes to leadership of government, we should not discount anybody because of their race, but instead evaluate the candidate based on who is best for the job. I hold this belief. I know many in my age group and younger hold this belief firmly too. Maybe this will happen in 15 to 20 years' time when the party holding the majority of the House chooses the 5G or 6G Prime Minister of who the 5G or 6G Prime Minister should be. However, it being 20 years away should not deter us from having such conversations now.",13,351,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00351
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I do not want any room for my speech to be misinterpreted. So, let me say categorically that I do believe that our Prime Minister is the best man for the job. And I also do believe that the 4G Ministers have chosen the best man for the job to eventually lead their team. So, nothing in my speech should distract from those conclusions.",14,352,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00352
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The point I am making in this speech is that it should be the best man for the job regardless of race, or dare I say the best person for the job regardless of race, for I do not see why a woman with outstanding leadership ability should be discounted.

2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),I mean this personally. It comes from deep within and I would like to share a story that speaks to the heart of these beliefs of mine. My wife and I have four children aged between one and 12 years old. Our second daughter was adopted. Her ethnic lineage is pure Chinese and we adopted her at birth in Singapore.,18,356,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00356
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"What happened was that there was a young Singaporean Chinese woman who found out she was pregnant. She decided to carry on with her pregnancy, delivered the baby and put the baby up for adoption. She got in touch with a Christian charity who helped place babies with adoptive families. My wife and I had put our names down with the charity as potential adoptive parents. And then, we received the phone call. My wife and I prayed about it and took the leap of faith in adopting this little Singaporean Chinese baby girl. Today, my daughter is completely part of our family. She is the younger sister to our first daughter and dotes on her two younger siblings. All our children are loved and treated equally, and are being brought up first and foremost as Singaporeans first; and secondly, as Singaporean Eurasians.",19,357,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00357
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, what then is race? If it is merely defined by virtue of blood lineage, our second daughter would be Chinese. But if it was also defined by culture, then living experience would play a part too. My second daughter put up the Chinese New Year decorations made up of hongbaos around our house this year. But during the Christmas season, she would eat all the Eurasian fare on the dining table, including sugee cake and even ask for seconds. To pre-empt her wondering why she looked a little different from her older sister, my wife and I told her when she was very young, ""You came from your tummy mummy; but you were born in our hearts.""",20,358,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00358
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),It is the same way I view Singapore – we are all given life from our mother's wombs but we are all born with Singapore in our hearts.,21,359,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00359
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, when I say being Singaporean is the pre-eminent identity marker of a citizen and that race is a secondary identity marker, I believe that firmly. There is no binary lens with which one should view race such that race completely does not matter or always matters to the discount of everything else. It is a spectrum – a spectrum that is a continuum within which my daughter, of Singaporean Chinese lineage and living in a Singaporean Eurasian home, is completely comfortable. Race is an asset to make the tapestry of Singapore culture richer and our identity fuller. So, let it not divide us but unite us in always choosing the right person to lead our Government.",22,360,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00360
2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The next point I want to make relates to adoption, a point which I have shared, I care deeply about. If we can create an environment in which couples who are unable to have their own children but who would love to have children and want to adopt can be placed in touch with the database of prospective mothers in Singapore, wanting to offer their babies for adoption, this would benefit both parties. But for this to happen, the pregnant women must be told of this option. I have had discussions with MSF over many years and I hope they will close the loop with me and inform me how the counselling for pregnant women, to ensure that they are aware that adoption is a good and feasible option, has improved.",23,361,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00361

2021-02-26-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"But there is a particular group of vulnerable people who are not afforded the same protection that other citizens have. These are the stateless people living in Singapore. They do not vote but they, too, need a voice in Parliament. Many have grown up in Singapore and many were even born in Singapore. They live here, work here and have families here. Yet, because their parents failed to register their birth at the time of their birth, some are denied citizenship and live their lives as stateless people. This impacts them in their daily life as some struggle to open bank accounts, buy or rent houses and even find a job. Such difficulties present a very real challenge for them. It leaves them in the lurch and vulnerable.",25,363,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00363

We have something precious here in Singapore. First and foremost, our people. Secondly, our Government working with the people, like a formidable aerobatics team weathering the storm in tight formation. The pandemic has not deterred Singapore's determination to build a better future for our children. The Jewel still stands at Changi Airport. Olive trees still grow on the equator at Gardens by the Bay. And we are not done turning a mudflat into a thriving metropolis.",27,365,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00365

COVID-19 has caused the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression. Globally, real GDP is estimated to have fallen by 3.5% in 2020, equivalent to a drop of close to US$ 5 trillion dollars in economic output. Many countries experienced full-year recessions in 2020. Sectors like aviation and tourism felt the brunt of the impact, with 1 billion fewer international arrivals in 2020 – a 74% drop.",18,385,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00385
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Labour markets were disrupted on an unprecedented scale, with 8.8% of global working hours lost relative to the fourth quarter of 2019.

Economists also warn of possible scarring, with long-term GDP losses, rising public and corporate debt, higher hurdles on capital spending, and continued rise in unemployment levels.",19,386,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00386
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"We disbursed a total of $27.4 billion in grants to provide relief, preserve jobs and help firms build capabilities to pivot to new growth areas – more than 18 times the amount disbursed in 2019. As many Members including Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Desmond Choo thoughtfully reminded us, we narrowly averted a much deeper recession and scarring. Our fiscal and monetary policy measures are estimated to have prevented a further 6.6 percentage points in GDP contraction last year, and mitigated the rise in resident unemployment rates by two percentage points – or about 155,000 jobs.",20,387,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00387

More details of our early findings can be found in the interim assessment of the COVID-19 measures that MOF released earlier this year.",21,388,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00388
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),The impulses from last year's measures continue to flow through the economy to complement Budget 2021.

2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"We tilted support towards the hardest-hit sectors to help them retain core capabilities and prepare for recovery. Today, some of these sectors are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. For example, with the phased resumption of activities domestically since June 2020, the consumer-facing sectors, including retail and food services, saw a gradual recovery to around 85% of pre-COVID-19 output levels by Q4 in 2020. Many firms have made good use of the support we rolled out.",23,390,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00390

Almost all recipients were micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs. Enterprise Singapore also supported more than 15,000 companies in raising productivity, going international and undertaking innovation projects. This is 54% more than in 2019. So, I am glad businesses were taking innovation more seriously during this COVID-19 period.",24,391,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00391

Based on preliminary estimates, mature workers aged 40 and above accounted for about half of the first 110,000 JGI beneficiaries, and about half of the 76,000 locals placed in SGUnited jobs and skills opportunities. This includes more than 8,000 mature jobseekers placed last year on career conversion programmes, like the TechSkills Accelerator and Professional Conversion Programmes, or PCPs. These schemes enable trainees to reskill for jobs with good growth prospects.

When the crisis hit, we layered on temporary assistance on top of some of these permanent schemes to provide additional support to vulnerable groups. We also introduced new measures like the Solidarity Payment and Care and Support – Cash to provide quick relief for Singaporeans' day-to-day expenses, and with the lower income receiving more. Finally, for those whose livelihoods were disrupted, we stepped in to provide some bridging support as they picked themselves up, for example, through the COVID-19 Support Grant and Temporary Relief Fund.",110,477,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00477

He was quoting a particular report. We are fully aware that there are families who have been deeply impacted by the pandemic, and some more than others. This is exactly why we have tilted our support significantly towards the lower income and vulnerable groups, and Government has partnered the community to reach out to those groups during this period. Mr Singh himself noted that there was and I quote, ""not-insignificant"" support. So, you have to see the support in totality – the full set of support – and not conclude from one sample because these are rigorous study of what his happening throughout Singapore.",112,479,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00479

Even in land-scarce Singapore, you can see in this chart [Please refer to Annex 3.], our housing prices are lower than those of many major international cities, even before accounting for grants. We provide housing subsidies to keep HDB flats affordable. The current income ceiling of $14,000 allows eight in 10 Singaporeans to buy a subsidised HDB flat. As a result of our housing policies, around 80% of new HDB flat buyers have little or no cash outlay on their mortgage payments, meaning they do not have to come up with cash, or little cash, for their mortgage payments; and nine in 10 Singaporean households own their homes. Our homes may not be the largest or the cheapest, but we definitely have well-built, affordable housing options, in a safe, secure and green environment.",123,490,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00490
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Next, we have strong support for couples who want to raise a family. Miss Cheng Li Hui and Ms Hany Soh asked for more to be done to support parenthood and first-time parents. Over the years, the Government has strengthened support for families with children, to defray the cost of education and childcare, through a combination of broad-based grants, subsidies and tax benefits. Upon the birth of their child, a Singaporean family would receive up to $35,000 in cash and cash-like benefits, through the Baby Bonus and other benefits. This includes a $4,000 MediSave grant which covers the child’s MediShield Life premiums from birth till age 21. Every Singaporean child can also receive over $180,000 in education subsidies by the time he or she turns 16, including pre-school subsidies.",124,491,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00491

I thank Minister of State Sun Xueling, Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam and the other women Members for speaking on the different ways that the Government, businesses and the community can support women to fulfil their aspirations and help them to better support their families. These include job opportunities, support for their jobs and livelihoods, re-designing jobs for more progressive workplaces, encouraging higher technology adoption amongst women, and support for care-giving. These are good points which we can continue to work together.",125,492,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00492

The Silver Support Scheme provides support for our seniors who had low incomes during their working years and need additional support in retirement. Over the next five years, to help more Singaporeans meet the Basic Retirement Sum, we will also be providing an additional boost through the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme. We are also in a fortunate position where most of our seniors have housing assets which they could use to support their retirement, if they choose to.",127,494,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00494
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Last but not least, the Government provides good and affordable healthcare to all Singaporeans, especially our seniors. We have been investing in our healthcare system, to meet the needs of an ageing population. We have almost tripled our healthcare spending, from $3.9 billion in 2011 to $11.3 billion in FY2019. This went into expanding healthcare capacity and enhancing healthcare subsidies. We now spend more than twice the amount on patient subsidies than we did 10 years ago and expect to spend more as our population ages. On average, a Singaporean can expect to receive about $200,000 in Government healthcare subsidies throughout their lifetime.",128,495,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00495

I thank Dr Tan Yia Swam who has registered her confidence and, I quote  ""I am confident that our healthcare system is robust and can provide adequate care for all citizens"". Indeed, Singapore ranks amongst the top for the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, which measures the ability of a child to reach his or her full potential if they had full health and complete, high-quality education. We also do well in the Bloomberg Health-Efficiency Index, which measures life expectancy as compared to medical spending. In 2019, our average life expectancy at birth was 84.9 years, with health-adjusted life expectancy of 74.5 years. Globally, Singaporeans are expected to live the longest!",129,496,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00496

A young couple buying a HDB flat near their parents could benefit from more than $134,000 in support in this year alone. Besides housing grants, the support includes pre-school subsidies to help with the education of their child, healthcare subsidies, and also offsets for expenses through the Household Support Package.",130,497,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00497

The family could receive over $35,000 in support this year in education and healthcare subsidies, including $1,200 from the Household Support Package. And these are over and above the housing subsidies that the family would have enjoyed when it first bought the flat. Neither family needs to pay their MediShield Life and CareShield Life premium in cash. No one will lose coverage due to inability to pay.",131,498,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00498

But it is important for all of us to appreciate what is already there, and to see the Budget in totality, over the years. Individual Budget measures are useful enhancements which sit on top of our already significant social spending. Over the past decade, we have been gradually tilting the tax and transfer system in favour of lower and middle income groups. On average, lower income citizen households can expect to receive benefits, net of taxes, of $6,500 per household member in 2021. Members of middle income households can expect to receive $3,500 in 2021.

As I have said in the Budget Statement, there are good, meaningful jobs in healthcare for our locals, and it is important to pay them the salary that they deserve – commensurate with the work that they do.

A capital-intensive economy open to investment and trade can have lower wage shares than labour-intensive economies. For example, in the biomedical sector, the wage share of the sector’s output is less than 6% compared to over 60% in the accommodation and food services sectors. But workers in the biomedical sector earn more than twice that of the accommodation and food services sector. So, what will improve the lives of our workers are better wages and better prospects, not the aggregate share.

In addition, interest rates are low, in fact, ultra low for now, but this may change quickly.

Just last year, we saw extreme capital flow volatility in global financial markets due to the uncertainties and risk sentiments associated with the pandemic. MAS kept the Singapore dollar nominal exchange rate stable during this period backed by the full power of our reserves, giving banks and businesses certainty to make decisions under very trying circumstances.",283,650,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00650

Mr Lee was invited by several countries in the region to share his views, as Singapore was relatively unscathed. I sat in all his meetings. It was very painful to see how speculation and the currency volatilities that these countries face was destroying businesses, big and small, and the lives of men and women in these places. The exchange rate is far more important for a small open economy like ours compared to our neighbouring countries. And if our neighbouring countries are so badly affected during the Asian Financial Crisis, you can imagine the impact on us.",284,651,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00651

The Parliament Budget Office or the Parliamentary Budget Office is not an unusual institution in many parliamentary democracies.

It is about a multi-year programme. And in my speech, I asked Deputy Prime Minister Heng – for which I do not believe a clarification was forthcoming – about the headline $24 billion figure which is a multi-year initiative, questions about the accountability of this figure, how are we going to look back at this figure and say that money has been spent prudently?",5,697,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00697

I believe I had some questions about it and fundamentally again, the Minister committed until 2024, I believe. And I had some questions about how many Singaporeans were trained?

So, I am not asking in advance what Assoc Prof Jamus Lim is going to say. That, of course, he will do in the Committee of Supply. But I am just asking and I am sure the Leader of the Opposition must know this  is the office that he is asking to be set up the same thing as what his colleague is going to ask for, or are they both asking for two separate things? That is all I want to know.",1,710,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00710

But before I answer his specific questions, let me repeat what I said right at the beginning of this debate.",1,713,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00713
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I said over the last few days, passionate debate went along a few threads. Some Members elevated the debate to help Singaporeans appreciate the changing landscape and the need to change. Some Members highlighted importance of our reserves – the bold and decisive response mounted and what it achieved. Unfortunately, some argue selectively without acknowledging the broader context, broader impact of COVID-19 and the outcomes of the Government's decisive interventions.",2,714,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00714
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, Mr Singh said earlier that we should set up such an office because it is important to examine outcomes. He had an encounter with a Ministry of Finance official who say that, ""I am not smarter than my boss"". Your arguments are totally convoluted. One does not lead to the other.",3,715,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00715
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"If you are focused on the outcome, may I ask if Mr Singh and the Workers' Party Members have read the interim report which I have put out in the Ministry of Finance website, widely reported in the papers, on what the measures have achieved? There is a reason why I put out the interim report, even though the full effects have not been done. Because I am conscious we have used a big part of last year's Budget, we have used the past reserves and that I have a responsibility to account for those outcomes. And I put those outcomes.",4,716,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00716
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, the Member talked about assessing outcomes. That is our biggest spending. Does the Workers' Party have any comment on that?

2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, what is the purpose of setting up an office when, with information that is publicly available is there for you to ask?",6,718,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00718

2021-02-26-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Sir, this is essentially a question, as I mentioned in my first intervention about Organs of State. You have the Ministry of Finance, you have Political Office Holders who drive the agenda of that Ministry and you have a parliamentary platform where the proposed Parliament Budget Officer will sit. Two different functions completely independent of what Government is saying about the outcomes, because that is an independent perspective and that is something for Parliament who is going to approve the Budget. Those who are approving the Budget ought to have access to an independent analysis. And that is what the Parliament Budget Officer will give.",1,720,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00720

2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"But let me just ask for the Workers' Party to be clear about what is it that you are proposing; and second, I am asking you a very simple question. Have you or any of your Workers' Party Members scrutinised that interim report and have questions for us?",2,722,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00722
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"But instead, in talking about outcome, what you have asked us just now, you raised the issue about, what about the Capability Transfer Programme which MOM is going to do in 2024?

This Budget debate is a serious debate about whether our broad direction is correct. Do you have suggestions on how we can do it better? I am open to your ideas. But I have to say, unfortunately, so far, I have heard none.",4,724,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00724

I am not sure another Member has capacity than to ask me about a matter I have not spoken about. So, just as a point of order, I think we should make that clear.

2021-02-26-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Aljunied),"The first is one where I raised that the Government cash surplus from 2011 to 2019, that is about $261 billion or about $29 billion of cash surplus a year. I understand that the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned that the land sales revenue would form a key part of it. Based on what I could see, that would be about a $138 billion within the same time period or about $15 billion. So, in the spirit of accountability, just so all of us can better understand, where did the balance of $14 billion of cash surplus come from?",2,729,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00729
2021-02-26-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Aljunied),"And I understand the need for us to be prudent about the use of land sales and this is something which I understand, but I think it is not one where we are calling for the use of land sales revenue in its entirety. It is one whereby, if you look at the incentives to using land sales revenue, they already exist today, but probably in a different extent. And I think it is also important, I guess, for me to share that —",3,730,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00730
2021-02-26-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Aljunied),"Sorry, so, what I mean is that the incentives for using land sales as a means to increase revenue. I think that is something that is already done indirectly and so that is already in place although to a different extent.",4,731,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00731
2021-02-26-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Aljunied),"But I think the broader point that I also would like to share, is in the context of Singapore, when it comes to land sales, it is something which I believe is a recurring source of revenue for the Government as well. That is the first clarification.",5,732,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00732
2021-02-26-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Aljunied),"The second is, there has been a lot of talk about our reserves. Just now Deputy Prime Minister mentioned that is about 20 years of surplus. Yesterday, a different Member shared that we have blown about 10 years' worth of savings. And I think earlier today, a separate Member also asked how long do we need before we can replenish our reserves.",6,733,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00733
2021-02-26-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Aljunied),"So, probably it will be helpful for Members of this House to understand, after accounting for the additional $11 billion of the draw at the end of FY2021, where would our reserves be? I mean, we do not need to know an absolute number, but where would our reserves be compared to 10 years ago, five years ago. That also helps us to understand the context, but without knowing the absolute amount of the reserves itself.",7,734,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00734
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On the technical question that Mr Louis Chua asked about, what constitute the other big part, well, one bit which, as the Member has pointed out, is the land sales; and the other part, a big chunk of it, is the NIRC. The NIRC is already being used. [",1,735,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00735
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On the second point about land sales, and that there is an incentive for the Government to use land sales because the revenues are already done indirectly, that is wrong. I said very clearly that when we do land sales, it is to meet the needs for our people, for our economy. You cannot plan land sales on the basis that we need the revenue, and therefore, I would have to do that. The land sale proceeds, they go into the past reserves.",2,736,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00736
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I totally reject your allegation that the Government has an incentive to sell more land in order to generate revenue. If the Government had an incentive, I would not have pointed out the problems in many countries. I have studied this in many countries where unfortunately, where the government, especially the local government, is so reliant on land sales that they have a vested interest to keep land prices high because they need the revenue, and, in turn, that creates a lot of hardship for the people.",3,737,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00737
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, our system cannot incentivise it. URA has long-term plans – 50-year plans, 20-year plans. The land use planning has been a great strength of Singapore. I think you should seriously look at what the agencies have been doing and do not make allegations like these. Because I think it will demoralise the many good officers that we have in our planning departments, in URA and the Ministry of National Development, who have over the years, allowed for so much development in so compact a land.",4,738,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00738

2021-02-26-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I thank the Deputy Prime Minister. I would just like to share that I did not make the allegation. Basically, what I was trying to get at is that if you look at the context of Singapore, the land sales revenue, I think that is a recurrent source of revenue for the Government over a period of time. I am actually not belittling the work of our MND and the good officers of the URA. I think that is something that they have done well in terms of the concept plan and the master plan.",1,741,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00741

2021-02-26-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Earlier, in his wrap-up, the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned the point that I made about nurses and healthcare workers and how I was very supportive of the decision to enhance their salaries and to review their salaries. I also made another point beyond that, which was to say that, I believe, it is not just about salaries; there are other factors that perhaps we could look at in terms of enhancing careers, mid-career conversions, perhaps in improving the work-life balance. I even suggested a bit of a radical idea, like paid holidays or mandatory leave that nurses and healthcare workers need to take to encourage them to step back from the frontline.",2,747,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00747
2021-02-26-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),The Deputy Prime Minister did not quite address this in his speech and I wanted to ask if it is something that the Government can actually consider beyond the salaries and the financial aspects of a nursing career.,3,748,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00748

I said, I sound a word of caution about soft capital. Precisely because it is soft, it can morph into various shapes.

I devoted more than two pages of my reply to you on that, about the size of currency trading, about my experience in MAS during the Global Financial Crisis, about my experience when I was accompanying Mr Lee Kuan Yew to the countries which were so badly hit by the Asian Financial Crisis.

2021-02-26-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I think one of the reasons we are quite comfortable to borrow now, with fairly large reserves behind us, is because we are quietly confident that in the long term, our rate of return from our reserves is going to exceed the cost of borrowing. Because when the Government of the Republic of Singapore goes out to borrow, there is a premium. The cost of debt is significantly lower than others.

I do not think he will mind me mentioning his name. Mr Das worked with Dr Goh Keng Swee in the 1960s and 1970s. So, I asked Mr Das, ""During your time, did you go out to borrow?"" And he said ""Once""; only once but for a different reason. And that was because Dr Goh saw a project, he was not entirely convinced that it was feasible and he gave instructions to the staff, ""Go out to an external third party financial institution and get a second opinion and see whether they lend us"".

2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"One is that for our SINGA Bonds, which is about borrowing for our infrastructure, the significant national infrastructure, we are borrowing because we are now coming to another hump in our development expenditure.",2,796,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00796
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In the early years, did we borrow? Yes, we did borrow when we were building the first MRT and our airports. And, again, that was another big hump. So, the nature of infrastructure project is such that you need to build it over the next two, three years, but the benefits of that project should last us several generations.",3,797,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00797
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, therefore, how do we spread out the borrowing? First, do we build or do we not build? Just because we do not have the resources to build it now, do we forego it? We must build it only if it gives you economic or social return. The projects that we did for our MRT lines, for our airport, give us both the economic and social returns, and therefore we can justify why we are doing it.",4,798,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00798

2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Then, the next question is how do I fund it? There are several ways. One is, could you go and use the past reserve for that? It is not because the reserves are used for extraordinary and temporary situation. It is spelt out in our Constitution.",6,800,2021-02-26-T-003-S-00800
2021-02-26-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, why are we borrowing? Well, I mentioned before that there are several reasons. One, that it is fair for inter-generational equity, because you spread out the cost of borrowing, because various generations are going to benefit from that. Second, at this point, it is efficient because interest rates are very low and ultra-low.

Recently, though, NETS has pushed out their new contactless card with similar operating principles for contactless cards as international scheme debit cards. This has led to some worries among the elderly. While contactless payment has made payments easy, senior citizens are more vulnerable to scams. The spike in bank account debit and credit-card scams in recent years has also made the elderly concerned over losing their hard-earned money in these scams. One of my elderly residents was told by DBS that all new cards will be contactless and they will not allow any card requiring PIN for all transactions.

It presents a range of internationally accepted standards which companies are encouraged to choose and follow, but are not mandatory. This has resulted in inconsistencies in reporting methods, quality in data disclosure and, hence, rendering the reports ineffective due to lack of comparability amongst the listed companies. It could also lead to greenwashing. According to an NUS study done in 2019 on sustainability reporting, there are clear differences in the sustainability reporting performance among different industries.",1,912,2021-02-26-T-006-S-00912

Ms Sylvia Lim asked if banks can work with the Police for more expeditious return of monies belonging to victims of scams. This is, indeed, a concern, especially when scam cases are on an uptrend. The banks have various measures to protect consumers. There are various caps, daily transaction limits, ATM withdrawal limits, contactless payment limits.",3,918,2021-02-26-T-006-S-00918

The cooling-off period applies more in circumstances where you buy something and you find that it was an impulsive buy, you return it and you get your refund. But for day-to-day transactions, I think there are serious practical limits to impose a cooling-off limit. But I think the most important safeguard is to practise good cyber hygiene and take personal precautions.",4,919,2021-02-26-T-006-S-00919

The Anti-Scam Centre under the Police, works closely with banks to freeze the bank accounts of recipients of scam monies to enable police investigations. However, once prosecution commences, it will be the Courts that decide when the seized monies can be returned, depending on factors, such as whether seized monies remain relevant for the purposes of investigation or trial.

In 2020, despite the economic recession, the number of policies surrendered hit a five-year low of 153,000, representing 0.9% of total in-force policies.

2021-02-26-T-006,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, let me state at the outset we cannot be dogmatic about this. We are promoting e-payments because it is efficient, convenient and green, but we are not aiming to be a cashless society. Cash will continue to be a familiar and convenient way to transact, as Ms Jessica Tan has experienced. The adoption of e-payments by Singaporeans has been steadily increasing in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of e-commerce have accelerated this trend.",13,928,2021-02-26-T-006-S-00928

Registrations for PayNow Corporate doubled last year to around 240,000 business users. This means that 80% of residents and businesses are now on PayNow. This has driven PayNow transaction volumes to over $5 billion for the month of December 2020, which is double the volume a year ago. We expect this growth to continue, as users can now also send and receive PayNow transfers via non-bank e-wallets, such as GrabPay and Singtel Dash.",14,929,2021-02-26-T-006-S-00929

There are 200,000 SGQR labels islandwide, with 120,000 deployed in 2020 alone. And as more people switch from cash to e-payments for their day-to-day transactions, the usage of cheques has fallen. The ratio of cheque volumes relative to e-payment volumes has dropped from 32% in 2016 to 18% in 2019 and then 12% last year.

These ratios should decline further as more people get used to accepting e-payments.

In the coming years, we will need to work very hard with the industry and all our partners, to build environmental risk resilience into the financial system, of which, quality disclosures play an important part; expand green finance solutions and markets; and leverage innovation and technology.

Our TFR has been below replacement level for years. In 2020, our TFR was 1.10, which is a historic low. We are in a similar predicament as East Asian societies like South Korea and Taiwan, and Scandinavian countries known for achieving good fertility outcomes, like Finland and Norway. They also experienced a drop in TFR, and some are at historic lows too.

This is consistent with findings from the latest National Population and Talent Division's Marriage and Parenthood Survey, where over 80% of single respondents aged 21 to 35 said they wanted to get married, and 92% of married respondents in the same age group wanted at least two children. In the last five years, or 2016-2020, the average number of citizen births also increased compared to the previous five-year period of 2011-2015.

Currently, the support from Government to parents for their second child is the same as their first. We reviewed this and will provide more support for couples having their second child. We will double the maximum dollar-for-dollar Government co-matching of parents' savings in the Child Development Account (CDA) for the second child, from $3,000 to $6,000.

Corruption is under control in Singapore but we must never be complacent. The findings from CPIB's 2020 Public Perception Survey saw strong public confidence in our national anti-corruption efforts, with the following cited as the top three success factors contributing to the low corruption rate in Singapore  first, the political determination to keep corruption at bay; second, the heavy punishments; and third, the anti-corruption laws that are effective.",2,1085,2021-02-26-T-006-S-01085

And that is, our reputation as a clean and corruption-free country is hard-won and is not something that we take for granted. Looking at our history, we know that such things may happen now and then, involving all strata of society. But regardless of who is involved, which organisation is involved, nobody will be above the law and CPIB, together with the rest of the enforcement agencies will get to the bottom of each and every case, because the reputation of Singapore, the kind of values that we exhibit must be above all other considerations.

It would be useful for these Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) to publish these comparisons in the analysis for the reasons for better assessment of their performance. In fact, it would be useful for the Government in the form of MOF to understand these comparisons in some detail.",7,1147,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01147
2021-02-26-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"With that said, I would like to ask how does the MOF itself assess that the SWFs Boards and management have done a reasonable job in terms of returns. What internal metrics, indices and benchmarks and processes are used?",8,1148,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01148
2021-02-26-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the case of Temasek, the MSCI is used as a reference. As I understand it, Temasek also sets its own hurdle rate at a risk adjusted cost of capital that its market value TSR has under-performed on the one, three, 10 and 20-year periods, as of March 2020. It has argued that its under-performance relative to the risk adjusted cost of capital is because it is making a systemic shift to build resilience for the future. I would like to ask does the Government have clarity on the transformation Temasek is undertaking and why they think the future rate of return will outperform the current rate of return on these new investment strategies?",9,1149,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01149
2021-02-26-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Last cut on reserve spending. Mr Chairman, the reserves consist of various classes of assets held by Temasek, GIC and the MAS, if we are to exclude land banks.",10,1150,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01150
2021-02-26-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"During typical economic crises some asset value such as equities may fall on the whole. This is fairly typical. If a result draw-down is financed by liquidating assets in a time of crisis, this may not necessarily be advantageous for Singapore since it may mean selling fundamentally good assets, such as shares and good blue chip companies, for example, at low prices rather than hanging on to those assets to realise future value when the economy recovers.",11,1151,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01151
2021-02-26-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, if the reserves draw-down is financed by borrowing against the collateral of the reserves, that may in some circumstances prove to be more advantages to Singapore, especially given that interest rates may be lower in a time of global economic crisis as central banks slash the cost of credit to financial institutions as they often do. Or is the first line of execution for reserves draw-down utilising cash or cash equivalents held by the MAS or other institutions?",12,1152,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01152
2021-02-26-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Hence, I would like to use this cut to ask the Government what is the operating principle that determines how reserves draw-downs are financed and executed with these considerations and questions in mind?",13,1153,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01153
2021-02-26-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"And in conclusion, I just like to add that I am aware that during the COVID-19 period, some sectors and some stock exchanges and market indices actually rose. In that sense, this crisis has been atypical. My comments earlier referred to more typical global economic crisis.",14,1154,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01154

This can reduce long tail costs.",1,1155,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01155
2021-02-26-T-007,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"For example, designing upstream and investing in an organic waste conveyance system cum digester as part of building or district. Organic waste is transported through a system of pipes to an onsite digester which could up-cycle waste into useful products. Such a system reduces overall cleaning and haulage cost due to lesser need for point-to-point transportation, allowing for a reduction in carbon footprint too.

The scheme was off to a good start, but it will need Government’s support to give it a boost in usage. The key challenge based on feedback from my residents is in navigating the various participating websites to look for something of interest.

2021-02-26-T-007,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,"Sir, there is much demand for the Government to enable local businesses to leverage publicly developed infrastructure and capabilities to catalyse development of industry’s eco-system. This is especially relevant with respect to datasets and applications specific to Singapore as part of our digitalisation efforts.

However, there are significant number of private companies compared to listed ones. The latter which already have sustainability reporting requirements. Private companies can provide the added impetus for our Green Plan and gender diversity aims. We can strike a good balance by limiting to companies above a certain level of turnover or manpower size.",3,1168,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01168

Given the rising prices of private property, 12% is no small amount, even though this could be remitted for married couples once they sell their first residential property within the specified timeline. This experience is different for a HDB owner who upgrades to an Executive Condominium (EC) or even buying another larger HDB unit. The Government grants semi-automatic ABSD remission providing them six months after collecting the keys to sell the flat.",3,1177,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01177
2021-02-26-T-007,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mr Chairman, this remission reduces the pressure of having to pay the ABSD in a short span of 14 days, a relief the HDB owners transitioning to private properties do not enjoy. I would like to ask if there is any rationale behind the absence of remission for a HDB to private property automatically, as a compared to HDB or EC upgraders.

And so, by taking this approach, we expect to bring about savings of 2% to 5% in total life-cycle costs over the long-term, which is a significant sum given that we spend about $15 billion to $20 billion every year on capital expenditure alone.",22,1207,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01207

Indeed, when coming up with support schemes, agencies do make full use of a whole range of tools. They considered the possibilities of fraud and unintended beneficiaries upfront in scheme designs. They deployed various monitoring mechanism and safeguards, at pre-disbursement and post-disbursement stages, to ensure that funds are disbursed to the appropriate beneficiaries.",23,1208,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01208

The priority then was to ensure that all firms received timely support, so that they could focus on retaining their workers and sustaining their operations. The JSS was implemented as a broad-based scheme then, without the need for onerous applications. This was especially helpful for SMEs.",24,1209,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01209

For Tier 2 sectors like land transport and retail, we extended by three months. For sectors that remain hard hit, we also introduced additional targeted measures like the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers to stimulate domestic tourism, and extended sector-specific support like the Aviation, Point-to-Point Support Packages and the Arts and Culture Resilience Package.",26,1211,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01211

For example, MOF has published its interim assessment of the initial effects of the Government's measures to reduce business costs, save jobs and support families. Preliminary data suggests that the Jobs Support Scheme has reduced job losses in vulnerable firms, while loan schemes have supported over 20,000 firms in accessing loans.",27,1212,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01212

As a result, GIC has undertaken pre-emptive measures to reduce portfolio risks. Nevertheless, despite reducing its risk exposure, GIC's returns on its portfolio, compared to a reference portfolio comprising 65% equities and 35% bonds; GIC's performance, despite a reduced risk, has been equal, if not better, than the reference portfolio.

2021-02-26-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I was talking about dealing with the issue of the execution of the spending of reserves. So, in terms of our fiscal framework, we have clear rules on what constitutes a draw on past reserves, but where the Government obtains the cash to pay for expenditures is a different matter. That is part of the Government's overall cash flow management. It is an operational issue and is separate from the budgeting process.",2,1230,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01230
2021-02-26-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For purposes of cash flow management, the Government has a range of liquidity sources it can tap on, and this would include tax revenues which come in at different times of the year, funds raised outside the Budget, like proceeds from land sales. Constitutionally they do not contribute to the Budget and do not count as Government revenues, but they are part of the cash flow that the Government receives. It also includes Government deposits which we can draw on for purposes of cash flow reasons.",3,1231,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01231

2021-02-26-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Only one exception is made, namely that is for Singaporean married couples. A Singaporean married couple may need to change homes due to changing family needs, such as when they have children, when their children are growing up, or when the couple needs to right-size in their senior years. It is in this context that we have an ABSD concession for Singaporean married couples buying a second residential property.",7,1235,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01235

For those who are purchasing a HDB flat or a new Executive Condominium, they are granted upfront ABSD remission, as Mr Chua highlighted. This is because, they are subject to HDB regulations which require them to not own another residential property and to dispose of their existing property within HDB's stipulated timeframe. There are no such regulations for private residential properties and that is the reason why for such private residential property purchases, ABSD remission is only granted upon the sale of the first property within the required timeline, unlike the case of HDB.",8,1236,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01236

In his response, the Deputy Prime Minister had referred to that as having a $20 million budget being requested for it.

As we battled the COVID-19 crisis and the public sector had to respond almost on the move and to make time critical decisions, and probably with no SOP manual to reference from, whether it is to set up the massive community isolation facilities or with the under urgency of time for the foreign workers. These are all unprecedented things that the public sector did last year.",1,1298,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01298

I read a lot of this in the AGO reports where the lapses were picked up and so on. So, in the situation such as this, with the urgency and the exigencies, needs, how has our procurement process been able to allow for such situations to be managed? And then, whether there is the provision of waivers and so on for such acts?",2,1299,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01299

In fact, this was raised last year too, when we were in the midst of, well, we still are in the midst, of fighting COVID-19, but at the height of the pandemic last year when we had a huge outbreak. I think some Members had asked questions about the processes in which these procurements could be done quickly. I had explained then that we do have Emergency Procurement provisions in place where for such cases, there are provisions for agencies to make use of these Emergency Procurement provisions in order to buy services more promptly. And indeed, these were made use of last year during the crisis and when we had, in particular, to respond very quickly.",1,1300,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01300

2021-02-26-T-007,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"That said, I wonder first if the Minister is also suggesting that our macro-economic and fiscal environment today is as unchanged as it has been historically, and even in the midst of the largest reserve drawdown in our history?

And so, if by implication, does that mean that we should regard all proposals by all Members of this House as equally, fiscally credible that whatever estimates provided should be regarded as equally trustworthy as long as they are put on the table. So, in part, you can think of it as not purely a constraint on the Government, which does have a very good track record, as I have explained, but also on proposals that are offered by Members of this House.

So yes, it has changed, but the important thing is this – what is the difference between Singapore and the other countries who have needed the IFIs or their own fiscal councils?

The last government's forecast for growth in the economy over the past 10 years have, on average, been out by £13 billion. Their forecasts of the budget deficit three years ahead have on average been out by £40 billion.

The final decision on the forecast has always been made by the Chancellor, not independent officials. And that is precisely the problem. Again and again, the temptation to fiddle the figures, to nudge up a growth forecast here or reduce a borrowing number there to make the numbers add up has proved too great...We need to fix the budget to fit the figures and not fix the figures to fit the budget. To do this, I am today establishing a new independent Office for Budget Responsibility.

But I also want to go on to point out that in the UK, after setting up the OBR, it has not necessarily been the case that they have been on target.

The OBR had predicted economic growth six times stronger than the latest official figures suggested.",9,1317,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01317

2021-02-26-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The first one is on the National Research Foundation. I think the Minister referred to some of the downstream outcomes. For example, four of the top 10 blockbuster drugs in the world are manufactured in Singapore. I believe those four are by MNCs though. So, my question would be, really, in terms of local companies, locally owned companies, does the NRF actually track the IP that its spending has resulted in, the IP that is co-created with local companies, and does it track whether that IP then is used to create a blockbuster drug or a blockbuster product by the local company itself further downstream? Is that something that the NRF looks at?",2,1324,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01324

I believe NRF was set up in 2002 or 2003, so it has been 17 or 18 years. So, I am wondering if that is being tracked, examples of that.",3,1325,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01325
2021-02-26-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Secondly, in relation assessing performance of Temasek and GIC, the Minister helpfully shared about advisory councils that help to guide Temasek and GIC. So, my question is, really, that the Government in the form of MOF is the sole shareholder, basically, of GIC and Temasek, and as the sole shareholder, is there a process within the MOF where you assess whether their performance is good enough?",4,1326,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01326
2021-02-26-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"In past debates on this subject, I believe that the Government has said its approach is a bit hands-off; it leaves it to the Board and management. But I am wondering whether there is a formal process every year or every few years to assess whether the Board and management have done well or whether they have done not well enough, so that they need to be taken to task or, in extremis, whether they need to be replaced. Does that sort of happen within MOF or somewhere else in the Government?",5,1327,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01327

2021-02-26-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the first question, the translation from research to economic output, and whether or not local companies themselves are benefiting from this, this is indeed something we do track. It takes longer, understandably, because the capabilities of our local firms may not be at the same level as MNCs. So, their readiness to take research and to translate research into tangible outcomes may not quite be there. So, there is an on-going effort to transform industries to boost the capabilities of our local firms. That is one prong.",2,1329,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01329
2021-02-26-T-007,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But a second prong of this is through NRF's research initiatives itself, some of these get translated into local start-ups, and then these start-ups, in the nature of start-ups, not every one will succeed. Some may exit early but we certainly hope some of them, over time, will grow and be very successful companies. And because we are still relatively early in this journey, I think we do need patience.",3,1330,2021-02-26-T-007-S-01330

As I have highlighted, we look at these returns not just on a yearly basis. I think that would be very short-sighted and that would be detrimental and counter-productive. We look at it on an overall basis and over a longer term. It is really rolling returns over a longer period of time, preferably over 20 years, which we do, but then we have intermediate milestones and we look at 10 and five-year periods as well.

2021-02-26-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The increase in requests to Facebook for information on accounts over the past year is due to the significant rise in cybercrime, including online scams and cyber-extortion. For example, social media impersonation scams, most of which occurred on Facebook and Instagram, have almost quadrupled year-on-year from 786 cases in 2019 to 3,010 cases in 2020.",1,1353,2021-02-26-T-010-S-01353
2021-02-26-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The requests were mainly due to online scams such as social media impersonation as well as online harassment such as doxxing, but none were for the serious offences as defined within the Seventh Schedule of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020.",2,1354,2021-02-26-T-010-S-01354

2021-02-26-T-011,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"All businesses should be responsible for ensuring that they comply with relevant laws and regulations which they are subject to, wherever they conduct their business activities.

2021-02-26-T-011,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Although businesses are primarily responsible for compliance, the Singapore Government helps to raise awareness in the business community through advisories and outreach events. Firstly, whenever sanctions are imposed by the UNSC, MTI, Singapore Customs and Enterprise Singapore will issue formal advisories on the scope of the sanctions and the penalties for non-compliance. Businesses are encouraged to refer to these advisories and seek legal advice to ensure that their activities do not expose their company and employees to sanctions. Secondly, Government economic agencies organise outreach events such as industry seminars for businesses to learn about best practices for due-diligence and Know-Your-Customer processes. This helps to equip businesses with the knowledge on how to spot red flags during the course of their commercial activities, so that they may be able to comply with prevailing laws and sanctions.",3,1358,2021-02-26-T-011-S-01358

2021-02-26-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government has been investing in the early childhood sector to provide families with access to affordable and quality preschool. At present, there are over 22,000 preschool educators in the sector, of which, over 160 are males. To support the expansion of the preschool sector, we will continue to put in place measures to attract more people, both men and women, to join the sector.",1,1360,2021-02-26-T-012-S-01360
2021-02-26-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For instance, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) offers Training Awards to encourage post-Secondary students to pursue Early Childhood courses at the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC). To attract more mid-career entrants, we have also rolled out the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for Preschool Teachers and the Place-and-Train Programme (PnT) for Educarers to encourage people who are looking to switch careers or re-enter the workforce to join the preschool sector.",2,1361,2021-02-26-T-012-S-01361
2021-02-26-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We believe that male educators can also play a valuable role in preschools, and that they bring different strengths and perspectives to the sector. They can offer male role models for children and emphasise the role men can play in supporting the development of children in their early years. As the preschool sector continues to expand, there are growing areas of specialisation such as Mother Tongue Language, Outdoor Learning, and socio-emotional development, where male educators can contribute meaningfully to our children’s learning.",3,1362,2021-02-26-T-012-S-01362
2021-02-26-T-012,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Nevertheless, there are challenges faced in recruiting male preschool educators. While early childhood educators are professionals who play a critical role in the holistic development of our children, there are misperceptions that the early childhood sector is associated with caregiving and is more suited for women. ECDA has been working to change these misperceptions. For instance, since 2018, ECDA has embarked on a national campaign for the early childhood sector to create greater awareness of the sector and career opportunities, and to foster greater respect and recognition of the profession. It is a journey to change misperceptions, and we will continue to work towards a better balance of male and female preschool educators over time, as we collectively debunk stereotypes and encourage mindset shifts.",4,1363,2021-02-26-T-012-S-01363

To ensure a fair allocation of our limited housing subsidies, those who buy a second subsidised flat from HDB receive a smaller subsidy than first-timer buyers, by paying a resale levy.",1,1365,2021-02-26-T-013-S-01365
2021-02-26-T-013,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB does not track the number of appeals it receives from specific groups of buyers for a waiver of the resale levy. Nonetheless, we do assist seniors who apply for 2-room Flexi flats with their resale levy. For seniors who sold their first subsidised flat before 2006 and chose to defer their resale levy with interest until they bought their second subsidised flat, we waive the accrued interest for their resale levy if they buy a 2- or 3-room flat as their second subsidised flat. In addition, for all seniors who buy a short-lease 2-room Flexi flat and need to pay a resale levy, regardless of when they sold their first subsidised flat, we assist them by capping their resale levy at $30,000 and adjusting it downward based on the length of the lease purchased. From 2018 to 2020, 6,460 senior households that booked a 2-room Flexi flat benefited from these forms of assistance.",2,1366,2021-02-26-T-013-S-01366
2021-02-26-T-013,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Beyond seniors, HDB has also exercised flexibility for other second-timers in extenuating circumstances, on a case-by-case basis. These include some single parents who buy a flat with their children. From 2018 to 2020, HDB has acceded to 535 appeals by such single parents to reduce the resale levy payable, or to incorporate it into the flat price so that it need not be paid upfront in cash.",3,1367,2021-02-26-T-013-S-01367

2021-02-26-T-023,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Co-payment is an important principle in the design of healthcare insurance. It encourages policyholders and their doctors, to consider the necessity of the medical treatment and its cost, so that they can make an informed decision on the appropriate healthcare services.

2021-02-26-T-023,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"This principle applies regardless of hospital category. Integrated Shield Plan (IP) full riders that covered the entire co-payment under the IPs were not in line with this principle. Such riders allowed policyholders to avoid co-payment regardless of their bill size, and had contributed to over-consumption, over-servicing and over-charging. Between 2015 and 2020, the compound annual growth rate of claims incidence was about 15% for full riders of private hospital IPs, and about 9% for full riders of restructured hospital IPs. For riders with some form of co-payment of private and restructured hospital IPs, this figure was close to 0%. Over the same period, the average bill size for claims from full riders were at least 20% higher than riders with some form of co-payment, for private and restructured hospital IPs.",2,1420,2021-02-26-T-023-S-01420
2021-02-26-T-023,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"This was one of the reasons why MOH had announced the requirement for a minimum 5% co-payment for new riders across all settings in March 2018. This would apply for new riders sold from 1 April 2019, while riders sold after the announcement, between 8 March 2018 and 31 March 2019, would have to transition onto these new co-payment riders by 1 April 2021.",3,1421,2021-02-26-T-023-S-01421

This is allowed under their contractual terms with their policyholders. MOH has encouraged the insurers, in considering these changes, to ensure that their policyholders' interests are safeguarded even as insurers seek to ensure the sustainability of their portfolios. As an additional safeguard, insurers are required to clearly explain these changes to their policyholders at least 30 days before they take effect.",4,1422,2021-02-26-T-023-S-01422

Infrastructural measures also help to mitigate noise emissions. For example, for expressways near residential areas, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) works with the National Parks Board to line the expressways with dense planting, which act as screens that absorb light and noise from roads. LTA is also studying the feasibility of other noise mitigation measures such as low-noise pavement mix for roads and vertical noise barriers.
