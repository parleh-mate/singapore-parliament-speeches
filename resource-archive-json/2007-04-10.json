This corresponds to the resignation rates of 2%, 4% and 3% respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we include Management Associates, who are the officers being tested for suitability for the Administrative Service, the resignation numbers are larger, but, of course, the base is larger as well.&nbsp; The total number of Administrative Officers and Management Associates who resigned in 2004, 2005 and 2006 were four, 14 and 12 respectively.&nbsp; This corresponds to the resignation rates of 1%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrative Officers leave the Service for various reasons, and we may often not be able to ascertain exactly the real reasons for their departure.&nbsp; Some indicated that they would like to further their studies while others want to have a change of career.&nbsp; Some of those who leave for jobs in the private sector enjoy a pay increase in their new jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Administrative Service has very stringent retention standards. &nbsp;Officers are appraised annually and are expected to have the potential to hold at least Deputy Secretary or CEO level jobs.&nbsp; Those who do not meet the mark are asked to leave the Service but they could remain in other schemes in the Civil Service if they wish and if there are suitable jobs for them.&nbsp; Over the last three years, a total of 13 Administrative Officers left the Service on such grounds, ie, they were managed out of the Service.&nbsp; Of these, eight officers left the Public Service. The other five transferred to join other schemes within the Public Service where they continue to contribute to the public service.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So, just like Abu Dhabi and Seoul, the possible addition of a race in the F1 calendar in Singapore&nbsp;would not necessarily be at the expense of any of the existing races.&nbsp; Moreover, we do understand from public information sources that Sepang&rsquo;s contract provides for a race to be held each year until 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is natural for some competition to exist between all F1 races.&nbsp; However, we do not see competition arising&nbsp;or&nbsp;being disadvantageous just because of geographical proximity.&nbsp; In fact, there are several F1 races that take place in the same region, such as those in Monaco and Monza, which is in Italy, and in Fuji in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan, and Shanghai.&nbsp; There are also several other factors that should be taken into account.&nbsp; For example, each race is unique in terms of its character and circuit design.&nbsp; Sepang has a dedicated circuit, while we are looking at a street circuit in Singapore.&nbsp; Should Singapore host the F1 Grand Prix, there will indeed be much scope for both countries&rsquo; events to complement each other.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Member for this opportunity to clarify media reports in mid-March that the ongoing upgrading of a block of rental flats in Toa Payoh had inconvenienced some residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The particular rental block is being upgraded under Project LIFE.&nbsp; LIFE stands for Lift Improvement and Facilities Enhancement.&nbsp; This is a programme implemented by HDB for one-room rental blocks where there is a high concentration of elderly residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seeks to improve the physical living conditions of the elderly tenants through lift upgrading and the installation of elder-friendly features, such as support handbars and the Alert Alarm System.&nbsp; It is fully paid for by the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When these upgrading works are going on in a rental block, HDB implements a host of measures to reduce inconvenience to residents.&nbsp; The contractors can work inside the flat only from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm during weekdays.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have to ensure that the flat is cleared up at the end of each day.&nbsp; There is an air-conditioned area for affected residents to rest during these working hours.&nbsp; Temporary toilets and storage space are also made available.&nbsp; And the upgrading is done in batches so that these communal facilities are sufficient for the affected residents&rsquo; use.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, since 1993, HDB has upgraded 38 rental blocks under Project LIFE and, in all these projects, no tenant has been forced to sleep in the corridors as a result of the upgrading works.&nbsp; One of the newspaper articles showed a picture of a man sleeping at the common corridor of his rental block.&nbsp; HDB investigated and found that he was sleeping outside on his own accord.&nbsp;&nbsp;The upgrading works at his unit has not even started.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have informed the newspaper that they had inadvertently misled their readers by using the picture in the wrong context.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB does exercise flexibility in cases of residents with serious medical or mobility problems and will arrange for such households to be shifted to a vacant unit.&nbsp; However, in the recent case, the resident who complained to the press did not fall into this category.&nbsp; He had asked for a vacant unit to store his belongings.&nbsp; He was not happy that he had to store it in the allocated storage space provided.&nbsp; HDB could not accede to his request, so he complained to the press.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:CHILDLESS SINGAPOREAN WOMEN--><p align=left>Column No : 213<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:CHILDLESS SINGAPOREAN WOMEN:::215-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Speaker, Sir, some couples who want children but have difficulties conceiving would turn to Assisted Conception Procedures (ACP).&nbsp; As part of the 2004 Marriage and Parenthood package, couples undergoing ACP can now use up to $6,000, $5,000 and $4,000 from their own or their spouse&rsquo;s Medisave for the first, second and third treatment cycles respectively.&nbsp; For the majority of couples who choose to undergo ACP at public hospitals, these withdrawal limits would cover the bulk of the treatment cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although greater financial support for fertility treatment will make ACP more affordable for couples who have difficulty conceiving, unfortunately, the reality is that no amount of financial support is able to increase the success rate of ACP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fertility declines with age, what is needed are upstream efforts to raise awareness on the narrowing fertility window as one ages and the risks associated with delayed childbearing.&nbsp; I am happy to report that our public education efforts have reaped some results.&nbsp; From my Ministry&rsquo;s 2006 survey of 3,000 married respondents, 94% are aware that it gets more difficult for couples to conceive as they get older, up from 89% in 2004.&nbsp; However, more can and must be done to raise awareness level and to transform awareness into a change in attitude and behaviour.&nbsp; My Ministry has and will continue to partner medical experts to spread this important message.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So it is quite stable.&nbsp; But when we come to the factors, like I mentioned just now, most of the cases were actually&nbsp;abuse by their own children - over 40% by sons; over 20% by daughters; and about 12% by their own spouses.&nbsp; So they are not outsiders. For these cases, like I have said, we have a protocol. We work very closely with the Police, hospitals and the&nbsp;Family Service Centres. When an elderly person or a friend refers the case to us, the social workers will be involved.&nbsp; The social workers conduct risk assessment, work out safety plans and provide counselling.&nbsp; Fortunately,&nbsp;for over 50% of the cases, after counselling, both sides were quite happy to work with each other again.&nbsp; Actually, 90% of them still stay at the same place.&nbsp; Only 10% have looked for alternative care or gone&nbsp;to institutional care.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, besides this protocol, some also went direct to the police or court. Some have applied for Personal Protection Order (PPO). The worst cases would be&nbsp;those who&nbsp;apply&nbsp;under the Maintenance of Parents Act&nbsp;to seek help for shelter and crisis homes.&nbsp; For some of them, we can even refer them to welfare homes if their children really cannot afford it.&nbsp; Most of the reasons for getting into trouble&nbsp;are&nbsp;chronic or&nbsp;long-term sicknesses like Parkinson's,&nbsp;dementia, and so on.&nbsp; I think the Chinese have a saying, \"If you are sick for too long, there are no filial&nbsp;children.\"&nbsp; Anyway, the point is that now, we also work with some VWOs.&nbsp; I am sure&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Mehta knows that we&nbsp;give the caregivers support as well.&nbsp; It is not just on why they become angry and abuse the elderly, but we also get relief for them and get the VWOs to train&nbsp;and&nbsp;give them support. We found that most of these people who&nbsp;abuse their parents&nbsp;are those who depend on the aged for financial support.&nbsp; They themselves do not do very well financially and so there is some relationship tension.&nbsp; We will do our best to work with the VWOs closely to help both sides to better&nbsp;understand each other.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Gan Kim Yong) (for the Minister for Education)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, it is always a pleasure to answer questions in the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Education&nbsp;established the Special Assistance Plan, or SAP schools, in 1979 for two purposes.&nbsp; Firstly, to keep alive the best traditions and ethos of old Chinese schools in a few selected schools, so as to inculcate traditional Chinese values and social discipline in a number of our top students.&nbsp; Secondly, to encourage a number of our academically able and linguistically talented students to study both Chinese and English at the first language level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, our SAP schools continue to play a key role in nurturing a core group of bilingual Singaporeans who are well versed in the Chinese language and culture, with a deep understanding of their heritage, and who are also well poised to grasp opportunities in the emerging China market.&nbsp; This is a strength of our system that we will continue to preserve going forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAP schools are keenly aware that they need to work doubly hard to create opportunities for their students to interact with students from other ethnic groups.&nbsp; They do so in a variety of forms&nbsp;- from twinning with non-SAP schools with a multi-racial composition to taking part in joint activities with non-SAP schools and community organisations which serve non-Chinese or multi-racial communities.&nbsp; An example is the twinning arrangement between Ai Tong School, which is a&nbsp;Primary SAP school, and Pierce Secondary School.&nbsp; Primary 4 pupils from Ai Tong who are weak in Mathematics and English receive tutoring help from non-Chinese students&nbsp;from Pierce Secondary.&nbsp; Similarly, the Secondary 3 students in Chung Cheng High School (Main) run a Conversational Chinese Programme for Primary 5 non-Chinese students from Geylang Methodist Primary School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAP schools also actively celebrate the different ethnic festivals and leverage on these occasions to deepen their students' understanding of other races and cultures.&nbsp; Non-Chinese students from neighbouring schools are invited to join in for these events.&nbsp; For instance, Anglican High celebrates Chinese New Year and Racial Harmony Day annually together with Damai Secondary School and Changkat Changi Secondary School.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, MOE and the SAP schools will continue to actively explore and create more opportunities for SAP students to interact with students from other ethnic groups.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Because a kind of a long-term relationship between two types of schools would probably be good in developing tolerance and understanding of our multi-cultural and multi-racial society.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;the Ministry has&nbsp;adopted the approach of&nbsp;top-down support for ground-up initiatives, ie,&nbsp;we&nbsp;encourage the schools to evolve and develop&nbsp;their own&nbsp;initiatives and programmes because by doing so, we give the schools a greater sense of ownership&nbsp;to the programmes that they have developed, and we encourage them to do so by providing them with the necessary support. Therefore, we would like to encourage a diversity of different programmes and activities.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;students will&nbsp;learn from different ways. So we encourage them to have different forms of integration programmes, rather than to formalise them and&nbsp;make it a formal programme.&nbsp; We would prefer to encourage them to have their own ideas so that they will be more effective in inculcating this multi-racial culture within the school.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah):</B> &nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister&nbsp;whether the students from SAP schools could truly benefit from multi-culturalism at the programme level as opposed to a daily&nbsp;interaction basis.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, in fact, some of the programmes are&nbsp;long-term programmes and they interact quite regularly.&nbsp; Let me give you an example. Hwa Chong Institution, for example,&nbsp;works very closely with&nbsp;its neighbourhood schools in terms of different cultural programmes.&nbsp; One example is West Spring Secondary and Bukit Panjang Government High.&nbsp; For these schools, they actually practise music together.&nbsp; In Hwa Chong, there is a Chinese orchestra.&nbsp; They have 24 festive drums as well as <I>wushu.</I> And from March to June, they will practise together with students from both schools. This culminates in a joint performance at the Racial Harmony Day in July. So they actually meet each other quite regularly&nbsp;within these three to four months.&nbsp; They practise together, get to know each other,&nbsp;learn from each other, and then they jointly perform together at the&nbsp;Racial Harmony Day.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, anyone listening to yesterday's debate will get the impression that this whole salary revision is only for the Administrative Service officers and the political office holders.&nbsp; I would like to stress that there are 64,000 civil servants, and they too make important contributions to the work of the public service, and this pay revision would also cover them.&nbsp; This will be&nbsp;the main focus of my speech today to give the perspective of the public sector employees on this pay revision.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the public service pay was last revised in 2000, after the service suffered an exodus of staff to the private sector.&nbsp; Hence, I agree with Minister Teo that it is timely and relevant to do this revision now before we see a repeat of that exodus.&nbsp; It is important for the public service to pay its officers competitive salaries in order to attract and retain its fair share of talent.&nbsp; Being the largest employer in Singapore, its policies on wages and human resource have a significant impact on the private sector.&nbsp; Witness the complaints from the private sector whenever they perceive in the past that the public sector was paying better bonuses, which they felt pressurised to match in order to retain their employees.&nbsp; Hence, the public service has also been mindful not to be seen as the leader when it comes to the payment of salary and bonuses to its employees.&nbsp; But this cautious approach has also resulted in the public service losing people.&nbsp; If the public service does not have its fair share of good people, service to the public will be affected.&nbsp; It would also not be able to live up to the rigorous demands of policy making in an extremely competitive and challenging environment.&nbsp; Having dealt with the public service in the course of my union work, I can vouch for the fact that the public service of today is a far cry from the service of the past, in terms of the quality of the staff and the standards of performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are now many dreaded acronyms among civil servants, such as PRP, which is Performance Review Process, where someone who receives an E rating is given a certain period to buck up, failing which he will be terminated.&nbsp; Then there is the SGS - the Special Gratuity Scheme&nbsp; - where someone who has stagnated in his performance and is blocking the career path of others is politely asked whether he could do something better in the private sector instead of continuing in his job.&nbsp; And if he so agrees, he could leave through the SGS.&nbsp; Then there is, of course, the equally dreaded best sourcing, where jobs could be outsourced to the private sector once market testing shows that it is viable to do so.&nbsp; The civil servants know that if they do not perform, not only will they be deprived of performance bonuses but they may also be asked to leave the service.&nbsp; So the public service today is no longer an iron rice bowl, where people are kept in service no matter what happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in fact, one of the complaints about the public service today among new recruits is that it lacks job security.&nbsp; The public service today employs people on contracts, even for jobs which are not short term.&nbsp; This is something that the public service, in my view, may want to review as it unnecessarily creates uncertainty particularly among new recruits&nbsp; -&nbsp; the group that has the highest turnover.&nbsp; If the reason is to test people before confirming them, then the good old probation system can still perform that function.&nbsp; So, even if the starting pay is adjusted, its concerns over job security are not addressed, then I think the public service will continue to see a higher turnover among new recruits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now focus on some aspects of the salary revision and its impact on civil servants.&nbsp; Our public sector unionists have raised some issues and concerns.&nbsp; They felt that thus far, the focus has been only on the pay of the top civil servants.&nbsp; They are worried in case the salary revision will benefit only the very few at the top and the graduates, based on Minister Teo's express concern that the graduate scheme is seeing a higher level of turnover.&nbsp; The very top civil servants form only a very small percentage of the 64,000 civil servants that are spread across 15 Ministries and who help to make the system work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our public sector unionists understand the need to reward and retain our top talents, but I believe that the rest of the civil servants too deserve to be treated fairly and should be given a decent pay increase.&nbsp; As one public sector unionist reminded me in a meeting that we had last Thursday, we must look at the public service as a total human being where every part of the body performs a function.&nbsp; It is not only the brain that matters.&nbsp; Even if a person has a wonderful brain, without the hands, legs, eyes, nose and ears, that person cannot function effectively.&nbsp; So we need to pay the top civil servants well but we must not forget the rest of the public service, without whom our public service will be crippled and cannot function well.&nbsp; The best policies will be ruined if poorly-paid demotivated, disgruntled counter staff at the Ministry is rude to the public, or if a similarly poorly-paid demotivated and disgruntled lower division staff fails to implement policies effectively.&nbsp; I think their concern is not unwarranted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many civil servants today who joined service years ago have reached the maximum on their scale and have not been receiving wage increases.&nbsp; Prior to the year 2000, they could expect to look forward to NWC wage increases.&nbsp; But since 2000, NWC wage increases were paid only in the form of the Annual Variable Component (AVC) which was split into two parts and paid in July and December.&nbsp; In the meantime, the cost of living has gone up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this has been particularly difficult for the public service staff in the lower divisions, such as Divisions 3 and 4 and the daily-rated employees.&nbsp; The Amalgamated Union of Daily Rated Workers has asked me to remind the Government not to forget about the DREs - the lowest-paid workers in the public service.&nbsp; On average, a DRE who has worked for more than 20 years earns only about $1,000 a month inclusive of allowances, which are paid only if they fulfill some traditions such as punctuality.&nbsp; Almost all the DREs today work two jobs to make ends meet.&nbsp; This is the group that, despite economic growth,&nbsp;is still stuck with low wages, as they face the same challenge of stretching incomes caused by globalisation that afflicts all our low-wage workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many have gone for training but there is a limit to how much the cleansing jobs that they perform can be revamped.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Government to pay special attention to the lower divisions and our daily-rated workers in the salary revision so that they are not left out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have listened carefully to the Minister's statement.&nbsp; I am glad to note that the salary adjustment, which will be paid&nbsp; primarily in the form of bonuses tied to performance and market demand, will benefit everyone in the public service.&nbsp; Since Minister Teo made the announcement on 2nd March this year that there will be a salary revision, expectations have been raised.&nbsp; Civil servants are expecting adjustments to their basic pay. &nbsp;Hence, it is important that the basic principle of how the adjustment will be made&nbsp;is clearly explained to both the civil servants as well as the public. The public service has a flexible wage system, and the adjustment this year is primarily in the variable component, and not a fixed component of the civil servants' salary structure, except maybe for only a few schemes of service which will get their basic pay adjusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another key consideration is that, unlike the salary revision exercise in 2000, the exercise this time is different in that the adjustment will not be the same across the board.&nbsp; Rather, the salary adjustment will depend on market demand and performance of staff.&nbsp; This means that the variable component that is pegged to performance has increased, and this makes it all the more important for the public service to have an effective performance management system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In essence, Sir, we can agree that if the public service is to improve its standards, it needs to reward people based on performance and not on their mere presence at work or based solely on seniority.&nbsp; Nevertheless, for a performance-based system to work, it is important to have in place an objective, fair and transparent performance appraisal system that generates confidence among public service staff.&nbsp; For this to happen, the targets must be clear, discussed with the staff and achievable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There must also be a system in place where managers are properly trained to appraise their staff and give regular feedback on their performance.&nbsp; Our concern is that the effectiveness of the performance management system in the public sector today varies across Ministries and statutory boards, and has to be improved.&nbsp; According to one unionist, statutory boards do not share their corporate KPIs with the unions and staff until only very recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But there are also examples of good performance management systems practised in the public sector.&nbsp; The PUB Employees' Union has confidence in&nbsp;its appraisal system, as the management engage an external consultant, discuss extensively with the union and the staff, train the supervisors and even a few years after the implementation of the appraisal system, the consultant continues to do annual evaluations to ensure that the system is complied with and functions well.&nbsp;

I hope that this is not how the public service management system is perceived.&nbsp; If more and more public service pay is to be pegged to performance, I would like to urge the Public Service Division to do a lot more work in this area to improve the performance management system across Ministries and statutory boards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now touch on market adjustment.&nbsp; One principle that we are seeing being&nbsp;more clearly established now is that an officer's wage increase will now be tied more closely to market demand.&nbsp; It is important, in my view, to ensure that those schemes of service without relevant market equivalents are also adequately compensated.&nbsp; The Minister had explained that the Public Service Division would look at the qualifications of the officer in such cases to determine how much wage adjustments to pay to those without market equivalents.&nbsp; In my view, this is not enough.&nbsp; The Government should also look at the job size of the officers and the complexity of the jobs, taking into account the knowledge and experience that they have in performing certain jobs in the civil service.&nbsp; The nature of the&nbsp;work in the civil service is different from that of the private sector.&nbsp; There are jobs, such as officers doing ICA work, where it is not possible to find the market equivalent, but these are jobs critical to Singapore's security.&nbsp; Hence, we need to be fair to them as well and ensure that they receive fair pay adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as market comparisons are now increasingly&nbsp;being used as a benchmark for salary revisions in the public service, it is imperative that the jobs in the public service do not remain static but are constantly reviewed and redesigned so that officers in all the schemes of service could continue to enhance the value of their work and will stand an equal chance of earning better bonuses and wage increases.&nbsp; This is important because it is not fair to the staff if they have been asked to do the same job for the past 20 years, and then one day when market comparisons are done, they are told that the market value of their jobs is lower than others and therefore they deserve less bonuses and wage increases.&nbsp; So, I would like to urge the Public Service Division to do a thorough review of the jobs in the public service to assess whether there are jobs which now have to be redesigned so that the staff on those schemes could do higher-level jobs and enhance their market value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some examples are the Corporate Support Service and the Operations Support Service, which could be upgraded to the higher-level jobs.&nbsp; This is something which we had raised a few years ago and I would like to urge the PSD to give this greater urgency and priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the comments about the public service is that other than the Administrative Service, promotions for the other schemes of service are far too slow compared to the private sector.&nbsp; Recently, the Ministry of Education made a very smart move by conducting a promotion exercise, which is essentially a catch-up exercise.&nbsp; Under the enhanced career structure for teachers, the MOE promoted a bumper crop of 10,850 officers.&nbsp; Some benefited from faster promotions while others benefited from the new additional career grade of GEOs 1A3/2A3, that was created.&nbsp; These are additional promotional grades as the next higher grade is too far for many to cross.&nbsp; I think, Sir, that this is a good move to motivate and retain staff, and I strongly urge the rest of the public service to study and implement this as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have highlighted some issues pertaining to the current service pay revision and have also made some suggestions for improvements.&nbsp; Having worked closely with the public service, primarily as adviser to the public sector unions, I must emphasise that, overall, in its human resource management policies, our civil service can pride itself as being a fair and progressive employer, whether in the area of staff welfare or staff development.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to quote you some examples.&nbsp; On work-life balance, our civil service is one of the earliest to adopt family-friendly policies, such as extended maternity leave for young mothers and&nbsp;paid sick leave for mothers to tend to sick children, long before the Employment Act was amended to provide the two days' paid sick leave to parents in the private sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our civil service also has schemes allowing women officers to work part time or flexi time and was the first to adopt the policy on equal pay for work of equal value, way back in the 1960s, even before Singapore officially ratified International Labour Organisation Convention 100 on this in the year 2002.&nbsp; I hope, of course, Sir, that we will see more female Permanent Secretaries, but the current record of four from a base of zero is not too bad.&nbsp; In fact, because of its reputation, I sometimes receive request from young school leavers looking for jobs in my constituency who specifically request for work in the Government service or who are disappointed when they could not secure a civil service job and want to appeal for a second chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, far from the impression that many have, the civil service is still an attractive, exciting and challenging place to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the course of my work, I also had the opportunity of meeting very enlightened senior civil servants, such as Mr Lim Siong Guan who not only understood very well what is important for our economy and growth and how to ensure that our civil service remains efficient and effective.&nbsp; He also understood very well the concerns of the average Singaporean and the need to take care of the civil servants even as the civil service charged ahead to prepare for new challenges.&nbsp; It was also during Mr Lim Siong Guan's time that we had our first public sector union-management gathering in 1997, which is a practice that we have continued up to today.&nbsp; The public sector union-management gathering provides a platform for the NTUC and the public sector unions to regularly discuss and engage the PSD and the public sector management from the Ministries and statutory boards on HR policies and issues in the public sector, and has laid a strong foundation for the development of good LMR in the public sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, if, as mentioned by Minister Teo, the public sector could, through competitive wages, help to retain able men and women in the public service and duplicate many more Permanent Secretaries of Mr Lim Siong Guan's calibre and character - I know that Mr Lim has retired - then this is something that is good for our future.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.22 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;different points of views have been given, I will not try and cover the same ground.&nbsp; Let me start by talking about what I know best - my own profession, the law.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our court system is based on the British model.&nbsp;Many years ago, lawyers in England called barristers were regarded like public servants.&nbsp; They were expected to use their skills and training for the benefit of all whose cause was just and innocent, without fear or favour and without reference to power or wealth.&nbsp; Consistent with their calling, their fees were regarded as honorarium which they cannot sue to recover.&nbsp; In other words, you have no recourse if your client decides not to pay you.&nbsp; Barristers were also not permitted to pick and choose their cases for their clients.&nbsp; A barrister was expected to represent all to the best of his ability, whether or not he found them loathsome or whether or not they were princes or paupers.&nbsp; Their overriding duty was to serve the public.&nbsp; And legend has it that after a barrister finished his work in court, his client will deposit his fee in a little pocket in the barrister's robe or gown. And this pocket was located at the back of the robe so that even the very act of payment could not be seen by the barrister, because such matters of money were beneath him.&nbsp; So, if you look carefully at the back of a lawyer's robe today, you will see a tiny pouch.&nbsp; That pouch is all but sewn up, so you cannot put any money in it anymore.&nbsp; It has no function but merely a vestige of time past.&nbsp;That story may not be entirely accurate, I should say.&nbsp; But it is dutifully told by one generation of lawyers to the next to emphasise the nobility of the profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal profession today is still an honourable one.&nbsp; Lawyers have a higher duty to the court.&nbsp; They must act in the interest of justice. They are held to a higher standard and respect of their character and conduct compared to any other profession.&nbsp; They are expected to serve the public good.&nbsp; But no one, and absolutely no one, expects lawyers today in England,&nbsp;Singapore or anywhere around the world to work with the same financial constraints of days gone by.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because those rules are outdated and unrealistic.&nbsp; Today, having a clean and competent legal system is an important part in any country's economy.&nbsp; And to achieve high standards, you need bright people willing to take up the law as a career.&nbsp; We all know that financial rewards play a part in someone making a selection of his career.&nbsp; And I do not think I will be wrong to say that today in law school in Singapore,&nbsp;the United Kingdom, United States or anywhere around the developed world, very bright&nbsp;students are attracted to the law largely on account of financial opportunities which the legal profession offers, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the legal profession worse for this?&nbsp; Clearly not!&nbsp; In fact, by paying well, you are actually raising standards and also levelling the playing field.&nbsp; Otherwise, you will be left in a situation where only the rich can afford to be judges and lawyers, which was the situation in England many years ago.&nbsp; You also need good legal minds, both in the private as well as the public sectors.&nbsp; The system will not work if you have bright judges and government prosecutors but less qualified lawyers in the private sector, and vice versa.&nbsp; So, the financial rewards in both these sectors must be compatible, otherwise there will be an imbalance of talent and an exodus from one to another whenever that imbalance is not addressed.&nbsp; This had in fact happened in the past in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, performing a public service is not inconsistent with receiving good pay.&nbsp; The position of lawyers has evolved. Why should it stand still for Ministers and civil servants?&nbsp; Yes, it is the duty of Ministers and the civil service to serve the public.&nbsp; Yesterday, Mr Siew Kum Hong spoke passionately about how Ministers should be cut from a different cloth and how they should be driven by the privilege of leading this country. I agree with him.&nbsp; A person in that job should not have to be motivated by anything other than the privilege and honour of leading Singapore.&nbsp; He should be someone who thinks that destiny demands of him to service.&nbsp; If he does not have that drive&nbsp;or mindset, how will he be able to make the tough decisions which he will inevitably have to make?&nbsp; But why does this mean that Ministers should be paid less than what they are worth or what their job demands.&nbsp; And why should their moral authority be questioned or eroded in the minds of right-thinking people simply because we seek to give them a fair wage?&nbsp; Just because someone should not do this job for money does not mean that you should not pay him fairly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the common arguments we hear?&nbsp; First, there is a fear that the wrong type of person may be motivated to take office.&nbsp; I think that is overstated.&nbsp; One does not get the job simply by applying for it.&nbsp; You first have to establish a good reputation.&nbsp; You then have to satisfy the Prime Minister's standards, no doubt highly stringent.&nbsp; You then have to be scrutinised by the electorate and prove yourself in the office of a junior Minister before you are asked to step up.&nbsp; It is clearly not in the PM's interest to appoint someone who is not competent and dedicated to Singapore.&nbsp; In fact, despite the salary increases in 1994 and thereafter, the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions that it is still difficult to persuade good people to step forward.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because asking someone who is probably already successful and comfortable in his career to completely overhaul his life, and more than that the lives of his family, is very difficult.&nbsp; What value do we place on that?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do Singaporeans really believe that keeping salaries low will discourage greedy and dishonest people from trying to get into office?&nbsp; The many examples around the world tell us differently.&nbsp; The wrong people will always try to take control because they know that if they succeed, they can rewrite the rules to benefit themselves and they will not bother about having a debate in Parliament or elsewhere about it.&nbsp; But there is a more fundamental point, I submit. There is nothing wrong with factoring salary in your career choice.&nbsp; We all do that.&nbsp; Why is it regarded as an imperfection when our Ministers do it or when the formula allows our Ministers to do it?&nbsp; If people demand their politicians take an oath of sainthood with their oath of office, then they are just asking to be deceived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other common argument is that other countries do not pay their leaders as much and the figures often cited&nbsp;sums which are officially declared.&nbsp; The additional perks and advantages received during and after office are usually left out. We have heard some examples yesterday.&nbsp; But, more importantly, again, so what if we pay the highest?&nbsp; Singaporeans should decide for ourselves what value we place on having an honest, dedicated, competent leadership.&nbsp; We should not be dictated by considerations and circumstances of other countries which have absolutely no relevance to us at all.&nbsp; What other leaders earn should not be how we value leadership in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we have a third argument&nbsp;of Mr Chiam yesterday comparing the Government to a charity.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;flabbergasted by this.&nbsp; It is completely different.&nbsp; A&nbsp;charity's deliverables are&nbsp;limited.&nbsp;It has no obligation to grow its business.&nbsp; It does not have to look after its donors or give them returns.&nbsp; The comparison is completely misplaced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So the basic question is: what is a fair wage?&nbsp; At first blush, it seems a difficult question.&nbsp; But once we agree on the principle, it is fairly simple to resolve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I fully accept the principle that we should let the market determine the value of our Ministers and senior civil servants.&nbsp; Benchmarking Ministerial salaries to the private sector is a sensible basis.&nbsp; Like many who have spoken before me, I believe the formula requires some fine-tuning so that it fairly represents the market and takes into account other important factors.&nbsp; Why fine-tune it&nbsp;now?&nbsp; It was simply because the formula was devised in 1994 when salary structures were somewhat different.&nbsp; It is clear that there has today been a significant widening of the salary ranges and these have occurred even at the very top.&nbsp; Take the law as an&nbsp;example.&nbsp; According to the <I>Sunday Times</I> of 1st&nbsp;April&nbsp;this year, in 1998, the difference between the top earner and the eight highest earner in law was $1.2 million.&nbsp; Today, I believe that figure to be much larger and may even exceed $5 million.&nbsp; In other words, there is a vast difference in remuneration even among those who are successful.&nbsp; The amounts earned by those at the very top are therefore no longer representative of what most successful lawyers take home. If the intention of the formula is to be in line with market, then these super earners are not a reflection of what the market pays a successful professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the earnings of the top 48, particularly those in the profession, are not really salaries.&nbsp; Although I do not know who they are, I believe they are probably senior partners or sole proprietors of their own firms.&nbsp; They are not just lawyers or accountants&nbsp;but entrepreneurs running a business of providing legal or accounting services.&nbsp; They are very different from salaried persons.&nbsp; Their earnings represent a return on their enterprise and risk.&nbsp; If the business fails to generate&nbsp;a profit, they earn nothing and they may even lose money.&nbsp; So in a real way, their entire earnings are effectively performance based.&nbsp; It is therefore inappropriate to take their figures and translate&nbsp;them into a regular monthly salary.&nbsp; In the circumstances, if the intention is to continue using the top eight individuals of each profession, then we should&nbsp;compare like for like.&nbsp; A substantial portion of our Ministers' and civil servants' pay&nbsp;should be made performance related.&nbsp; I note that the measures announced yesterday seek to place a greater emphasis on performance&nbsp;but, if you want a proper comparison, a larger portion should be performance based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the key performance indicators should be spelt out clearly so that the public is left in no doubt of the standards that are expected.&nbsp; We are more than willing to pay our public servants a fair wage and, in return, it is reasonable for us to know what we will get in return.&nbsp; There is nothing that&nbsp;will reassure Singaporeans more than a clear set of concrete deliverables from our public servants and if they do achieve their targets, no one can reasonably begrudge them what they earn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my final point is about symbolism.&nbsp; At the end of the day, whatever formula one chooses, the Government must serve and be accountable to all segments of the society.&nbsp; The formula should properly reflect that.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang had, some time ago, suggested that Ministers' salaries should be a multiple of salaries of the bottom 20%.&nbsp;Politically very convenient to argue but really practically makes little sense. Mr Low&nbsp;obviously&nbsp;agrees because he did not repeat the suggestion at this debate yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same vein, this formula should not just take into account the top 48.&nbsp; We cannot ignore the perception that&nbsp;if the formula is tied just to the top,&nbsp;Ministers and civil servants will always enjoy the upside regardless of how the rest of Singaporeans are doing.&nbsp; Indeed, it is well conceivable that the top 24 could continue to earn well and&nbsp;do better even in an economic downturn and increased unemployment.&nbsp; In that event, the Government may be compelled to impose salary cuts&nbsp;and pay below the benchmark as it had done in the past.&nbsp; But what is the point of having a formula if you are only going to follow it some of&nbsp;the time? More importantly, if the formula results in figures which the Government is not comfortable paying, then perhaps there is something wrong with the formula.&nbsp; I believe the formula should contain elements which will tie salaries to the general well-being of Singapore, for example, the GDP, the unemployment rate, the cost of living.&nbsp; We can work out the details.&nbsp; I know these matters may be taken into account when deciding performance bonuses, but I think it is important that we spell this out expressly to demonstrate that they will have a direct bearing on salaries as well.&nbsp; It may be a question of presentation and explanation, but in matters such as these, which are emotional, I think presentation and explanation are just as important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Teo Ser Luck)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Teo Ser Luck):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as an office holder in the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I would like to respond to Mr Low Thia Khiang's points that were raised yesterday in Mandarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I> ):[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070410/20070410VS_082223.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>* .</I> ]&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;Mr Low mentioned yesterday during the debate about&nbsp; the living standards and civil servants' salaries of various countries such as Denmark, Switzerland and Finland,&nbsp;and he has compared&nbsp;them with Singapore. Let me use Denmark as an example to make a simple comparison. The taxes in Denmark are about 43% to 63%, whereas the top income earners in Singapore pay 20%. The GST in Denmark is 25%, but in Singapore our GST is 5% which will be increased to 7%. Their unemployment rate is about 3% to 5% and the figure for Singapore is less than 3%.&nbsp; This is a country that emphasises strongly on social welfare.&nbsp; So, they levy very high taxes on their people.&nbsp; If the unemployment rate is high, it will lead to job insecurity, and thus many people will need social welfare to help them.&nbsp;In the long run, it is not sustainable and it is a burden on the people.&nbsp; Can we accept this? After a generation of hard work, our society has been elevated from&nbsp;a Third World society to&nbsp;a first class society.&nbsp; To achieve this, it requires tremendous effort and wisdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, if we use these countries as comparison, because of the difference in background, it is like comparing two different companies that are selling different products. Likewise, it is difficult to compare the salaries for the political leaders in Singapore with those in European countries.&nbsp; So, such comparison is unfair and inappropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 363-364.\r\n<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>In English</I>):&nbsp; Sir, the issue of pay has always been an emotive one.&nbsp; And most of my parliamentary colleagues have already brought up many points, and I will re-emphasise some of them.&nbsp; I face these difficult issues as well&nbsp;when I was in the private sector, that is, how much do we pay a person, how much is the talent worth, what is the&nbsp;job's worth.&nbsp; While we may argue exactly how much we should pay a person, one thing that is clear in the private sector is that we pay top dollar for&nbsp;talent as well.&nbsp; The logic is simple.&nbsp; It will cost the company much more to replace the top talent than to pay more to retain him. Not only would we lose the experience of this talent, we incur cost on time and training for the new replacement.&nbsp; Any company that values its talent will make&nbsp;the sound business decision to pay market value.&nbsp;In the same way that the private sector pays well to keep its talent, I agree that the Government should pay top dollar to attract and retain our fair share of top talent in our civil service.&nbsp; The stakes are high.&nbsp;There are many companies but only one government, and the Government is dealing with&nbsp;the whole country of four million population in Singapore.&nbsp; So the business of Government must not fail.&nbsp; We need the best to run the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1994, this benchmark has been implemented.&nbsp; I suppose the Government understands that today, the public sector has to compete with the private sector for talent and the public sector job is just another option in the job market.&nbsp; Let me quote Mr Philip Yeo who said recently that the value system for his generation was strong and that would mean times had changed, and so had the value system.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not questioning the moral obligation of the younger generation,&nbsp;because there are certainly more options now and more distractions.&nbsp; So, to many, the social responsibilities of a job in the Government may not be as attractive enough now to outweigh the generous private sector offers, and this is the current situation that we have to accept.&nbsp; It is not easy to find someone with a three-in-one - the ability, the mind, the heart - all rolled into one.&nbsp; It is even more challenging to expect them to come in at a discount.&nbsp; So it is not an everyday sale like in a shopping centre.&nbsp; We have to continue to try to find these good people with a unique compassion.&nbsp; But then we must also be ready to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, I think the debate should be on how we peg the civil service pay to that of the private sector.&nbsp; How should the public sector pay public servants competitive salaries?&nbsp; I agree that not all top civil servants will make it to the top tier of the private sector and <I>vice versa</I>.&nbsp; But the top talents are leaving for the private sector, so it is reasonable to peg to the level that the private sector pays.&nbsp; Many of my parliamentary colleagues have already spoken about the benchmark and formula, and I would say that the formula has caused many on the ground quite confused.&nbsp; But I would just like to put it simply that we should just pay what is needed to retain and check the talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the real issue here is if we pay a market value, would the public sector talents be able to function&nbsp;at the same pace, undertake the same risks and generate the same output as&nbsp;the private sector talents?&nbsp; A company is essentially a profit and cost centre or, what we call, a P&amp;L centre, comprising&nbsp;revenue and cost, headed by a Chief Executive or General Manager.&nbsp; The revenue centre is the frontline staff who bring in the business, the sales department for the company, while the cost centre is the back-end staff -&nbsp;operations, logistics, accounting -&nbsp;that provide support for the revenue centre.&nbsp; The frontline revenue generating staff usually have a lower fixed base, higher variable pay component pegged to the amount of business it generates for the company when it meets the targets.&nbsp; The back-end staff, on the other hand, usually have a higher base pay, lower variable component and, taken together, the frontline staff usually get paid more than the back-end staff when the targets are met and the company prospers.&nbsp; However, there are also underperforming ones and they get even lesser and they also face termination in double quick time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, at times, when I was in the private sector, I did get cold sweat because you woke up in the morning and you worried&nbsp;whether your numbers met the targets or not, or whether your competitors were doing something that was different that would pose a threat to your business.&nbsp; So which market pay&nbsp;should the civil servants be pegged to - revenue, cost or P&amp;L centre?&nbsp; Or should the civil servants in different Government agencies and departments have different benchmarks like in the private sector, considering that the Government would also have its own P&amp;L centre?&nbsp; Should economic promotion agencies, such as the EDB, that attract foreign investments into Singapore be paid higher variable components like the sales department in a private sector?&nbsp; The formula to derive the benchmark is currently complicated enough for most people.&nbsp;So I do not really see the need to over-engineer it any further.&nbsp; But let us review the broad guidelines and see if it is necessary to place more variables and less fixed component and link it to performance indicators in the areas of responsibilities.&nbsp; And these have to be more specific than GDP.&nbsp; It can be too broad as KPIs need to have direct impact on the actions of the different functions that will positively affect the GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, as we peg the civil service pay to the private sector, we should instil the same discipline of the private sector in the civil service.&nbsp; The private sector takes actions swiftly on performers and non-peformers.&nbsp; While top performers are rewarded handsomely, the non-performers are quickly dealt with.&nbsp; In market jargons, we call that \"heads will roll or you get the chop\".&nbsp; This is important to send a clear message of what is needed to be done with a sense of urgency.&nbsp; Similarly, we should review our system of assessment to identify performers and non-performers so that the system of reward and incentive will be more closely aligned to that of the private sector.&nbsp; If we can link performance to economic output, as many Members have mentioned, ability to be cost-efficient, reducing Government's spending but maintaining the same level of activities or with the same level of impact, innovation, creativity, efficiency and effectiveness of systems and policies implemented,&nbsp;I believe that the Government should start placing more emphasis on quantifying targets and measuring an officer's performance more closely according to clear and measurable objectives because you cannot manage or control something&nbsp;that you cannot measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I agree that the pay of the Administrative Officers has fallen behind and ought to be adjusted, we must be mindful that by increasing the pay of the Administrative Officers, we would&nbsp;likely&nbsp;create a larger income gap between the 230 Administrative Officers and the other 60,000 plus non-Administrative Officers in the civil service.&nbsp; As in any wage disparity, those who are paid lesser might feel dissatisfied, especially if we perceive that they are working just as hard, if not harder than those who are paid more.&nbsp; While we can justify the top dollar we are paying to our top talents, we must ensure that the wage disparity&nbsp;within the civil service does not create an unhealthy tension in the system or demoralise the large segment of the civil service.&nbsp; We need thinkers but we also need doers.&nbsp; Plans are nothing.&nbsp; Planning is everything.&nbsp; You can have the best policy paper written, but there will still be no impact if the implementation is not effective.&nbsp; And this requires different skills sets and they are both as critical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we seek to build an elite system, we must ensure that we do not end up with an elitist system.&nbsp; The civil service must continue to function as an effective organisation throughout all levels, across all different schemes of services and each and every civil servant must be given the opportunities to shine, to progress according to his capabilities and potential and to be recognised for his contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we started pegging Ministers' and top civil servants' pay to the private sector in 1994, we should examine if this has indeed been</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>effective in attracting the type of talents that we want.&nbsp; As we know, even with the salary formula, many of the current office-holders left their successful careers and joined the Government at a discount, with no certainty of success.&nbsp; But many other top talents did not make that sacrifice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, are we going to continue to revise upwards the benchmarks every year?&nbsp; I see no need for such revisions, if we use pay as the sole basis of attracting talents.&nbsp; While I support the current proposed increase, my view is that pay should not be the main component to attract and retain talent.&nbsp; We ought to develop a whole package that would make civil service a choice career for our best people.&nbsp; And part of the package in the private sector is to provide a fair leadership, keep the employees constantly motivated and optimally challenged.&nbsp; Similarly, for the civil servants, we must provide a total package to make civil service a choice career where civil servants are given opportunities to stretch themselves, learn new capabilities and develop to their fullest.&nbsp; I met this young officer sometime ago.&nbsp; He told me he had many ideas and papers written but they are all in a drawer.&nbsp; I told him that that was great and asked him, \"Why do you not present it to the Minister?\"&nbsp; He said, \"No.&nbsp; They are not for presentation or to share the ideas now because they are contingency plans, just in case the Minister changes his mind again or his directions.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, going forward, with greater competition from the private sector for young talents, we need to ensure that the civil service remains inspiring, allowing our young officers room for creativity, challenging them to take risks, make them feel ownership in whatever they do and, at the same time, we must be able to create a sense of idealism in our young officers with a larger purpose of helping to shape the future of our country, something that cannot be fulfilled in the private sector.&nbsp; One observation which may be useful for consideration in this whole package is a cosmetic observation.&nbsp; We call our top civil servants Administrative Officers.&nbsp; They do policy planning that impacts the lives of many people.&nbsp; But an administrative officer in the private sector with the same designation has a very different role.&nbsp; They handle administrative functions in making sure that office equipment is maintained, the telephones are working, the letters are routed to the right people, and this is just to maintain the office in support of the frontline staff.&nbsp; It is an important job no doubt, but tactical in nature.&nbsp; So should we consider a change in the name for some of the officers to better reflect the strategic impact of that role in the public sector?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to summarise my views on three key points.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we must understand the need to pay more and to keep and attract talents in the civil service.&nbsp; It is done in the private sector and should be done in the civil service in order for us to attract and retain the brightest people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, in pegging the civil service pay to that of the private sector, we need to ensure that we develop a system with the same discipline of the private sector to reward performers and to deal with non-performers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we should look beyond pay to create a compelling package that will make the civil service a choice career, particularly to our young officers.&nbsp; To this end, we need not be too fixated about the salary formula, as there would always be subjectivity with regard to how the formula ought to be determined.&nbsp; Money must not and should not guide the minds and hearts of our office-holders.&nbsp; Let the minds and hearts not be driven by money but by passion.&nbsp; We must be compassionate, feel the pains and sorrows of the needy, and have the political will to make a difference for them.&nbsp; We must create opportunities to help our fellow Singaporeans to succeed.&nbsp; And, as leaders, we must be with our people through thick and thin, be the first to take the heat and the last to claim the credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To end, I would like to quote, in Mandarin, the words of one blogger and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.&nbsp; I will just combine the quotes together:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; \"I hope our leaders will think of the worries of the nation first before they think of the happiness.&nbsp; They should put the interests of the people above the interests of&nbsp;self.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):<I>&nbsp;</I> Sir, with that, I support the motion.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.50 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I believe I would not&nbsp;be far wrong to say this topic is certainly one of the most hotly debated issues now in the&nbsp;public, other than the recent debate on the GST hike.&nbsp; However, one good outcome this debate has brought about for Singapore and also fellow Singaporeans is the opportunity to showcase the commitment of this Government to transparency and good corporate governance.&nbsp; Ours is a Government that is not afraid to take issues onto the catwalk for everyone to give their views and opinions.&nbsp; We have read recently in the newspapers of how one country, after a coup, rewarded its top brass arbitrarily with a 30% rise in their pay&nbsp;without making any reference to the people.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the debate proper on the remuneration for our Ministers and the top echelons in the civil service, I call this a \"Three Cheers!\" announcement.&nbsp; The three cheers are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The graduated approach to the salary adjustment;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n(2)&nbsp; The increase in the variable component of salary and linking it to GDP growth;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting aside up to 25% of annual remuneration as individual performance bonus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the motion that top civil servants and Government leaders should be paid a reasonable package.&nbsp; I feel that there is really no parallel to compare the responsibilities of our leaders in civil service and politics to those of the top CEOs in the corporate world.&nbsp; Given a choice, who should fill the ministerial cabinet posts?&nbsp; The people who helm these posts will have to lead, plan and execute policies that will have such far-reaching ramifications on the entire population of Singapore. &nbsp;I guess my choice is clear.&nbsp; It should be the most capable men and women that we can find on this island.&nbsp; Their remunerations should commensurate with their portfolios and responsibilities, and the real question is:&nbsp;how much should that be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formula that has been put forth, based on the top eight earners of six professions, will always be open to questions.&nbsp; And, yes, there are many questions.&nbsp; One argument being bandied about is: why six?&nbsp; Why not average of 12 professions?&nbsp; Why these professions and not others?&nbsp; Why top 8 earners? &nbsp;Why not top 100 earners?&nbsp; Situation varies.&nbsp; Invariably, emotions set in, and the whole argument&nbsp;to pay or not to pay becomes clouded.&nbsp; Let us put emotions aside and focus on why we are here today to discuss on this topic again.&nbsp; What is our objective?&nbsp; Our aim is&nbsp;to look at the work of our Ministers as well as top civil servants and present a framework in which we can provide the necessary remuneration.&nbsp; The remuneration must be such that we can continue to attract the best talents to serve in the civil service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House had spent many hours debating this issue in 1994 and 2000.&nbsp; The benchmarks were debated and accepted.&nbsp; I do not think we need to debate on the benchmarks again, as long as the benchmarks remain relevant today as they were in 1994 or 2000.&nbsp; I think our Government should just stick to and honour the benchmarks for remuneration.&nbsp; If the Government wants to or&nbsp;is willing to review this benchmark again, may I suggest that we commission an independent committee comprising&nbsp;well respected individuals independent of our civil service and Government in our country to study and&nbsp;put forth their recommendations.&nbsp; This was suggested by other hon. Members of this House, Mr Alvin Yeo and Mdm Ho Geok Choo, yesterday as well.&nbsp; It is really awkward for the Government to review and propose its own remuneration.&nbsp; If the Government overpays the civil servants and the Ministers, it is not fair to the people.&nbsp; If the Government underpays the civil servants and the Ministers, it is not fair to the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first cheer, I would applaud the announcement that the increase in Ministers' remuneration be rolled out on a graduated scale.&nbsp; Our current team of Ministers, whether they are doctors, lawyers or engineers by profession, is not about to resign just because they are not getting any pay rise.&nbsp; They are individuals who have committed to serve the people.&nbsp; They are individuals who made personal sacrifices to serve the country.&nbsp; Underpinning this need to pay top salaries to attract top brains is our concern how can we continue to attract top&nbsp;brains to go into Government service in future.&nbsp; If we do not take action to adjust the remunerations to the agreed benchmarks, we risk sending the wrong signal to the younger talents who are potential Ministers-to-be.&nbsp; We risk losing them to the private sector now and we risk being unable to attract enough good talents into politics in the future.&nbsp; So, adjust the salary we must, but we need not do it in one step.&nbsp; I believe the graduated increase approach will be more palatable to the people at large, and they will then know that we are doing this exercise more&nbsp;for the future than&nbsp;for the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some argued that there must be a spirit of altruism for those who venture into the path of civil&nbsp;service, we have to be realistic.&nbsp; Let me draw an analogy in sports.&nbsp; Every sports man or woman would have a great passion for their sport, be it tennis, F1 race or golf.&nbsp; But even then, organisers have to raise huge sums of&nbsp;prize money, if they are to compete and make sure that they are able to attract the best personalities to take up the sports.&nbsp; Look at Wimbledon tennis, where the organisers have to raise the prize money to more than a million pounds.&nbsp; If they had kept the prize money to just 30,000 pounds, do you think that you will get that same level of competitiveness and energy in the sports?&nbsp; The tennis greats, such as&nbsp;Roger Federer and Pete Sampras,&nbsp;would probably be better off taking up golf and jostle for a chance to be the next Tiger Woods.&nbsp; The one million pounds invested in prize money have generated many more hundred million pounds in the tennis industry and commerce in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second cheer,&nbsp;I applaud the announcement of&nbsp;a larger portion of the&nbsp;remuneration adjustment to be paid as a variable component rather than a fixed salary.&nbsp; About half of this variable bonus will be based on the growth in our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which is the primary barometer of our economic health.&nbsp; However, we all know that a rise in GDP may not benefit all sectors of society equally and some may even lag behind.&nbsp; I would suggest that the Government consider using indicators that will directly impact on the livelihood of all Singaporeans, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or even the&nbsp;inflation rate.&nbsp; Keeping the CPI low will keep our cost of living affordable, and keeping our inflation rate low will protect our people's savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third cheer is the announcement&nbsp;linking 25% of&nbsp;remuneration to individual performance.&nbsp; It should not be an across-the-board standardised pay package for all&nbsp;who hold a ministerial post.&nbsp; Each Minister should be assessed, based on&nbsp;his contribution and its impact on improving the people's quality of life.&nbsp; This variable component should be subject to fluctuations, just&nbsp;like the variable component of the wages for all other workers in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, I should end by sharing this with the House.&nbsp; Jamaica has a population of 2.7 million.&nbsp; A news report on what the Ministers were getting in 2002 disclosed that the Prime Minister's salary, in Jamaican dollars, rose from $2.4 million to $4.7 million;&nbsp; the Finance Minister from $1.95 million to $3.8 million; Cabinet ministers from $1.8 million to $3.5 million; House Speaker from $1.6 million to $3.3 million.&nbsp; The pay issue was the subject of the Oliver Clarke Committee on Parliamentary Salaries, an independent committee that looked into the pay of Ministers and parliamentarians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just read you some extracts of what the <I>Jamaica Observer</I>&nbsp;said on this issue in its editorial:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We expect that there will be renewed debate over how MPs and members of the executive should be paid now that the Special Parliamentary Group (SPG) that was established to review the Clarke Report has tabled its report, and the matter is coming up again for debate in the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the members of the committee that was headed by Mr Oliver Clarke, this newspaper does not believe that Jamaican parliamentarians are overpaid or adequately compensated.&nbsp; Many who sit in the legislature or accept posts in the Cabinet or the executive could do far better in their professions or the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we accept Prime Minister Patterson's proposition that parliamentarians should receive 'some reasonable compensation in line with what obtains in other areas of professional life'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even as we support better salaries for those in the legislature - as one means of discouraging corruption - we want to be sure that taxpayers, going forward, receive an adequate return on their investments.&nbsp; The process, as proposed by the Clarke Committee, must ensure transparency and accountability and, and as far as possible, the linking of pay to outcomes.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, does&nbsp;that not sound very similar to what we are discussing today?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion,&nbsp;I support the Ministerial Statement on civil service salary revisions and give this Statement three cheers.&nbsp; I hope the Government will consider the suggestions of:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up an independent civil service salary review committee for future salary revisions; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to GDP, include the CPI, inflation rate and other global indices for the assessment of variable bonus for MPs, senior civil servants and Ministers.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Otherwise, it cannot sustain itself and definitely cannot grow.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is no different.&nbsp; It must continually attract some of the brightest and best to&nbsp;public service as political office-holders, Administrative Officers or officers in other branches of Government.&nbsp; There are also sensitive jobs in defence, intelligence, home security, foreign service, etc,&nbsp;that require people with good brains, firm hands and&nbsp;stout hearts.&nbsp; And because experience and judgement are of paramount importance, these officers need to be retained for many years.&nbsp;

Our competition is regional and international.&nbsp; Highly skilled physicians and surgeons&nbsp;do not come cheap.&nbsp; On top of that, we require them to be compassionate to all our patients and also to work together as a team.&nbsp; We also appeal to their sense of service and professionalism and, fortunately,&nbsp;part of the reward of a doctor is seeing his patients get better and walk out of hospital.&nbsp; Otherwise, pay has&nbsp;to go up higher and patients will have to bear bigger healthcare bills.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am therefore very sympathetic to challenges faced by the Prime Minister in attracting and retaining talents in the public sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to pay Ministers and civil servants adequately and fairly?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is one subject that never fails to excite the House, the press, the coffeeshop and, recently, cyberspace and its netizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also discovered that besides primary school education, every Singaporean is also an expert on Ministerial pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I take comfort in what the Prime Minister said recently at the Administrative Service Dinner.&nbsp; I quote, \"We pay competitive wages, attract and retain people of calibre and hold them to high standards of integrity and performance.\"&nbsp; However, he added, \"Financial rewards cannot be the main motivation of public officers.\"&nbsp; I agree with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, like all Singaporeans, will worry&nbsp;for Singapore the day people enter politics, or join public service in order to make a fortune, or worse, to enrich themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, in addition to their monetary compensation, there are other intangible but equally real rewards. Often, the satisfaction one gets from work of passion, sense of nation-building and the knowledge that one is improving the lives of fellow Singaporeans, far exceeds monetary rewards. Besides such personal satisfaction, Singaporeans look up to our Ministers and treat them with great respect.&nbsp; Most Singaporeans know that they are competent, honest and hardworking. We&nbsp;see them at the grassroots functions, community clubs, Parliament and in their Ministries. Newspaper reports have some of the Ministers appearing to&nbsp;have aged prematurely, mentioning Raymond&nbsp;and Vivian, I think,&nbsp;Swee Say too.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is easy to agree that Ministers' pay should not be pegged at a level to compensate them fully, as though they have remained in the private sector and progressed in the private sector.&nbsp; I think that&nbsp;may be deemed speculative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as&nbsp;taxpayers, we want to pay our Ministers and political office-holders&nbsp;adequately&nbsp;so that they will be able to provide a good home for their families, good education for their children, financial security for old age, and perhaps&nbsp;a little luxury every now and then. So we are not talking about a Spartan or priestly lifestyle. We certainly do not want our Ministers to be impoverished when they accept political office.&nbsp; This is especially so, now that we are no longer in our initial years of nation-building.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n<I>&nbsp;</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Moral authority</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, much has been said about moral authority and Ministers' salaries.&nbsp; I understand the sentiments but I fail to fathom the logic. I fully agree that there has to be a public service element of sacrifice in the total scheme of Ministers' compensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my mind, a Minister's moral authority is not proportional to the quantum of his forgone pay.&nbsp; His moral authority to govern has a lot more to do with this own moral fibre, integrity, intellectual honesty, his competence and his compassion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am comforted by the fact that the Government has shown restraint and consideration by increasing salaries in phases, over the next two years.&nbsp; They have also decided to&nbsp;take only 2/3 of the benchmark.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And more importantly, they have come to this House, openly and clearly explaining their position. And even if one disagrees&nbsp;with the way the benchmark is computed, one must respect them for their approach - open, fair, robust, no hypocrisy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, it is for the electorate to judge&nbsp;whether &nbsp;$2.2 million per annum for a Minister is fair and acceptable.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How important is monetary compensation in public service?&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey by HR experts Heidrick &amp; Struggles across the Asian Pacific region on \"Effectiveness of various HR policies with respect to employee retention\" states that of seven areas, two stand out,&nbsp;ie, the two&nbsp;most important things&nbsp;people look at&nbsp;- leadership development, which is training, coaching and mentoring,&nbsp;and long-term career planning, which is succession plans and&nbsp;career path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The survey found that companies that are exceptional in these two areas will be better able to retain their talent.&nbsp; These experts concluded, and I quote, \"So while compensation must remain competitive, it is not the primary driver of employee satisfaction.\"&nbsp; The first trigger for an employee to leave a company is usually related to career development and opportunities, or perceived lack thereof.&nbsp; Other factors are \"a favourable culture climate\", \"increased responsibilities\", \"community involvement\", \"promoting a favourable image\" and, lastly, \"monetary reward system\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is clear to me that the public sector actually possesses those very attributes that experts say should enable them to retain their officers. The civil service today is different from those in the&nbsp;sixties. Whilst the situation is no longer revolutionary, the job is still no less challenging.&nbsp; Besides, much is done in the area of leadership development and long-term career planning and we even have a Mentor in the Cabinet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, could it be that the Government is under-selling itself, that the situation&nbsp;is made to seem worse?&nbsp; Or could it be that the quoted&nbsp;5% is actually quite acceptable and that the Government should not try and aim at a zero-loss situation?&nbsp; So some attritions may be unavoidable. We should accept that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should also be remembered that not all separations are due to inadequate compensation. I recommend a book,&nbsp;\"The 7 Hidden Reasons&nbsp;Employees Leave\" by an expert,&nbsp;Leigh Branham. It is good reading.&nbsp; It tells you why people do not want to tell you the real reasons why they leave.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am relieved that a large part of the increase is pegged to performance of the individual as well as that of Singapore's GDP growth, and not just straight increase in the fixed salary component.&nbsp; Making Ministers' and senior civil servants' pay bear a greater relationship to their performance is indeed a good move.&nbsp; This is actually the situation in the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However, relying on GDP growth alone is, in my mind, a simple, convenient but inadequate measure.&nbsp; I propose the Government also take in at least one other indicator -&nbsp;that of the total costs of running the government as a percentage of total revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private sector CEOs have to ensure that&nbsp;profits are not consumed by increasing costs and expenses. &nbsp;Board of Directors looks to growth not only of the&nbsp;top line but as well as growth of the bottom line when they are evaluating the management performance. GDP growth unfortunately only measures the revenue or the top line. We impose that discipline on charities that, when they raise funds, they must not spend more than 30%.&nbsp; So similarly, we&nbsp;&nbsp;reward Ministers and senior civil servants better only if they can run the Government with increasing productivity and efficiency.&nbsp; Hard data on cost ratios will be more useful and compelling than general declarations of improving service and efficiency.&nbsp;That way, we can further lighten the tax burden for Singaporeans and corporations.&nbsp; More investments will result and&nbsp;more jobs should be created.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is a more refined way to align the interest of Ministers and senior civil servants to that of the society at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other portion of compensation is to be based on a Minister's personal performance. It will surely be up to the Prime Minister to assess&nbsp;the Ministers' performance. We do know that PM has his own KPIs for his Ministers and I expect them to be both exacting and demanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Benchmarking</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the current two-thirds M48 is a useful tool. &nbsp;It is better than the previous two-thirds average 24 adopted in the 1994 White Paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, choosing the top eight persons from each of the&nbsp;six professional groups is&nbsp;narrow and skewed. The top&nbsp;eight are actually extreme outliers. They actually constitute the top 0.04% of accountants, the top 0.12% of engineers and the top 0.24% of lawyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most compensation experts would recommend companies determining CEO salary ranges to be in the range of 75th percentile of comparable scope of responsibility and size of jobs, ie,&nbsp;pay according to the&nbsp; top 25% of comparable group if they wish to be competitive. &nbsp;However, we also note that where highly specialised skills are needed, there is often no choice for the company but to pay whatever compensation that will attract the candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it be possible to revise the benchmark two-thirds M48 to make it more broad-based and more reliable?&nbsp;May I therefore suggest to the Government to&nbsp;use the median salary of the top 5% of each of the&nbsp;six chosen professional groups instead of just the top&nbsp;eight persons?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the&nbsp;Government can remove the discount totally or keep it to 4/5 of whatever number instead, as benchmarking to the median salary of the top 5% may depress the benchmark salary. Whatever the quantum of discount decided by the Government, we will see that that is the portion which is the&nbsp;public service element of the pay that collectively Ministers and civil servants want to give to the society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken together, these&nbsp;two modifications will provide a more reliable benchmark not based on outliers but&nbsp;will&nbsp;be more consistent as we go forward. Such a benchmark should be&nbsp;more acceptable to the public too.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<I>Capping the increase</I><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in order to reassure taxpayers that in the future, there will still be moderation even as the Government reviews Ministerial pay, may I suggest that after this round of increase, there be a cap of cumulative increase of not more than 50% for any intervening five-year period?&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I believe, will help assuage the angst and sense of inequity felt in some quarters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, because the income gap between the top earners and the rest of society will continue to widen, it is even more important that we must ensure abundant opportunities for young Singaporeans to reach the top.&nbsp; We must ensure that all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language, religion, or socio-economic background&nbsp;have equal opportunities to reach the top. Then they too can enjoy the high pay that top earners command and their family can have a better life.<br>\r\n &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Pension</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, I applaud the Minister for remembering the pioneer batch of MPs and civil servants. These are people who have contributed much to Singapore.&nbsp; By this act, we are teaching our young that this is not a \"disposable\" society, like Kleenex tissue, use and throw.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is right to promote the culture of&nbsp; \"<I>yin shui si yuan</I> \" - remembering where the water comes from.&nbsp; Indeed, I propose that over and above this one-time payment, we should perhaps consider increasing their pension, as many of them are in their old age and a $380 pension may&nbsp;be insufficient if there is no&nbsp;family support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst I advocate a higher payout to the pioneer batch of nation builders, I propose that, going forward, the Government should do away with the pension scheme for political officer-holders and Administrative&nbsp;officers.&nbsp; The pension scheme is an antiquated retention tool. &nbsp;Most civil servants have been converted to the CPF scheme long ago.&nbsp; By the way, the private sector does not use pension anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is why management philosopher, Charles Handy, wrote about the&nbsp;'Doctrine of Enough' in his book, \"<I>The Hungry Spirit\".</I>&nbsp; He recommended that each of us&nbsp;needs to find&nbsp;our own personal level of what is \"enough\", so that we can be liberated to pursue our dreams and our purpose without being chained to our appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to make three key points today.&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I believe that the spirit of serving and giving is still alive in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;We need to be careful not to leave behind political and civil service officers that combine excessive levels of power and money.&nbsp; (3) If Government wishes to benchmark public servants with the private sector, then there&nbsp;are some principles around compensation practices&nbsp;which should be adopted, to simulate more closely private-sector norms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, why I believe that the desire to serve is still alive in Singapore.&nbsp; This week is a very special week for me.&nbsp; Two fellow volunteers -&nbsp; Linda Kho, Managing Director of a training consulting firm, and Mrs Ng Sock Kian, a Vice President in a bank&nbsp; -&nbsp; decided to take the plunge, turning their backs on the private sector to work full-time with me in&nbsp;the non-profit special needs community.&nbsp; They join another ex-Goldman Sachs HR regional director, Goh Boon Keng.&nbsp; All three ladies took pay cuts from half to two-thirds of their pay to serve in a cause they believe in.&nbsp; I share their names, not to put a badge of honour on them, but to illustrate this following point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Mentor is right in many things about Singapore.&nbsp; But his opinion that the real world of Singapore does not surface&nbsp;leaders who are willing to make sacrifices, to do something that they believe in, I say, is a tad too pessimistic.&nbsp; In fact, I know of a number of people who have tasted corporate success and are willing to rise above their power suits and perks to move on to serve in the non-profit sector.&nbsp; Not all of them have left and some of them are still looking for an inspiring vision and&nbsp;team to lend their talents to.&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself have served&nbsp;with many volunteers who gave of their time and money unconditionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spirit to serve without asking for much in return is still alive in Singapore.&nbsp; In fact, many of us still admire the courageous political heroes who took on Singapore's British colonial masters then, to create a family and nation of our own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, I would like to touch on power and money&nbsp; -&nbsp; the potently addictive motivators behind many human behaviours, and to caution this House that we need to be careful not to leave behind political and civil service officers that combine excessive levels of power and money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the general argument is this.&nbsp; If we do not pay leaders high enough, we will never be able to attract the right people.&nbsp; I ask the House to consider this contrarian view.&nbsp; I say that if we do not balance and we concentrate too much power and money in top public officers, it might not attract the right people.&nbsp; On the contrary, we might attract the wrong people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, public office holders and top civil servants wield the most power in our country.&nbsp; This power to swing national policies and even the power of king-making does not carry a price tag that is easily written, and is a very significant component of that position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides power, money is the other top motivator behind many people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Put together, power and money can be potently addictive.&nbsp; As responsible leaders, we must be careful not to leave behind a system or structure that combines power and monetary rewards to such high levels that incumbents are so handcuffed by this lethal combination that they find it hard to let go.&nbsp; And worse,&nbsp;it creates an office that potential candidates are so attracted to that they may go for broke just to get there, whether they are suitable or not.&nbsp; This potentially can do more harm than good to Singapore -&nbsp;something that will not augur well for our country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next point is on public versus private sector.&nbsp; I would submit that working in the public sector is not exactly the same as working in the private sector, and I do not mean state-owned enterprises.&nbsp; Ex-Permanent Secretary Ngiam Tong Dow was yesterday quoted in the House on how he did not have to lose sleep over the bottom line when he was serving in the civil service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my fellow volunteers in the Enabling Master Plan for Disabled and a Managing Director of a foreign bank told me that his job can disappear tomorrow if he does not perform or if there is a corporate reorganisation somewhere in headquarters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When I was working in a local conglomerate and involved in company turn-around projects, I witnessed first-hand the high drop-out rates of top executives-turned-entrepreneurs who could not stomach the&nbsp;tough work of producing consistent enough profit levels that qualify them for&nbsp;public listing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Singaporeans know the painful journeys that successful technopreneurs like Sim Wong Hoo of Creative Technologies, Olivia Lum of Hyflux and Wong Ngit Liong of Venture Manufacturing&nbsp;went through before they finally got their millions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, it is the general perception of many Singaporeans that the degree of job security in the Singapore public service is relatively high and working there is not exactly working in Wall Street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, not all highly-paid CEOs of legal firms or banks are top candidate choices to be Ministers or top civil servants.&nbsp; By the same token, not all top political and civil service leaders may excel in the private sector.&nbsp; So I do agree that those precious few who are able to thrive in both public and private sectors are Singapore's crown jewels and they are worth millions of dollars.&nbsp; Even so, I think once that special leader crosses over to serve in&nbsp;a public office, it is futile for him to keep looking over his shoulders to yearn for what he could have made.&nbsp; Alan Greenspan, economist and former US Federal Reserve Chairman, who spent almost 20 years serving four Presidents, was reported to have accepted an annual pay of only US$180,000.&nbsp; When he finally retired in 2006, he still had a fruitful career due to his influence and expertise.&nbsp; He donated free service to the UK Treasury and is now also a highly sought-after speaker with a price tag of US$100,000 per talk.&nbsp; Alan Greenspan is a good illustration of a respected and skilled leader who is highly capable of working in the private sector but chose to serve his country below his market value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, if Government wishes to pay and benchmark public servants against private sector pay instead of against other governments, then it should simulate the work environment as close as that in the private sector.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp;start adopting some principles around compensation practices that resemble more closely the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I propose five compensation practices for consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice 1.&nbsp; Set up an independent senior salaries review body comprising independent representatives from various key sectors in Singapore.&nbsp; The principle of not writing one's own pay cheque is very key in addressing public disquiet on this issue.&nbsp; The United Kingdom Senior Salaries Review Body, which proposes political and civil service pay, for instance, comprises senior executives from the private sector, HR and finance consultancy, academia and so forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Public perception of this body's independence is just as critical as the body's real independence.&nbsp; In the corporate sector, there is already an uproar over how some CEOs influence their boards to write themselves excessive pay cheques, even to the extent of being paid hefty sums upon exit due to poor performance.&nbsp; A 2005 study on \"CEO Skill and Excessive Pay\" by Professors from Stanford, Wharton School and the New York University concluded that particularly in big stable firms, a high salary does not necessarily mean that a CEO is more competent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice 2.&nbsp; Establish a line of sight that shows clearly the link between pay and performance of political and civil service leaders.&nbsp; Make key performance indicators (KPIs) transparent so that the people of Singapore know how the leaders have contributed to the Prime Minister's vision of an inclusive and vibrant Singapore in which no one is left behind.&nbsp; Do not simply use one global helicopter KPI like the size of Singapore's GDP as the basis for performance-based component like bonus.&nbsp; How does the Health Minister, for instance, see his Ministry's good performance linked directly to the GDP?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation best practice dictates that there be a clear line of sight between one's pay packet and his direct performance.&nbsp; In the case of public servants, I believe that performance-based pay can tie in to at least three tiers:&nbsp; (1) country's performance, not just economic; (2) each Ministry's performance; and (3) each individual's performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely, performance indicators like the customer's or the citizen's feedback to major public services, the number of jobs created for local Singaporeans, percentage of Singaporeans in the lowest-income bracket, the number of Singaporeans who choose to migrate, etc, are all KPIs that can be incorporated in a balanced score card of our top leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice 3.&nbsp; Adopt a more commonly acceptable salary benchmarking formula.&nbsp; In the private sector, it is rare to see the use of the current salary benchmarking formula which targets only a very small number of top wage earners in the sector that they compete in.&nbsp; Actually, one key questionable underlying assumption of the current formula is that 100% of all the political office-holders, every Permanent Secretary and&nbsp;every Administrative Officer will surely end up as&nbsp;top wage earners in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most firms I know set their target competitive rates at either the 50th or the 75th percentile of target employee categories in selected companies and industries, but never at such a small number of top wage earners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice 4.&nbsp; Adopt a broader band pay range for each position that we are talking about, to cater to appropriate salary levels for incumbents ranging from those with entry-level skills to those critical skills experts or long-term outstanding performers.&nbsp; Hence, hypothetically using $1.2 million as&nbsp;a mid point for a Minister's pay and a minimum-to-maximum spread of 60%, the minimum pay for entry-level Minister can be $840,000,&nbsp;or 30% below mid point; a mature performer&nbsp;gets $1.2 million and a consistent top performer gets close to $1.6 million, or 30% above mid point.&nbsp; So, adopt a broader band pay range for each position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice 5.&nbsp; Cultivate more lasting and non-monetary motivators to usher in and retain good people to join the public sector.&nbsp; Simply throwing money at the problem does not solve it.&nbsp; There is no quick-fix solution to talent attraction and retention, and there are numerous best practices in this field.&nbsp; Many employers, though, find it harder to walk the talk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;March 2007,&nbsp;a <I>Harvard Business Review</I> article entitled \"What it means to work here\", the authors lament at their HR equivalent of keeping up with the Joneses.&nbsp; The authors said that in their quest to find and retain top talent, organisations often try to match competitors' salary offers and training opportunities.&nbsp; They forget that people will become long-term deeply engaged employees only if their work experience is what they expect it&nbsp;to be, and they are intrigued and excited by a vision that they find inspiring; a leader they want to follow and work roles that match their passion and their talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, may I even suggest that for the sake of Singapore, we should release the 32-year-olds who, after serving their bonds, may want to respond to a different drum beat in their lives or simply want to expose themselves to a different work environment whilst they are still young.&nbsp; If they stay on, because they are handcuffed&nbsp;by a&nbsp;super pay scale or their pension, it is a lose-lose situation for them and the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, the issue of pay is a sensitive one.&nbsp; Someone earning $1,000 can never fathom another who is earning $10,000.&nbsp; A person earning $10,000 will never understand how another who is earning $100,000 a month still feels is not sufficient.&nbsp; For someone like Minister Mentor who will be remembered by all of us as the father of Singapore, how does one even find a price tag big enough for his contribution?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is enough?&nbsp; We may never agree.&nbsp; But let me end&nbsp;with the writing of Charles Handy who said, \"The philosophy of \"enough\" cannot be imposed on a society.&nbsp; It is a matter of norms, not law.&nbsp; But norms are set by the elite, whose examples set the fashion.&nbsp; What the top people do today, the middle level imitates tomorrow, and the bottom aspires&nbsp;to, some day.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people who follow us are watching us.&nbsp; Our young people are also watching us.&nbsp; So it is the people sector, where many are professionals who volunteer their service and money unconditionally all these years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I urge our leaders to give some more thought on what is reasonable enough for top leaders' salaries, whilst considering the five compensation practices I quoted.&nbsp; At the same time, I urge that together, Members of this House will make it a priority to ensure that everyone in Singapore has a real chance of also being able to reach their personal level of \"enough\".</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Over the last few weeks, I had dialogues with a number of union leaders. Many of them asked me: \"Why is $1.2 million still not enough?&nbsp; Is this debate about $10.5 million worth of salary increase for the Ministers or is it more to this?&nbsp; And, if so, what is the real issue?\"&nbsp; I explained to them that this is about attracting the right people and the best team to lead the nation and to serve the people.&nbsp; And I told them that this is important because having enough jobs is the best welfare for our workers and having a clean and capable government is the best protection for our people.\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, way back in 1991 to 1993, I spent two years based in New York City working for the EDB.&nbsp; Once I called on the Chairman of a Fortune-500 company&nbsp;- one of the top companies in the world - and he told me that he was very impressed by Singapore Incorporated.&nbsp; He said there was one thing we have in common between Singapore and his company, that is, both of us compete very aggressively in this global economy.&nbsp; In his case, the company has to compete for business revenue.&nbsp; In the case of Singapore Inc., we have to compete for investment and total business spending.&nbsp; In his case, as a Chairman, he has to sustain profitable growth.&nbsp; In our case, we have to sustain economic and job growth.&nbsp; He said that it was not easy for companies to compete successfully, and he fully realised and recognised that it was even more difficult for a country to do so. And he said that he was very impressed because Singapore competed as a Singapore Incorporated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members may feel that the public sector does not work hard enough.&nbsp; I beg to differ.&nbsp; I spent 21 years as a civil servant.&nbsp; And for those of you who think that our civil servants do not work hard enough, just try to say it to our PUB whose staff worked many years to produce NEWater to solve our water problem and to supply NEWater to wafer fab.&nbsp; Just talk to MND and URA - how hard they have to work to find the land needed for our wafer fabrication parks in Ang Mo Kio, Woodlands, Tampines and Pasir Ris.&nbsp; Just talk to our JTC - how at one time, they had to work round-the-clock because the piece of land allocated to a wafer fab park turned out to be an illegal dumping ground, and there was no record that it was an illegal dumping ground.&nbsp; So when they dug the ground, they discovered loads of rubbish underground.&nbsp; In fact, they had to work day and night because we had to meet the deadline that we promised to investors.&nbsp; Just try talking to the EDB - whose staff have been travelling around the world to secure investments, to create jobs for Singapore, and the list goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore Inc. has indeed done very well. As a result, we are today one of the countries with the highest employment rate and the lowest unemployment rate.&nbsp; This is something we all can be proud of.&nbsp; However, let us recognise that this job is never done, because the journey of economic development is one with no end.&nbsp; We have to press on for the benefit of our workers and our people.&nbsp; Yesterday, our pioneering leaders created labour-intensive jobs; today, we are creating skill, technology, and capital-intensive jobs; tomorrow, the next thing we have to go on is to create more innovation and knowledge-intensive jobs for the future generation of Singaporeans.&nbsp; In other words, the process of creating better job, better pay, better life is a journey with no end.&nbsp; This is the reason why yesterday we built Jurong Industrial Estate; today, we build wafer fabrication parks; we build chemical island at Jurong, we build Biopolis at OneNorth, and so on.&nbsp; And the task tomorrow will get even bigger and more challenging.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; When we say that competition in the future will be stronger and bigger, many people think that this is just a slogan.&nbsp; Sir, let me assure you that this is all real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago, Intel, a company that EDB has been promoting since the 1970s, decided to build their wafer fab plant in Dalian of China.&nbsp; This wafer fab plant is going to produce 12-inch wafer fab.&nbsp; It involves about US$2.5 billion worth of investment and it is going to create more than 1,500 jobs.&nbsp; By the year 2010, when this plant is up and running, my guess is that by then, China will surpass Singapore not just in terms of wafer fab production capacity but maybe in terms of technological capabilities as well.&nbsp; In other words, competition will get stronger and better all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is nothing we can do to stop the competition from getting better and bigger.&nbsp; But I explained to our workers and union leaders that there is one thing we can do, ie, to do whatever necessary to make sure that we have the right people and the best team to lead Singapore.&nbsp; Because that is our best bet of transforming Singapore Incorporated of today into a Singapore Unlimited of tomorrow in the world of unlimited competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is another reason why we have to work together to make sure that we have the right people and the best team to lead Singapore.&nbsp; When the Chairman of that MNC complimented Singapore for Singapore Inc., I told him one thing.&nbsp; I said: \"Thank you very much for your compliment.&nbsp; But there is one big difference between your company and Singapore Incorporated as a country.&nbsp; Both of us, you as a company and we as a country, have to restructure as fast as we can to stay ahead of competition. But there is one big difference. In your case, you can retrench your workers.&nbsp; In our case, we cannot retrench our citizens.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, we not only have to create new jobs for the young, for the better educated, we also have to take care of workers of all ages.&nbsp; Today, if you look at Singapore, what do we have?&nbsp; We have programmes for the low-wage workers, for the mature workers and for the PMETs.&nbsp; For the low-wage workers&nbsp;- we talk about JRP (Job Re-creation), SRP (Skills Re-development). For the mature workers - we talk about re-employment.&nbsp; For the PMETs, Dr Ng Eng Hen announced a few weeks ago in this House the Professionals Conversion Programme, and I was told the response has been tremendous.&nbsp; The various agencies, NTUC and WDA are working together in running a series of seminars and workshops for these PMETs.&nbsp; And for our blue-collar workers, we are now stepping up re-deployment.&nbsp; You may not be aware, Sir.&nbsp; Based on the data collected by the unions, we notice recently that the workers affected by retrenchment today are getting younger and younger.&nbsp; In the manufacturing sector, my colleague, Ms Cham Hui Fong, told me that two years ago, 41% of the retrenched workers were less than 40 years old. It went up to 48%.&nbsp; And last year, it was 51%.&nbsp; In other words, we have to find ways to help many of these workers to keep up the pace of change in terms of re-deployment as the pace of restructuring gets faster and faster, affecting more and more workers, including the younger workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, not only do we have to compete as a Singapore Unlimited in future. Equally important, if not more importantly, we must also take care of each other as one Singapore United. For these two reasons - Singapore United and Singapore Unlimited - I believe it is important that we work together to make sure that we find the right people to form the best team to lead Singapore into the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of leaders do we need?&nbsp; I think it is the three \"Hs\".&nbsp; The first \"H\" is people with a thinking head, otherwise they will not be able to lead us in competing as Singapore Unlimited.&nbsp; The second \"H\" are leaders with a caring heart, if not they cannot lead us as Singapore United.&nbsp; And, thirdly, most of all, these potential leaders with thinking head and a caring heart must also have a pair of clean \"hands\"; in other words, no corruption.&nbsp; Every dollar we collect from businesses must go to the Government and every dollar we spend must be for the benefit of the people.&nbsp; I read in the newspapers today and I heard Mr Chiam spoke in the House yesterday. He said that the Singapore Government has set a new Guinness World of Records of Ministers with the highest salary in the world.&nbsp; I would like to ask Mr Chiam:&nbsp; is he referring to \"clean\" wage or \"dirty\" wage?&nbsp; Because there is a big difference between \"clean\" wage and \"dirty\" wage.&nbsp; A wife of a visiting Minister came to Singapore.&nbsp; My wife accompanied her for shopping at Raffles Hotel. Apparently, she went in and she just told the shopkeeper - I want this, this, and that, and the shopkeeper put everything together and the bill came up to tens of thousands of dollars.&nbsp; And that lady, the wife of the Minister, did not pay a single cent because she had friends who were with her who took out from their handbags not credit cards but a stack of papers and paid everything in cash.&nbsp; In other words, many of these Ministers, so to speak, have mobile ATM - automated teller machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, civil servants too.&nbsp; I was in Siem Reap over the weekends with Buona Vista grassroots leaders.&nbsp; I asked the tour leader, \"When you fall sick, where do you go?\"&nbsp; He said, \"I go to a public hospital.\"&nbsp; I asked, \"How is the public hospital?\"&nbsp; He said, \"It&rsquo;s not bad.&nbsp; The price is not too expensive but the UTM can be very expensive.\"&nbsp; I asked, \"What do you mean by UTM?\"&nbsp; He said, \"Under-table money.\"&nbsp; And I asked him why did he need to pay under-table money, and he said, \"Because if you want to get good care, or you want your parents to get good care, you have to pay UTM so that the nurses and doctors will take good care of you.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I want to emphasise this point about clean wage and dirty wage because these have tremendous impact on the life of the workers.&nbsp; One government - I will not mention which one, but not the Singapore Government - lamented to the NTUC that they wished that their unions can be as constructive as NTUC.&nbsp; So my NTUC colleagues, union leaders, told them, \"Look, your government hopes you can be as constructive as the NTUC.\"&nbsp; And their union leaders told our union leaders, \"You please tell our government that the day when our government behaves like the Singapore Government, that is the day when we will behave like the NTUC of Singapore.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, win-win-win tripartism is crucial to enhance and protect the well-being of Singaporeans and Singaporean workers, and this can only be possible if we have a clean and capable government in charge of Singapore.&nbsp; These are the two strong reasons, I feel, that we must do whatever necessary to ensure that we have the right people and the best team in place - to realise our vision of Singapore United and Singapore Unlimited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the next question is: how are we going to compete for these right people to form the best team?&nbsp; Mr Market rewards successful corporate leaders.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because these corporate leaders are able to generate profit for the stakeholders and at the same time give better bonuses to the workers.&nbsp; So, successful corporate leaders are rewarded by Mr Market. As a people, we cannot wait for Mr Market to reward our national leaders, our political leaders.&nbsp; The question is, as a people, do we value the contributions and commitment of our national leaders?&nbsp; Our national leaders are different from corporate leaders.&nbsp; Corporate leaders are very good in making money, very good in growing business and growing corporations.&nbsp; But our national leaders are very good in changing the life of the people for the better.&nbsp; The question is: how do we attach a value to this?&nbsp; Since Mr Market is not going to attach a value to that, we, as a people, have to decide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at Singapore, if ever we are going to have a record in the Guinness Book of Records, I do not think that the entry proposed by Mr Chiam is the right one&nbsp;- that Singapore has got itself a world record in terms of Ministers' salary.&nbsp; My proposal would be that we have set the record in the Guinness Book for being a country that is able to transform the entire nation from a third world country to a first world country in one generation.&nbsp; And I do not think there are too many countries in the world that are able to achieve it.&nbsp; Looking ahead, our challenge is to keep staying in this First-World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I see it, Mr Speaker, Sir, the real and urgent issue facing the House today is how fast we can move to keep attracting the right people to form the best team.&nbsp; Let me make a confession here.&nbsp; The Prime Minister has heard it before and I want to speak very frankly.&nbsp; I used to hold a lot of reservations about this benchmarking of Ministers' pay, and the Prime Minister knows my view.&nbsp; But, lately, I changed my mind.&nbsp; And this is the reason why today I am standing here speaking with conviction. What makes me change my mind?&nbsp; My union leaders asked me, \"SG Lim Swee Say, SG Lim Boon Heng served us for 25 years,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>13 years as our Secretary-General. He did not resign, and he was not unhappy being paid $1.2 million. So if the Government decided not to increase your pay, are you going to be unhappy?&nbsp; Are you going to resign as Secretary-General of NTUC?\"&nbsp; I told them a story.&nbsp; I said, one day, I walked down the street, I saw this lady from behind, wearing a T-shirt and written on the back was \"The answer is No\".&nbsp; I thought this was interesting.&nbsp; What was the question in front?&nbsp; So I overtook her and looked in front, and written in front was \"The answer is still No\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I told my union leaders, \"Doesn't matter what happens to the pay increase, Lim Swee Say will always be happy serving the workers and labour movement.&nbsp; Lim Swee Say will never resign.\"&nbsp; So they said, \"If that's the case, there is no issue.&nbsp; There is no need to increase the pay then.\" I told them that the issue is not whether this old Lim Swee Say will be unhappy or will resign.&nbsp; I said you should ask yourself this question, \"Today, this old Lim Swee Say is 52 years.&nbsp; By the year 2011 general election, the old Lim Swee Say will be 57 years.&nbsp; By the next general election in 2016, if the old Lim Swee Say is still around, he will be 62 years old.\" I told them, \"If you think through this carefully, Lim Swee Say, 52 years old, is not the oldest in the Cabinet and yet, according to my own assessment, I think for the good of the country, I should just stand for one more general election.\"&nbsp; By 2016, when I am 62 years and if I still have to stand for election to serve as the Secretary-General of NTUC and as a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, I think it must tell something that our efforts in attracting the best people to form the best team must have run into some difficulties.&nbsp; It is therefore in our interests to focus our minds on this.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, in my view, the most important and urgent issue today facing us in this debate on the Minister's pay is really one of how do we attract young Singaporeans to come forward to serve, and the process must start now.&nbsp; The process must not wait. I was asked, two weeks ago, \"Mr Lim, is it a good time to increase wages?\"&nbsp; I told them there is no such thing as good time or bad time.&nbsp; I said we must do it all the time.&nbsp; And I think some people misunderstood me.&nbsp; They think that Lim Swee Say said \"Do all the time\" means keep increasing Ministers' pay everyday!&nbsp; That is not what I meant.&nbsp; When I said we must do it all the time, I mean we must attract the best talent possible all the time because the process of forming a new and best team must be a non-stop one.&nbsp; We have to quicken our pace to keep reaching out to those Singaporeans with a globalised brain and a pro-Singapore heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where do these people come from - young Singaporeans who have globalised brain and pro-Singapore heart?&nbsp; One important source would be the civil service.&nbsp; I look at my fellow Cabinet colleagues, quite a number of us came from the civil service - Chee Hean, George Yeo, Hng Kiang, Tharman, Boon Wan, and so on.&nbsp; It is important that we keep the wage system in the civil service competitive because not only do we need a good civil service but equally, if not more important, we must make sure that the civil service will continue to be a source of future national leaders.&nbsp; And yet, at the same time, some of these best brains of the future must come through the private sector because diversity is strength.&nbsp; If we want to compete as Singapore unlimited, that private sector background is critical and crucial.&nbsp; The challenge of course is that these globalised brains and pro-Singapore hearts in the private sector are also the ones who are very good in making money.&nbsp; And that is the reason why we have to find ways to attract them by reducing the wage gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was in Siem Reap, the tour leader said something very interesting.&nbsp; I do not know how it came about but it just came up. He said, \"You know, when there is water, there will be fishes.&nbsp; When there are fishes, there will be food.&nbsp; When there is food, there will be people.&nbsp; When there are people, there will be civilisation.\"&nbsp; It is a very profound statement. When I heard that, I told myself that I must share this with Members in this House.&nbsp; Because what we are talking about basically is this.&nbsp; How do we attract some of the best brains in Singapore, the best potential leaders in Singapore, to basically help us to produce \"water\"?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because we must have water so that there will be fishes, so that there will be food, so that there will be people and there will be civilisation.&nbsp; So water is the basic building block.&nbsp; There is nothing glamorous about producing water.&nbsp; That is the reason why I think some management theory talked about the \"rain-maker\". The \"rain-makers\" are the people whom people look up to because they make rain and when they make rain, there is water and the whole tribe benefits from the rain.&nbsp; In other words, we have to look for more of these \"rain-makers\" so that they will make rain and create water for Singapore Unlimited and Singapore United to survive and grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my grassroots leaders then asked me, \"Mr Lim, if the issue is really about attracting new blood, new Lim Swee Say to come into politics, into Cabinet, why not let the old Lim Swee Say stay on with $1.2 million and let the new Lim Swee Say have the $2.2 million?\"&nbsp; I looked at him and said, \"For the old Lim Swee Say to take $1.2 million is not the problem.\"&nbsp; But let me ask you this question, \"If I old Lim Swee Say declare I stay on $1.2 million, when the new Lim Swee Say comes into politics, the media will ask him, \"New Lim Swee Say, are you on $1.2 million or are you on $2.2 million?\"&nbsp; The new Lim Swee Say said, \"Oh, I am on $2.2 million.\"&nbsp; Then the next question will be, \"Why are you less committed than the old Lim Swee Say?&nbsp; Old Lim Swee Say is happy with $1.2 million.&nbsp; Why do you need $2.2 million?\"<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on a serious note, what we have to ask ourselves is: are we serious about doing whatever necessary to attract some of the right people, the best brains, to form the best team?&nbsp; If so, let us not try to dance around this tough decision. It is a difficult decision, but it has to be done.&nbsp; Let us do it.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the whole process of attracting the right people to form the best team is difficult and challenging and I hope that we do not underestimate it. I read somewhere that once MM Lee was asked for his assessment of his Cabinet. His reply was that this is the best team he could put together.&nbsp; And somebody interpreted what he said to mean that he did not say that this is the best team in absolute terms. He just said that this is the best team he could put together.&nbsp; In other words, let us recognise that, at the end of the day, attracting the best talents is not so simple - just because you want to attract them, they will come in. We can only attract those whom we are able to attract, and these are obviously those with the passion to serve.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I feel that we have to do a lot more because the new Lim Swee Say of the future must be a lot better than the old Lim Swee Say of today.&nbsp; Otherwise, our vision of Singapore Unlimited and Singapore United would not be realised. There is one big difference between the way we nurture leaders in the corporate world versus the political arena.&nbsp; It is something I would like to share, having gone through it for the last few years.&nbsp; In the private sector, the union leaders used to say that when you have a good CEO, be happy but do not be too happy, because you will not be happy forever.&nbsp; When they come across a bad CEO, they said, be sad but do not be too sad, because you will not be sad forever.&nbsp; Because that is the nature of the private sector world - CEOs come and go.&nbsp; If you are good, the market will poach you. If you are bad, the market will fire you.&nbsp; So they keep moving.&nbsp; But in the case of the political leadership, it cannot be done that way. Some of us may have this impression that we can just go out and get people to come in and try them out for five years.&nbsp; If it works, it works.&nbsp; If it does not work, next term we drop them, find a new Minister and a new Cabinet.&nbsp; It does not work that way.&nbsp; Policy formulation has got tremendous implications.&nbsp; Here, we are talking about the lives of Singaporeans, we are talking about the jobs of the workers.&nbsp; It is something that is not to be taken lightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would say, let us be realistic, let us be serious about how we can really go out there to attract the best brains.&nbsp; I heard a lot of talk about whether we can adopt a more idealistic approach like going for people who are prepared to sacrifice everything to come in to serve.&nbsp; Yes, I think there are people with good brains, there are people with a good heart.&nbsp; But we do not have enough good people with both good brains and good hearts.&nbsp; Because if there are enough people with good brains and good hearts in this world, then how do we explain there are so many bad governments in this world?&nbsp; On this basis, I am very sure that having a good government with Ministers with good brains and good hearts cannot happen by chance.&nbsp; It must be through a conscious effort.&nbsp; Therefore, at the end of the day, when we talk about moral authority, my sense is very simple.&nbsp; If a Minister were to tell the people that he is drawing low salary but pockets big money, I think he has no moral authority to lead.&nbsp; If a Minister has promised to change the life of the people for the better, but at the end of the day, the only better life is his own life, he has no moral authority to lead.&nbsp; If a Minister is a \"NATO\" (no action, talk only), every time a problem happens, he blames everybody except himself, then he has got no moral authority.&nbsp; But if a Minister, through some transparent formula, is prepared to accept a clean wage and does his very best to create opportunities for the people and to change the life of the people for the better, then I think there is no reason why he cannot command our respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me continue in Mandarin please.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070410/20070410VS_082113.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a> *.</I>]&nbsp; My father and I were 17 years old when we went overseas for the first time.&nbsp; But there was one difference, ie, when my father went overseas when he was 17 years old, he left his native place and he came from China to Singapore to seek a livelihood. After which, he settled down in Singapore.&nbsp; For me, the situation was different.&nbsp; When I was 17 years old, the first time I went out of Singapore was to Johor for mountain climbing, because I was on a trip together with my National Junior college classmates. Back then, I was very confident of getting a scholarship.&nbsp; I was looking forward to going overseas for study and was full of confidence and hope for my future.&nbsp; During my father's time, he was living in a totally different environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, coincidentally, my son is also turning 17 years old.&nbsp; Next month, he will be 17.&nbsp; But he is different from me and my father.&nbsp; He does not need to wait to be 17 years old before he could go overseas.&nbsp; In fact, when he was&nbsp;two years old, he already went overseas with me to New York. And now, today, my son goes to a good school for education, and he has a good computer for his good fun.&nbsp; If he studies hard, I do believe that he will have a good job and a good career.&nbsp; In other words, my father, my son and I have different fates because under Singapore's political leadership we have been able to progress from a Third-World country into a First-World country within a generation.&nbsp; Even so, I am still worried over the future of Singapore.&nbsp; Why so?&nbsp; Even though I know that my 17-year-old son has a bright future, one thing I cannot be sure of is that when he gets married with kids, when his children turn 17&nbsp;- 30 years from now if I am lucky -&nbsp; are we certain to say that Singapore can still have a prosperous economy?&nbsp; This I am not sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that if we want to safeguard our own future, we have to take the necessary actions to continuously attract the younger generations, the best talents, with an enthusiastic heart, who will put the country and people before oneself, as well as serve the country with one's heart and might. If we can do that, I would be confident that our future generation, our children or grandchildren, will have a safe and stable country, as well as a prosperous economy to live in and pursue their dreams.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">* Cols. 365-366.\r\n<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):&nbsp; Sir, when I was based in New York City, every night at 10 o'clock, one station would broadcast the 10 o'clock news. At the beginning of the news, some voice would come on and say, \"It is now 10 o'clock.&nbsp; Do you know where your children are?\" This is because in the early 1990s, the New Yorkers were very concerned about the safety of their children.&nbsp; So, every night, at 10 o'clock, before the news came on, it said, \"It is now 10 o'clock.&nbsp; Do you know where your children are?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, here, in Singapore, we need not worry too much about the safety of our children.&nbsp;

Do you know who our future Prime Minister and future Ministers are?\"&nbsp; Sir, my answer is, \"no, not yet\".&nbsp; What about you?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But I think I am quite puzzled and I am&nbsp;saying, why should it be?&nbsp; We have recently read about the CEO of ST Engineering being paid probably about $2.8 million a year.&nbsp; Are the employees of ST Engineering very unhappy?&nbsp; So I called up some of them.&nbsp; I asked them whether they are upset that their boss, the CEO, is actually paid that much.&nbsp; And they told me, \"Of course not.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;I then added, \"If he is paid a fraction lesser, maybe the rest of you could get a bit more.\"&nbsp; But they told us, \"No.&nbsp; As a boss who runs a company with a turnover of millions of dollars, we want to hold him responsible, that he must know that earning this much of money, he has this obligation to fulfil to his people, that he should be there to provide good jobs, and good-paying jobs, for his employees in ST Engineering.\"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why are they not quarrelling and debating on how much their CEO should be paid?&nbsp; Some would say that, well, because they have no authority to do so.&nbsp; If they are not happy, at the most they quit.&nbsp; But, more importantly, what we have realised is that the workers are able to see what the management has done that has a lot of positive impact on their pay packets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To many people&nbsp;we spoke to, there is probably no price tag to leadership.&nbsp; How do you price leaders?&nbsp; One million dollars?&nbsp; Two million dollars?&nbsp; There is actually no price tag, although&nbsp;a lot of people on the street just cannot understand.&nbsp; One million dollars is not enough?&nbsp; One hundred percent pay jump?&nbsp; They find that this is probably a bit too much for them to accept.&nbsp; But, in my view, there are probably flaws in any benchmark.&nbsp; We can use any kind of benchmark, there will still be flaws.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawyers and doctors or corporate leaders cannot be compared to the political leaders that we have today.&nbsp; The Government needs a more acute strategic understanding of the world that we are operating in.&nbsp; We are also competing in an environment today where all the familiar signposts are already no longer the same, and we need people to be able to look at the changes rapidly.&nbsp; Our public officers that are led by the Ministers or the leaders must be able to see the changes.&nbsp; We need thinkers, planners and, of course, doers and implementers, to ensure that Singapore continues to prosper and thrive.&nbsp; Therefore, we cannot afford a Government that fails.&nbsp; We have spoken to our people.&nbsp; For example, SIA can fail, but Singapore cannot fail as an air hub.&nbsp; DBS Bank probably can fail, but Singapore again cannot fail as a financial hub, because the stakes are probably too much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, there is this very high expectation on the deliverables of our Government.&nbsp; And because of this high expectation, I think what we are expecting from them is tremendous, compared to any&nbsp;corporations that we can think&nbsp;of.&nbsp; Then, again, we ask ourselves: what is the purpose of having this four-day debate on this?&nbsp; Do we have a good Government that our people can trust?&nbsp; Can we sleep in peace when, say, we are attacked by SARS or when terrorism is actually threatening everywhere around the globe?&nbsp; The answer today must be, \"Yes\".&nbsp; Why then&nbsp;is there this big hoo-ha again over these extra millions of dollars that we are paying when, if you look at the Budget, we are already giving so many tens of millions of dollars back to the people, whether it is on account of GST, PESA, or many others?&nbsp; Why are we&nbsp;spending so much time to quibble over these few million dollars that we are paying to the architects of our first-class society?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think the flaw of the system today is that the voters do not have a proper assessment of the real person behind the scene, ie, the architect, the people who work behind the scene, or even those Ministers that are fronting the scene, and people who work behind the policies.&nbsp; More importantly, people are not able to have a good assessment of the kind of rationale and objective of why and how policies are being shaped and how these will impact the people's lives.&nbsp; What we hope to see is, when this debate is over, which we are quite sure that the chances are that it will be supported by all,&nbsp;that the Government, led by this team of Ministers, together with the support of the public officers, will continue to work and ensure that whatever policies that we are implementing - the way we present the policies and talk to the people, whether it will impact the lower-income workers, the PMETs, the older workers -&nbsp;these people on the ground can better appreciate what the Government has done over the years and enable them to better link, eg,&nbsp;the standard of living that we have today, the better life that we have, the better life that we expect our next generation will have, to&nbsp;leadership by this Government, that we will continue to be led by a good, competent&nbsp;Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have&nbsp;more discerning Singaporeans today.&nbsp; They are better able to judge.&nbsp; But we will have to continue to give this human touch to illustrate what the Government has done over the years and will continue to do.&nbsp; This is to also ensure that whatever we are doing, we do not just show them hard facts and figures but that there is some emotional attachment from the ground to the Government,&nbsp;the people and the policies that we are going to implement.&nbsp; Of course, a company with first-class management but third-class workers is not going to succeed.&nbsp; Similarly, if we look at Singapore as one that will prosper and thrive with sound policies, it cannot be just done with good policies and a first-class infrastructure but also because we also have Singaporeans who must be committed and excited by the new ideas and vision that our Government has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;we will not begrudge this extra pay for a competent Government.&nbsp; But we must be assured that this cannot be a zero-sum game.&nbsp; Stakeholders like us, if we invest this money in the Ministers and the public service,&nbsp;would expect higher and better returns.&nbsp; Linking the pay to economic performance is sound.&nbsp; But we have to take care of the process.&nbsp; Three years ago, we worked with one company to introduce performance-based pay and to also introduce KPIs.&nbsp; This is a multinational with a turnover of millions of dollars.&nbsp; The rank-and-file workers&nbsp;used to get a fixed three-month bonus.&nbsp; After we introduced KPI, we changed the structure.&nbsp; Instead of a fixed three months, they would get a range of two months to as high as six months.&nbsp; The workers were certainly happy.&nbsp; But when the management showed us that it would in turn get a range of zero to nine months, there was a lot of unhappiness.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; They felt that workers like us who suffer, work day and night and have to work overtime to produce the results, only get a maximum of six months, whereas the management, who sit in the air-conditioned office,&nbsp;get as high as nine months.&nbsp; So they find that this is totally ridiculous and out of sync.&nbsp; They could not agree.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we went deeper into it and realised that there were a lot of processes that were not put in place.&nbsp; The workers on&nbsp;the ground do not quite understand what the management has been doing.&nbsp; Despite the fact that management can bring in good business and investment, it was not&nbsp;communicated and translated to the people so that they could understand and comprehend.&nbsp; What we have done is that, through a lot of sessions with the management, we realised that there must be a lot of information sharing.&nbsp; And information sharing must be something that is relevant, that people could relate to and understand.&nbsp; So whenever the management brings in new investment, the way they communicate to the people is no longer \"There is a new investment that is going to bring us millions of dollars.&nbsp; You have to work probably for another 200 hours to make it happen.\"&nbsp; Instead, they explained to them that \"This new investment is going to help in our margins and revenues and benefit you in the end, because your bonuses will go up; overall, the prospects have improved.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever someone generates some new ideas that save money, it is no longer just a new idea.&nbsp; To them, this new idea has already transformed itself into something that they can see will benefit themselves,&nbsp;their pockets.&nbsp; So this is how they have done it over the years.&nbsp; For the last two years, I think all of them have been&nbsp;enjoying seven, eight or nine months' bonus.&nbsp; They are happy.&nbsp; They no longer point their fingers at their management and ask, \"Why are they drawing more money and we less?\"&nbsp; Because they have gone through a process where whatever the management were to communicate to the people, the people could relate to, understand and appreciate how this&nbsp;little contribution that each individual makes can actually impact on the overall KPIs and therefore affect themselves and benefit the entire company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just one illustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that&nbsp;linking pay to performance is certainly a sound idea because many people could accept it&nbsp;better, that you can have this better pay package, but it is linked to something which is good for the economy and for everybody.&nbsp; So when we hear from the Ministers and the civil servants, when they communicate policies to the people, it may be useful if&nbsp;these policies, even the different GDP growth that we have been using,&nbsp;could&nbsp;be translated into something that could resonate with the people and that they could relate to. For example,&nbsp;what would be the number of better-paying jobs with this growth of GDP?&nbsp; What would be the real changes and value-add that people could appreciate?&nbsp; And what are&nbsp;the better opportunities that each and every individual can anticipate?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will be easier for Singaporeans to therefore relate to how this GDP growth can link to the pay package of the Ministers and how it will actually affect them positively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need Government leaders who are not planners but those with a good sense to listen to the people.&nbsp; It will demonstrate that they not only look after the people but also with the right EQ, passion and&nbsp;empathy, that they really understand the ground.&nbsp; You can have a first-class fantastic policy but, if you do not understand the ground, you can never implement it effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last Budget saw many goodies given out to Singaporeans.&nbsp; Public assistance, we know, is a very sensitive issue.&nbsp; It is important because it benefits the lower-wage workers.&nbsp; But there are actually many other various funds that were introduced, eg, Opportunity funds, ComCare funds, Workfare Improvement Scheme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;these&nbsp;are all much bigger in scale and&nbsp;benefit many more Singaporeans.

This is something that the labour movement has done for various cooperatives because we have to explain to the people what are the challenges, what&nbsp;we have done and how we actually dealt with those issues, and how it actually benefited the workers in the end.&nbsp; If the various Ministries could have some social report card to indicate to us what they have done over the years, such as how many Singaporeans and workers have benefited in one way or another through the various schemes,&nbsp;it will certainly help to present a clearer picture of what the Government has set out to do and has actually done and&nbsp;carried out to deliver the promises that they have given to the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be some sort of KPIs where&nbsp;they&nbsp;impact the individuals and&nbsp;can be better understood by&nbsp;Singaporeans in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When new policies are being presented, we would urge that&nbsp;it&nbsp;be a bit more Singaporean-centric - take a look at&nbsp;exactly what&nbsp;Singaporeans will want to see; how will it affect them?&nbsp; So,&nbsp;when you present it to the people, there is probably a better linkage, instead of just giving them hard figures and&nbsp;economics that people do not quite understand.&nbsp; These are certain issues that we thought&nbsp;will be useful for the Singaporeans in general, to better understand the purpose of doing all these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may say it again, pay adjustment to the civil service&nbsp;- well, they have done a good job -&nbsp;we will support that&nbsp;the Government&nbsp;pay them.&nbsp; But this should not be a zero-sum game. Again,&nbsp;our people would want us to say that they would&nbsp;not want to dispute or&nbsp;say&nbsp;whether&nbsp;the timing&nbsp;is right or&nbsp;wrong because there is not right or&nbsp;wrong timing.&nbsp; If we think that this is the right Government that we have trusted and&nbsp;we will continue to place our trust in, then we have&nbsp;to trust&nbsp;the team that is led by PM to&nbsp;ensure that the pie will continue to grow amidst all the challenges that continue to daunt us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to think about our next generation that will continue to benefit under the good leadership&nbsp;where opportunities will be abundant for our children and where we can grow old and not have to worry about our&nbsp;livelihood.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.33 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to say a few words in this debate.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me begin by making my position clear. I am not against paying for results.&nbsp; In the private sector, you pay for performance. If a person performs to expectation, he is remunerated accordingly. &nbsp;If a person performs above expectation, then he is rewarded for that exceptional performance.&nbsp; He can be rewarded with both an increase in basic salary as well as a good bonus. &nbsp;Depending on the type of industry he is in, this remuneration could also come in other forms, such as stock options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the private sector, the basic premise when it comes to remuneration and reward is this: you pay for what you get, and you should get what you pay for.&nbsp; The employee knows that he gets paid for results and he is accountable for his performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal with these points in my speech:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Accountability for performance;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue centres and cost centres; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Timing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me begin with accountability.&nbsp; We know that in the present system, civil service and Ministerial salaries are benchmarked against the salaries of the top earners in certain sectors of the private sector. In certain top grades, a discount is given off the benchmark. While not everyone understands the intricacies of the formula used, Singaporeans generally know that our civil service salaries are benchmarked against what some perceive to be lofty private sector salaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing is, if private sector salaries are to be used as the yardstick for measurement, then it is reasonable to expect the same sort of accountability for performance in the civil service that the private sector companies demand.&nbsp; One cannot just take the rewards without also taking on the obligation of accountability for performance for those rewards. &nbsp;I am therefore glad to hear that some part of the increases will be paid by way of performance bonuses, especially in respect of the higher grades of the Administrative Service.&nbsp; However, like my colleagues, Mr Alvin Yeo and Mr Inderjit Singh, before me, I think that a larger part of the total remuneration package should be performance-based throughout the civil service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is true or not, public perception is that working in the civil service provides a person with an iron rice bowl.&nbsp; But that is not the case in the private sector.&nbsp; In the private sector, if your performance is poor and consistently poor over a year, or even two quarters in some sectors, you could be out of a job. It is&nbsp;not&nbsp;a case of not receiving your bonus or not progressing.&nbsp; You may not have a job at all if you do not perform.&nbsp; As Mr Hri Kumar has said, the remuneration of many of the top professionals is almost solely based on performance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the civil servants face the same guillotine? Are they similarly accountable?&nbsp; The public perception is that they are not.&nbsp; If we want to peg our civil service salaries to the top salaries in the private sector, then they must be accountable for their performance.&nbsp; In a recent article that appeared in the <I>Straits Times</I>, the Public Service Division said that Ministers do not have guaranteed tenures because they face elections every five years. That is&nbsp;a fair point.&nbsp; But we are&nbsp;increasing the salaries of not just the Ministers and other political appointment holders today.&nbsp; We are&nbsp;increasing the salaries of the whole of the civil service. They do not&nbsp;face elections every five years. How are they accountable if they do not&nbsp;perform?&nbsp; The public does not see that accountability for performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we want the remuneration of the civil service to be pegged to that of the private sector, I believe&nbsp;the right thing to do is to set targets and key performance indicators, or KPIs, for our civil servants.&nbsp; These may not always be revenue-driven, as in the private sector.&nbsp; For instance, we obviously cannot&nbsp;have revenue-driven KPIs for the departments in MCYS that administer welfare schemes.&nbsp; But we can set other targets and performance indicators.&nbsp; It may not be easy to devise, but it can be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for the civil service remuneration packages to be more closely linked to individual performance, civil servants must have targets and performance indicators set in accordance with their individual roles.&nbsp; They should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely. Yes, the percentage increase in our GDP for a particular year can be a factor where it is&nbsp;taken into account, but it should not be the only factor. With a system of KPIs in place, civil servants will have goals to strive for and if they meet or exceed those goals, they will be rewarded accordingly.&nbsp; And if they do not perform and fail to meet their targets consistently, then they must also face the consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next issue which we should also consider in the equation is the fact that in the private sector, every company and business has its revenue-generating centres and its cost centres.&nbsp; Mr Teo Ser Luck has touched on this in his speech.&nbsp; To put it simply, it is widely acknowledged that&nbsp;workers in the revenue-generating centres of a business will earn more than those in the cost centres, that,&nbsp;at the same time, their remuneration is also far more performance-based.&nbsp; Again, if the civil service is to be run along the lines of \"Singapore Inc.\", as&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say has referred to, then should we not also look to see which departments in each Ministry are the so-called revenue centres and which are the cost centres?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, the performance of certain departments in various Ministries cannot be revenue-driven.&nbsp; Some adaptation is necessary. &nbsp;In the case of these departments, the concept of revenue will naturally need to be replaced with something else that describes their ultimate goals and targets. But the purpose of the&nbsp;segregation is not to create divide within the service. One of the main purposes of such a distinction is to ensure that resources are allocated correctly so that performance and results are rewarded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to say a bit about the timing of these revisions.&nbsp; I do not think that these revisions are being introduced at the right time.&nbsp; And I&nbsp;do not think that we have been sensitive to the feelings of many people in choosing to make these revisions at this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards the end of last year, the Prime Minister announced that it was likely that GST would be increased from 5% to 7%.&nbsp; There were two main reasons for the increase.&nbsp; The&nbsp;first was because we would need more revenue to invest in research, development and infrastructure to take Singapore forward and make it a top tier First-World country.&nbsp; The second reason was because there was a widening income gap and we need to redistribute the wealth from the top earners to the lower wage earners who have experienced little or no increase in their salaries over the last few years.&nbsp; In fact, while top level income earners have experienced up to 4% annual increases in their salaries, even some middle income earners have experienced little increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the fear of the income gap widening, we supported&nbsp;the increase in GST and introduced measures like Workfare and the GST offset package in the Budget to help close the gap.&nbsp; But in this House today, even before those income gap-closing measures have been implemented, we debate an increase in Ministerial and civil service salaries which can only widen the gap between civil servants and the lower wage earners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, ultimately, the question that many people have asked me is&nbsp; - did we increase GST to pay for this increase in salaries?&nbsp; While that is clearly not the case, it is most unfortunate that a support package so carefully crafted in good faith to help our lower income families should now be seen in such light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect there is probably never a good time to introduce the issue of increasing Ministerial and civil service salaries, and there will always be people who feel that the salaries are already too high.&nbsp; Nevertheless, do we really need to pick a time when the&nbsp;public is least receptive to such increases? Allow me to read just two excerpts from the feedback which I have received.&nbsp; I quote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"To&nbsp;have pay adjustments now and then is fair. &nbsp;But to do it now, in view of GST hike, is extremely politically insensitive.&nbsp; There's a difference between being above board/honest and being blunt.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"..... timing of the pay hike is extremely insensitive amidst talk of narrowing the income gap and the impending GST increase.&nbsp; If a pay hike is absolutely necessary, a better timing would have been when the welfare policies have exercised their effectiveness and the people better adjusted to rising prices.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that we must invest in our future and must ensure that we retain the best in our Government and civil service.&nbsp; But we must also ensure that these people give us their best performance so as to justify the salaries that they are receiving. &nbsp;To ensure that this is the case, they must be accountable for their performance.&nbsp; I also hope that&nbsp; the Government will take into account the sensitivities&nbsp;of Singaporeans&nbsp;when introducing these changes to Ministerial and civil service salaries.&nbsp; After all, many are still in the slow process of recovery from the last economic downturn and have yet to see the benefits of the measures introduced in the recent Budget.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Affluence has created bad habits, excessive consumption and waste generation.&nbsp; According to the UNEP, Singaporeans generated 1.1 kg of domestic waste per person per day compared to Germany's 0.9 kg.&nbsp; Littering lingers as a bad habit. Singapore is also not spared from the social problems of modern cities&nbsp; - drug abuse, juvenile delinquency, vandalism and teenage crime.&nbsp; Even though the deterrents&nbsp;are severe, the struggle for survival and social improvement will be an eternal one for Singapore.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt in the minds of Singaporeans of the uncertain times we live in and the excessive competition for talent and economic progress at all levels - individual, organisational and national. Credit must be given not only to our extremely competent leaders, but also the people of Singapore, including those who stay at home and care for frail elders and disabled.&nbsp; Singapore's success is due to the hard work of the average person too because his or her loyalty to the nation is Singapore's real strength.&nbsp; It is not just the working population that I am referring to; each and every individual, no matter how big or small the contribution he or she makes,&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It is perhaps the same kind of approach that was the background of&nbsp;President Nathan's speech delivered at the Second Session of the Tenth Parliament and reported in the <I>Straits Times</I> on 13th January 2005.&nbsp; He spelt out seven priorities: (1) secure Singapore's place in the world; (2) build a safe and secure environment; (3) build the economy; (4) invest in people, young and old; (5) augment population and talent, including foreign talent; (6) engage the youth; and (7) make it a place for everyone, an inclusive society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in response to the President's Address, Mr Wong Kan Seng made the following statement:&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At the heart of every successful society is a core of dedicated and committed people who stay and move ahead together.&nbsp; This is especially vital for a small city state like Singapore.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In last year's National Day Rally Speech, our Prime Minister said, \"We are a nation and a big family.&nbsp; The Government will do its best to look after all Singaporeans and ensure that everyone can share in the nation's fruit of success.\"&nbsp; He then went on to talk about the income disparity in Singapore, largely due to globalisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point I want to make is the social compact of the top leaders and the populace.&nbsp; This message has been discussed many times&nbsp; - &nbsp;that the leaders need us and the people need the leaders.&nbsp; The people's trust and confidence is a must for any government to rule a country.&nbsp; We have seen in Thailand recently what can happen when that trust is broken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, today's debate is focused on an economic issue, but let us not forget that it will have social and moral implications.&nbsp; I will expand a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, some of my fellow MPs talked about the fact that there are many Singaporeans who are still struggling to make ends meet, as they are financially strapped.&nbsp; Many people are wondering how much of their limited income will be channelled into the 2% GST hike.&nbsp; Others are wondering if the rents will rise due to the property boom that has been experienced lately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people who will receive increased salaries as a result of the decision taken by the Government will be the target of envy by all those who struggle to support their families with a limited wage.&nbsp; Management of envy is a very difficult task.&nbsp; If the envy rises year after year, the social compact could collapse.&nbsp; Mind you, the top leaders have excelled in their performance over the last six years, and they do deserve competitive salaries.&nbsp; We want civil servants who are high in IQ and EQ.&nbsp; On top of that, they have to be morally upright, courteous and concerned about Singaporeans.&nbsp; That is indeed a tall order.&nbsp; In my opinion, all of them have these attributes.&nbsp; However, the million dollar question is:&nbsp; how much is enough?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have two points to make for consideration in this debate.&nbsp; The first point is that the formula that was passed by Parliament in 1994 needs to be revisited and revised because, at that time, performance-based appraisal and rewards were not practised.&nbsp; Today, we have basic salaries for employees and bonuses awarded on the performance of the employee during the previous year.&nbsp; Following this logic, the benchmark salaries of the top civil servants, ie, the MR4 grades, should be pegged to the basic salaries of the top 48 earners, ie, from each of the six chosen fields.&nbsp; Since they are also eligible for pensions after their retirement, it is a reasonable proposition.&nbsp; For the high performance civil servants, bonuses could be added to the basic salaries.&nbsp; I am glad to note that in&nbsp;his speech yesterday, Minister Teo Chee Hean mentioned that a sizable proportion of the raise will be in the form of performance bonus.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the MR9 category, we could peg at the basic salaries of the relevant categories also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a GDP bonus is a good idea.&nbsp; But I think overall performance should be the guiding yardstick for all civil servants.&nbsp; These have been enumerated by fellow Member, Mr Teo Ser Luck, eg, originality, creativity, passion, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we look into the future, potential top leaders have to have the right motivations.&nbsp; If we choose those with good brain only, they may inadvertently be working for the pay package and not the goal of public service.&nbsp; Good quality of people in the civil service should be the ultimate aspiration for the Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move on to my second point.&nbsp; Let us look at this issue of salary raise for civil servants in Singapore&nbsp;in perspective.&nbsp; About one month ago in this very Chamber, we discussed the amount that public assistance recipients receive.&nbsp; Many MPs voiced the inadequacy of the amount given, even with the proposed increase.&nbsp; The media has featured real life illustrations of such very poor persons.&nbsp; I have interviewed, in the nature of my work, <I>samsui</I>&nbsp; women or local construction workers, as we know them -&nbsp;old elderly who once worked as <I>coolies</I> or menial labourers in the Singapore port.&nbsp; Public assistance recipients have contributed in the past towards Singapore's economic success that we are enjoying today, and this should not be forgotten.&nbsp; When we juxtapose the amount of dollars that was discussed in that debate and the amount of dollars that we are discussing now, the huge difference is hard to miss.&nbsp; My point is that if we are to be generous towards civil servants who belong to the upper class, then let us be a little generous towards the very poor, as represented by the public assistance recipients&nbsp; -&nbsp; so they can sleep on full stomachs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the recipients living alone, perhaps the MCYS can reconsider the amount and raise it&nbsp;in the coming review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, there is no doubt that the top civil servants have performed extremely well, and&nbsp; they deserve a raise.&nbsp; The question ultimately is how much is enough.&nbsp; The Singapore public may be concerned that if the private sector salaries and bonuses spiral upwards in future, there will be unimaginable salaries drawn by the public sector.&nbsp; Is this the way to go?&nbsp; Surely not.&nbsp; To give the public an assurance, then the idea of a cap, suggested earlier by NMP Loo Choon Yong, should be seriously considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the above suggestions and comments, I support the motion.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:TIME LIMIT FOR SPEECHES--><p align=left>Column No : 298<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:TIME LIMIT FOR SPEECHES:::299-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I should say that the Prime Minister intends to speak tomorrow.&nbsp; So those Members who are going to speak after me should not feel disappointed, as the Prime Minister will take care of the points which they raise.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, I would like to thank all the MPs who have spoken.&nbsp; What was gratifying to me was to see that we&nbsp;all share the same objective.&nbsp; We are trying to make Singapore a better place for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; And that we all also appreciate the necessity of having a good public service, and this is an important institution which we need to nurture, cultivate, grow and develop if we want Singapore to be that better place which we all want it to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is how to achieve this.&nbsp; Let me address the key issues raised under five themes.&nbsp; We have talked a lot about the benchmarking.&nbsp; We have talked about alternatives.&nbsp; We have talked about pensions and independent panel.&nbsp; We have also talked about the difference between the private and the public sectors&nbsp; -&nbsp; risk, accountability, reward&nbsp; -&nbsp; performance and career management in the civil service and also the income gap and timing of this adjustment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me talk about this principle of pegging salaries to the market, and also whether or not by paying Ministers and civil servants more, Ministers in particular, then the moral authority is lost, as though there is some inverse proportionality between the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that most Members of the House, if not all, have actually spoken in favour of market comparable salaries for our civil servants.&nbsp; Some, of course, have suggestions on how this salary level is determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with these later.&nbsp; But, at least, they agree that we have to pay competitive salaries for a good public service.&nbsp; This is already quite a big step forward.&nbsp; Because if we look back 15-20 years, even as recently as 10-12 years, this may not have been so easily accepted.&nbsp; People say, \"The civil service is an iron rice bowl.&nbsp; There is no need to pay them competitive salaries.&nbsp; Just enough for them to get by will do.\"&nbsp; The fact that we have taken this step forward that civil servants need to be paid competitive salaries, and the majority, in fact, almost all Members of this House, support that, is a major advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, in many countries, civil servants are lowly paid.&nbsp; The result is poor quality of public services, and civil servants who are more focused on using their public office for private profit, whether it is a policeman at a roadblock, a tester at a driving centre, or a senior officer in charge of granting approvals and licences, whether these licences are really necessary or not for the proper functioning of the country and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that many Members also support the concept of benchmarking the pay of office holders to the types of jobs they could otherwise be doing, but not all agree with this and not all agree with the method and the methodology that we have chosen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do agree with Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Siew&nbsp;Kum Hong that it is indeed an honour and privilege to come into public office, and to lead and to serve.&nbsp; Public service is an honourable duty, with intrinsic rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some go further and argue that by comparing salaries of officer holders in this way, it undermines the whole concept of service and the moral authority of Ministers.&nbsp; As I said earlier, it is an inverse relationship -&nbsp; the more the salary, the less the moral authority, and the less the salary, the higher the moral authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this is not the correct way of thinking about it.&nbsp; What is most important is the motivations of the person and his willingness to devote his time and energies to serving and to making a difference.&nbsp; If a person is motivated by money, then even a low salary has its dangers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As pointed out by Mr Alvin Yeo, if the motivation is money, there are more effective and less public ways of using one's position to make money than to have an open debate on salaries, as we are having in Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I was rather disappointed by Mr Low Thia Khiang</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>who said that it was a waste of time and money to have such a&nbsp;debate in Parliament.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, this debate shows precisely how transparent the Government is.&nbsp; We are even prepared to come forward, speak in this House, have it debated publicly on&nbsp;a subject&nbsp;which can be as emotive and as personally discomfiting as discussing salaries. So I am&nbsp;somewhat disappointed with Mr Low that he is actually against such transparency.&nbsp; Would he prefer a system where Ministers and civil servants&rsquo; salaries are a murky secret? &nbsp;Ms Denise Phua should be assured that it is by this very transparency, that we make sure&nbsp;what&nbsp;she&nbsp;called the \"nexus of power and money\" will not arise in Singapore because we present what we do openly and transparently.&nbsp; It is for the people to see and judge.&nbsp; It is where there is no such transparency where politicians may take a&nbsp;pittance but actually amass a fortune that we need to be most concerned about the nexus of power and money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But back to the subject of moral authority. The key lies in how we make sure that the&nbsp;people who serve are motivated by the desire to serve and to do their best for the country and our people. The key is in choosing the right people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach we take is a practical one. In the last election, the Prime Minister asked me to help&nbsp;induct new candidates for the People's Action Party into this House and I am glad to see that many of them are now making substantive contributions in this House, in their constituencies to their constituents, serving them, doing good work for them.&nbsp; When I asked them to come in, personally I knew that I was asking each one of them to make a sacrifice.&nbsp; Those who were prepared to come in have come in, agreed to do so and they never talked to me about it, they did not mention it to me but I could see the doubts, the concerns, that little flicker in the eye where it said, \"Is this really what I'm going to do?&nbsp; Is this what I'm getting into?\"&nbsp; Some had to give up their jobs, they had mortgages.&nbsp; But what&nbsp;I could see was&nbsp;they were most concerned about the family, \"Will I have time for my wife,&nbsp;my husband, my children, to look after my ageing parents?\" and then the uncertainty &ndash; would they be able to make good MPs, to live up to the expectations of the public, to live up to the expectations of the people that they hope to serve and the privacy they would lose because&nbsp;any shortcomings or failures would be exposed in a&nbsp;most public way possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We looked for people who have shown commitment and concern for their fellow men. A good number had already been active in the community, in NGOs,&nbsp;before we fielded them.&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua is one of them.&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan himself served many years in the grassroots.&nbsp; We asked them to come in and take on even heavier commitments and responsibilities in serving the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sacrifices that they make when they decide to become MPs and office holders are real and unquantifiable. We cannot do much about reducing these. But what we can do is to reduce the financial sacrifices so that we reduce some of the impediments that might otherwise make it more difficult for good men and women&nbsp;to serve, and to make a difference for Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, the choice is made by Singaporeans themselves at the General Elections, every five years. And the people have chosen wisely. They have rejected candidates who offer themselves, with&nbsp;doubtful capabilities and motivations, and selected good ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is one level of checks. But the PAP itself has another level of checks. We screen,&nbsp;test and select our candidates carefully and one of the key qualities that we look for is the willingness to serve the people.&nbsp; If his motivations are self-serving or to make money, we do not select him. And if we discover that that is what he is about after he has come in, we&nbsp;drop him.&nbsp;&nbsp;One can only hope that Mr Low&nbsp;has equally stringent processes for selecting the persons they offer as candidates to the people because if you do not have transparency and you do not have discussion in this House, as we have been doing these last few days, we cannot be sure that the people that we bring into the office are the right ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me&nbsp;deal with some of the issues on benchmarks.&nbsp; Many MPs have spoken on this - Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Gautam Banerjee, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Alvin Yeo, Mrs Josephine Teo,&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong, Dr Loo Choon Yong, Ms Denise Phua.&nbsp; Some have suggested pegging the pay to levels of government officials in other countries, taking a moving 3-5 year average, job sizing and scoping, including new categories of jobs, defining a new benchmark based on companies by market capitalisation.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh has also&nbsp;suggested there is really no need for a benchmark.&nbsp; The Prime Minister should just decide and that would solve the problem.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in 2000, the formula for the MR4 benchmark was revised to make it more robust. We moved&nbsp;the Ave24 to 2/3M48.&nbsp; And we took in half of stock options, not the full amount, in order to reduce the volatility.&nbsp; We increased the numbers to eight persons in the&nbsp;six professions and we moved to the median, instead of the mean, to take care of this outlier problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rank positions of the MR4 benchmark among the top 1,000 earners have been remarkably stable and this shows that the benchmark is quite robust.&nbsp; The rank position of the MR4 benchmark for YA1999 was 206th&nbsp;and in YA2006, it was&nbsp;201st - remarkably stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benchmark formula, as I said, has been designed to take care of outliers and that is why we have taken the median&nbsp;in the&nbsp;six professions and we have also&nbsp;applied a&nbsp;one-third discount.&nbsp; The median is $3.3 million.&nbsp; The one-third discount brings it to the benchmark number of $2.2 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have pointed out that the individuals in the group of the top 48 earners change from year to year. It is therefore unfair for Ministers to be paid according to this benchmark every year.&nbsp;I will ask for a table* to be circulated and this is a table on the 'dwell' rate of the 48 top earners&nbsp;each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On average, for the last&nbsp;six years, on a year to year basis, close to 40% of the top 48 income earners remained in the top group of 48.&nbsp; Specifically for lawyers and accountants, about two-thirds of the individuals&nbsp;remained unchanged (from one year to the next in this group).&nbsp; Engineers stay the shortest in the list.&nbsp; I am sure Ms Lee Bee Wah will have something to say about that.&nbsp; No doubt&nbsp;they stay short in the list because when they get on this list, they grow up very quickly and become something else.&nbsp; They are likely to become&nbsp;CEOs or take on senior management jobs in companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have pointed out that if the persons change every year, then we are only selecting the top persons every year and it may be different persons&nbsp;on the list.&nbsp; So that is not fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I can also see problems if the same persons&nbsp;remain on the list every year.&nbsp; Then you can say that only these people are doing well and how about the rest of them who are not doing well all the time.&nbsp; So when you look at it, a&nbsp;40%&nbsp;&lsquo;dwell&rsquo;&nbsp;rate, it seems to me to be not unreasonable but the more important thing is, what are we benchmarking against.&nbsp; We are not&nbsp;benchmarking against specific individuals.&nbsp; What we are benchmarking against is the typical salaries that persons holding these types of&nbsp;jobs and&nbsp;responsibilities do earn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have selected these&nbsp;six job categories because they are realistic alternatives for persons who are considering a career in the public service, whether they are at a young age on graduation or whether they are considering coming into public elected office in their 30s and 40s because many of them are from these professions.&nbsp; We have not included architects or doctors, because they require specific talents or skills, and we have not included entrepreneurs.&nbsp; So entrepreneurs are not on the list.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have made the point about entrepreneurs and risks,&nbsp;entrepreneurs are not there.&nbsp; We can fine-tune the job categories - add in a few,&nbsp;put up, lose some,&nbsp;but I do not think the outcome will be very different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Alvin Yeo's suggestion to adopt a&nbsp;3-5 year moving average,&nbsp;to some extent, we are&nbsp;doing this already, except that the average is very sticky - going up and very quick to come down when we move, because we move down very sharply during a recession.&nbsp; I think it is very difficult for any government to say, \"Well, the moving average tells me that I should stay there or go up when, in fact, we are in the&nbsp;middle of a recession.\"&nbsp; So it comes down very quickly but it is quite sticky going up and, to some extent, I am taking a measured approach when we make these adjustments.&nbsp; We are taking a longer term view of how salaries are moving already.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that the PM should&nbsp; just decide and the problem is that&nbsp;we are having this debate because we have this benchmark but if the PM were to just simply decide and come up with a figure,&nbsp;he would still need to justify to the public how he came to this number, and he would have to find some means of comparison and benchmarking in order to have this number.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I think it will be quite a complicated exercise but we will have a look and see whether it can be done and how it can be done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal now with this subject of&nbsp;benchmarking&nbsp;salaries of public officials to those&nbsp;public officials in other countries.&nbsp; When Singapore is usually so obsessed with ranking and benchmarking on&nbsp;an international comparison basis - competitiveness, PERC,&nbsp;quality of government and public service, corruption index, and so forth&nbsp;-&nbsp;why do we not&nbsp;do so for Ministers and office holders as well?&nbsp;On the surface of it, it sounds like a very compelling argument.&nbsp;But you ask yourself, why are you doing these comparisons in the first place and are these comparisons valid?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, as I explained earlier, our salaries are clean.&nbsp; Everything is there.&nbsp;So when you look at the salary of&nbsp;the Prime Minister of Britain, or Australia, or almost any other country in the world, you do not know what is the total compensation package.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are really not comparing apples with apples.&nbsp; We cannot find out exactly what it is that they are earning because it is not completely transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one problem.&nbsp; But the second and more fundamental issue&nbsp;is this.&nbsp; Is that a relevant comparison?&nbsp; When you do a competitiveness ranking with other countries, it is a relevant comparison.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because you are trying to attract investors to come to invest in Singapore, to create jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; So we want to see how competitive Singapore is against another country which is your competitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are looking at salaries for civil servants and office holders, you must look at what are the realistic alternatives that civil servants and office holders might pursue.&nbsp; They cannot become office holders in Finland,&nbsp;Denmark, or the United States.&nbsp; It is not a relevant market comparison for them, or <I>vice versa</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to look at what a young man or a person in his 30s or 40s is comparing himself to - a young man or woman when he is deciding what he is going to do with his life.&nbsp; And these are the relevant market&nbsp;comparisons, not what politicians in Germany,&nbsp;France,&nbsp;Finland, or&nbsp;Denmark are being paid.&nbsp; It is not relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have suggested that we set up&nbsp;an independent panel to review&nbsp;and&nbsp;set salaries -&nbsp;take it out of the hands of this Parliament, take it out of the hands of the Prime Minister.&nbsp; We do not have to deal with this issue which makes us all feel very uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1994, we had a panel, chaired by&nbsp;Mr Michael Fam, who was then the Executive Chairman of Fraser and Neave, and it comprised other private sector leaders.&nbsp;Its terms of reference were to verify that the IRAS data and calculations in the White Paper were correct, and to comment on the appropriateness of the Prime Minister's salary, taking into account the job scope and responsibilities of&nbsp;PM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel was satisfied with the data and the calculations used and we have since computed the benchmarks annually on the same basis. And incidentally, the annual IRAS data that we use for the benchmark computation is&nbsp;audited by the Auditor-General.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we now&nbsp;have more than a panel. In fact, we have a full discussion and debate in the House,&nbsp;as Mr Inderjit Singh reminded us because he has kept the cuttings from 1994.&nbsp; We have done this in 1994 and in 2000. We have full transparency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ultimately, even if you had an independent commission and it recommended a salary, somebody has to decide whether to accept that recommendation and implement it,&nbsp;and you cannot escape from the responsibility of making that decision.&nbsp;What happens if the number is too high? Do you just go along and&nbsp;say, \"Should be&nbsp;all right.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody should get upset because this was an independent panel that set it.\"&nbsp; I do not think you will escape the same difficulties as we are having today.&nbsp; You still need to explain how, why and&nbsp;whether it makes sense or not.&nbsp; And the Prime Minister and his Cabinet have to decide whether to accept this recommendation or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in other countries, there are independent panels but, unfortunately, the legislature or the government does not have the will and determination to implement the recommendations of the independent panel because of the political pressures and the inability on their part to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what if the benchmark level determined by the independent panel is too low?&nbsp; The Prime Minister and the Cabinet still have to take the responsibility for running the Government, making sure that the civil service has got enough people, and so on.&nbsp; And it still has to decide whether to accept that, even in the face of&nbsp;a civil service which is losing people.&nbsp;So, in the end, the Cabinet and the&nbsp;Prime Minister have to take responsibility and then&nbsp;go to the electorate at the elections and ask the electorate to decide whether the job that they have done has been good enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the difference between the public and private sectors.&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Michael Palmer, Mr Teo Ser Luck, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Dr Loo Choon Yong, Ms Denise Phua have spoken a lot&nbsp;about the difference between the private sector and the public sector, particularly where it applies to risks.&nbsp;I think I explained earlier that the benchmark does not contain entrepreneurs and people who own companies.&nbsp; So, basically, it is people who earn incomes and particularly the 15P32 benchmark contains the 32-year-olds who are working for others.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense, it is not that different from a good Administrative Officer working in the public service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I completely agree with&nbsp;Members who say that if we are going to pay competitive market salaries, then we should adopt market policies in our performance management and&nbsp;HR policies in the civil service. And certainly, that is the way we are going to go, and that is the way we have been moving for the last 10-12 years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those of you who were in the House when Mdm Halimah spoke, I think she gave an excellent speech which described the HR practices that we have in the public service today, which are very different from the HR practices 10-12 years ago,&nbsp;and it was a very good speech, as Mdm Halimah usually gives, from the perspective of the workers who now face these new pressures in the civil service which they did not face before - performance bonuses, annual assessments, risks of having their whole function best sourced if they are inefficient, being invited in for polite conversations to tell them that they might find it more advantageous for themselves to continue another career in another line in the private sector, and not in the Government sector. The fact is that many of our officers now are employed initially on contracts and they have to prove themselves before they are put on&nbsp;permanent service.&nbsp; These are now features of the public service in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On developing KPIs for public servants, we have been spending a lot of time talking about the Administrative Officers.&nbsp; But actually, there is a wider public service out there, as Mdm Halimah pointed out, there are over 60,000&nbsp;public servants&nbsp;and also statutory board employees who serve in the wider public service.&nbsp; As Mr Teo Ser Luck pointed out, you can actually select KPIs for different groups of people, depending on what kind of performance you want from them.&nbsp; Certainly, those frontline agencies, like EDB, who go out and chase for investments to come to Singapore, EDB incentivises them that way. That is one example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have different benchmarks for different levels and&nbsp;different types of officers in the service.&nbsp;We also have different ways of rewarding our officers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The senior officers in the service have a larger component of performance bonus, and the performance bonus is both on an individual as well as GDP basis, whereas the junior officers, while they do have performance bonus, their performance bonus is generally a smaller percentage of their total annual remuneration.&nbsp; For very senior civil servants, as I pointed out, the variable component is now 47% of pay.&nbsp; Mr Alvin Yeo, I believe, and Mr Gautam Banerjee also suggest moving it up to 60% to 70%.&nbsp; I am not sure whether we will get there eventually, but we are certainly moving in the right direction.&nbsp; We have moved from one-third to half.&nbsp; Mr Alvin Yeo says we should go to two-thirds. As we restructure the salaries, as we have the opportunity to do so, we will see whether this makes sense for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example of restructuring the salaries is also at the junior levels.&nbsp; One of the reasons why we have given out the performance-based payment for our junior officers is because we want to take this opportunity to build up the performance element among our junior officers in the civil service.&nbsp; And if the economy and salary levels permit in the coming year, we will take this performance-based payment and build it into the scheme so that it becomes part of the salary structure of our junior officers with a larger performance element.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been many suggestions on what we can include into the matrix for deciding on the performance bonuses of Ministers and top civil servants.&nbsp; We have considered a number of different possibilities.&nbsp; None of the suggestions really is new, whether it is inflation, lower or&nbsp;average wage levels or whatever it is.&nbsp; None of these suggestions really is new.&nbsp; But the Government as a whole has to cater not just to individual groups of Singaporeans but also to all Singaporeans.&nbsp; Therefore, we felt that the GDP is a good indicator of being able to create wealth for all of Singapore and, with that wealth, to be able to make, even those Singaporeans who may not directly benefit from that GDP growth,&nbsp;those Singaporeans even better off as well, as this Government has done consistently over the years through asset enhancements and wealth transfers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also note that even the private sector, not just the public sector, also has difficulties defining KPIs to make sure that there is no distortion between short-term and longer-term goals of the organisation.&nbsp; This is because if you have a KPI that is very focused on your quarterly returns, you may run the company into the ground over the five-year period time-frame to produce&nbsp;good quarterly returns for the next two or three quarters.&nbsp; That has happened in companies.&nbsp; And in Government, many of the things we do are very, very long term.&nbsp; Some Members would have read the <I>Straits Times'</I> article where they interviewed Mr Tan Gee Paw, the Chairman of PUB, and he was quoted as saying:&nbsp; \"Some of the things we do in Government, we do not see the result within our own career.\"&nbsp; The results come after we have finished our career.&nbsp; Those are some of the types of things which senior public officers in the civil service have to deal with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would be a little careful about defining KPIs which are too specific, too targeted and too short-term.&nbsp; But the Prime Minister decides on the performance bonus, and I am sure that, when he decides on what performance bonus to give to the Ministers, he will look at how the Minister and his Ministry are performing and take that into consideration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all said and done, what number does this benchmark produce for us?&nbsp; May I ask for this table to be circulated? &nbsp;[<I>Copies of table distributed to all hon. Members.</I>]&nbsp; Does it make sense?&nbsp; Many people say that, \"Well, actually, you are operating on a part of the curve which is very rarefied, where the oxygen is very thin, it fluctuates very rapidly, there are very few people down there.\"&nbsp; And, if you can think of it mathematically, if you draw a curve from the first, say, to the 1,000th income earner in Singapore, Singaporeans are concerned that this benchmark produces an answer which is on the steep part of the curve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can draw Members' attention now to this chart.&nbsp; [<I>Copies of chart distributed to all hon. Members.</I>]&nbsp; This chart shows the income level on the vertical axis and the ordinal number, ie, the rank of the person for the top 1,000 income earners in Singapore.&nbsp; So owners of companies are not there.&nbsp; It is income earners.&nbsp; How we have defined this number is explained in the explanatory notes, ie, what goes into the income elements.&nbsp; But this is the plot.&nbsp; There is indeed a very steep part in the curve, the part where it basically goes exponential.&nbsp; But where are we on the curve of the top 1,000 income earners for the MR4 benchmark as well as the current salary?&nbsp; We are actually on the flat part of the curve, not on the steep part of the curve.&nbsp; So, actually, the benchmark is a relatively stable benchmark.&nbsp; We are not on the&nbsp;top left&nbsp;part of the curve where it shoots up very sharply.&nbsp; So the benchmark indeed produces quite a stable result.&nbsp; It gives you the MR4 benchmark level, the revised&nbsp;and&nbsp;current salaries for both MR4 Ministers and the Prime Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you look at the top 1,000 income earners at age 32,&nbsp;you see a very similar pattern.&nbsp; Really, what you see are four points there, three clustered very closely together, the benchmark itself 15P32 for SR9, the current SR9 salary and revised SR9 salary.&nbsp; So here we are almost at the benchmark.&nbsp; And we are about where we want to be on this curve, because we are on the knee of this curve.&nbsp; Probably one or two of the best of our officers get promoted to this grade each year.&nbsp; And we are taking some of the best people into the civil service each year, and we want them, because we want them to contribute to making Singapore better.&nbsp; So these are people who have not just got their four 'A's and two S-papers in JC.&nbsp; That is not enough as a qualification.&nbsp; That gets them through the door perhaps of the interview room.&nbsp; But what the Public Service Commission is looking for when it looks for scholars of this category, this qualification, are people who have commitment to the country, have shown that they have interests beyond just their books and studies, have leadership qualities, done community service, have been active in sports and games, and so forth, ie, outstanding young Singaporeans, some of the most outstanding Singaporeans you can find in their cohort.&nbsp; And we should be fortunate that we have a system in Singapore which is able to bring some of these people into the public service to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, rather than for them to all be attracted out into the private sector and working for the bottomline of some other company, which may well be an MNC or, perhaps, as many might do, go to London, New York,&nbsp;Hong Kong or Silicon Valley to work and be lost to Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now deal with some more mundane matters - mundane perhaps for some Members here&nbsp;but certainly matters I think very close to the heart of Mdm Halimah as well - ie, performance and career management in the civil service.&nbsp; So I hope that Members will bear with me if I take a little bit of time to explain some of these details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have focused most of our discussion on Ministers and Administrative Officers.&nbsp; There is actually a wider civil service out there whom we all depend upon to service Singaporeans and the public.&nbsp; We must take care of all of them as well, because they serve loyally and faithfully.&nbsp; I would like to thank Mdm Halimah for her compliment on the civil service and that it has come a long way, and I would like to reiterate that we value all civil servants, not just the Administrative Officers.&nbsp; Like Mdm Halimah said, civil servants no longer enjoy secure tenure.&nbsp; We have an exit route for under-performers and organisational renewal schemes.&nbsp; Even our top public sector officers have fixed tenures.&nbsp; Those who are on the Public Service Leadership Scheme have a 10-year tenure if they are at Deputy Secretary level, and then, if they make it to Permanent Secretary, 10 years.&nbsp; After that, they leave.&nbsp; So they are not there all the time, permanently.&nbsp; As someone said, perhaps we should change the name \"Administrative Officer\", because it does not correctly reflect what an Administrative Officer does.&nbsp; Perhaps, we should change the name \"Permanent Secretary\" too, because the Permanent Secretary is not there permanently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do freely admit that the civil service can do better in its human resource management and, in particular, its performance management.&nbsp; I think all of us are very Asian.&nbsp; The idea of calling in your subordinate and telling him all of his strong points is not so much of a problem, but telling him all his weak points, that is more of a problem.&nbsp; So everybody thinks he is doing fine and, if he does not get his performance bonus, he wonders why.&nbsp; As we have introduced the performance bonuses and more promotional grades in the various schemes and services, HR managers, in fact all managers in the public service, have to become better managers of people, to learn how to lead, motivate, reward them and tell them how they are doing, so that they can help to develop them.&nbsp;&nbsp;So PSD will certainly examine how to improve the supervisory skills in the service so that they in turn can coach and mentor other officers better.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a rigorous regular appraisal system.&nbsp; It is not just by the immediate superior.&nbsp; But we have a ranking system where the officer is also considered by superiors of other staff of similar grade so that there is comparison between departments.&nbsp; So it is not just on the whims and fancies of one superior officer that the fate of a civil servant gets decided.&nbsp; There are quotas for performance grading so that you cannot have everybody good or very, very good.&nbsp; You cannot have the entire organisation very good.&nbsp; I was told by someone - I will not mention which uniformed organisation this is&nbsp;and in which foreign country - that, in his navy, 95% of his officers are performing above average.&nbsp; There is obviously a problem there somewhere.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Siew that we should be more transparent in how Administrative Officers are managed.&nbsp; In fact, we do counsel and out-manage Administrative Officers who are not performing well.&nbsp; May I ask for this other table to be circulated?&nbsp; [<I>Copies of table* distributed to all hon.

These are the daily-rated employees (DREs).&nbsp; Our DREs&nbsp;today are now entirely employed by the statutory boards.&nbsp; Most of them are in the National Environment Agency (NEA).&nbsp;&nbsp;The NEA, which employs&nbsp;the vast majority of our DREs,&nbsp;has training incentives for them to upgrade themselves as part of the new Collective Agreement (CA) that was signed in October 2006.&nbsp; They will receive a training incentive of $200 (per course) for completing and passing courses that lead to a nationally recognised certificate,&nbsp;and they can receive up to two such incentives a year.&nbsp;This encourages them to improve themselves so that they can do better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a Good Conduct Allowance which has been increased from $30 to $40 per month to encourage them to come regularly and to reward those who do not absent themselves from work. This was increased with effect from October 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;NEA also has plans&nbsp;to conduct a salary review of its DREs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is intended for implementation&nbsp;in the later part of this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do agree that we do need a more holistic human resource management system in the civil service. Pay is not the cure for everything, and the civil service knows&nbsp;and realises that.&nbsp; There are other deeper issues that we have to deal with. That is why, in conjunction with the pay increases, we are also conducting reviews of a few key services, for example, the Management Executive&nbsp;Scheme and the Management Support Scheme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The civil service will also look into tapping and developing leadership potential across the public sector.&nbsp; It is not confined to the top echelon of officers&nbsp;and includes&nbsp;senior officers in our professional and departmental services.&nbsp; Young officers and other services with potential and drive&nbsp;will be provided more opportunities to stretch and grow them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our system is not designed to keep everyone in the service.&nbsp; So, we do not look for zero resignation and zero attrition, but we do want to make sure that we do not fall into the same position that we were in in the 1990s where, with&nbsp;a galloping economy, we were losing many people from&nbsp;all segments of the public service.&nbsp; What it meant was that the level of service&nbsp;to Singaporeans fell. Those who remained in the service were demoralised because they had to do more work and they saw their colleagues leaving.&nbsp; And because the service level fell,&nbsp;they had more complaints from the public, and I am sure, from Members of Parliament, about the quality of service and we were put under more pressure.&nbsp; So we do not want to find ourselves in that same kind of situation.&nbsp; We want to make sure that we can continue to remain competitive and we can keep, employ and retain our public servants and have a good working climate in our institutions and organisations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now deal with timing and whether or not this is a good time or right time to do this.&nbsp; Sir, I have been asked whether this is a good time to make such salary adjustments.&nbsp; But, actually, the point is that such salary adjustments must be done in good time.&nbsp; Otherwise, we will end up with problems in the public service.&nbsp; We have had no major adjustments since 2001.&nbsp; We have already waited for six years. Economic recovery has been going on for the last three years and we have had good growth for three years, but we have not raised salaries as quickly as we should have.&nbsp; If we wait too long and we are too far out of line, it makes it even more difficult to move our salaries because each time we do that, there will be consternation&nbsp;with the huge percentage which we are&nbsp;raising salaries by if we have to move once in a very long time to come to market levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, I believe that will be to the detriment of Singapore and Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have also been many speeches and views brought up Members of Parliament and also members of public about the income gap and&nbsp;the difficulties of the lower-income group and those with no income.&nbsp; Capping the salaries of Ministers and top civil servants will not solve this problem.&nbsp; The problem can be best addressed&nbsp; -&nbsp; how to help low-wage workers, how to help the lower income and&nbsp;how to help the aged with no families through sound&nbsp;policies and programmes like those which were introduced in the Budget recently&nbsp;- Workfare,&nbsp;increased allocations for ComCare but, most importantly, through growing the economy, creating jobs, creating the resources so that we can help everyone in Singapore to lift themselves up and have a better life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have paid attention to the needs of the low income through the GST offset package so that over the next five or six years,&nbsp;they will be well taken care of. For those in the lower-income groups, the GST offset is worth some&nbsp;16 to 19 years&nbsp;of the extra GST that these low-income Singaporeans will have to bear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On public assistance, there was a debate in this House with Dr Lily Neo during the Committee of Supply.&nbsp; Minister Vivian Balakrishnan summed up&nbsp;that&nbsp;we want an approach that is low in entitlement, but high in flexibility, because the needs of these individuals are quite different,&nbsp;and we&nbsp;need to find more holistic and flexible ways of looking after their needs.&nbsp; Indeed, I must say that Dr Lily Neo is a good example&nbsp;of a Member of Parliament who has, through her ingenuity and active involvement with&nbsp;the older people in her constituency,&nbsp;found these creative&nbsp;and more meaningful ways of helping them because they know that this is not the&nbsp;anonymous&nbsp;hand of Government that is giving that assistance, but it is real people with real hands&nbsp;and warm hearts who are helping them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would ask now for this article to be circulated.&nbsp; [<I>Copies of article distributed to hon. Members</I>.]&nbsp; It is an article by Steven Bartos.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the Director of the Institute of Governance in the University of Canberra.&nbsp;This article&nbsp;appeared in this magazine called the \"Public Sector&nbsp;Informant\", February 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;The article looked at Singapore's public service as a possible benchmark for Australia.&nbsp; The Australian public service is held generally in quite high esteem.&nbsp; Bartos acknowledged that \"Singapore had overtaken Australia in the efficiency and effectiveness of its public service\".&nbsp;&nbsp;He explained the&nbsp;reasons for this.&nbsp; He said that we have revamped our processes, we have very creative and active use of information technology and&nbsp;we have reorganised our institutions.&nbsp; He said that it took 300 people to draw up the Australian budget and 20 in Singapore.&nbsp; I have not actually gone to the Ministry of Finance to count&nbsp;the numbers but that was what he reported in the article approvingly.&nbsp; And&nbsp;very tellingly, this was what he said, and I quote, \"The other source of Singapore's public service advantage is the extent to which it has invested in public servants themselves.&nbsp; The senior ranks are very well paid, which of course helps. &nbsp;Just as important is their investment in education.\". He has many other comments to make about Singapore and the cultural differences and why we do things here, like banning chewing gum, which will be unacceptable in Australia, and so forth.&nbsp; All in all, a balanced&nbsp;and thoughtful article -&nbsp;someone who understands Singapore and obviously knows what it takes to build a good public service.&nbsp; And he quite ruefully&nbsp;said that the senior ranks are very well-paid, which of course helps.&nbsp; I think that is a very understated way of making a very important point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I&nbsp;listened carefully to what Mr Chiam See Tong had to say yesterday. He said that we are just a little dot. When we look at America, it is 15,000 times our size and&nbsp;60 times the population of Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that we are just a dot. America is such a big country, so many people, such a huge country and the American President is paid so little. What is so special about Singapore?&nbsp; But, Sir, that is precisely the point. There are many, many&nbsp;dots in the world.&nbsp; But what makes this dot so special?&nbsp; This little red dot is very special because all of us have taken the trouble to take care of it very well.&nbsp; All Singaporeans have worked hard to make Singapore special. The Government is a special government, carefully constructed, bringing in the best people so that&nbsp;it can move Singapore forward even with all the disadvantages that we have - the lack of resources, the position that we are in the&nbsp;region and the world. And Singapore is helped along by a first-class,&nbsp;excellent, efficient, uncorrupt&nbsp;public service that helps it to achieve Singaporeans' dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do need a good public service in Singapore.&nbsp; It is a very special country, a very special red dot,&nbsp;Mr Chiam.&nbsp;We do want to make it even better for Singaporeans in the future. We need thinkers,&nbsp;planners and&nbsp;doers in the whole public service.&nbsp; The whole public service has to work as a team&nbsp;and it has to work as a team with all Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a public service that we can be proud of.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Government that works.&nbsp; It is a Government that works for Singapore and Singaporeans.

Paradoxically, many societies also have little difficulty in accepting the institutional hypocrisy of low official pay and large unofficial income.&nbsp; They are content to let that&nbsp;hypocrisy continue and where it is not possible for them to be unofficial income, such societies are content to accept the loss of talent from the public sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone is content to be less than honest about the situation, and salaries are held hostage to politics.&nbsp; This mould is politically very difficult to break.&nbsp; But difficult as it is, we have to, in Singapore, completely break this mould if we are to prosper and move ahead as a society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at whom we want in our public service.&nbsp; We want the very best.&nbsp; The people we want have many career choices.&nbsp; They have to be of a quality to get to the top in any profession or field that they choose.&nbsp; Put it this way:&nbsp; if someone is not good enough to get to the top of PricewaterhouseCoopers, would you want that person to be a Minister?&nbsp; Would we want someone as a Minister if he cannot get to the top in a major law firm, MNC or a bank?&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, it is a rhetorical question.&nbsp; The answer is obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Such a talented person will have to choose, and it is a real, serious choice.&nbsp; Do I want to go into public service or do I want to be a top lawyer, accountant or banker?&nbsp; Let us not fool ourselves.&nbsp; The opportunities in the private sector have always been good.&nbsp; Now, they have become quite extraordinary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us here know that for a fact.&nbsp; Take a bright young man in his 30s.&nbsp; Assume that he is among the brightest in his generation.&nbsp; Today, he has an array of career choices.&nbsp; He can stay in Singapore or go overseas.&nbsp; He can join any MNC or financial institution, or he can stay in a profession.&nbsp; If he remains in the private sector, he will have his privacy, he can travel the world, live where he likes, have a second and a third home, and choose to live the life he wants.&nbsp; In his early 40s, he could be earning $2 million and more, and by the time he is in his late 40s, a real high flyer could be taking home $5 million or more.&nbsp; If the median for top lawyers and accountants is $4.2 million and $3.7 million respectively,&nbsp;Members can guess what those above the median will be making.&nbsp; That was in 2005, and I am leaving out the real heavy hitting investment bankers out of these scenarios.&nbsp; Those who are entrepreneurial and start businesses could earn even more.&nbsp; We are talking about tens of millions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the risks are also higher.&nbsp; But the trend is clear.&nbsp; In our globalised economy and in this almost borderless world, the economic opportunities are vast and breathtaking for a bright, talented young person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we think it is fair, just or realistic to expect such a person to come into public service and earn 30% or less of what he could earn outside?&nbsp; It does not make any sense that Ministers should earn a fraction of top private sector professionals, when&nbsp;we look at the different sets of responsibilities and the consequences of how they perform.&nbsp; Why do we, as a society, think we can expect the brightest and the best to go into public service, earn much less than what they would earn in the private sector, and get regularly attacked and abused for what they do earn?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it all pure fantasy and rhetoric that we look for the best to come into Government?&nbsp; Well, let us look at the frontbench.&nbsp; It is not good to personalise an argument, but sometimes an illustration helps.&nbsp; As an example, let us look at the Minister who kicked off this debate.&nbsp; Minister Teo, by common consent, is among the very brightest of his generation. His academic and subsequent track records speak for themselves.&nbsp; He runs the Defence Ministry and oversees the civil service.&nbsp; The rest of us in the private sector earn our money only because he and his team ensure the safety and security of Singapore.&nbsp; Only the naive will take that for granted in the case of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Teo is not a cog in the wheel.&nbsp; He is at the very apex of the system, and bears the final and ultimate responsibility for the functioning of the system.&nbsp; I have yet to hear a single convincing argument as to why someone like him should earn less than the senior partner of a major accounting or a law firm in Singapore.&nbsp; They are not even in the same ball park when we consider the responsibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would we be better off as a society if he was now an investment banker earning several million dollars?&nbsp; There are likely to be several in his cohort in the private sector who are earning much more than him.&nbsp; It probably does not matter to him, otherwise, he will not be in the public service.&nbsp; But we have to look at the future.&nbsp; It may matter to the next Teo Chee Hean in his 30s, and it will matter even more to the future of Singapore.&nbsp; If we do not keep salaries competitive and we lose some of the potential Ministers and Permanent Secretaries, then we will pay dearly as a society -&nbsp;in reduced opportunities, in reduced competitiveness and reduced national wealth.&nbsp; We can continue&nbsp;navel-gazing, squabble over the individual salaries and, in the process, we run the risk of losing the plot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it is such a no-brainer, why is it that people are so resistant?&nbsp; Let us consider the arguments that are routinely trotted out in support of keeping official pay low.&nbsp; In summary, the views against the salary increase are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Minister's job cannot be compared with that of a top private sector job.&nbsp; Motivations in each case are different.&nbsp; The Minister performs public service and he should not be disgruntled about the extra million or so that he could earn outside.&nbsp; Ministers are already adequately paid and increasing the salaries may break the compact of trust, respect and regard between the Government and the people.&nbsp; Ministers are expected to make a sacrifice, and we, as a society, should not be coldly materialistic.&nbsp; To peg Ministers' salaries to the market will transmit wrong values.&nbsp; Reference was often made to other countries which do not pay their Ministers as much, and which have no corruption.&nbsp; These arguments are deeply flawed.&nbsp; They cannot stand the test of logic or an analysis of the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me, first, take the point where our approach to salaries is contrasted with that taken by the US and other western countries.&nbsp; It is a false point because the comparisons are misleading.&nbsp; In the US, for example, people are in politics or in the senior civil service for a relatively short period.&nbsp; When they come out, their market value is enhanced.&nbsp; It is what the Minister Mentor called the \"revolving door\" system.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a like-for-like comparison.&nbsp; If we want a honest comparison with the US, then look at areas where public service is a lifetime career.&nbsp; One example is the US judicial service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very revealing to look at the Federal Court System in the US.&nbsp; That system used to attract top lawyers.&nbsp; But years of policy failure in not paying adequate salaries to Judges has resulted in a serious situation, serious enough in the words of the current Chief Justice, John Roberts, to be called&nbsp;\"a constitutional crisis\" - a constitutional crisis that has arisen because of the lack of political will to pay Judges adequately.&nbsp; Chief Justice Roberts said this in January this year in his annual report&nbsp;on the US judiciary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chief Justice did not mince his words.&nbsp; He considered the issue so important that it was the sole point he made in his report.&nbsp; He made the following points:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judicial salaries had fallen far below private sector salaries for lawyers.&nbsp; As a result, in fact, they have stopped comparing the salaries of private sector lawyers, and&nbsp;the number of lawyers from the private sector who were coming in as judges had fallen sharply.&nbsp; He said, \"It changes the nature of the federal judiciary when Judges are no longer drawn from among the best lawyers in the practising bar.\"&nbsp; He emphasised the vital importance of a strong and competent judiciary for the well-being of the entire country and the American people.&nbsp; He criticised Congress' inaction in failing to raise salaries in the strongest language that a judge could possibly use. He said Congress had failed for over 20 years to do anything.&nbsp; He called Congress' inaction \"grievously unfair\".&nbsp; He quoted the National Commission which said that the inaction was \"the most egregious example of the failure of federal compensation policies.\"&nbsp; He pointed out that the budgetary cost of the increase would be minuscule in proportion to the benefit.&nbsp; He accepted that a pay rise would be unpopular, but also pointed out that Congress had a duty, indeed a constitutional responsibility, to make a decision which, even if unpopular, is necessary to promote the long-term good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would be the result of inaction?&nbsp; Again, there is no need to guess.&nbsp; The US experience shows what will happen and I quote Chief Justice Roberts, \"In the face of decades of Congressional inaction, many Judges who must attend to their families and futures have no realistic choice except to retire from&nbsp;judicial service and return to private practice.&nbsp; The numbers are sobering.&nbsp; In the past six years, 38 Judges have left the Federal bench, including 17 in the last two years.&nbsp; If judicial appointment ceases to be the capstone of a distinguished career and instead becomes a stepping stone to lucrative positions in private practice, the Framers' goal of a truly independent judiciary will be placed in serious jeopardy.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you do not keep salaries competitive, what sort of people do you attract?&nbsp; Again, I quote the Chief Justice:&nbsp; \"Our judiciary will not properly serve its constitutional role if it is restricted to&nbsp;(1) persons so wealthy that they can afford to be indifferent to the level of judicial compensation; or (2) people for whom the judicial salary represents a pay increase.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we want a truly class-based system of government, or if we want to attract people who will not make it in the private sector, then, yes, go ahead and let the salaries go below the private sector.&nbsp; For a lawyer, being appointed a judge is the ultimate recognition, the pinnacle of professional achievement or as the Chief Justice said, \"the capstone of a distinguished career.\"&nbsp; And, yet, judges resigned in enough numbers for it to be called \"a constitutional crisis\".&nbsp; That is what will happen if there is too much of a disconnect between public service and private sector income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us not fool ourselves.&nbsp; The public service, whether in the US or in Singapore, will fail to attract good people, and it will lose good people in such a situation.&nbsp; If you want that, then go ahead and quibble about the extra $10.5 million or so that will be paid to the entire Cabinet, an amount which will not even qualify as a single top salary in 2006.&nbsp; Or put it in another way, that is, marginally more than what the two top lawyers in the median income for 2005 were getting.&nbsp; It is almost surreal that there is so much angst and debate over this issue.&nbsp; We need a sense of proportion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alarm bells about the low levels of judicial pay have been sounded by others in the US as well.&nbsp; The <I>Financial Times</I> on 5th April 2007 carried a report about competition between New York and London to be the world's leading financial centre.&nbsp; The stakes are high&nbsp; - thousands of jobs, billions of dollars.&nbsp; One of the disadvantages of New York was stated to be its litigation culture.&nbsp; In that context, the Chairman of one of the top US law firms, Mr Cohen of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, said that part of the problem lay in the quality of the US federal judges.&nbsp; He was quoted as saying, \"A very radical idea would be to take the federal judiciary and double the salaries, so you would be able to keep your best judges instead of them being forced to go into private practice.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is&nbsp;the US which critics of our pay policy frequently cite as a model to be followed.&nbsp; The truth is that there has been a failure of political will in the US to pay adequately.&nbsp; Do not compare with the politicians.&nbsp; That is not a like-for-like comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The politicians in the US will not suffer as a result of such inaction.&nbsp; They will have opportunities to get good compensation often when they are out of office.&nbsp; Former President Bill Clinton gets an average of US$250,000 per speech that he delivers.&nbsp; So does former Secretary of State, Mr Henry Kissinger.&nbsp; People simply do not understand the US system, and do not realise what it will mean to us if we follow that system.&nbsp; Look at Senior Minister and Minister Mentor.&nbsp; If we had the US system, they will be spending their post-Prime Ministerial years giving speeches for money.&nbsp; Minister Mentor could join Kissinger Associates and Senior Minister could join the Carlyle Group.&nbsp; Better still, they could form their own lobby group&nbsp; -&nbsp; call it Lee-Goh Associates.&nbsp; This is no laughing matter.&nbsp; This happens everywhere.&nbsp; They can then lobby the Government they used to lead or open doors in China, India, the Middle East or elsewhere, not on behalf of Singapore, but on behalf of their own corporate clients and for their own benefit.&nbsp; Lee-Goh Associates&nbsp; -&nbsp; what do you think it could pull in in a year?&nbsp; $20-$30 million, much more, no problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we not think about all this when we make facile comparisons?&nbsp; Is it fantasy?&nbsp; Well, is that not what happens in a country that we refer to as a model to be followed?&nbsp; So, why not here?&nbsp; There is no law against it.&nbsp; It is ultimately Singaporeans who will pay the price if we do not pay our public officials properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are real issues.&nbsp; Chief Justice Roberts and Mr Cohen are serious people dealing with serious issues which go to the heart of the American system.&nbsp; They decry the way American judges are paid.&nbsp; True, we are here debating the salaries of not only our judges but also a broader group, including politicians.&nbsp; But the principle, the rationale, is the same because, in both situations, it is a career choice with a substantial element of public service; and it would be normal to think that when you accept appointment of a senior judge, you put the element of public duty over pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this competitive world, there will be a direct impact on all of us if the best people are not in Government.&nbsp; And in the fierce&nbsp;race to the top, when we are competing with other countries which are bigger and have more resources, it is critical for our future that we have two essential elements:&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

and two, the very best in leadership positions.&nbsp; Without either, we will fall short.&nbsp; We could even seriously falter because, in many ways, we are not a natural state.&nbsp;Too many Singaporeans seem to take our stability and progress for granted without a nuanced understanding of our somewhat precarious geopolitical and strategic situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can be more sanguine if we were Monaco, in the middle of a prosperous and peaceful Europe.&nbsp; But we are in Southeast Asia, in a region rife with religious, ethnic and racial tensions and afflicted by poverty.&nbsp; If we leave aside diplomatic niceties, then the truth is that our neighbours do not really love us - and that is putting it mildly.&nbsp; If it was possible, they would make our lives much more uncomfortable.&nbsp; And that is also putting it mildly.&nbsp; It is our task to ensure that it is not possible for them to do that to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural state of affairs in this region therefore is disorder and tension.&nbsp; It is not peace, progress and stability.&nbsp; We have turned this dangerous state of affairs on its head, and used it for our prosperity.&nbsp; But we have to work with that disorder and work very hard, all the time, to make sure that it does not wash over us.&nbsp; And we have to keep several steps ahead of it on all fronts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments about whether we should pay our entire Cabinet S$10 million per annum more, appear almost absurd when compared with the real issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for comparisons with other countries.&nbsp; When you deal with policy issues, make sure your arguments are valid.&nbsp; Look at the US, New Zealand, Finland;&nbsp;look at their history, population, culture, their political systems, the type of people they get into Government and then ask yourselves whether direct comparisons make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me deal with the second point that is often made - that public office involves substantial public service and therefore, there must be a sacrifice.&nbsp; It throws up a number of questions.&nbsp; How do you quantify the sacrifice that is needed?&nbsp; What is the nature of the sacrifice that is needed?&nbsp; Or I will make an even more fundamental point.&nbsp; If you look at how this concept of public service came about, you will see how much it is bound by hypocrisy.&nbsp; This concept was developed at a time when one had to be an aristrocrat to be in power.&nbsp; The somewhat patronising approach was that the aristrocrats had to do their bit for society by taking on political office - <I>Noblesse Oblige</I>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth, however, is more prosaic and less romantic.&nbsp; A friend sent me an extract from the British House of Commons Information Office on British Ministerial Salaries and that document has this wonderful quote from Lord Macaulay about what office holders who came in for public service, under the so-called concept of <I>Noblesse Oblige,</I> did.&nbsp; I quote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"From the nobleman who held the White Staff and the Great Seal, down to the humblest tidewaiter and gauger, what would now be called gross corruption was practised without disguise and without reproach.&nbsp; Titles, places, commissions, pardons, were daily sold in the market overtly by the greatest dignatories of the realm; in the 17th Century, a statesman who was at the head of affairs might easily and without giving scandal, accumulate in&nbsp;no long time, an estate amply sufficient to support a dukedom.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office holding in truth meant power and through power, serious wealth.&nbsp; Human nature has not changed much over the years.&nbsp; When you design a system, you do not work on the basis that you will get another generation like our founding generation.&nbsp; You set up&nbsp;a system for bright people with perfectly understandable and acceptable wishes, aspirations and values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua spoke from her heart.&nbsp; I admire the conviction with which she spoke and she said there are people who will be prepared to sacrifice.&nbsp; I agree but that misses the point.&nbsp; Some may be prepared to sacrifice but we cannot take a chance and rely on people making sacrifices in order to come to public service.&nbsp; It is too important.&nbsp; It is the future of Singapore.&nbsp; You cannot rely on people's charity.&nbsp; You have to put in place a system that you know will work and not rely on the good faith alone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the 17th Century, the British reformed their system and by the early 20th century, a top Minister like Churchill was earning about 5,000 pounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am told that that would be worth about 350,000 pounds in today's terms.&nbsp; That is roughly what our MR4 was.&nbsp; But British Ministerial salaries have not kept pace with inflation.&nbsp; It is probably not politically feasible in the UK.&nbsp; But that does not make it right.&nbsp; As an aside, if you read Roy Jenkin's biography of Churchill, you will see that Churchill also made some money by writing.&nbsp; For example, he received an advance of 8,000 pounds for a book (about half a million pounds now) in the early 20th century, just before he took office.&nbsp; In the year in 1960, President Kennedy was getting US$150,000.&nbsp; The Presidential salaries had kept pace with inflation.&nbsp; The salary would be higher than the US$450,000 that the US President now gets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we need to know this concept and the context and the history before we start talking about public service and sacrifice.&nbsp; Historically, there was really no real sacrifice in financial terms and salaries were relatively high and, when they were low, there were other significant advantages.&nbsp; Through a lack of political will, over time, public service salaries have fallen in many countries.&nbsp; Why do we think that such an approach is a correct one or that it will work for us?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about sacrifice, ask - what is the logic behind the idea of sacrifice?&nbsp; Why do we demand financial sacrifice from those going into public service?&nbsp; Is that the most sensible way of showing one's commitment to one's country?&nbsp; It is surely more logical to make sure that money is a neutral factor, ie, it should neither be an attraction nor a disincentive.&nbsp; Qualified people should be able to make the choice of public service based solely on whether they have the ability, character and commitment to make a difference to society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, when you refer to idealism and sacrifice, the question also is - how much sacrifice is enough?&nbsp; Take the young person whom I referred to earlier, who is about to embark on a career.&nbsp; He can go into public service or he can go and become a lawyer or an accountant with an expectation that he will get S$4 million or more a year; or start a business with the possibility of eventually earning tens of millions.&nbsp; And we are talking about the very best - the people who know that if they start out on a career, they will reach the top. &nbsp;If he chooses the public service and if he is paid S$2 million&nbsp; a year, he will, nevertheless, forgo S$2 million a year over 10 to 15 years.&nbsp; That is a S$20 million to S$30 million sacrifice.&nbsp; Is that not enough?&nbsp; How many successful people in the private sector contribute S$25 million to charity?&nbsp; I will say, let us get real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem, of course, is for the bulk of the population, it is difficult to comprehend this sort of numbers.&nbsp; So, it is easy to make political points, as Mr Low sometimes makes, but we have a greater duty to look at the market from which we are sourcing the talent and saying what is it that we need to do in order to get them.&nbsp; Money should not be an attraction&nbsp;nor should it be a disincentive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Ministers are public servants.&nbsp; Yes, they have to be much more than the equivalent of top private sector professionals.&nbsp; But taking the arguments made by the critics at face value, a Minister has to have all the brain power and analytical qualities and energy of a top private sector performer; and on top of that, he&nbsp; has to also have a strong sense of public spiritedness, ie, they should be more capable and more all-rounded than private sector high fliers.&nbsp; Is that an argument or is that a&nbsp;logic for saying that Ministers then&nbsp;should get less than private sector top performers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central thread underlying all these arguments against a salary increase is a breezy assumption: that we are in a steady state, there is a lot of talents available and people will cheerfully give up S$25 million over a 10 to 15-year period for the sake of public service.&nbsp; And that even if the best do not come into public service, nevertheless, we will somehow carry on prosperously, like various European countries.&nbsp; I wish such a&nbsp; \"blue sky\" scenario is real.&nbsp; But an hour's plane ride will tell you otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, there are number of other points made: is the formula correct?&nbsp; Are we looking at too small a sample?&nbsp; The private sector winners will change every year, whereas the Ministers remain the same, and that&nbsp;means the Ministers will&nbsp;win every year, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Ministers are at the apex of the system.&nbsp; You have to compare them with those at the apex of the private sector.&nbsp; Any other comparison will be meaningless.&nbsp; If you want the very best - then the comparisons must be with the very best.&nbsp; In this context, I would like to refer to what my colleagues, Mr Hri Kumar and others, have said - that senior partners, for example, of major professional firms are equity owners and take an enterprise risk and that their income is different from salaries.&nbsp; In theory, that may be so but, in truth and in reality, the fact is if you are bright and you are very good and you start out in a professional firm, you will reach the top and along the way, you accumulate enough equity.&nbsp; So, sometimes, the risk is overstated.&nbsp; The test is that there is really a lot of room at the top.&nbsp; You just have to be good enough.&nbsp; And if you are good enough, you will overcome all these risks.&nbsp; Therefore, the best and most suitable approach is really to compare with the top performers, as long as the Minister is performing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;I will end with another quote, again&nbsp;from Chief Justice Roberts.&nbsp; He said: \"Reason commands action.\" &nbsp;He said that in January 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;For us as well, reason commands action.&nbsp; Inaction, due to lack of political will, will be a failure - a failure to do the right thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The critics of this policy are however&nbsp;right on one thing.&nbsp; Public sentiment is not positive on these changes.&nbsp; It will strain the social compact.&nbsp; And I do not believe that the ground sentiment is going to change anytime soon.&nbsp; So this is one of those policies on which political capital has to be spent.&nbsp; But spend it we must, for the longer-term good of this country.&nbsp; And we have to do our best to bring across the nature of our society, the risks we face and how we are different from other more natural countries, to explain and,&nbsp;hopefully,&nbsp;eventually convince the ground.&nbsp; It will take time.

And I agree with Mr Shanmugam that it would be naive and simplistic to assume that anyone, no matter how he loves Singapore, would be motivated to public service by ideals alone. Just how adequate and sufficient the reward should be remains the crux of the issue. So we have identified some professions and used the median income of these professions as a basis for rewarding our Ministers. The question is always: is this a fair comparison?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will say that it is not. For them, the main difference lies in the market discipline and the regulatory controls imposed to ensure fair market practices and consumer protection. Take the case of a CEO of a listed company. Many listed company CEOs will tell you soon enough of how the market will punish them, their company stocks particularly, if their periodic numbers are not profitable. Often, CEOs are rewarded on the basis of the financial performance and that is usually benchmarked against the bottom line or the profits of the company. In many cases, where the company is not doing well, or the company continues to bleed red ink, stock prices will more likely dive southwards and in many cases, CEOs will be told to go; which perhaps explains why many CEOs in the US, while they are paid very handsomely, do not last on the average more than five years on the job. In their case, every time the company performs badly quarter on quarter, the CEO's job is at risk. And the market knows it because of the legal requirement, in the case of listed entities, to post the results of the company's performance on a regular basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, take the case of a professional. Why is a lawyer paid the wages that he earns? Again, market discipline plays a major part in this. Would a lawyer be able to earn the kind of salary that he enjoys if he was no good? I am a lawyer, and I will be the first to tell you that if I am no good, my clients would take their custom elsewhere to other lawyers who will be eagerly standing in line to take my place. Conversely, if a lawyer is good, because he is able to solve complex legal problems, he will be paid a premium and no one would begrudge him of that.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Ministers' salaries, many would argue that it would not be fair to compare Ministers' salaries with the private sector because they are not subject to the same market discipline as the high earners in the private sector are. For goods and services, a client is free to go to another firm if he is not satisfied with what he is getting. The same, however, cannot be said of public services. Outside of general elections, there are no competing services for public policies on health, education, or transportation, for example, that would set the appropriate real time benchmark for determining the quality of the Minister's performance. Equally, in many cases, at least unlike&nbsp;listed companies, there is no established framework of disclosure that would help to determine the actual performance of the Ministries, the quality of the Minister's contribution to the policy process and the outcome of these policies as to its effectiveness. In the context of and the tradition of the British parliamentary democracy which we inherited, the Minister's performance is determined by the ability of the backbencher to raise questions about particular policies and the Minister's continuing stay in Cabinet would depend largely on his ability to give an account of and defend the policies of his Ministry. This is very much a hit and miss approach for which I cannot say is entirely satisfactory. Why so?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, information flow is more often guarded by secrecy than by open candour; with the consequence that unless a scandal breaks out, whether or not exposed by the media, or the Auditor-General picks up an administrative lapse, it would be difficult for the public to have a full and complete picture of the performance of the Ministry and, hence, the performance of the Minister. I do not deny that our Ministers and&nbsp;Ministries are excellent. However, as it stands, we do not know if they could be better; or if the Ministries are performing badly, it could be worse but for the work of the Minister and his senior civil servants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, under the current system, the work of the Ministry is carried out by the professional civil servants who are led by the Permanent Secretary. The Minister&rsquo;s role is largely political, the main thrust of which is the strategic direction and political defence of the work of the Ministry. In this regard, it is the civil servants who prepare the answers to questions raised in Parliament and often, provide answers to anticipated questions. Political appointees do not often write papers. They do not do the research, neither do they undertake the execution of policies. But they provide policy directions in a similar way that directors of a company provide the strategic thrust for the management. Above all, they take responsibility for the work of the Ministry in the same way that the Companies Act pins responsibility on directors for the failings of the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very often, as in the case of companies, it is the civil servant who may bring up proposals to be endorsed by the political master. How much work, input or value add is provided by the Minister is not clearly defined in the current framework. For this reason, while the public would have no issue with the high salary given to the Permanent Secretaries and senior civil servants, they become a lot more apprehensive when it comes to Ministers. Should the Ministers therefore be remunerated for the responsibility that they take, or should they be paid by policy directions that they provide? I think the Government should be clear about this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it has been a while since we initiated the policy of pegging Ministers' salaries to private sector salaries. How have we fared? Underlying the debate is the belief that we would be in a better position in tapping talent from the private sector, after implementing the policy proposed by the White Paper in 1994. In the current Cabinet of full Ministers, one Minister came from a bank and a surgeon came from the private practice. The rest were elevated from the civil service, having spent the most part of their careers in policy-making. With the exception of one, whose profession is not included in the list of professions used as benchmarks, their present salaries generally would have been higher than what they were earning previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does it mean for us? After 14 years since we introduced the policy of pegging the Ministers' salary to the private sector, there is still no clear evidence that pegging the Ministers' salary will necessarily result in more people from the private sector being inducted into public service. The fact remains that the bulk of our Ministerial candidates continue to be drawn from the civil service; and rightly so, as these entrants would have had long years of policy experience to take on Ministerial appointments in the Cabinet. Yet, this does not mean that we do not have to pay our civil servants and&nbsp;Ministers well. I suppose for civil servants, it is settled principle that we should pay them well enough to keep them happy in service and for Ministers, well enough for talented and able civil servants to know that there is career and pay advancement beyond the level of the Permanent Secretary. If we can accept this as a basic principle, even in the way we apply the settled formula, I am sure we will be in a position to decide on what is a reasonable compensation for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question at the end of the day, Madam,&nbsp;is not how much a Minister should be paid. I do not think that people mind generally that Ministers should be paid highly. The question really is whether there are sufficient and clear benchmarks that will properly determine the Minister's work and the quality of his contribution to the work of the Ministry. I believe it will be easier for the people to accept increases in the Ministers' salary if the Government is more open about the process of measuring the performance of the Minister. In past debates in this House on this topic, there have been&nbsp;calls, including today, in the light of Ms Denise Phua's speech, to have a more transparent process of measuring the performance of Ministers; such as perhaps having an independent body, headed by the President, to provide&nbsp;an independent and institutionalised process of assessing the performance of Ministers because&nbsp;this will help to add to the confidence of the process of fixing the wages&nbsp;and rewarding Ministers. I support this proposal and hope the Government will consider this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to serve our nation is both a duty and a privilege which all Singaporeans should apply himself or herself to without hesitation. Money is an important consideration. However, it must never be at the forefront of our consideration to enter public service. High salaries as inducement for entering public service will rob the Minister and his office of the moral high ground to serve. Great names in history are often remembered for the sacrifices that were made than by the monies that they earned. Highly capable people who are not prepared to make the sacrifice should not be called to serve. In fact, in some cases, I think our country&rsquo;s interest will be better served, if they remain where they are. They can be co-opted into service in other ways as this Government has often done.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070410/20070410VS_090502.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a> *.</I>]&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, in 1994, during the parliamentary debate on Ministerial salaries, Minister Mentor Lee said, and I quote, \"Even for Lim Kim San, Barker, Hon Sui Sen, the first generation leaders, whether they will still step forward bravely to decide today to serve in the Government and serve in politics, it is not certain.\"&nbsp; The former Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan, said that the immediate task our Government is facing today is how to ensure that the young generation will continue to lead Singapore and to take over the Ministerial positions and bring Singapore forward.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, unless there are better alternatives, the high salary policy is the only practical measure to attract talents to serve in the Government, in Singapore's context. The day before, a report in <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I> pointed out that, despite having a population of 1.3 billion people, China today also faces the same problem of a shortage of leaders.&nbsp; In Singapore, we only have 4.5 million people; the shortage of talents is a more serious problem.&nbsp; Last night, the Taiwan TVBS channel reported the salary increase for the Singapore Prime Minister and compared Singapore Prime Minister's salary with their President's salary. And they hinted obliquely that Singapore PM's salary is 10 times their President's salary.&nbsp; I think the newscaster has probably forgotten, or perhaps she is not aware that each time their President used the presidential jet, it would cost more than a few million Taiwan dollars, or even more than 10 billion Taiwan dollars. But our Prime Minister only travels first-class on SIA.&nbsp; How do you compare?&nbsp; And also, the reporter forgot that their President has certain claims for his expenses.&nbsp; But our Ministers only receive one salary. So, in comparison, there are a lot of anomalies because many foreign friends do not realise that our Prime Minister and the Ministers only receive a salary and there&nbsp;are no other claims for entertainment expenses, special fees and other fees.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, two friends from Beijing came to visit me, and I drove them around Singapore.&nbsp; Coincidentally, there was a Minister's car passing by.&nbsp; So I pointed out to my friends and said that he is one of our Ministers.&nbsp; He said, \"Oh, your Minister is very young.\" And I asked, \"Which one?\" He replied, \"The one on the front seat next to the driver.\"&nbsp; I told them, \"No, that is the bodyguard. The one driving is the Minister.\"&nbsp; So the Minister has become the driver for his security officer!&nbsp; That would be big news in China.&nbsp; But that is the practical reality of Singapore.&nbsp; I do not think there is any other country where the Minister becomes the driver for his security officer. This reflects Singapore's own unique circumstances.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of the salary increase for Ministers, what is the reaction of the citizens?&nbsp; I can summarise it in one sentence and&nbsp;the voice of the people is: \"Ministers, please do not forget about us.\"&nbsp; In fact, this Government has not forgotten about the people at any time because party politics has this special feature that the power comes from the people.&nbsp; The governing party understands this principle and I think the Opposition party also understands this principle.&nbsp; The Minister for Finance, in this year's Budget said, since 2001, the Government has distributed a total of $7.5 billion, to share the fruits of success with the people.&nbsp; This year, the Government has set aside $4 billion to share with the people of our country.&nbsp; The important thing is that the bulk of this amount is spent on looking after the lower income families.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, we are a small country, we have started from scratch, to having everything today.&nbsp; We cannot afford to have corruption in our political regime. Otherwise, we are going to lose everything that we have.&nbsp; Therefore, when the Government spent $4 billion to look after the middle- and lower-income people, I fully support the increase in our Ministerial salaries and senior civil servants' salaries. And I hope that&nbsp;Prime Minister Lee's team will introduce more pro-people measures every year .<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 367-368.\r\n<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.40 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to participate in this debate.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, when I spoke in this House on the Integrated Resorts, I thought that that was one hotly debated topic.&nbsp; Now, I realise that the debate on public service pay is much more highly charged.&nbsp; The strange coincidence is on that day, I was also one of the last speakers in the House and I was holding everyone up from dinner, so I asked the remaining Members in this House to please bear with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start by listing some basic premises everyone can all agree on.&nbsp; Firstly, civil servants and public service leaders must be compensated adequately, and wage adequacy depends on the relevant private compensation levels.&nbsp; I have many friends who are teachers, for example, and I know they toil very hard.&nbsp; They need to be given their dues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we need to cultivate a strong public service ethos in our nation so that we can have the right people with the best interests of Singapore, and enough of them to take the nation forward.&nbsp; For a young nation, it is an imperative to build up dedication to the nation and its institutions, such as the civil service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Singaporeans want a good and honest Government.&nbsp; It is important for us to agree on all these premises, and I think we all do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how I think the issue on the civil service salary revisions should be framed.&nbsp; However, the way this issue has played out in our national discourse has been unfortunate. The problem is in the messaging to Singaporeans.&nbsp; Right now, the message from the Government is that the only way to get people to serve the country, especially at the top leadership positions in political office, is to lure them with money. It may not be the message the Government intends to send out.&nbsp; As the Minister in charge of civil service said yesterday, \"financial rewards cannot and should not be the main motivation of those in the public service\".&nbsp;But this latter aspect has only been on the periphery of this long-standing and widely debated issue, at least, in respect to service in the top leadership positions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far back as 1989, the Prime Minister, then the Minister for Trade and Industry, said that the Government \"will offer whatever salaries are necessary to attract and retain the talent that it needs\".&nbsp; Madam, this has been the consistent message from the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have to go extreme financial lengths, I, like my colleague, Mr Siew, question whether we would be getting the right people to lead this country.&nbsp; Running a country is not the same as running a company.&nbsp; As a small and young nation, we may be able to ride on the buoyancy of a good economy,&nbsp;but we can only be anchored by firm ideals and values.&nbsp; Without the anchor, we would lose our bearings.&nbsp; Surely then, public service motivated by passion and dedication is one of those ideals and values.&nbsp; Surely then, we have to cultivate and nurture this.&nbsp; If we focus on the financial rewards, and we design a system which emphasises this aspect, are we acting in our nation's best long-term interest?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the latest revisions, we are told that a $1.2 million salary is not enough to build a good enough Government.&nbsp; $1.6 million is now needed.&nbsp; If Singapore's Government waxes and wanes by the dollar quantum, I think we are in trouble.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, we know we can get a good and honest Government without getting into a race for the highest salaries.&nbsp; We need not look at Finland, Denmark and Switzerland for examples.&nbsp; I recently read a research paper by NUS political science lecturer, Jon Quah, that the PAP Government was only able to implement the second prong of its anti-corruption strategy, ie, the reduction of incentives for corruption by improving the salaries and working conditions in the Singapore Civil Service, in the 1980s, long after we had achieved economic growth.&nbsp; Although they lagged behind what would have been the commensurate market pay at that time, much more than the current gap, Singaporeans still enjoyed good governance.&nbsp; Although we do not want to return to that situation and we can afford to pay more now, the point is that good governance is not exponentially increased with increasing salaries.&nbsp; It may be helpful to bear in mind that the principle of diminishing marginal returns will set in.&nbsp; Beyond paying a certain amount, how much more are we improving good governance?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, we should be concerned about the message that we are sending, especially to our youth.&nbsp; We should be wary about suggesting that we can buy leadership, that we can buy dedication, compassion for people and the willingness to serve.&nbsp; Administrative culture both reflects and influences the norms of society at large.&nbsp; In a small country like Singapore, where the State plays a far bigger role than in other countries, it wields greater influence in the transmission of values.&nbsp; We should moderate the current financial-driven approach to public service.&nbsp; The Government may put off people who are willing to serve out of passion.&nbsp; In fact, the suggestion is that the Government is only looking for individuals from the top 438 income-earners to serve, since the emphasis is on the financial sacrifices said to be involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, it is not just about idealism, although it must still be the most important point.&nbsp; Sometimes, the implication of a policy or system cannot be foreseen, and there could be unforeseen dangers in the current system for Ministerial salaries.&nbsp; We hear continual warnings from this Government about the danger of being led by a rogue government.&nbsp; Madam, I agree.&nbsp; Precisely, when political power is coupled with immense financial power, these are the conditions that make it more likely to lead to the creation of such a government, especially if we attract people who are motivated by financial gain.&nbsp; We can dangle million-dollar salaries in the belief that it is the only way to get good people, but we may instead get people with ulterior motives, which are much harder to detect.&nbsp; As a small country, we cannot risk that.&nbsp; Moreover, with a system which pegs salaries at between the 24th and 25th highest earner of only six professions, I fear that it is easy for a government which chooses to do so, to enrich itself in subtle but deceitful ways, such as by providing preferential access to public resources, government contracts or favourable legislation.&nbsp; In the current system, it is easy for politicians to establish a close nexus of connections with just a few dozen income earners.&nbsp; While the current set of leaders is honest enough not to exploit this, can this be guaranteed for all future governments?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Teo has pointed out, and I thank him for his explanation, the stringent criteria in selecting good people.&nbsp; Madam, the reason why I am still concerned is because the question is whether we are willing to take such risks.&nbsp; At the LKY School of Public Policy event last year, when asked if it is possible to hire foreign talent to run the country, the Minister Mentor said: \"No.&nbsp; You must have the passion, you must have the commitment, you must share the dreams of the people.\"&nbsp; So we must always try to nurture this sense of public service and find the right ways and the right balance in attracting our future leaders.&nbsp; Are we in danger of casting this aspect to the periphery?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I am glad the Minister in charge of the civil service welcomes our views and ideas about the methodology for arriving at a suitable salary benchmark for Ministers, senior civil servants and directors in the Administrative Service, otherwise known as the MR4 and SR9 benchmarks.&nbsp; He said yesterday that there is \"no perfect method\" for doing these benchmarks.&nbsp; Madam, I humbly submit that not only is the current method less than perfect, it is flawed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the possibility of abuse, it also goes against the principle that&nbsp;the Minister said that our public service subscribes to - the principle that \"we do not seek to lead the market, but to keep pace with it\".&nbsp; Here is how:&nbsp; Salaries at the current benchmark at the MR4 grade, would rank our 18 Cabinet Ministers within the top 438 income earners.&nbsp; The current number of senior Permanent Secretaries in the civil service has not been reviewed, but a <I>Straits Times'</I> article in 2004 reported that there were eight Permanent Secretaries, some of whom were stepping down to be replaced by others.&nbsp; Let us say that there are 25 Ministers and senior civil servants altogether.&nbsp; That would mean nearly 6% of the top income earners come from the public service.&nbsp; But, Madam, the Singapore Civil Service, with a size of 64,000 people, represents less than 2.5% of the Singapore labour force of 2.6 million workers.&nbsp; If the policy is truly to ensure that public officers are paid commensurate with the private sector, and nothing more, then a better benchmark would be to peg salaries to the point at which the Ministers and senior civil servants are proportionately represented among the top jobs in the private sector.&nbsp; If there are 25 individuals in the MR4 grade or higher, then the benchmark should be at the 1,000th income-earner.&nbsp; Likewise, if the figure is 20 individuals, then the benchmark is at the 800th income-earner.&nbsp; It becomes a self-adjusting formula.&nbsp; The principle is such:&nbsp; 2.5% of the labour force, 2.5% of the top income earners.&nbsp; This upholds the principle of keeping pace with the market and not leading it.&nbsp; The current benchmark does not.&nbsp; Even the Government has not followed the benchmark more times than it has since 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, this should also apply to the SR9 benchmark.&nbsp; Depending on how many Administrative Service officers are in this salary grade, the pay package should be pegged to the point at which they are commensurately represented among the top earners aged 32.&nbsp; Again, the number of officers in this grade has not been revealed.&nbsp; But whatever the number, pegging it to the 15th income earner is completely arbitrary and definitely leads the market rather than follow it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, finally, there is one thing that puzzles me.&nbsp; I understand that the benchmark is meant to be reviewed every five years.&nbsp; The 1994 White Paper was implemented the following year and the next salary review came in 2000 and was implemented in 2001.&nbsp; So, given that resignation rates have been going up in the civil service since then, why did we not do the salary review in 2005?&nbsp; Why did we wait until now when the situation seems to be more dire?&nbsp; If attracting good people to serve the country is the challenge, why did we not do the salary review two years ago when the PAP Government was looking for people to stand in elections and serve the country?&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister can help to clarify this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, we should never downplay the capabilities of Singaporeans in their role in taking Singapore forward, in terms of the potential they have to lead the country with dedication and passion and in their contributions in tandem with the Government.&nbsp; They, as much as the Government, are the reason we have progressed to where we are now.&nbsp; Leadership that flies on the wings of passion and dedication can take the country higher than the engine of financial rewards.&nbsp; We will always reap what we sow.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS--><p align=left>Column No : 338<p>\r\n\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE--><p align=left>Column No : 353<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE:::354-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
