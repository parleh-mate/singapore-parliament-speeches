He\r\n\r\nalso  announced in his Budget Statement seven items\r\n\r\nof  tax  reliefs and a surplus of $20 million.  All\r\n\r\nthis goes to show that Singapore is in a very sound\r\n\r\nfinancial  position.  This  is  a  budget  that  is\r\n\r\nwelcomed  by  all  the people of Singapore,  and  I\r\n\r\nhereby support the financial policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government is now concentrating its\r\n\r\nefforts on industrialisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  urbanisation  in order to catch  up  with  the\r\n\r\ntechnologically  advanced  countries.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nconcentrating    its   efforts   on   technological\r\n\r\ndevelopments  as  a  means to further  develop  our\r\n\r\neconomy.   All   this   is   very   well    because\r\n\r\ncircumstances  are such that we have  to  catch  up\r\n\r\nwith the other advanced countries. But I would like\r\n\r\nto  take  this opportunity to remind the Government\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  not overlook certain  aspects  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  that have taken place in some  Western\r\n\r\ncountries. The development of their technology  and\r\n\r\neconomy  have  brought about certain  shortcomings.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also  the evolvement of  escapism  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  excessive  material  development.   The\r\n\r\nspiritual aspect of human life must be looked into.\r\n\r\nCreativity,  the emotions of human  beings,  should\r\n\r\nalso  be developed together with technological  and\r\n\r\nmaterial development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the process of urbanisation and\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in Singapore, the Government  has\r\n\r\ntaken various steps to control social pathology and\r\n\r\nother   shortcomings.  These   shortcomings   which\r\n\r\naccompany  material  and technological  development\r\n\r\nare  air pollution, environmental pollution,  noise\r\n\r\npollution,    industrial   accidents,    industrial\r\n\r\ndiseases, traffic congestion, and a host of others.\r\n\r\nThe  abuse of the mass media is also one aspect  of\r\n\r\nthe  shortcomings. People are more  concerned  with\r\n\r\ntheir own material enjoyment than the interests and\r\n\r\nwelfare of the country. In other words, the  people\r\n\r\nare  becoming more and more selfish. They take less\r\n\r\nand  less  interest  in  the  people  around  them.\r\n\r\nDegradation and decadence, therefore, set in. As  a\r\n\r\nresult of this phenomenon, crimes are mounting  and\r\n\r\nanti-social  activities  are  increasing.  We  have\r\n\r\ngangsterism, blackmail, juvenile delinquency, and a\r\n\r\nhost of other anti-social activities. On top of all\r\n\r\nthis,  there  is  the problem of drug  abuse.  Drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking is going on in Singapore. Young  people\r\n\r\nare sporting long hair in spite of the Government's\r\n\r\nattempt to discourage it. It is regrettable that we\r\n\r\ncan  still  see in this corner of the  world  young\r\n\r\npeople  taking  drugs,  sporting  long  hair,   and\r\n\r\nengaging  in  activities outside the ambit  of  the\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to create a healthy and wholesome\r\n\r\nsocial atmosphere and environment, we must not fall\r\n\r\ninto  the  wake  of  some technologically  advanced\r\n\r\nWestern   countries.   Over  and   above   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, the Government should pay attention to\r\n\r\ncultural development. The people must be inculcated\r\n\r\nwith a sense of belonging. They must be educated in\r\n\r\nthe effort to make Singapore a clean and pollution-free  city. I do not think that campaigns like  the\r\n\r\n\"Tree  Planting Campaign\", \"Anti-Mosquito Campaign\"\r\n\r\nand \"Family Planning Campaign\" have been adequately\r\n\r\ncarried  out.  I  hope  that  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nallocate  more funds to step up these campaigns  in\r\n\r\norder  to avoid the by-products and the ill-effects\r\n\r\nof  industrialisation. Sir, although we  cannot  be\r\n\r\nassured  that  the ill-effects of industrialisation\r\n\r\ncan  be totally eradicated, I am sure that with all\r\n\r\nthe efforts put in, we can reduce them to a certain\r\n\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the prosperity and economy of\r\n\r\nSingapore are developing at a pace far greater than\r\n\r\nour   neighbouring  countries.  This  brings  about\r\n\r\nunemployment   in   those  countries,   and   these\r\n\r\nunemployed   people  are  therefore  pouring   into\r\n\r\nSingapore. This may cause an \"explosion\" in future.\r\n\r\nI  would,  therefore, propose to the Government  to\r\n\r\nencourage   Singaporeans   to   invest    in    our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries. Encouragement  should  also\r\n\r\nbe given to our technicians and technocrats to help\r\n\r\nin  the  development of our neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nThis  will not only help those countries  to  solve\r\n\r\ntheir  unemployment  problem  and  to  raise  their\r\n\r\nstandard  of living, but will also ultimately  help\r\n\r\nus  to  check the danger of a potential \"explosion\"\r\n\r\nfrom occurring in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, even with an enlightened\r\n\r\nleadership,  Singapore cannot function without  the\r\n\r\nsincere  co-operation of the people.  If  there  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a co-operation, I am confident that Singapore\r\n\r\nwill have a brighter future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I must congratulate the hon. Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance for his pain-less\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget.  It  was  a Budget  which  was  quite\r\n\r\nrightly  described by a newspaper as  one  \"with  a\r\n\r\nheart\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who comes from the manufacturing sector, I\r\n\r\nnote  with concern the fact that earnings from  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector as measured by  the  GDP  have\r\n\r\ndeclined  in 1972 to only 20.1 per cent as  against\r\n\r\n25  per  cent in 1971 and 27.5 per cent in 1970.  I\r\n\r\nalso  note from the Minister's statement  that  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing investment commitments  fell  sharply\r\n\r\nfrom  $716  million  in 1971 to $252  million  last\r\n\r\nyear.  While it is accepted that this drop  may  be\r\n\r\ndue  in  part  to  investment  commitments  of  the\r\n\r\npetroleum   refining  industry  as  well   as   the\r\n\r\nshipbuilding and repairing yards, this alone  could\r\n\r\nnot account for the big drop in investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Minister has\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  his  statement that  the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is correlated to its being considered  an\r\n\r\nideal   off-shore  manufacturing  base  for  multi-nationals and their subsidiaries, and that  special\r\n\r\nefforts will be made to attract more investment  to\r\n\r\ncome  to  Singapore.  While  paying  attention   to\r\n\r\nattracting more investment to come to Singapore, it\r\n\r\nis  also  necessary to make a study of the possible\r\n\r\ncauses   of   this   decline  in   investment   and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing earnings. While we like to  encourage\r\n\r\nnew  multi-national firms to come to Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nmust not overlook the existing ones, especially the\r\n\r\nlocal  industries that are now established  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year, manufacturers in Singapore have\r\n\r\nbeen  faced  with increased costs  in  many  areas.\r\n\r\nThere  were taxation and other increases which  may\r\n\r\nhave    directly   and   sharply   increased    the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and production costs. These may  have\r\n\r\ncontributed   to   the  decline  in   manufacturing\r\n\r\nearnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to suggest to the\r\n\r\nMinister to look into some of these factors  which,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  are  causing hardship  to  some  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  industries,  and  which  may  have   also\r\n\r\ndeterred   would-be  investors   from   coming   to\r\n\r\nSingapore. In addition, the high increase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin production cost has either deterred  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  programme of many manufacturers  or  has\r\n\r\ndriven  some  of them to transfer their  operations\r\n\r\nand or expansion to neighbouring countries. Some of\r\n\r\nthese factors are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Increasing cost of raw materials\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Increase in freight charges\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Revision of PSA tariffs\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Revision of PUB electricity tariffs\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Revision of the water rates and the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the block system of charging\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Additional cost of anti-pollution measures\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Increase in land rentals, leading to increase\r\n\r\nin assessments\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Increase in assessed land values leading to\r\n\r\nhigher assessments\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Increase in workmen's compensation premium,\r\n\r\nresulting   from   the   higher   compensation\r\n\r\npayable, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Increase in CPF contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is justification for some of these\r\n\r\nincreases,  for  example,  the  increase   in   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions. But I think it is the  duty  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  if we are to encourage the  growth  of\r\n\r\nindustries in Singapore, to exercise better control\r\n\r\nover  some  of  the other increases. While  we  are\r\n\r\ntrying to compete in an extremely competitive world\r\n\r\nmarket,   it   may   not  be  possible   for   many\r\n\r\nmanufacturers, especially the local industries,  to\r\n\r\nbear  all these increased costs within such a short\r\n\r\nspace  of  time. Obviously it is very difficult  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  the  extent of these increases  in  real\r\n\r\nterms  of  costs, or how they will directly  affect\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of production of the various industries.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  these increases in  terms  of  costs\r\n\r\nwill  make  our products less competitive  and,  if\r\n\r\nthey  are for the local market, manufacturers  will\r\n\r\nhave  no choice but to pass these increases  on  to\r\n\r\nthe consumers, thereby causing inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, this is a vicious cycle. Some of the\r\n\r\nincreases,  which  I  have  mentioned  above,   are\r\n\r\ncompletely  outside the control of the  Government,\r\n\r\nbut the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  increases,  such  as  in  land  rentals,  in\r\n\r\nassessed  land values, in additional cost of  anti-pollution  measures, and in the revision  of  rates\r\n\r\nfor  public utilities, can and should be controlled\r\n\r\nand  coordinated  if  we are to  maintain  or  even\r\n\r\nincrease  our  rate of industrialisation.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  like to urge the Government to seriously\r\n\r\nlook  into the matter before the activities of  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector are affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point I would like to\r\n\r\nraise  concerns assistance to local  industries  to\r\n\r\nincrease their exports. In June last year,  at  the\r\n\r\nannual   dinner  of  the  Singapore  Manufacturers'\r\n\r\nAssociation,  the  Minister for  Finance  indicated\r\n\r\nthat  he  would  be  prepared to consider  granting\r\n\r\nincome  tax concession to locally-owned  firms  for\r\n\r\nparticipating in approved trade fairs, exhibitions,\r\n\r\nand  trade  missions,  and which  are  not  already\r\n\r\nenjoying  export incentives or other incentives.  I\r\n\r\nam  therefore a bit disappointed that no  statement\r\n\r\nto  this  effect  is  made in  his  Budget  Speech.\r\n\r\nAlthough  our  exports of industrial products  have\r\n\r\ngrown  substantially over the last 10  years,  they\r\n\r\nare  mainly  due  to the exports of  multi-national\r\n\r\ncompanies,   with  the  electronic  and   petroleum\r\n\r\nindustries  accounting for 53.8  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  industrial export in 1970. This  shows  that\r\n\r\nour  locally-owned  industries accounted  for  only\r\n\r\n46.2  per  cent  or  less than half  of  the  total\r\n\r\nindustrial  export. Even then these export  figures\r\n\r\nof  local  industries are confined to  only  a  few\r\n\r\nindustries,   like  shipbuilding   and   repairing,\r\n\r\ntextiles, food and veneer products. The other local\r\n\r\nindustries show a much slower rate of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government intends to stimulate the growth\r\n\r\nof  local industries, a great deal has still to  be\r\n\r\ndone  to assist them to broaden their base  and  to\r\n\r\ndiversify. One of the more important factors is  to\r\n\r\nencourage  a higher growth of exports. I  therefore\r\n\r\nfeel that special consideration should be given  to\r\n\r\nlocal   manufacturers  at  this  stage   of   their\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  One  way  is to  give  a  double  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction concession. I appreciate that no  blanket\r\n\r\nconcession can be given. I would therefore like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  Treasury  or  the  Income   Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork  closely with those concerned to work out  the\r\n\r\ncriteria, so as to avoid abuse by individuals.  But\r\n\r\nbecause  of  a few individuals who may  abuse  this\r\n\r\nprivilege, there is no excuse to penalise  all  the\r\n\r\nothers.  The types of expenditure which  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  for  double taxation relief  are  those\r\n\r\nwhich  are  normally incurred, i.e, travelling  and\r\n\r\nhotel  expenses, freight for exhibits, construction\r\n\r\ncost  of  display stands and participation fees  in\r\n\r\ntrade   fairs   and  entertainment   supported   by\r\n\r\nreceipts, subject to certain limits. I am confident\r\n\r\nthat  officers from the Income Tax Department  will\r\n\r\nknow how to draw up criteria to avoid abuse and, if\r\n\r\nneed  be,  I would even venture to suggest  that  a\r\n\r\nrealistic   limit  be  set  for  such  double   tax\r\n\r\ndeduction concession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to commend the Government\r\n\r\nfor  the  recent increases in the salaries  of  top\r\n\r\ncivil servants. I understand that not more than 322\r\n\r\nofficers are affected, which is a very small figure\r\n\r\ncompared  to the approximate 50,000 civil  servants\r\n\r\nwe have in Singapore. In line with the Government's\r\n\r\nthinking,  we should not pay too much attention  to\r\n\r\nmaterial  wealth,  and  that  we  should  pay  more\r\n\r\nattention  to  culture, paintings,  music,  etc.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to suggest that, in order to retain some\r\n\r\nof  our  more  promising technical  and  scientific\r\n\r\nofficers   in  the  public  sector   and   in   the\r\n\r\nuniversities,  statutory boards and  the  technical\r\n\r\ninstitutes,  more  funds  should  be  provided  for\r\n\r\nequipment  and  research in order  to  provide  job\r\n\r\nsatisfaction   to   this  category   of   important\r\n\r\npersonnel.  To start with, I would like to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  maybe we should put aside for this purpose  a\r\n\r\nsum  of  $2  million which is only half of  the  $4\r\n\r\nmillion set aside for the increased salaries of the\r\n\r\n322  officers.  This  $2 million  will  give  added\r\n\r\nincentives   and  job  satisfaction  to   the   few\r\n\r\nthousands  who are manning and performing  yeomen's\r\n\r\nservices  in the universities, technical institutes\r\n\r\nand the technical divisions of the public sector. A\r\n\r\nman, especially an educated person, needs money  to\r\n\r\nlive,  but given a sufficient salary he also  needs\r\n\r\nsomething to live for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that there is a provision of $120,000\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ministry of Science and Technology  for\r\n\r\napplied research. There is also a similar provision\r\n\r\nof $100,000 under the Ministry of Health. But these\r\n\r\namounts  are  insufficient to enable a  proper  and\r\n\r\nintensive research to be conducted. I would like to\r\n\r\nsuggest,  for the consideration of the  Government,\r\n\r\nthat  this  sum  of  $2 million  be  added  to  the\r\n\r\nresearch  grant  of  the Ministry  of  Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology  for  equipment and research,  and  that\r\n\r\nthis  grant be given more readily to those research\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the  public  sector.  What  music  and\r\n\r\nculture  is  to  the society, research  is  to  our\r\n\r\nscientists  and  engineers. I hope  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  not  overlook this important aspect  and  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the very important sector of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to comment on\r\n\r\nthe salary scale of the technical officers who,  to\r\n\r\nmy mind, have been overlooked. This important class\r\n\r\nof  technicians is in great demand nowadays.  While\r\n\r\nwe  are  building up our Industrial Training  Board\r\n\r\nand  our technical colleges, we have a greater need\r\n\r\nfor this category of people, since more of them are\r\n\r\nrequired  as teachers and instructors. The  present\r\n\r\nsalary  scale of 5465-1030 per month  will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  keep  good and experienced staff  in  the\r\n\r\ntechnical   institutes  and  in  our  schools.   In\r\n\r\nindustry  such people are employed as  supervisors,\r\n\r\nand  they  are given a much better salary scale.  I\r\n\r\nwould therefore like to suggest to Government  that\r\n\r\na  more  realistic salary scale be implemented  and\r\n\r\nthat the scheme of merit increments should also  be\r\n\r\napplied to this grade of technical officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to comment on, Sir,\r\n\r\nis merely to echo the sentiments of most Members of\r\n\r\nParliament in this House and the public  at  large.\r\n\r\nThis  is  in regard to the tax relief for taxpayers\r\n\r\nwho  support  dependent parents  and  grandparents.\r\n\r\nWhile  this tax relief is most welcome by all,  the\r\n\r\namount  of  tax deduction of $300 per dependant  is\r\n\r\nindeed on the low side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn   addition,   the   relief   should   be   given\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  whether or not  the  parents  are\r\n\r\nstaying  with the taxpayer, provided genuine  proof\r\n\r\nof support is given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, in his Budget Statement the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance has briefly described a survey of  our\r\n\r\neconomic  performance in the past, which  indicates\r\n\r\nthat the current financial year will be better than\r\n\r\nthe  last  one.  There  is economic  progress  with\r\n\r\nreduced  taxation, and there will be a  surplus  of\r\n\r\n$20 million. This undoubtedly reflects our economic\r\n\r\nstability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recently has raised the salaries\r\n\r\nof  Government officers in the Superscale in  order\r\n\r\nto  retain them in our public service. This is  one\r\n\r\nway  to  reward officers for higher performance.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that this policy will also be implemented  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  other  categories  of  Government\r\n\r\nofficers, because without their help the Government\r\n\r\ncannot achieve its objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the two considerations, one to encourage and\r\n\r\nto reward an officer for the work he has performed,\r\n\r\nand  the  other  to prevent capable  officers  from\r\n\r\njoining  the  private sector,  I  must  stress  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of the first consideration. Whether  it\r\n\r\nis a country, a society or an individual, it is not\r\n\r\npossible   to  survive  on  material   alone.   The\r\n\r\nspiritual  aspect and value need to be  encouraged,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  make the people lead fuller  and  more\r\n\r\nmeaningful   lives.  Therefore,  the  revision   of\r\n\r\nsalaries of Government officers in order to  retain\r\n\r\ntheir services so that they may not be attracted by\r\n\r\nthe  private sector, together with better treatment\r\n\r\naccorded to them, should be regarded as a  kind  of\r\n\r\nreward  and an acknowledgement for the right spirit\r\n\r\nof service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Finance Minister, medical\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  services will be strengthened  and\r\n\r\nimproved  in the coming financial year.  Living  in\r\n\r\nthis  tense  and industrialised metropolitan  city,\r\n\r\nthere is an increasing need for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedical  services and care. Any measure to increase\r\n\r\nand   improve   this  service  will  be   welcomed.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  a community-sponsored institution  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Chung  Hwa Hospital should get  Government\r\n\r\nsupport.  Medical reliefs know no  boundaries.  The\r\n\r\nauthorities  should  also give  adequate  training,\r\n\r\nmanagement,  study and financial aids to  modernize\r\n\r\nand develop Chinese medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new budget policy will no doubt give relief\r\n\r\nto  taxpayers who support parents and grandparents.\r\n\r\nThough the amount of tax relief is very small, this\r\n\r\nhowever   reflects  the  valued  concept   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in preserving our good tradition. I hope\r\n\r\nthat the Government will also pay attention to  the\r\n\r\nsmaller families, which are the trend, particularly\r\n\r\nthose  living  in flats. However,  due  to  limited\r\n\r\nspace  in these flats, taxpayers may not have their\r\n\r\nparents and grandparents living with them. And very\r\n\r\noften,  we find that children of taxpayers  do  not\r\n\r\nalso  live  together with their parents. After  all\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of relief for support of  parents  and\r\n\r\ngrandparents does not seem too generous. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  should  be no qualification of residence  to\r\n\r\nthe claim for such tax reliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the current international\r\n\r\nmonetary crisis and inflation, the presentation  of\r\n\r\na  progressive budget for Singapore is a creditable\r\n\r\nachievement.   I  hope  that  with  the   judicious\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the Finance  Minister  in  this\r\n\r\ncoming year we may achieve the targeted 15 per cent\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate of our economy, as he had remarked  in\r\n\r\nconcluding his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise to congratulate the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  his  lucid  presentation of  the  Budget.  The\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate  of 13 per cent in our  GNP  has  been\r\n\r\ngreeted with applause, especially in the context of\r\n\r\na   turbulent   world  economy.  The   Government's\r\n\r\nfinancial   position  is  excellent  and   a   boom\r\n\r\npsychology  prevails  in the  banking  sector,  the\r\n\r\nproperty  market  and, until  recently,  the  Stock\r\n\r\nMarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close examination of the financial statistics,\r\n\r\nhowever,  reveals  evidence of distortions  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy which are hidden in exciting growth  rates.\r\n\r\nInstead  of euphoria, I think we need to pay  close\r\n\r\nattention  to  a  number of what I consider  to  be\r\n\r\npotentially  disruptive  factors.  First,  as   the\r\n\r\nMinister  rightly pointed out, is  the  problem  of\r\n\r\ninflation.   The   turmoil  in  the   international\r\n\r\nmonetary  system  is one major  factor  to  contend\r\n\r\nwith.  Unless  we  can  apply proper  monetary  and\r\n\r\nexchange  controls,  we shall  continue  to  import\r\n\r\ninflation in two ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) via higher import prices, because of\r\n\r\ninflation  in  the advanced countries,  which  will\r\n\r\naffect  our cost of living and costs of production,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) via uncontrolled speculative short-term\r\n\r\ncapital  which swamps our property market  and  the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange.  Every time  the  U.S.  Dollar  is\r\n\r\ndevalued  and  other currencies are  up-valued,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  decide on our exchange rate,  keeping  in\r\n\r\nmind four factors:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to preserve our competitive edge in the major\r\n\r\ntrading blocs;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to keep the cost of living from being pushed\r\n\r\nup by higher import prices;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to maintain full employment at a good rate\r\n\r\nof growth; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) to ensure a healthy balance of payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an unsettled international monetary arena, a\r\n\r\nsmall   country  like  ours  must  apply   exchange\r\n\r\ncontrols  on the import of speculative  capital  or\r\n\r\nelse  we  shall be overwhelmed by excess  liquidity\r\n\r\nand  unhealthy inflation. It would not be necessary\r\n\r\nto control export of capital as long as our economy\r\n\r\nremains  vibrant. Besides, this would be unwise  as\r\n\r\nit  would  be  a deterrent to inflow of  productive\r\n\r\nlong-term investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent move by the Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority   of   Singapore  to   increase   reserve\r\n\r\nrequirements of banks to 9 per cent is a  necessary\r\n\r\none  to check excessive growth of money supply  and\r\n\r\ncorresponding  inflation.  However,  I   fear   the\r\n\r\nmeasure will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nineffective,  and  I  think it  is  discriminatory.\r\n\r\nForeign banks are still free to bring in funds from\r\n\r\nabroad.   This  will  place  local   banks   at   a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage.  Moreover, we  should  stipulate  the\r\n\r\nabsolute  levels of foreign funds held by banks  as\r\n\r\nwell   as   maintain  the  higher  reserve   ratio.\r\n\r\nOtherwise  with the increased inflow of  funds,  no\r\n\r\nmatter what the reserve ratio, the money supply can\r\n\r\nbe  extended indefinitely. Paradoxically,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nseem  to have better control over our hawkers  than\r\n\r\nover our bankers and stock brokers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major factor that would need to be\r\n\r\nconsidered  in checking inflation is  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket.  The boom is induced in part by the general\r\n\r\nlevel   of   economic  activity,  but  is   greatly\r\n\r\nexacerbated by speculation, fuelled particularly by\r\n\r\nthe  inflow of hot money. The unhealthy boom in the\r\n\r\nproperty  market has severely penalised the  middle\r\n\r\nand  lower-middle income groups, the executive  and\r\n\r\nthe  professional  people. It has also  contributed\r\n\r\nsignificantly  to the Stock Market boom  as  shares\r\n\r\nwere  re-valued  in  the light of  higher  property\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe Government should restrict\r\n\r\nownership  of  residential properties to  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens   and  permanent  residents,  except   for\r\n\r\ndesignated enclaves. Proxies may still be  used  to\r\n\r\nbuy  up property but severe penalties could he laid\r\n\r\ndown. Countries like Switzerland have already  long\r\n\r\nhad  such  restrictions. In addition, all  property\r\n\r\ntransactions should be allowed no more than a  rate\r\n\r\nof  return  of  15  per  cent  a  year  (with  some\r\n\r\nflexibility  for escalation of building  costs).  I\r\n\r\nprefer  this to a capital gains tax because capital\r\n\r\ngains tax is expressed in terms of percentage,  and\r\n\r\nyou  can always jack up the price to get more,  and\r\n\r\npaying  the Government taxes at the same time.  But\r\n\r\nif  you  specify the rate of return, then, in  this\r\n\r\nway, you can control the market better. In this way\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  properties  will  not   be   unduly\r\n\r\nprofitable,   speculation  will  be  dampened   and\r\n\r\nlegitimate  home-owners  given  the  chance  to  be\r\n\r\nowners of property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area where inflation needs to be\r\n\r\nchecked   is  the  Stock  Market.  I  welcome   the\r\n\r\nSecurities   Industry  Bill  and  the  accompanying\r\n\r\ncontrols  on Stock Market activities. As the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and other Ministers have pointed out,  the\r\n\r\nget-rich-quick mentality will prove detrimental  to\r\n\r\nour  productivity and work ethos.  The  regulations\r\n\r\nmust,  however, be designed in such  a  way  as  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  speculation which hurts the small investor\r\n\r\nwhile  providing a smooth capital market for  long-term investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this year inflation will hit the\r\n\r\nlower  income groups through the increase in import\r\n\r\nprices  and  the cost of services.  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nNational  Wages Council should build in a component\r\n\r\nof  cost-of-living adjustment, particularly for the\r\n\r\nlower   wage  earners.  We  can  well  afford   the\r\n\r\nadjustment, Sir, provided the rate of inflation  is\r\n\r\nhigher in the advanced countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also applaud the substantial allocation to\r\n\r\nSocial  Services -- an increase of almost  50  per\r\n\r\ncent.  In  particular, the accelerated Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board programme will benefit the lower-income group. Housing constitutes a major pillar of\r\n\r\nsocial   stability.   Besides,   improved   housing\r\n\r\nconditions  and better recreational facilities  for\r\n\r\nthe working class will contribute substantially not\r\n\r\nonly   to   their  stability  but  also  to   their\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the move by Government to provide\r\n\r\ntax   reliefs  for  the  support  of  parents   and\r\n\r\ngrandparents. However, as the last but one  speaker\r\n\r\nsaid,  the  relief  should be extended  to  include\r\n\r\nthose  parents and grandparents who are not  living\r\n\r\nwith  the claimant. Extended families living  under\r\n\r\none  roof, Sir, have become impractical in one  and\r\n\r\ntwo-room flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, in the longer run, I believe three\r\n\r\nmajor   areas   need   attention.   Firstly,   real\r\n\r\ndevelopment  would  require  that  our   industries\r\n\r\nupgrade  or acquire higher technology. On  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  with  rising wage costs and  the  increasing\r\n\r\ndrive    of    other   developing   countries    to\r\n\r\nindustrialise,  our low technology industries  will\r\n\r\nface stiff competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn  the  other hand, it  is  difficult  to\r\n\r\ninduce   the   middle-   and   higher-technology\r\n\r\nindustries  to come out here as these  are  not  so\r\n\r\npressed by escalating production costs in their own\r\n\r\ncountries.  I note with concern the figures  quoted\r\n\r\nby   the  Minister.  As  he  stated,  manufacturing\r\n\r\ninvestment  commitments fell from $716  million  in\r\n\r\n1971 to $252 million last year. This, Sir, reflects\r\n\r\nthe difficulties I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I also welcome the setting up of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Training  Board.  Together   with   its\r\n\r\nactivities   to   encourage   the   formation   and\r\n\r\ntransmission  of  skills for our workers,  enabling\r\n\r\nthem  to  be more productive with a higher standard\r\n\r\nof  living, Government should also look closely  at\r\n\r\nthe training of executive, managerial and marketing\r\n\r\npersonnel,  especially in the  foreign  firms.  For\r\n\r\nwithout    the    development   of    skills    and\r\n\r\norganisational  know-how, we  shall  never  achieve\r\n\r\nreal  development.  Rapid  development  also  makes\r\n\r\nskills  obsolete fast; hence in the years ahead  we\r\n\r\nwould   have   to  have  a  number  of  re-training\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as we develop rapidly, we shall have to\r\n\r\nface  problems  of  phasing  out  the  cottage-type\r\n\r\nindustries.  As  long as land is  available,  these\r\n\r\nindustries can be, and are, re-sited. However,  the\r\n\r\nprocess  must  end inevitably for we  have  limited\r\n\r\nspace.  Government would need to study the problems\r\n\r\nof  these  industries, balancing  equity  with  the\r\n\r\nefficiency needs of our country. Perhaps  a  system\r\n\r\nof outright subsidy can be implemented to encourage\r\n\r\nchange  to  more desirable trades before  costs  of\r\n\r\nproduction  push them out. For the  low  technology\r\n\r\nindustries, like textiles and electronic  circuitry\r\n\r\nassembly, the safety valve against the shortage  of\r\n\r\nlabour  and rising wage cost may be to employ  more\r\n\r\nmarried  women.  Factories  can  be  more  suitably\r\n\r\nlocated  in housing estates and more creches  built\r\n\r\nto help working mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with these observations, I give\r\n\r\nmy  full  support  to  the  Government's  financial\r\n\r\npolicy as outlined by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I welcome the Budget Statement  made\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister  for Finance.  According  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  our  economic growth rate  in  the  past\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  was 13 per cent and  our  external\r\n\r\ntrade  growth  rate was 11.7 per  cent.  Judged  by\r\n\r\ninternational  standards, it  is  very  creditable.\r\n\r\nSir,  this fine economic performance reminds me  of\r\n\r\nthe time when we separated from Malaysia and of the\r\n\r\ntime  in  1971  when we were faced  also  with  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  British military  withdrawal.  During\r\n\r\nthose   times,   we   were  faced   with   economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties. But with the co-operative effort, the\r\n\r\ndiligence  and  patriotism of our  workers  coupled\r\n\r\nwith  the co-operation of the employer, we  managed\r\n\r\nto overcome our economic problems and difficulties.\r\n\r\nInstead  we were able to achieve economic  progress\r\n\r\nand peaceful industrialisation. In spite of the low\r\n\r\nwages  there  were  very  few  industrial  disputes\r\n\r\noriginating from the workers, resulting in  a  more\r\n\r\nstable  economic  situation. Our  present  economic\r\n\r\nprogress  and  achievements have been  due  to  the\r\n\r\nefforts and contributions of people of all walks of\r\n\r\nlife,  but  the  performance and  attitude  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers,  in  particular in the past, should  merit\r\n\r\nparticular mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Budget Statement, the Minister\r\n\r\nannounced  that  there  will  be  tax  reliefs  for\r\n\r\ntaxpayers'  dependent  parents,  grandparents,  and\r\n\r\nhandicapped children. This is very encouraging. The\r\n\r\nfact that the Government can do this is evident  of\r\n\r\nour   economic   progress  and   the   Government's\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of our unique Asian  family  system.\r\n\r\nHere,  I  would  like to advance a suggestion  that\r\n\r\nsince  we  may  have a more rosy prospect  for  our\r\n\r\nfuture  economy  in view of our present  favourable\r\n\r\neconomic progress and national effort, the  quantum\r\n\r\nof  tax  reliefs  should also be increased  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming  financial year in respect of the  taxpayer,\r\n\r\nhis  wife,  and the first and second children.  The\r\n\r\npresent  tax relief measures (for taxpayer: $2,000;\r\n\r\nearned income: $1,000 maximum; wife: $1,000; 1st\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchild:  $750; 2nd child: $500) were implemented  in\r\n\r\n1961.  At  the moment our economy and  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  are  much  better than those  of  1961.  So\r\n\r\ncomparing  the present economic situation  and  per\r\n\r\ncapita  income with those of 1961, it is  necessary\r\n\r\nthat  we  increase the quantum of tax  reliefs  for\r\n\r\npersonal income, earned income, wife, and  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  and  second children. This  is  particularly\r\n\r\nnecessary in view of the fact that in recent  years\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  encouraging  the  raising   of\r\n\r\nquality  of  our citizens and promoting  the  small\r\n\r\nfamily system, which is a very correct policy.  So,\r\n\r\nin  order  to match this policy, we must  give  the\r\n\r\nfirst and second children more tax reliefs as  this\r\n\r\nwill  have a great promotive effect on Government's\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years, we have achieved economic\r\n\r\nprogress  and brought about prosperity and material\r\n\r\nenjoyment  for our people. But, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nthere  is  also a fact which we must pay  attention\r\n\r\nto,  that  is, there is a trend for some people  to\r\n\r\npay  more  attention  to money gains  and  material\r\n\r\nenjoyment.  In  addition  to  this,  there  is  the\r\n\r\nintrusion of decadent Western culture. As a result,\r\n\r\nsome  people go for a life of pleasure,  easy-going\r\n\r\nand  living  a  more decadent way of life,  heading\r\n\r\ntowards  hedonism.  This  is  very  dangerous   and\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to  our  nation  building  and  higher\r\n\r\nperformance,  because all the present  achievements\r\n\r\nhave  been  brought about by the good qualities  of\r\n\r\nour   people,  their  diligence,  thriftiness,  and\r\n\r\nthrough  their patriotic efforts and so on.  So  we\r\n\r\nmust  not  let  all  these deleterious  effects  to\r\n\r\ncorrode  the  healthy spiritual  condition  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Otherwise, we will be at a great loss  and\r\n\r\nthe  country  will also suffer. In order  to  avoid\r\n\r\nthis,   I   hope   the  Government  will,   besides\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  economy,  pay  attention  to   the\r\n\r\ninculcation in our people of a healthy attitude  of\r\n\r\nlife.   This  can  be  achieved  through   cultural\r\n\r\neducation  and  activities  and  by  providing  the\r\n\r\npeople with the necessary healthy mental pabulum in\r\n\r\norder to enable them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  create  and enjoy a healthier and fuller  life,\r\n\r\nboth  as an individual and as a group. In order  to\r\n\r\nachieve the above objectives, the Government should\r\n\r\nsystematically promote various healthy cultural and\r\n\r\neducational  activities and  further  organize  and\r\n\r\nliaise with community cultural organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin  support of the motion standing in the  name  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance. In so doing, may I  also\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to express my thanks to him  for  that\r\n\r\nportion  of his Budget Statement delivered in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  On  26th February, 1973. We have the  unique\r\n\r\nadvantage  this year of first reading a portion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Financial Policy Statement in the local press,\r\n\r\nand  later  listen to the remaining  instalment  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber. Sir, the result of and the  reaction\r\n\r\nto  this unprecedented arrangement may not be quite\r\n\r\nthe  same  as what the hon. Minister had  expected,\r\n\r\nbut  I  find  this  innovation  rather  refreshing,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  conventional  procedure  would   have\r\n\r\ninvolved  the hon. Minister in what would otherwise\r\n\r\nbe  a  laborious  exercise in  this  Chamber;  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will then read about it in the local  press\r\n\r\nthe  following day, I hope without distortion,  and\r\n\r\nfinally,  dwell  further into the verbatim  report,\r\n\r\nyet another day later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever uncomplimentary thoughts hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  might think aloud in this House  over  the\r\n\r\nnew arrangement, I think their grouses ought to  be\r\n\r\nmore  than  submerged  by  the  very  tranquilising\r\n\r\nStatement, including that portion published in  the\r\n\r\npress, of course. That no new tax was introduced is\r\n\r\nwelcome,  and  the  new  tax  reliefs  are   indeed\r\n\r\nconsoling,  in  that it goes to prove  that  humane\r\n\r\ngestures   are   still  possible   when   financial\r\n\r\nconsideration permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now invite hon. Members' attention to\r\n\r\nthe  penultimate paragraph of that portion  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  Statement in this Chamber-I  think  the\r\n\r\ndistinction here is necessary for hon.

As one  of  the\r\n\r\nmany people directly concerned with the climate  of\r\n\r\nlabour-management  relationship  in  the  Republic,\r\n\r\nalbeit for only a short period of time in my  case,\r\n\r\nI  find  it  fitting that the Minister devoted  his\r\n\r\nlast comments to acknowledging the importance of co-operation and collaboration between management  and\r\n\r\nlabour,   for,  given  all  the  other  ingredients\r\n\r\nrequired  to  maintain and accelerate our  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth,  it is, in the final and crucial  analysis,\r\n\r\nthe  understanding  between management  and  labour\r\n\r\nthat holds the path to success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estimates for FY 1973-74 provide for 77 new\r\n\r\nposts as against the deletion of two in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Labour. These  new  appointments\r\n\r\nrepresent  roughly  30  per cent  increase  to  the\r\n\r\noverall staffing position in the Ministry, a fairly\r\n\r\nhigh figure percentage-wise, but unfortunately this\r\n\r\npercentage  is derived from an already small  base.\r\n\r\nLast  year  we had, from the Minister down  to  the\r\n\r\npeon,  267 posts. As the Minister for Education  is\r\n\r\nso  fond of quipping in the Members' Room, he  said\r\n\r\nthat  one  of  his departments is  larger  than  my\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Unfortunately,  we  do  not   count   on\r\n\r\nbuilding an empire. We are more dependent on -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Quality!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> - quality of work. I do not\r\n\r\nthink I should burden the House further as to  what\r\n\r\ntranspired in the Members' Room. May I be permitted\r\n\r\nto  proceed?  Of the new posts, the  net  increase,\r\n\r\nreally,  is  only 49. It is because 18  posts  were\r\n\r\ntransferred from the Public Health Division to form\r\n\r\nthe  new  Industrial  Health Unit  which  was  also\r\n\r\nsuccessful in securing another 10 of the new  posts\r\n\r\nprovided,  thus making a total of 28  in  this  new\r\n\r\nUnit.  The Industrial Health Unit is a new  section\r\n\r\nperforming   duties,  which   hitherto,   was   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the Ministry of  Health.  Hence,\r\n\r\nthe net effective increase is, as I have mentioned,\r\n\r\nonly 49 or about 20 per cent. Of these,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25  are assigned to the Ministry's headquarters, 15\r\n\r\nfor  the  expanded Statistics and Research Section,\r\n\r\nfive  for  the Work Permit Office, two allotted  to\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Unit and the  remaining  two,\r\n\r\nboth  of  whom are not field officers which  we  so\r\n\r\nbadly need, to the Factory Inspectorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, the existing number of established\r\n\r\nposts  in both the Factory and Labour Inspectorates\r\n\r\nare  grossly inadequate. The situation  is  further\r\n\r\naggravated  as  both  the Inspectorates  have  been\r\n\r\noperating below the establishment strength for many\r\n\r\nyears  now.  With  a  rapidly expanding  industrial\r\n\r\nsector, and the many new commercial establishments,\r\n\r\nit  has  been  extremely hard-pressed for  the  two\r\n\r\nshort-handed  sections in having to cope  with  the\r\n\r\nincreasing   workload.  The  officers   have   been\r\n\r\nstretched to the limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of illustration, may I enlighten\r\n\r\nthe House with some statistics as an indication  of\r\n\r\nthe  workload that these two sections have to bear.\r\n\r\nThe  Factory Inspectorate, operating with a reduced\r\n\r\ncapacity,  conducted a total of 11,076  inspections\r\n\r\nduring  1972, close to doubling the previous year's\r\n\r\nfigure  of  6,368. The Inspectorate had stepped  up\r\n\r\nits   enforcement  action  on  industrial   safety,\r\n\r\nresulting  in a total of 234 prosecution  cases  in\r\n\r\ncourt as against only 52 in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Inspectorate is in no happier\r\n\r\nsituation  as  far as personnel is  concerned.  Its\r\n\r\npresent  establishment  strength  of  20  has  been\r\n\r\nstagnant  for  the  last decade. Despite  this,  it\r\n\r\ncarried out 6,425 inspections, an increase of 2,248\r\n\r\nover 1971. Prosecutions in court trebled from 33 to\r\n\r\n100  cases.  It must be pointed out that  with  the\r\n\r\nvery  limited  personnel, enforcement actions  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be sufficiently stringent to serve  as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent  not  only to the defaulting  party,  but\r\n\r\nalso  as  a  reminder to others.  The  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nconscious of the fact that legal action has  always\r\n\r\nbeen our last resort, and in most cases unpopular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety and health campaign organised by the\r\n\r\nMinistry last year was intended as a means of  mass\r\n\r\neducation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  persuasion,  but regrettably  this  method  of\r\n\r\npersuasion  has not proved sufficiently  effective.\r\n\r\nThe   total  number  of  accidents  in   both   the\r\n\r\nindustrial  and other sectors rose to  a  new  high\r\n\r\nfigure of 10,675 in 1972, of which 186 were fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accidents do not happen, they are caused; as\r\n\r\nMembers  will  agree. In some of  the  factories  I\r\n\r\nvisited,  the working environment left much  to  be\r\n\r\ndesired. In a night visit to one factory.  I  found\r\n\r\nno  less than half a dozen accident traps,  one  of\r\n\r\nwhich   is  deadly.  There  are  many  causes   for\r\n\r\naccidents  -  poor housekeeping in  the  production\r\n\r\nareas,  inadequate safety precaution and equipment,\r\n\r\ntidak-apa  attitude  of the  management,  and  most\r\n\r\nimportant, ignorance, negligence, carelessness  and\r\n\r\neven   defiance   on  the  part  of   the   workers\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glaring example of the combination of these\r\n\r\nfactors  can  be seen in the building  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.  Many  of  the accidents  which  occurred\r\n\r\ncould have been prevented. It is a common sight  to\r\n\r\nsee   workers  precariously  clinging  on  to   the\r\n\r\nscaffolding,  instead  of using  the  safety  belts\r\n\r\nprovided. For these acts of sheer defiance, I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  workers will realise that they may have to pay\r\n\r\nvery dearly in the end, even with their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will appreciate that the enforcement\r\n\r\naction  in  this  particular respect  is  extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult,  in  view  of  the  environment  at  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  sites. Compliance is only  effective,\r\n\r\nfor  as long as the Ministry's enforcement officers\r\n\r\nare  present. Further, due to the shortage of  this\r\n\r\ncategory of workers, any discipline imposed by  the\r\n\r\nmore   enlightened   and  the  more   conscientious\r\n\r\ncontractors  or  site overseers are  futile,  as  a\r\n\r\nworker can easily down tools in protest, then  walk\r\n\r\nacross to the adjacent site and find himself a  job\r\n\r\nalmost immediately. Perhaps, a solution might  well\r\n\r\nbe the formation of a co-ordinating body comprising\r\n\r\nthose   parties   concerned,  such  as   engineers,\r\n\r\ncontractors and developers, to iron out  a  unified\r\n\r\nstandard or code of practice to be adopted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby all, so that it will prove to the defaulting\r\n\r\nworkers that it does not pay to play merry-go-round\r\n\r\nor to shift around from site to site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is, in the meanwhile, considering\r\n\r\nrevising  the  existing regulations concerning  the\r\n\r\nissue  of licences for building operations, with  a\r\n\r\nview  to  incorporating more stringent measures  to\r\n\r\ncompel compliance with the safety standards. But  I\r\n\r\nmust  warn that the Ministry shall not hesitate  to\r\n\r\ninvoke punitive measures and actions against  those\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant defaulters. At least one  licence  for\r\n\r\nwork   at   a  construction  site  was  immediately\r\n\r\ncancelled when found to have been lacking in safety\r\n\r\nstandards.  The licence was reinstated  later  only\r\n\r\nafter  a  written assurance was made to the  effect\r\n\r\nthat there would be full compliance with the safety\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, many of the accidents could have been\r\n\r\nprevented had there been proper planning and layout\r\n\r\nof  the factory buildings concerned. I am given  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that plans for factory  buildings  were\r\n\r\nonly  submitted  to the relevant authorities  since\r\n\r\nOctober  last year, not earlier. Certain  dangerous\r\n\r\nproduction   processes,  which  can   trigger   off\r\n\r\naccidents,  were  not separated  or  isolated,  and\r\n\r\nsufficient  precautions were not  taken  to  ensure\r\n\r\nsafety.   In   some  factories,  the  fire-fighting\r\n\r\nequipment provided were nothing more than ornaments\r\n\r\nmerely   for  the  purpose  of  satisfying  certain\r\n\r\nregulations  of  the authorities. In  an  interview\r\n\r\nwith  a  group of workers in a certain  factory,  I\r\n\r\nfound  that,  to  my  dismay, none  of  them  could\r\n\r\noperate   the   fire   extinguisher   which    was,\r\n\r\nincidentally,  strategically hung at its  location.\r\n\r\nIn  some factories, the nozzles, which should  have\r\n\r\nbeen attached to the hose-reel, were removed by the\r\n\r\nmanagement and kept under lock and key for fear  of\r\n\r\ntheft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a rather frustrating experience during a\r\n\r\nvisit to a factory. I witnessed a number of workers\r\n\r\nflushing the floor with jets of water from a  hose-reel which was installed solely for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nfire-fighting.  Shortly  after,  my  attention  was\r\n\r\ndrawn to a thick and voluminous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblack   smoke  emitting  some  distance  away.   On\r\n\r\nenquiry, I was told that a fire broke out  at  that\r\n\r\nmoment in a nearby factory. On rushing over to  the\r\n\r\nfire-site,  I was confronted by a rather hysterical\r\n\r\nplant  chemist  who  complained that  although  the\r\n\r\nworkers  did try to operate a hose-reel, there  was\r\n\r\nno  water at all. Nobody knew where or how to  turn\r\n\r\non the water supply!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must apologise to the House for having to\r\n\r\nburden  hon.

I only hope to reiterate the point  that\r\n\r\nhad  everybody  taken a little  more  interest  and\r\n\r\nconcern,  it  would have been a very  much  happier\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new influx of foreign workers swelling\r\n\r\nthe  ranks  of our industrial workers, we  must  be\r\n\r\nconscious  of the fact that these foreign  workers,\r\n\r\ninasmuch  as  they  contribute  positively  to  our\r\n\r\neconomic well-being, are not properly inducted into\r\n\r\nour  philosophy of life, or orientated to  the  new\r\n\r\nsystem  of  work. We will have to carry them  along\r\n\r\nwith  us  in  the same pace and discipline  in  our\r\n\r\nmarch towards our goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I say that our strife for a better\r\n\r\nliving  need  not be accompanied by  pain,  sorrow,\r\n\r\nmiseries  and sufferings of those who  pioneer  the\r\n\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmuch  has  been  said  with regard  to  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  by  the  Minister  for  Finance,  and  I\r\n\r\nappreciate  the depth of feeling expressed  on  the\r\n\r\nmany  issues. To my mind, Sir, the Budget Statement\r\n\r\nwas  tolerable; tolerable because it was  good  for\r\n\r\nsome but a vacuum for those who need most.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe it was Oscar Wilde who said that\r\n\r\n\"discontent is the first step in the progress of  a\r\n\r\nmind  or  a  nation\". I can assure you,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nafter  waiting  for  more  than  15  years  for  an\r\n\r\negalitarian society, the lower income strata of our\r\n\r\nSingapore  society  is  becoming  well  and   truly\r\n\r\ndiscontented. It would seem that from the moment of\r\n\r\nthe  original proposition of egality, so many years\r\n\r\nago,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmen  in power and authority have developed the fine\r\n\r\nart  of  paying lip-service to an ideal which  they\r\n\r\nsupport in theory but rarely in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A close scrutiny on price movements of all\r\n\r\ncommodities shows a clear rising trend  of  between\r\n\r\n15  to  20  per  cent  on the  average.  This  most\r\n\r\ncertainly will affect the lower income groups  more\r\n\r\nthan  the others. It is disappointing to note  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  has taken no steps to  relieve  this\r\n\r\nsituation.  The rising trend continues, and  action\r\n\r\nmust be taken to ensure that, in fact, it will  not\r\n\r\ncontinue and stifle any possibility of a reasonable\r\n\r\nliving  by  these people. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  view\r\n\r\nwith  concern  that  despite  the  efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nConsumers' Association of Singapore, pay-rises  won\r\n\r\nover  the  past  few  years by  the  NTUC  and  its\r\n\r\naffiliates have been diminishing more and  more  in\r\n\r\nvalue  because of the consistent rise  in  consumer\r\n\r\nitems.  CASE  recognises the need for  constructive\r\n\r\naction  and calls upon the Government to  alleviate\r\n\r\nthe  heavy  burden  on workers, especially  in  the\r\n\r\nlower income brackets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, any policy which is designed to assist\r\n\r\nthe  lower-paid worker must attack the problem from\r\n\r\na  number  of different directions, but  of  course\r\n\r\nalways  aiming  towards one common objective;  help\r\n\r\nfor  the  lower-paid. But help for  the  lower-paid\r\n\r\nwould mean that those who are more highly paid will\r\n\r\nneed  to pay more. I do not think it would be right\r\n\r\nto  pretend that it is solely a question  of  being\r\n\r\nkind to the lower paid. There may be a price to  be\r\n\r\npaid,  and  this should be borne by those  who  can\r\n\r\nafford  to  bear  it.  In these  times  of  growing\r\n\r\ninterdependence and complexity within  our  economy\r\n\r\nit  is  right,  certainly  in  my  view,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should regard a fairer price  system  as\r\n\r\npart  of  the  process of regulation  and  control,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  its responsibility. The Government  must\r\n\r\nseek  changes in the system which will  favour  the\r\n\r\nweakest  among  us.  The  basic  principle  of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  be  to protect  and  promote  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the underprivileged in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumers' Association of Singapore is\r\n\r\npainfully  aware of the increase  in  cost  to  the\r\n\r\nconsumer of a wide variety of goods and services, a\r\n\r\nreduction in our living standards, and once again a\r\n\r\nburden on those less able to bear it. CASE is doing\r\n\r\nits  utmost to make life bearable for the consumer,\r\n\r\nbut   Government  is  committed   to   assist.   In\r\n\r\nassisting,   the   Government  is  fulfilling   its\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the citizens of our land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no apparent solution as to how to beat\r\n\r\nthe  price hikes. Rigid control is not the  answer,\r\n\r\nalthough in certain instances, it may be. Sir,  the\r\n\r\nanswer  lies  in education and subsidies:  consumer\r\n\r\neducation   by   organisations   like   CASE,   and\r\n\r\nGovernment  subsidies for essential commodities  to\r\n\r\ncushion the pockets of the consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, again the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nburdens  the lower-income workers by ignoring  them\r\n\r\nunder  the  tax  policy and changes in  the  Annual\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement. What relief does a  worker,  who\r\n\r\nearns  $3,000 or less a year, obtain if he supports\r\n\r\ndependent  parents,  grandparents  and  handicapped\r\n\r\nchildren?  Why  is  the  Government  widening   the\r\n\r\ndisparity that at present exists in our society  by\r\n\r\nnot   compensating  these  people?   I   urge   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  rethink  its  policies   with   the\r\n\r\nobjective  of  substantially  narrowing   the   gap\r\n\r\nbetween the haves and have-nots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, the lower-paid workers are\r\n\r\npainfully  disturbed  by the rapidly  deteriorating\r\n\r\nbus  transport system. They are bounced around  and\r\n\r\nharassed  by  vehicles that constantly break  down,\r\n\r\nleaving    them    stranded   on    the    streets,\r\n\r\napprehensively watching full busloads pass by  them\r\n\r\nwhile  waiting for an empty bus. I do believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance should  have  considered\r\n\r\nthis most urgent requirement of public transport in\r\n\r\nhis Annual Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suppose in his anxiety to mechanise and\r\n\r\nimprove  work methods for higher growth rates,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance in his Annual Budget Statement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndid  not consider the still rising  trend  of\r\n\r\naccidents   in   industry.  No   realistic   budget\r\n\r\nprovisions have been made. Notice, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat   here   again  the  lower-paid  workers   are\r\n\r\npenalised. Occupational health and safety  must  be\r\n\r\nstressed due to the constant increase in the number\r\n\r\nof  industrial  workers and  the  upward  trend  in\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents. Government functions in  this\r\n\r\nfield should include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the education of the workers in occupational\r\n\r\nhealth and safety;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) constant vigilance to ensure that progressive\r\n\r\ntechniques  of  guarding  of  machinery,  etc, be\r\n\r\nemployed to safeguard the workers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) provision for better legislation and stricter\r\n\r\nenforcement; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the creation of enthusiasm among workers and\r\n\r\nemployers  alike in high standards of  occupational\r\n\r\nhealth  and safety as a direct contribution towards\r\n\r\nproductivity and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should also be consideration for pre-employment medical examination of workers, testing\r\n\r\ntheir  fitness  for  employment,  as  an  essential\r\n\r\nfeature  of any form of preventive action  designed\r\n\r\nto  protect their physical and mental health.  This\r\n\r\nmedical examination should be conducted with a view\r\n\r\nto  adapting the worker to his work and at the same\r\n\r\ntime  to preventing any deterioration in his health\r\n\r\nthat might be connected with his job. Whether it is\r\n\r\ndirected  towards vocational selection  or  towards\r\n\r\nappropriate  guidance, the aim of  fitness  testing\r\n\r\nshould be to seek a balance between the man and his\r\n\r\nwork  in  order  to provide better protection  with\r\n\r\nless strain on the worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fitness of a worker can correspond to only\r\n\r\none phase in the relationship between his state  of\r\n\r\nhealth  and  his  work, both of  which  are  highly\r\n\r\nsubject  to  change, any assessment of fitness  for\r\n\r\nemployment  is constantly subject to review;  hence\r\n\r\nthe need for periodic medical examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of rehabilitation of injured or sick\r\n\r\nworkers  should  also  be  the  business   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

In\r\n\r\nthis  new  Budget,  there  are  no  new  taxes   or\r\n\r\nincreased  taxation. On the contrary, the  Minister\r\n\r\neven  announced seven items of tax reliefs. We  all\r\n\r\nknow  that  Singapore  is a small  country  without\r\n\r\nnatural  resources and quite heavily populated.  It\r\n\r\nis  also  in  a turbulent region. In spite  of  all\r\n\r\nthis,   we  have  made  achievements,  and  it   is\r\n\r\nsomething  that we should be proud of.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nall  these  achievements are  attributable  to  the\r\n\r\nenlightened  leadership, the  co-operation  between\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the people to ensure that these\r\n\r\nhard-earned achievements will continue to grow.  We\r\n\r\nmust  also  enhance  our  concerted  efforts,  work\r\n\r\nharder  to ensure that we have a better future  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, economic development is a matter of great\r\n\r\nconcern   to   every   developing   country.    The\r\n\r\nformulation and implementation of economic policies\r\n\r\ndetermines  the success or failure  of  a  national\r\n\r\neconomy,  which in turn will affect the future  and\r\n\r\nthe destiny of a people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget statement, an extensive and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive review has been made of  the  economy\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. The Minister for Finance pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  there was a growth rate of the GNP of 13  per\r\n\r\ncent last year against an annual growth rate target\r\n\r\nof  15 per cent. He pointed out that this shortfall\r\n\r\nof  2  per cent was the result of external  events,\r\n\r\nthe international monetary crisis, and the internal\r\n\r\nfactor, i.e, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompletion   of   the  British  military   pullout.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  can  do  nothing about  the  external\r\n\r\nfactors,  something can be done about the  internal\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has also pointed\r\n\r\nout  in  his Budget statement that the contribution\r\n\r\nto   total  GDP  by  the  manufacturing  industries\r\n\r\naccounted for 23.5 per cent in 1972, an increase of\r\n\r\n20.1 per cent compared with 25 per cent in 1971 and\r\n\r\n27.5  per  cent in 1970. The growth  rate  has,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  slowed down. The Minister also  pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat   this  was  because  of  stagnation  in   the\r\n\r\ninvestment    of    petroleum    industries     and\r\n\r\nshipbuilding.  In spite of all this,  he  does  not\r\n\r\nshow  any  pessimism over these two  industries.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  quote  from the  Budget  Statement\r\n\r\n[Hansard, Vol 32, No. 10, col. 466]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For these two industries our locational\r\n\r\nadvantage   will   continue   to   favour   maximum\r\n\r\ndevelopment. The future of Singapore is  correlated\r\n\r\nto   its   being   considered  an  ideal   offshore\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  base for multi-nationals  and  their\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries. In our overseas investment promotion,\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Development  Board  (EDB)  will  not\r\n\r\noverlook   the   smaller  but  no  less   important\r\n\r\nmanufacturing firms. To encourage them to diversify\r\n\r\ntheir activities to Singapore, my Ministry will  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to invest equity up to 50 per cent,  with\r\n\r\nthe  option  for  them to buy  back  a  substantial\r\n\r\nportion  later. The EDB will identify  these  firms\r\n\r\nand the Development Bank of Singapore Limited (DBS)\r\n\r\nwill manage our investments. A fund of $100 million\r\n\r\nwill  be  provided for this purpose to serve  as  a\r\n\r\ncatalyst   to  use  to  best  advantage  our   vast\r\n\r\nexpenditure on training.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the short supply of trained personnel,\r\n\r\nthere  has  been a slowdown in our high  technology\r\n\r\nindustries. On this matter, the Minister said [col.\r\n\r\n467]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government will continue to allocate a large\r\n\r\npart of its resources to technical education. Since\r\n\r\n1962,  and  more  actively  in  recent  years,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  through the Economic Development  Board\r\n\r\nhas  been  engaged in a multiple-programme approach\r\n\r\nto    develop   industrial   training   in   modern\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   skills.  Besides   the   Industrial\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Scholarship Scheme, we  now  have  the\r\n\r\nOverseas  Training  Programme, the  Joint  Training\r\n\r\nProgramme,  the Apprenticeship Training Scheme  and\r\n\r\nthe   Training  Subsidy  Scheme  for  sophisticated\r\n\r\nindustries.   The  Government  on  its   part   has\r\n\r\nearmarked $8.7 million for industrial training  for\r\n\r\nthe next financial year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  endorse  this approach of the Government  as  it\r\n\r\naims to enhance and to diversify our industrial and\r\n\r\ntechnological  skills, and  at  the  same  time  to\r\n\r\nprovide  opportunities for our  people  to  acquire\r\n\r\nskill  and industrial training. Under this  policy,\r\n\r\nthe  EDB  will play a very important role  although\r\n\r\nthere was some blunder previously. Henceforth,  the\r\n\r\nEDB  must pay special attention and exercise  great\r\n\r\ncaution so that the people will not be let down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The era of industrial revolution first began in\r\n\r\nEurope.  It  is therefore quite natural that  there\r\n\r\nare  technological and scientific  advancements  in\r\n\r\nEurope and America. It goes without saying that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to learn from their experience and expertise.\r\n\r\nHowever,   we  should  not  overlook  the  existing\r\n\r\nindustrialised  countries in  our  region,  because\r\n\r\ntheir   technology  is  not  entirely  lacking   in\r\n\r\ndevelopment for us to learn. We need not go too far\r\n\r\naway  to  learn  when we have some good  neighbours\r\n\r\nfrom  whom we could learn. I hope that the EDB will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  identify these industries and  firms,\r\n\r\ninstead of taking the wrong concept that \"the  moon\r\n\r\nshines brighter in foreign countries\". There should\r\n\r\nnot be any discrimination between local and foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors. I can quote a case. There was a  visitor\r\n\r\nfrom  Euro-America and he was well received at  the\r\n\r\nairport and taken to the hotel by officials of  the\r\n\r\nEDB.  He was treated as a guest of honour.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  a  prospective  investor  from   this\r\n\r\nregion,  with  an earning power in  terms  of  $100\r\n\r\nmillion, requested to see senior EDB officials, but\r\n\r\nhe  was turned down. When it was realised that this\r\n\r\nprospective  investor,  who  was  a  man  of   high\r\n\r\npotential,  was  about to leave for a  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry, the EDB then sent men out to get in  touch\r\n\r\nwith him. This idea of \"foreign worship\" should  be\r\n\r\ndiscarded.  We  should give fair treatment  to  all\r\n\r\ngenuine investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, investors from advanced countries who\r\n\r\ncome  to Singapore with the intention of exploiting\r\n\r\nour  facilities for their own selfish  ends  should\r\n\r\nnot be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwelcomed. Some of these selfish investors had  been\r\n\r\ngiven  the  best  terms  for  their  investment  in\r\n\r\nexchange  for the technological training that  they\r\n\r\ncould  give to our technical personnel.  But  after\r\n\r\nseveral  years, facts have shown that we  have  not\r\n\r\nreaped  the  expected benefits from such investors.\r\n\r\nAs   regards   overseas  training  schemes,   joint\r\n\r\ntraining  schemes and so on, what are the  criteria\r\n\r\nfor  such  agreements, and what  are  the  expenses\r\n\r\ninvolved? How many people have benefited from these\r\n\r\ntraining schemes, and what are the results of their\r\n\r\ntraining? What is the price that we have  paid  for\r\n\r\nall  this?  Is it justifiable? Although  we  are  a\r\n\r\ndeveloping  country, and needing  foreign  aid,  we\r\n\r\nmust  realise  that such aid must be given  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of mutual benefit. We should not allow  lop-sided  co-operation. We must ensure that the  money\r\n\r\nfrom our people are spent wisely on the development\r\n\r\nof our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, we should also pay adequate\r\n\r\nattention  to the existing industries in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe should give them whatever aid that is necessary,\r\n\r\nand  also  to  the ancillary industries  which  are\r\n\r\nuseful.  It  is  only with such encouragement  that\r\n\r\nthere can be adequate co-operation, better division\r\n\r\nof  work and full exploitation of resources between\r\n\r\nlocal industries and their ancillaries to make them\r\n\r\nthe mainstays of our industries, and be competitive\r\n\r\nin international markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An enlightened leadership, political stability,\r\n\r\nand a progressive society with a hardworking people\r\n\r\nhave  already  created great confidence  among  the\r\n\r\nindustrialists of many countries. We must take full\r\n\r\nadvantage  of this climate of confidence  to  study\r\n\r\nthe  changes and trends prevailing in international\r\n\r\nmarkets.  Although  we have made  mistakes  in  the\r\n\r\npast, we should not continue to make such mistakes.\r\n\r\nWe  must  be  extra  cautious  in  our  development\r\n\r\nplanning  and its effective implementation.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly  then that we can hope to be able to reap  the\r\n\r\ndesired  objectives and benefits in  the  years  to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one\r\n\r\nof the magical ingredients that helped Singapore to\r\n\r\nmake   rapid  economic  progress  is  the  vigorous\r\n\r\npromotion  of  wise economic, social and  political\r\n\r\npolicies,   which  have  brought  about   political\r\n\r\nstability,  racial harmony, industrial  advancement\r\n\r\nand  a secure livelihood for the people as we  have\r\n\r\nwitnessed  today.  Just  over  a  decade   ago,   a\r\n\r\nturbulent    political   situation   with    racial\r\n\r\nanimosity,  industrial unrest and mass unemployment\r\n\r\nwas  the  order  of  the day.  However,  under  the\r\n\r\ndynamic  leadership of the present  Government  and\r\n\r\nwith  the  unanimous  support of  the  people,  our\r\n\r\nRepublic has made significant improvements  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious fields. We should be proud of ourselves  to\r\n\r\nbelong to a nation with such great promise for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, the world is\r\n\r\nrapidly changing and it appears difficult to  grasp\r\n\r\nwith  certainty  the  way  the  world  changes  and\r\n\r\ndevelops.  But what one can predict is  that  peace\r\n\r\nwill triumph over war. Peace and righteousness will\r\n\r\nbe credibly extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once China played the role of an extremist in\r\n\r\nworld drama; now she approaches her foreign affairs\r\n\r\nwith  a  moderate  attitude. This  trend  in  world\r\n\r\naffairs is favourable to our foreign policy of non-alignment.  Our  foreign policy  is  based  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of \"making as few enemies  but  as  many\r\n\r\nfriends  as  possible.\" By this principle,  we  are\r\n\r\nable  to  befriend more and more countries and  our\r\n\r\nnational prestige is growing day by day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can forecast that there will be increased\r\n\r\neconomic  involvement by China in South-east  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries.   Therefore,   we   should   take   this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  increase  trade  between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries   by  organising  more  and  more   trade\r\n\r\nmissions to China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, trade has become universally\r\n\r\nnecessary  for progress. It is a melting  pot  into\r\n\r\nwhich  distance and differences, self-interest  and\r\n\r\neven  mutual dislike are being tossed and remoulded\r\n\r\ninto mutual beneficial business arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence   of   this   mutual   beneficial\r\n\r\narrangement  is  seen  in the  trading  partnership\r\n\r\nwhich  comes  into being between erstwhile  enemies\r\n\r\nand  between capitalists and communists. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  even  more  beneficial  business\r\n\r\narrangements  between Singapore and  China,  and  I\r\n\r\nquote the Minister for Finance [col. 450]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With the better opening up of China to\r\n\r\ninternational trade, there is the possibility  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  serve as a base for  multi-national\r\n\r\nfirms   for  manufacture  and  exports  to   China.\r\n\r\nConversely,  China  may  find  Singapore  a  useful\r\n\r\noutlet for its products.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I am in full agreement with the Minister that there\r\n\r\nwill  be  greater  economic,  social  and  cultural\r\n\r\ninvolvement   by   China  with   South-east   Asian\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  we should take  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\ngeographical   position  of  Singapore   which   is\r\n\r\nsituated in the centre of the trade routes  between\r\n\r\nthe East and the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 70's trade and industries will become more\r\n\r\ncompetitive  and complex, and there is  a  need  to\r\n\r\nstep  up our exports and to improve the quality  of\r\n\r\nour  manufactured  goods.  We  will  not  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  meet  this challenge  to  export  our\r\n\r\nmanufactured  goods and other cargoes economically,\r\n\r\nunless  we  can reduce freight charges and  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime increase the number of our own ocean-going\r\n\r\nvessels.  The need for increasing and strengthening\r\n\r\nour  merchant fleet has become very evident and  it\r\n\r\nis  a  step in the right direction for the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance to have given a $50 million loan to the\r\n\r\nNeptune  Orient  Lines  for the  purchase  of  more\r\n\r\nships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the income tax relief, the\r\n\r\nrates  of income tax and tax relief in our  country\r\n\r\nare  virtually the same as those of ten years  ago.\r\n\r\nThe personal reliefs for the tax-payer and his wife\r\n\r\nremains   at   $2,000   and  $1,000   respectively,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the well-known fact that  commodity\r\n\r\nprices and the cost of living have all gone up over\r\n\r\nthe  past ten years. In these circumstances,  there\r\n\r\nshould be a corresponding increase in personal  tax\r\n\r\nreliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new tax relief was announced by the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  in  his  Budget  speech.  Taxpayers   who\r\n\r\nsupport their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naged  parents or grandparents can now claim  a  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  of  $300  per person. In my  opinion,  this\r\n\r\namount  is  inadequate. The people of  our  country\r\n\r\nbear   the  responsibility  of  maintaining   their\r\n\r\nparents,  irrespective of whether they are Chinese,\r\n\r\nMalays   or   Indians.  This  is   their   ethnical\r\n\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our income tax system, though\r\n\r\nbased  on the principles of the British system,  is\r\n\r\nquite  different  from it. The  British  Government\r\n\r\nallows  a  wide scope of tax relief for maintaining\r\n\r\nclose relatives. It is not confined only to parents\r\n\r\nbut  is extended to cover other close relatives  as\r\n\r\nwell.  The tax relief, however, is based on certain\r\n\r\nprinciples  set  out  by the government.  By  these\r\n\r\nprinciples, tax relief is only allowed  in  respect\r\n\r\nof  dependent relatives who are physically weak, in\r\n\r\nold  age,  widows  or divorcees without  their  own\r\n\r\nincome or the means to support themselves. This  is\r\n\r\na  logical principle we must follow. I am, however,\r\n\r\nof  the opinion that the amount of relief should he\r\n\r\nincreased  to $750 per dependent parent,  making  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  $1,500 for two dependent  parents.  This\r\n\r\nincrease  is reasonable and will hardly affect  the\r\n\r\nrevenue.  Not all taxpayers have dependent  parents\r\n\r\nto  support.  Some  of  their  parents  might  have\r\n\r\nalready passed away while others may have means  to\r\n\r\nsupport themselves, thus leaving a small number  of\r\n\r\ntaxpayers who qualify for this tax relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to say\r\n\r\nsomething  about government-private joint  ventures\r\n\r\nin  industrial development. I trust that  all  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  are  aware  that  it  is  mainly  due   to\r\n\r\nSingapore's  excellent geographical  location,  the\r\n\r\nhard work of its people and the wise leadership  of\r\n\r\nits   government,  that  Singapore,  as  a  country\r\n\r\nlacking  in  natural resources  such  as  gold  and\r\n\r\nsilver,   has   been  able  to  develop   into   an\r\n\r\neconomically strong and prosperous country within a\r\n\r\nshort  period of a few years. On this basis, it  is\r\n\r\nworthwhile  for  us to encourage government-private\r\n\r\njoint  ventures in industrial development in  order\r\n\r\nto further consolidate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocial  construction and welfare services  in\r\n\r\nthe  State.  This  is  not only  a  proper  way  of\r\n\r\nnurturing  the  national  capitalists  through  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  channel, but also serves  to  enrich  the\r\n\r\ncoffers of the State from the profits derived  from\r\n\r\nthe  joint  ventures which contribute immensely  to\r\n\r\nsocial  welfare projects. Although it will  be  too\r\n\r\nnaive to speak of the doctrine \"From each according\r\n\r\nto his ability, and to each according to his needs\"\r\n\r\nat   the   present  moment,  nevertheless,   as   a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  country  it is fitting  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould be developed into a welfare State, where the\r\n\r\nhelpless aged and those born handicapped are  taken\r\n\r\ncare of. By investing in some major industries, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will be able to earn large sums of money\r\n\r\nannually for its various welfare projects  as  well\r\n\r\nas helping these industries to improve and succeed.\r\n\r\nIt   will  contribute  immensely  towards  revenue,\r\n\r\nsocial  construction,  the  nurturing  of  national\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and the welfare of the  people.  Since\r\n\r\nthis  one  single  move will serve  several  useful\r\n\r\npurposes, why not do it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while supporting the Government's financial\r\n\r\npolicy   as   presented  in  the  Budget,   may   I\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  Minister  for  Finance  who  has\r\n\r\nacquitted  himself creditably, and may I also  hope\r\n\r\nhe  will  remain in the same Ministry  for  a  long\r\n\r\nperiod   to  present  us  next  year  with  another\r\n\r\npainless budget which will continue to reflect  his\r\n\r\nability  to  take  the  nation  along  the  highway\r\n\r\ntowards economic progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampung Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Budget Speech on the\r\n\r\nfinancial  policy  for 1973-74,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  mentioned that the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  will  be  spending around  $349  million  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  target figure from 20,000  to  30,000\r\n\r\nunits   per   year.  This  is  indeed  good   news,\r\n\r\nespecially  to our middle and lower income  groups.\r\n\r\nUnder  urban renewal programmes, we can  see  high-rise   buildings,  offices,  multi-storey  shopping\r\n\r\ncomplexes, hotels, restaurants, coffee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouses, everywhere. The political situation in  our\r\n\r\ncountry is stable; the administration is efficient.\r\n\r\nWith all the favourable conditions created for  the\r\n\r\nforeign investors and due to the difficulties faced\r\n\r\nby other developing countries such as rising labour\r\n\r\ncosts  and inflation, these investors have come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  establish  their  factories.  As   a\r\n\r\nresult,  the Jurong industrial estate has become  a\r\n\r\ngreat  industrial centre. Sir, with the  successful\r\n\r\nresult  of industrialisation and building industry,\r\n\r\nour growth rate over the last six years has reached\r\n\r\nmore  than  10 per cent every year. This is  indeed\r\n\r\npraiseworthy and deserves our acclaim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years the Government has\r\n\r\nacquired land for development purposes, causing the\r\n\r\navailable land for residential use to decrease.  We\r\n\r\nhave  built more and more housing estates, but  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for Housing Board flats is ever-increasing.\r\n\r\nSir,  although our per capita income is $3,680  per\r\n\r\nannum, the rising cost of living, especially in the\r\n\r\nrising prices of property and land, has caused many\r\n\r\nmore people in the middle income group to apply for\r\n\r\nHousing  Board fiats. The Government  is  acquiring\r\n\r\nland for its urban renewal programmes, while owners\r\n\r\nof  private  properties are  recovering  their  old\r\n\r\nbuildings  in order to demolish them and erect  new\r\n\r\nhigh-rise buildings so as to get more profits. This\r\n\r\nhas  resulted in a greater number of the middle and\r\n\r\nlower income groups living in very congested areas.\r\n\r\nThe  houses are crowded and are small and dark with\r\n\r\npoor  amenities. From the inside, you  cannot  tell\r\n\r\nthe  day  from the night. You can hear the children\r\n\r\nplaying  and the groans and moans of old  folks  in\r\n\r\nthese  houses. Sir, these people who live  in  such\r\n\r\nhorrid  conditions  are very uncertain  about  what\r\n\r\nsort  of  future  their children  will  have,  even\r\n\r\nthough  they  can  see all the beautiful  buildings\r\n\r\naround them. We must build more low-cost housing to\r\n\r\nimprove the living conditions of our people. It  is\r\n\r\nonly  through  living  under reasonable  conditions\r\n\r\nthat we can cultivate the right concept of life and\r\n\r\nproper national consciousness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  part  of  our people. We  should  not,  in\r\n\r\nstriving for economic prosperity, neglect those who\r\n\r\nlive in poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the home-ownership scheme,\r\n\r\narrangements have been made for people  to  utilise\r\n\r\ntheir  Central  Provident Fund contributions  as  a\r\n\r\ndeposit payment for Housing Board flats, which  are\r\n\r\nnow  better designed. This is indeed a move in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction  because, with  this  arrangement,\r\n\r\npeople  will feel more secure and happy  that  they\r\n\r\ncan  have a spot of their own on our little island.\r\n\r\nBut  one  of the conditions of this arrangement  is\r\n\r\nthat the applicant must pay 20 per cent of the cost\r\n\r\nas  a  deposit. Unfortunately, people like hawkers,\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers, odd job labourers, who do  not  have\r\n\r\nany  regular employment, do not contribute  towards\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  and  therefore they  will  not  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  pay  their 20 per  cent  deposit  for\r\n\r\nHousing Board fiats. The amount of deposit may only\r\n\r\nbe  $1,000  or $2,000, but it is simply beyond  the\r\n\r\nreach  of these people. They can only hope to  rent\r\n\r\nthe  flats.  As we all know, the waiting  list  for\r\n\r\nrenting  of flats is much longer than that for  the\r\n\r\npurchase  of flats. Mr Speaker, Sir, when they  see\r\n\r\ntheir  neighbours move into their  newly  purchased\r\n\r\nflats, they are filled with remorse and regret  and\r\n\r\na  painful  feeling.  I hope  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nconsider their plight and rectify this situation by\r\n\r\nexempting them from paying the 20 per cent deposit,\r\n\r\nso  that  they may also apply for the  purchase  of\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats and they should be given longer\r\n\r\nterms of monthly repayment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few months, prices of land and\r\n\r\nproperty have been escalating. Many people  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  class are in a tight spot. Terrace  houses,\r\n\r\nwhich  used  to cost $30,000 to $40,000,  now  cost\r\n\r\nbetween  $80,000 and $90,000. These  people  simply\r\n\r\ncannot afford such a high price. They cannot  apply\r\n\r\nfor Housing Board flats because the combined family\r\n\r\nincome  exceeds $1,500 per month. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nincreasing the salaries of Government servants  and\r\n\r\nfor the people is a step in the right direction  at\r\n\r\nthe right time. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is over-simplifying the issue to  assume\r\n\r\nthat  by doing this they will not go to the private\r\n\r\nsector.  We know the Housing Board and the Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore    Authority   are   providing    housing\r\n\r\naccommodation  for their staff,  and  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nother   statutory   bodies   and   all   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments will do likewise to provide housing for\r\n\r\ntheir  employees, as this is more necessary than  a\r\n\r\nsalary increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps we have been devoting our full\r\n\r\nattention  to industrialisation, urban renewal  and\r\n\r\neconomic growth, so much so that we have overlooked\r\n\r\nthe  development of our cultural and social values.\r\n\r\nWe  are becoming more and more capitalistic in  our\r\n\r\noutlook and in our way of life. Many of us seem  to\r\n\r\nspend all our waking moments either in making  more\r\n\r\nmoney or indulging in various activities which  are\r\n\r\nnon-productive and decadent. All these will  go  to\r\n\r\nloosen  our  social and moral fabric  and  cause  a\r\n\r\nlowering  of our social discipline. As we can  see,\r\n\r\nthere  are  many  restaurants, night-clubs,  coffee\r\n\r\nhouses, etc, which have many singers from overseas.\r\n\r\nAll these are female gold diggers in disguise. They\r\n\r\nare  here to earn our money and to weaken the  will\r\n\r\nof  our young people. Sir, in the last few years we\r\n\r\nhave    seen   many   talent-time   contests   over\r\n\r\ntelevision, and in our various community centres we\r\n\r\nhave  singing contests. But it is very rare  indeed\r\n\r\nto see winners of these contests appearing in these\r\n\r\ngrand shows. What we see on the TV are merely  gold\r\n\r\ndiggers   from  abroad  in  the  form  of  gorgeous\r\n\r\nfemales.  This  is an abnormal development  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.   We   must   strive   to   increase   our\r\n\r\nproductivity  and  economic  growth.  We  encourage\r\n\r\nforeign capital and foreign investors to come in to\r\n\r\nset  up factories. We also welcome specialists  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  personnel from abroad.  But  we  do  not\r\n\r\nwelcome  these  merry-land  females  who  cause  an\r\n\r\nobstruction in our progress and a reduction in  our\r\n\r\nforeign exchange. Sir, we must not allow an  influx\r\n\r\nof  these overseas female singers to monopolise our\r\n\r\ntelevision. We should encourage more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our  local  singing talent to  perform  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious television programmes and shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides extra-mural technical, industrial and\r\n\r\ntrade   courses   conducted  by   our   educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  such  as  the  Extra-mural   Studies\r\n\r\nDepartment  in  the  University of  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University and the Adult Education  Board,\r\n\r\nsimilar  educational  and instructional  programmes\r\n\r\ncan  be  shown on television so that our people  in\r\n\r\ntheir  hours  of  leisure  may  be  able  to  learn\r\n\r\nsomething from these good and educative programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has said that l972\r\n\r\nwas   a   year   of  high  international   monetary\r\n\r\ninstability.  In June 1972, the Pound Sterling  was\r\n\r\nforced to float. The United States of America, as a\r\n\r\nresult  of its chronic balance of payments deficit,\r\n\r\nwas  forced  to devalue its currency.  Despite  all\r\n\r\nthese  difficulties  and  uncertainties,  we   have\r\n\r\nmanaged  to achieve a growth rate of 13  per  cent.\r\n\r\nThis  is  indeed a great achievement.  In  our  new\r\n\r\nBudget,  we have no new taxes. On the contrary,  we\r\n\r\nhave seven reliefs or exemptions of tax, and we are\r\n\r\ngoing  to enjoy a surplus of $20 million.  This  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a  Budget which is welcomed by people  from\r\n\r\nall  walks  of life. Unfortunately the  income  tax\r\n\r\nrelief of $300 for those who have to support  their\r\n\r\nparents is too low. It should at least be $750  per\r\n\r\ndependant. Moreover, children between the  ages  of\r\n\r\n16  and  21  years are in an age of high school  or\r\n\r\nuniversity  education, and therefore  the  economic\r\n\r\nburden  on  the parents is fairly heavy.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether it would be possible to give some allowance\r\n\r\nto tax-payers who have to support their children in\r\n\r\nthe higher educational institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the wake of economic\r\n\r\nprogress,  we should also enhance the consciousness\r\n\r\nof our people so that they will be prepared to meet\r\n\r\nthe demands of changing situations, new targets and\r\n\r\nneeds and to strive for these objectives. On behalf\r\n\r\nof  the  people in my constituency, I  support  the\r\n\r\nfinancial policy of our Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\nwe  all  know,  owing to the total rundown  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish    army   and   the   world-wide   monetary\r\n\r\ninstability, we disappointingly fell short by 2 per\r\n\r\ncent  in  our targeted 15 per cent annual  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth rate. This prompted the Finance Minister  to\r\n\r\nexplain at length the cause of this shortfall, when\r\n\r\nhe presented his annual Budget in Parliament at the\r\n\r\nend of last month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the Finance Minister knows\r\n\r\nmuch  better than I that to sustain a 10  per  cent\r\n\r\neconomic growth rate is a tremendous goal that most\r\n\r\ncountries  find  difficult to  reach;  and  that  a\r\n\r\ntarget  of 15 per cent growth rate is a high ideal.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1960s, our average economic growth  rate\r\n\r\nwas  9.5 per cent. In 1971, it was 15 per cent. Our\r\n\r\nleaders  hoped that we could sustain this rate  for\r\n\r\n1972,  and  that nothing should be less  than  this\r\n\r\nunusual figure. However, in spite of the fact  that\r\n\r\nwe had suffered a loss of earnings from the British\r\n\r\nmilitary expenditure, which was roughly 3 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the  GNP,  we can still manage  to  achieve  an\r\n\r\neconomic growth rate of 13 per cent. This indicates\r\n\r\nvery   clearly  that  what  we  Singaporeans   have\r\n\r\nperformed is an economic miracle. A month ago, when\r\n\r\nthere was a storm of world-wide monetary crises, an\r\n\r\nEnglish  magazine  pointed out  that  although  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Government   had   not   announced    a\r\n\r\nrevaluation  of  its  currency,  it  was  in   fact\r\n\r\nrevalued between 1 and 2 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to point out that,\r\n\r\nin its painless Budget which handed out several tax\r\n\r\nreliefs  instead of introducing any new taxes,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  decided  to  appropriate  the   biggest\r\n\r\namount  of  money to building more housing  estates\r\n\r\nfor  the  middle and lower income groups. Prior  to\r\n\r\nthe  l960s, there were already those who repeatedly\r\n\r\nmentioned  that with no natural resources Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  be  faced with two fundamental  difficulties\r\n\r\nwhich  no  one  could overcome. The  first  is  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  mass unemployment; the second  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion of accommodation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor half a million of the poorer  people.\r\n\r\nNow,  under  the  able leadership  of  our  present\r\n\r\nGovernment over the last 14 years, coupled with the\r\n\r\nefforts    made   by   our   hard-working   people,\r\n\r\nunemployment is no longer a problem today  and  the\r\n\r\nproblem of accommodation for half a million  people\r\n\r\nis  also nearly solved. At present, we are well  on\r\n\r\nthe  way  to  a total accommodation of  our  people\r\n\r\nthrough our \"Tenants' Ownership Scheme\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, the fact that the rate of\r\n\r\nbuilding has been increased, from 45 minutes to  30\r\n\r\nminutes per unit, may be commended in three ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Housing and Development Board has\r\n\r\nbuilt  and planned to build more and more  one-room\r\n\r\nand  three-room flats to accommodate those  middle-lower class people who have not been able to find a\r\n\r\ndecent  house  to live in since the 1950s  so  that\r\n\r\nthousands of hawkers, workers, trishaw-riders, taxi-drivers  and  low  paid shopkeepers  may  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to quit the slums and  move  into  HDB\r\n\r\nflats with provision for water and electricity, and\r\n\r\nto  enjoy a relatively hygienic and modern  way  of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the monthly rental for a one-room flat\r\n\r\nis  $20;  one only need to pay $30 for an  improved\r\n\r\ntype  one-room flat. The rentals for  two-room  and\r\n\r\nthree-room   flats   are  slightly   higher.   This\r\n\r\nrelatively low rental does not necessarily  reflect\r\n\r\nthe  actual cost of the HDB flat. Jr, other  words,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has to subsidise $20 for a one-room\r\n\r\nflat  per  month and $15 for a two-room  flat.  The\r\n\r\nlesser the number of rooms, the more the Government\r\n\r\nhas to subsidise the cost of the building, and vice\r\n\r\nversa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in encouraging the people to purchase\r\n\r\nHDB flats by using their contributions, which is  a\r\n\r\nvery  rare practice in the other countries  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  the  Government is helping the people  from\r\n\r\nthe  middle  and lower income groups to purchase  a\r\n\r\nthree-room, four-room, or even a five-room flat. In\r\n\r\ncomparison  with the expensive private houses,  the\r\n\r\nHDB  flats seem to appeal more to the masses.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  there is a long queue for the purchase  of\r\n\r\nHDB flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister mentioned in his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement that the greater demand for accommodation\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people  is being duly attended  to.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  also expresses the need to  improve  it\r\n\r\nfurther.  One  way of doing this is  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  target  from 20,000 to 30,000  units  per\r\n\r\nyear.  In  point  of fact, in this island  Republic\r\n\r\nwhere  the price of land is rocketing, people  from\r\n\r\nthe  middle-lower income group would find  it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  buy  a semi-detached  bungalow  from\r\n\r\nprivate  developers. It may be compared to  winning\r\n\r\nthe  $400,000  lottery.  Nowadays,  even  a  senior\r\n\r\nGovernment  officer finds it difficult  to  own  an\r\n\r\nideal  detached bungalow. I do not know about  most\r\n\r\nof  the Members of Parliament here! The outcome  of\r\n\r\nthis  trend  will be that only a minority  of  rich\r\n\r\npeople are able to live in such bungalows built  by\r\n\r\nprivate  developers,  while  the  majority  of  our\r\n\r\npeople will have to settle for HDB fiats under  the\r\n\r\nright policy of our \"Tenants' Ownership Scheme\". We\r\n\r\ncan foresee that in the 1980s, modern HDB satellite\r\n\r\ntowns  will  be  erected  everywhere.  It  can   be\r\n\r\nanticipated that by then about 80 per cent  of  our\r\n\r\ntotal population will be housed in the HDB kits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I would like to stress the\r\n\r\nimportance of improving the environment of the  HDB\r\n\r\nflats. Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to say a few words\r\n\r\nabout  my  impressions of a recent  visit  to  some\r\n\r\ntenants of these HDB flats. I remember that as soon\r\n\r\nas  I  walked up the stairs of a block of  one-room\r\n\r\nflats,   I   immediately  saw  groups  of  innocent\r\n\r\nchildren playing poker on the staircase, or playing\r\n\r\nhide-and-seek along the verandah, or helping  their\r\n\r\nparents  to  look after their younger brothers  and\r\n\r\nsisters,  and  so forth. I hardly saw  any  primary\r\n\r\nschool  students, who live in these flats, spending\r\n\r\ntheir   time  reading  books  or  magazines.   Only\r\n\r\noccasionally  did  I  find  some  secondary  school\r\n\r\nstudents reading books. There was a young man  from\r\n\r\na  family of nine. He was keen in studies,  and  he\r\n\r\nwanted me to make a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggestion  to  the Government that  pavilions  and\r\n\r\narbours should be built in housing estates in order\r\n\r\nto provide students with a quiet and suitable place\r\n\r\nto work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to their innocence or under the influence\r\n\r\nof   traditional  and  religious  teachings,   some\r\n\r\nparents have more children than they can afford  to\r\n\r\ncare  for.  As  a  result,  the  second  generation\r\n\r\nsuffers,  despite the fact that their parents  work\r\n\r\nhard  during their whole life. There was a  middle-aged woman with more than a dozen children, and she\r\n\r\napproached  me for help. From her facial appearance\r\n\r\nand  the  way  she  tried hard to calm  herself,  I\r\n\r\nrealised very deeply her grievances and sorrows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I crossed a crowded car park and\r\n\r\npaid a visit to the three-room and four-room flats,\r\n\r\nthe situation changed entirely: both the adults and\r\n\r\nchildren  were staying indoors; all the doors  were\r\n\r\nfastened  as if they lived in a separate world.  On\r\n\r\none  occasion,  only  after knocking  at  the  door\r\n\r\nrather   loudly  did  an  old  woman  answer.   She\r\n\r\nexplained  smilingly that since only  she  and  her\r\n\r\ngrand-children were at home, she would not open the\r\n\r\ndoor  to let anybody in, unless it was someone they\r\n\r\nrecognise.  She then went on further asking  me  to\r\n\r\npersuade  the  Government to remove the  gas  meter\r\n\r\nfrom  the house so that the whole family could have\r\n\r\nmore  security and comfort. She repeatedly stressed\r\n\r\nthat life had been better ever since they moved out\r\n\r\nfrom  their  atap  dwelling  to  these  HDB  flats.\r\n\r\nHowever, she said that there were too many ears and\r\n\r\ntoo many people, and one single act of carelessness\r\n\r\ncould cause an accident and might even lead to loss\r\n\r\nof life. Moreover, should any one be careless about\r\n\r\nleaving  the door open, one would certainly  invite\r\n\r\nthieves.  She considered it wiser to keep the  door\r\n\r\nshut and to stay in and to enjoy the TV. It is just\r\n\r\nlike  what the old Chinese proverb says, \"A scholar\r\n\r\nhas no need to go outdoors to know of the world\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that the present Government\r\n\r\nleaders, who have always devoted themselves to  the\r\n\r\nnation and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people,  would certainly agree  with  me  that\r\n\r\nthese busy, crowded, and noisy housing estates have\r\n\r\nto be improved upon a good deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quite understand that in our new Budget, the\r\n\r\nreason  for  the  Government  to  appropriate   the\r\n\r\nlargest amount of money to build more HDB flats  is\r\n\r\nto  meet the demand of the people which exceeds the\r\n\r\nsupply.  I  can  anticipate further  that  the  new\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  would  certainly  have  a  better\r\n\r\nenvironment than the present ones. I am pretty sure\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government will continue to allot  money\r\n\r\nfor  the  improvement of living conditions  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in housing estates. On this account  may  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  at least two steps in which the Government\r\n\r\ncould  improve the environmental conditions of  the\r\n\r\nhousing estates in future?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the creation of a caretaking system. For a\r\n\r\nhousing unit of 500 to 600 families, we may appoint\r\n\r\nan  elderly  caretaker  to deal  with  the  general\r\n\r\naffairs  of  the  estate.  Only  when  this  system\r\n\r\nmaterialises, will the elder tenants of  the  flats\r\n\r\nfeel  safe  to  use  the lifts in  their  high-rise\r\n\r\nflats.  Moreover, the tenants may be  able  to  get\r\n\r\nsomeone  to help in case of accident. Besides,  the\r\n\r\ncaretaker  can also play the role of  bringing  the\r\n\r\ntenants  together,  promoting mutual  understanding\r\n\r\namong  the  tenants, and encouraging them  to  love\r\n\r\ntheir  way  of  life in the HDB flats,  which  will\r\n\r\neventually  help shape their social  consciousness.\r\n\r\nAll  these  point to the fact that a caretaker  can\r\n\r\nplay a very important role indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, this is not a question of money, but\r\n\r\na  question of system. In the latest issue  of  the\r\n\r\nHDB's organ, Our Home, there is much discussion  on\r\n\r\nthe  problem of security guards and their salaries.\r\n\r\nIt  seems to imply that because there is a lack  of\r\n\r\nfunds, the HDB authorities could only get a limited\r\n\r\nnumber  of men to maintain security in the  housing\r\n\r\nestates.  However,  if  we compare  the  job  of  a\r\n\r\ncaretaker with that of the security guard, the duty\r\n\r\nof  the former tends to be positive, while that  of\r\n\r\nthe  latter tends to be rather negative. If, in the\r\n\r\nwords\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof an old Chinese saying, \"One cannot have both the\r\n\r\nfish  and the bear-palm at the same time\", I  would\r\n\r\nrather  choose the caretaker, because  his  job  is\r\n\r\nmore  practical and more applicable to the  present\r\n\r\nsituation in the housing estates. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  what  the authorities concerned think  of  my\r\n\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the HDB authorities should do what they\r\n\r\ncan  to develop the limited open grounds around the\r\n\r\nhousing estates into parks or sports grounds, so as\r\n\r\nto  enable the old and the young to have a  bit  of\r\n\r\nfresh  air,  or to engage in a game of  basket-ball\r\n\r\nafter  a  day's  hard  work. This  is  particularly\r\n\r\nimportant  to  the tenants of the crowded  one-room\r\n\r\nflats.  To tell you the truth, Sir, my constituency\r\n\r\nhas  not got even a full basket-ball court; it  has\r\n\r\nonly  half a basket-ball court. That is why at  the\r\n\r\nend of last month, twelve young citizens approached\r\n\r\nme  on  the matter of basket-ball practices, and  I\r\n\r\nhad   to  get  permission  from  the  Bukit   Merah\r\n\r\nCommunity  Centre for them to use its court.  Other\r\n\r\nfacilities, like sports centres, cultural  centres,\r\n\r\nconference or meeting rooms, etc., are what I  have\r\n\r\nin  mind, and for the realisation of which we ought\r\n\r\nto make a yet greater effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is some truth in the proverb which says,\r\n\r\n\"A  fool will be wise on a thousand thoughts\", then\r\n\r\nI hope that the suggestions I have put forward will\r\n\r\nbe  looked  into by the authorities concerned,  and\r\n\r\nthat  they  will take positive steps  to  implement\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I shall close my speech with two famous\r\n\r\nlines  from  a  famous Chinese  poet,  from  Tu  Fu\r\n\r\nSelected Poems, translated by Rewi Alley:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would be possible to build an immense house\r\n\r\nwith thousands of rooms,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all who needed could take welcome shelter.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I would like to congratulate  the\r\n\r\nMinister on one particular aspect and, that is,  he\r\n\r\nhas taken heed and accepted the views of Members of\r\n\r\nthis   House  expressed  last  year  and  has  made\r\n\r\nadjustments in regard to the collection of taxes. I\r\n\r\nhope  that this year he will again listen  to  what\r\n\r\nMembers  have to say and to bear them in mind  when\r\n\r\ndrafting the next Budget statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember that the topic of soaring\r\n\r\nprices was a favourite subject during the past  two\r\n\r\nBudget  debates. I believe that this time  it  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  a hot topic for discussion. This  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause we enjoy harping on an old tune but because\r\n\r\nwe  come from constituencies in which the lower and\r\n\r\nmiddle  income groups predominate, and also because\r\n\r\nprices are still soaring in recent months. In fact,\r\n\r\nprices  have  gone up by 10 to 20 per  cent.  Since\r\n\r\nwool  must  ultimately come from sheep,  the  brunt\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be  borne by the middle  and  lower\r\n\r\nincome  groups  who are finding it  more  and  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  make ends meet. So I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance will make efforts to check the\r\n\r\nsoaring prices or at least to control the prices of\r\n\r\nsome  daily necessities to ensure that there is  no\r\n\r\nprofiteering by unscrupulous merchants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the economic boom and the influx of\r\n\r\nforeign  capital, there has been an excess flow  of\r\n\r\ncurrency  in  Singapore. Capital is  increasing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and this is not without its ill-effects.\r\n\r\nFor   example,   our   share  market   has   become\r\n\r\noverheated,  and I am therefore glad to  note  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is taking remedial action  to  cool\r\n\r\nthe  overheated share market to ensure  its  proper\r\n\r\nfunctioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter concerns the prices of land and\r\n\r\nhouses.  As a result of soaring prices in land  and\r\n\r\nhouses  in recent years, wage earners in the income\r\n\r\ngroup  of $1,003 a month find it impossible to  own\r\n\r\nhouses built by private developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third ill-effect of this excess capital in\r\n\r\nSingapore is that factories are finding it more and\r\n\r\nmore difficult to get workers, and domestic help is\r\n\r\nalso  difficult to obtain. Provision shops,  barber\r\n\r\nshops, workshops and farms too find it difficult to\r\n\r\nget  local  labour,  and  they  have  to  rely   on\r\n\r\nlabourers  from  other  countries.  Although  these\r\n\r\nlabourers and workers are welcome, they bring along\r\n\r\nwith  them  their unwelcome bad habits, which  have\r\n\r\nill-effects  on our own workers. As a  result,  the\r\n\r\nstandards of morals and ethics in Singapore are put\r\n\r\nto   a   severe   test  in  the  light   of   rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialization   and  urbanization.   Thus   the\r\n\r\ninevitable  concept of money in command has  become\r\n\r\nthe  value which has taken root in the minds of not\r\n\r\nonly  the  older  generation but also  the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration. This is one aspect detrimental  to  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment which we must try to check and  prevent\r\n\r\nit from becoming worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance seems to have over-emphasised the importance of commerce and industry\r\n\r\nat  the expense of agriculture. I certainly do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the audacity to expect the Minister to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  status  of agriculture to the same footing  as\r\n\r\ncommerce and industry. But agriculture deserves due\r\n\r\nattention.  Experts have expressed  the  view  that\r\n\r\ncountries  which do not produce the food that  they\r\n\r\nrequire will suffer dire consequences in the  event\r\n\r\nof  a  cut-off  of  supply  from  foreign  sources.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  would  like  to  point  out  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  our farmers deserve  some  form  of\r\n\r\neconomic  and  financial aid  from  the  Government\r\n\r\nwhich  they  are not getting. They  often  live  in\r\n\r\nextreme  difficulties. The pig  farmers  provide  a\r\n\r\ngood  case in point. Firstly, they suffer  a  sharp\r\n\r\ndrop  in  the  price of pigs. Secondly,  they  were\r\n\r\nmanipulated by middlemen, when there was  an  over-production of pigs. Yet under those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  the  Ministry of  Finance  did  not\r\n\r\nextend a helping hand to the poor farmers. In  many\r\n\r\ncases, the smalltime farmers had to \"close shop and\r\n\r\ncall  it  a  day\".  In  the case  of  the  big-time\r\n\r\nfarmers, although they managed to pull through  the\r\n\r\ndifficult period, they suffered heavy losses. Then,\r\n\r\nthey  were  faced with the rising prices of  animal\r\n\r\nfeed, it was argued that that was due to the  rise\r\n\r\nin  the  cost of raw materials. But now, prices  of\r\n\r\nraw  materials  have come down but  the  prices  of\r\n\r\nanimal feed still remain almost the same. What  has\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Finance done to help  these  poor\r\n\r\nfarmers?  The farmers work and toil the whole  year\r\n\r\nround  but  they  are still on the brink  of  semi-starvation.  The world seems to be  too  harsh  and\r\n\r\nunfair to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to fishing. The\r\n\r\nGovernment is encouraging deep-sea fishing.  It  is\r\n\r\nregrettable  that in spite of earlier talk  on  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  deep-sea fishing, nothing  further\r\n\r\nhas developed beyond that. While the population  is\r\n\r\nincreasing,  there is no increase in our  catch  of\r\n\r\nfish.  We  have to rely on foreign supply.  We  can\r\n\r\nproduce  at  most  only one quarter  of  the  total\r\n\r\nconsumption.  This is an unfavourable  trend  which\r\n\r\nshould not be allowed to continue if we are not  to\r\n\r\nrely  too  much  on foreign supply.  Because  over-reliance  On foreign supply will not only  cause  a\r\n\r\nloss of foreign exchange but also expose its prices\r\n\r\nto  foreign manipulation. The development of  deep-sea   fishing  will  make  available  to   us   the\r\n\r\ninexhaustible resources of the ocean and open up  a\r\n\r\nnew  avenue  of  employment and an outlet  for  our\r\n\r\nsurplus  capital. Sir, I hope that  positive  steps\r\n\r\nwill be taken to develop deep-sea fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my speech will be incomplete without any\r\n\r\nreference to education and teachers. In his  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement,  the Minister for Finance said  that  in\r\n\r\norder to provide some incentive to teachers and  to\r\n\r\nraise  their morale, the Government has decided  to\r\n\r\ngive them opportunities for promotion. This is  all\r\n\r\nvery  good.  But  what is the  actual  position  in\r\n\r\nregard to its implementation? The effect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis    just   the   opposite.   According   to    my\r\n\r\nunderstanding, this is the first promotion exercise\r\n\r\nfor teachers, and therefore many qualified teachers\r\n\r\nhave put in their applications. Some 4,000 to 5,000\r\n\r\nteachers  are said to have applied. By  right,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry concerned should have set certain criteria\r\n\r\nfor  the short-listing of applications, instead  of\r\n\r\ngiving  the important job of short-listing  to  the\r\n\r\ncomputer.  What  happens to this computered  short-listing? We find that, as a result of this, in some\r\n\r\nschools not even a single teacher was called up for\r\n\r\ninterview, whereas in other schools as many  as  20\r\n\r\nto 30 teachers were called up for interview. Again,\r\n\r\nsome  senior teachers with many years' service were\r\n\r\nnot  given  the opportunity of an interview,  while\r\n\r\njunior teachers in the same school have been called\r\n\r\nup. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, can you really say that in\r\n\r\na  school with a few tens of teachers not even  one\r\n\r\nteacher  is  eligible for an interview?  What  will\r\n\r\nparents and students think of such a school? Again,\r\n\r\nin  the  same  school, senior assistants  were  not\r\n\r\ncalled  up  for interview, whereas junior  teachers\r\n\r\nwere  called  up. This can only cause friction  and\r\n\r\nsuspicion among the teachers. Senior assistants can\r\n\r\nvery  well turn round and say, \"Well, if you  think\r\n\r\nthat so-and-so, a junior, is better than I am,  for\r\n\r\nan  interview,  you can ask him to  take  over  the\r\n\r\nburdensome administrative work. Why should you  let\r\n\r\nme  remain as a senior assistant?\" So how  can  the\r\n\r\nmorale  of teachers be enhanced? I am pointing  out\r\n\r\nall these matters in order to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to the fact that, instead of  raising\r\n\r\nthe  morale and improving the relations  among  the\r\n\r\nteachers, there have been suspicion and low  morale\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  poor  recruitment  and  promotion\r\n\r\nexercise.  Many teachers are changing  their  jobs.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry of Finance should probably review the\r\n\r\nsystem of promotion exercise and make provision for\r\n\r\na better and more reasonable exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding my criticisms, I still support\r\n\r\nand  endorse  the Budget statement of the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, while congratulating the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  for  his  painless and considerate  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement,  I  wish to draw the attention  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse to some rather pressing issues affecting  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of our people. I have no doubt that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  aware of these issues and,  with  his\r\n\r\nusual skill and application, will try to work out a\r\n\r\nsolution to these issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I wish to point out is the urgency of a\r\n\r\nsolution to these issues, for there seems to be the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  a  series  of  inflationary   spiral\r\n\r\nresulting   in   widespread  misery   and   general\r\n\r\ndiscontent. The recent rise in the cost  of  living\r\n\r\nhas  caused some measure of anxiety among the lower\r\n\r\nincome group. To say the least, the cost of food is\r\n\r\nabout  20  per cent higher than it was  six  months\r\n\r\nago. For the rich, this rise means nothing. For the\r\n\r\nmiddle class workers, this may mean a reduction  in\r\n\r\ntheir monthly savings. For the poor or lower income\r\n\r\nworkers, this means tightening their belts.  It  is\r\n\r\nno exaggeration to say that a worker, earning $10 a\r\n\r\nday or $300 a month, with a wife and three children\r\n\r\nand living in a Housing and Development Board flat,\r\n\r\nis  left with about $4 a day for food for the whole\r\n\r\nfamily  after deducting other standard  expenditure\r\n\r\nsuch  as  rent,  water and electricity,  bus  fare,\r\n\r\nschool  fees, children's pocket money, books,  etc.\r\n\r\nThe answer seems to be either to raise their income\r\n\r\nor to lower the cost of living, or perhaps to both.\r\n\r\nHow  can this situation be improved? I do not know.\r\n\r\nBut  I  do  know  that it is a  situation  that  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  more  and more difficult  for  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is that recently the cost of an ice-water drink has gone up from 5 cents to 10 cents.\r\n\r\nWhat  the reason is, one cannot understand. Whether\r\n\r\nit  was  the  payment  of the 13th  month  pay,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  it  was the decrease in the value  of  the\r\n\r\nAmerican  dollar, or the decrease in the  value  of\r\n\r\nmoney,  one does not know. Singapore seems to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  affected  as a result of the  crisis  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational monetary world. If the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  assures that the external situation  does\r\n\r\nnot affect us, it should be reassuring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is the conservation of water. The\r\n\r\ncampaign  to save water has been on for some  time.\r\n\r\nDisincentives to water wastage, such as  increasing\r\n\r\nthe  charges  in  PUB bills, have been  introduced.\r\n\r\nFrom  the  reports of daily consumption,  it  would\r\n\r\nappear  that  the  campaign is  not  producing  the\r\n\r\ndesired effect. I hope the Minister will review his\r\n\r\ncampaign and adopt more effective measures  to  cut\r\n\r\ndown  our  water  consumption.  Whatever  the   new\r\n\r\nmeasures may be, it appears that very much  depends\r\n\r\non  the  success of motivating the public  to  save\r\n\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that puzzles the public is that while\r\n\r\nthe  Government  asks for the co-operation  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  to save water, its workers turn on hydrants\r\n\r\nat  full blast to clean drains and markets.  Whilst\r\n\r\nadmitting  that  drains  and  markets  need  to  be\r\n\r\nwashed, one wonders whether ii is necessary to  use\r\n\r\nso  much  water. If the water used is  not  potable\r\n\r\nwater  but  effluent water then it should  be  made\r\n\r\nknown to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As water conservation is an urgent matter, I am\r\n\r\nsure   the   Minister  will  review  his   campaign\r\n\r\nperiodically until success is achieved.  Also,  the\r\n\r\nfacilities for the storage and supply of water must\r\n\r\nbe  enhanced. We must not always depend on  foreign\r\n\r\nsupplies.  In  that  respect, the  Minister  should\r\n\r\ndevise ways and means to improve the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, may I, on behalf of the constituents\r\n\r\nin  Sembawang, express our support for  the  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement given by the Minister for Finance on  the\r\n\r\n26th February, 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note that, as was the case\r\n\r\nlast  year,  there  are no new taxes.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthere  is a surplus of $20 million. This is evident\r\n\r\nthat  our country has continued to enjoy prosperity\r\n\r\nand  stability. We managed to achieve a growth rate\r\n\r\nof  13  per  cent, despite the complete rundown  of\r\n\r\nBritish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narmed  forces  and  the  consequent  reduction   of\r\n\r\nmilitary  expenditure. What  are  the  reasons  for\r\n\r\nthis?  To  my  mind,  there  are  several  reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  we have a capable and dynamic Government,\r\n\r\nactively   pursuing  and  implementing   wise   and\r\n\r\neffective  economic policies, such as a  full-scale\r\n\r\nindustrialisation    programme.    Secondly,    the\r\n\r\npolitical  stability and social peace that  prevail\r\n\r\nin our country have done a great deal to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  faith  of  foreign investors in  our  country.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the diligence of our people. Fourthly, the\r\n\r\nsincere co-operation between labour and management,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  industrial  peace,  has  raised  our\r\n\r\nindustrial production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards external trade, a record level of\r\n\r\n$15,680    million   was   achieved   last    year,\r\n\r\nrepresenting an increase of $1,645 million,  which\r\n\r\nis  a  very  substantial amount. This reflects  the\r\n\r\nimportant   role   that  our   country   plays   in\r\n\r\ninternational  trade. Although many  countries  are\r\n\r\nattempting at direct trading, this is obviously not\r\n\r\nan  easy task because they lack good docks, godowns\r\n\r\nand   other   harbour   facilities   required   for\r\n\r\ninternational  trade.  More  important,  they  lack\r\n\r\nefficient  administration and workers with  a  high\r\n\r\ndegree  of  social discipline. It can  be  expected\r\n\r\nthat  in  the next 10 years we will become a  great\r\n\r\ncentre  for  international  trade.  I  recall  that\r\n\r\ntowards  the  end of last year the Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nduring  a  visit to the European countries,  called\r\n\r\nupon those countries to regard Singapore as a great\r\n\r\ncentre  for  international  trade.  Obviously,  the\r\n\r\nprospects are excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one thing that deserves mention here is the\r\n\r\nnew tax relief for the support of aged parents.  It\r\n\r\nis  an  extremely wise measure. Although the relief\r\n\r\nof  $300 per annum per dependant is not much, it is\r\n\r\na  symbolic gesture. I do hope that the amount will\r\n\r\nbe increased from year to year. The significance of\r\n\r\nthis  concession is very important. It goes to show\r\n\r\nthat the Government has given heed to the views and\r\n\r\nopinions  of the people of our country.  When  this\r\n\r\nnews  was  announced, it won the  wide  acclaim  of\r\n\r\npeople from all walks of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, there are several other measures for\r\n\r\ntax   concession.  For  example,  for  those   with\r\n\r\nhandicapped children above the age of 16 years, the\r\n\r\nrelief  will allow these unfortunate ones to  enjoy\r\n\r\nmore  warmth in the family. The relaxation  of  the\r\n\r\nlimit on premiums for life insurance policies  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  many  people in the middle income  groups.\r\n\r\nThe  reduction of stamp duties on marine  insurance\r\n\r\nis another example of these wise measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of the people in a rural\r\n\r\nconstituency, I am naturally concerned about  their\r\n\r\nwelfare. I notice that the provision for urban  and\r\n\r\nrural  services  this year amounts  to  $3,250,000,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  exactly the same as that for last  year.\r\n\r\nThere  is no increase. I think this amount  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient. There are many rural areas  which  have\r\n\r\nyet  to  be  improved in respect of roads,  drains,\r\n\r\nstreet  lighting,  water and electricity  supplies.\r\n\r\nAll  this  requires a great deal of money.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat   the   Minister   concerned   will   consider\r\n\r\nallocating a greater amount for public works in the\r\n\r\nrural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, during the debate on the President's\r\n\r\nSpeech  and also on the Budget, I had made  similar\r\n\r\nrequests.  I  am  afraid that my requests  had  not\r\n\r\nobtained any results. I shall therefore again  call\r\n\r\nupon the Minister to reconsider these requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Estimates, we note\r\n\r\nthat although the Ministry of the Environment is  a\r\n\r\nrelatively new Ministry, it has been allocated  $36\r\n\r\nmillion. This shows the importance of the Ministry,\r\n\r\nwhose   main   task   is  to  prevent   water   and\r\n\r\nenvironmental    pollution.   Singapore    is    an\r\n\r\nindustrialised country. We must not make  the  same\r\n\r\nmistake  which other industrialised countries  have\r\n\r\nmade  by polluting the environment. It is therefore\r\n\r\nabsolutely necessary that the Government allocate a\r\n\r\nlarge sum of money for anti-pollution measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government intends to raise the building\r\n\r\ntarget  from  20,000 to 30,000  housing  units  per\r\n\r\nyear.  There is a crying need for more  houses  and\r\n\r\nfiats.  We  know  that there are 60,000  to  70,000\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the waiting list for Housing Board flats. If we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to build Housing Board fiats at the  rate\r\n\r\nof  20,000 per year, then these unfortunate  people\r\n\r\nwill  have to wait for at least two or more  years.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Government is going to build more\r\n\r\nflats per year will mean a reduction in the waiting\r\n\r\ntime between the application and the allocation  of\r\n\r\nflats. This is indeed a measure most welcome by our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it cannot be denied that our\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  looked  after  the  interests  and\r\n\r\nwelfare  of the lower income groups. We have  built\r\n\r\nmany  hawker centres. All these hawker centres  are\r\n\r\nsuitably  situated  and are  provided  with  modern\r\n\r\nsanitation.  No doubt the land provided  for  these\r\n\r\nhawker  centres fetches a very high price, but  for\r\n\r\nthe sake of improving the welfare and livelihood of\r\n\r\nthese  hawkers, it is worthwhile to pay this price.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is also going to spend  $5  million\r\n\r\nfor  the construction of hawker centres and markets\r\n\r\nin  the  next  financial year. This is indeed  good\r\n\r\nnews.  I am sure the hawkers will be able to  carry\r\n\r\non    their   trade   in   better   and   healthier\r\n\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is also going to spend $37\r\n\r\nmillion  for the development of education. This  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely   necessary.  As  a  result   of   rapid\r\n\r\ndevelopment, industries have sprung up resulting in\r\n\r\na  shortage of skilled and semi-skilled workers. At\r\n\r\nthe  moment, the main concern of foreign  investors\r\n\r\nis  not whether the labour force is stable but with\r\n\r\nthe   availability  of  skilled  and   semi-skilled\r\n\r\nlabour.  In  order  to  solve  this  problem,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should allocate this amount to carry out\r\n\r\na   full-scale   technical  education   development\r\n\r\nprogramme  to train a large number of artisans  and\r\n\r\nunskilled people so that they will be equipped with\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  skills. The Minister has  mentioned\r\n\r\nvarious schemes, such as overseas training schemes,\r\n\r\njoint  training  schemes  and  apprentice  schemes.\r\n\r\nNaturally all these are very good measures. But  in\r\n\r\norder  to obtain optimum results, emphasis must  be\r\n\r\ngiven to the practical aspects, i.e, on-the-job\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining, by sending apprentices  to  work  in\r\n\r\nfactory sites so that when they eventually take  up\r\n\r\na job, they will be fully trained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance also\r\n\r\nmentioned  that for last year there is a  reduction\r\n\r\nin  the  investment  figure  for  the  shipbuilding\r\n\r\nindustry.  This is something which we  should  take\r\n\r\nnote  of. As a result of rapid development  in  the\r\n\r\nshipbuilding and ship-repairing industry  over  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years, we have become a centre for  this\r\n\r\nindustry  in South-east Asia. We must try our  best\r\n\r\nto  maintain this superiority. But why is  there  a\r\n\r\nreduction   of   investments  in  the  shipbuilding\r\n\r\nindustry?  We  must try our best to  find  remedial\r\n\r\nmeasures. As far as I know, one of the reasons  for\r\n\r\nthe  reduction  of investments in the  shipbuilding\r\n\r\nindustry  is  the  scarcity of suitable  sites  for\r\n\r\nshipyards. If that is the case, we should  open  up\r\n\r\nmore  tracts  of  land  for  the  construction   of\r\n\r\nshipyards.  I  know  that  in  Naval  Base  in  the\r\n\r\nSembawang  constituency, there is a  big  tract  of\r\n\r\nland  suitable  for  building  shipyards.  We  must\r\n\r\nimmediately  open up this piece of land  and  other\r\n\r\nsuitable  pieces of land so that more  people  will\r\n\r\ncome and invest in our shipbuilding industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we have also satisfactorily developed\r\n\r\ntourism.  780,000 tourists visited  Singapore  last\r\n\r\nyear,   enabling   us  to  earn  foreign   exchange\r\n\r\namounting to $400 million. In order to attract more\r\n\r\ntourists  to  come to our country, we should  spend\r\n\r\nmore  money on developing tourist resorts. We  must\r\n\r\nencourage  more  cultural and art activities  among\r\n\r\nour  multi-racial society, because  all  these  are\r\n\r\nattractions  to the tourist.

Members in congratulating\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance for his popularly  known\r\n\r\npainless   Budget  statement  which  outlined   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's financial policy. I do not  intend  to\r\n\r\nspeak  on the economic aspects of the Budget, which\r\n\r\nhave  already been dealt with by many  Members  who\r\n\r\nhave spoken in support of the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget speech, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nrevealed  that  the average per  capita  income  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is now $3,687. With a growth rate  of  15\r\n\r\nper  cent  in our Gross Domestic Product  for  1972\r\n\r\nover  1971, the economic indicators show  that  our\r\n\r\nRepublic is now in a better position to devote more\r\n\r\nattention  to  the  subject  of  leisure  and   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of culture as an integral part  of  the\r\n\r\nsocial and economic development of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By culture, I do not mean only the fine arts,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  music,  drama and  dance.  Rather,  I  am\r\n\r\nreferring  to  all  that  are  concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  life. This is where effort  should  be\r\n\r\nmade in ensuring that, among Singaporeans, the  art\r\n\r\nof  living  should be one which is  Singaporean  in\r\n\r\ncharacter and recognised by others to be such.  The\r\n\r\nway  towards  this  may  be one  involving  a  long\r\n\r\nprocess but the end result, when recognised  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful,  would be a most satisfying  one;  that\r\n\r\nis,  when  we  Shave  Singaporeans  who  are  well-mannered;  always  civic-minded; always  courteous;\r\n\r\nfriendly  in disposition; well-disciplined;  imbued\r\n\r\nwith  the  values and ideals which are positive  in\r\n\r\ncharacter; endowed with a healthy body and an alert\r\n\r\nmind;  possessing  a well-rounded  personality  and\r\n\r\nendowed with creative sensibilities which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan be further developed through an exposure to the\r\n\r\nfine arts, such as music, drama and the dance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural activities must, therefore, be\r\n\r\nchannelled    towards    producing    Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially Singaporeans of the future who are  able\r\n\r\nto retain their national identity regardless of (or\r\n\r\nrather   in   addition,  able  to  withstand)   the\r\n\r\nonslaught  of unknown influences which must  surely\r\n\r\ncome in the 21st century of urbanised living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems there will be and must be successfully\r\n\r\nsurmounted,  especially in areas which concern  the\r\n\r\nmass media (which are powerful instruments and  can\r\n\r\nbe  used either for good or for evil), science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology   or   what  may  be  called   technical\r\n\r\ncivilisation, and, of course, youth, in  many  ways\r\n\r\nthe key to the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the environment we live in, both in\r\n\r\nphysical  and  social terms, should  be  one  which\r\n\r\ncontributes  to the building of a stable,  creative\r\n\r\nand all round personality in our citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a policy of cultural development\r\n\r\nshould  be  on  the  basis  that  culture   is   an\r\n\r\ninseparable part of daily life and go side by  side\r\n\r\nwith  life-long  education. Hence,  all  manner  of\r\n\r\ncultural activities, which would include all manner\r\n\r\nof  activities  where there is social inter-action,\r\n\r\nshould  be  made accessible to all. In this  sense,\r\n\r\nSir,  the fine arts (music, drama and dance) should\r\n\r\nnot  be confined to only the elite. It is only with\r\n\r\nindividual   participation  at  all   levels   that\r\n\r\ncultural activities can be of benefit and  help  in\r\n\r\nthe  task  and the process of nation building.  Our\r\n\r\nleaders  have  stressed  the  importance   of   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of culture in nation-building, and  now\r\n\r\nis  the  moment  to give serious attention  to  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of a cultural policy  towards  this\r\n\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a means of the democratization of culture, if\r\n\r\nI  may  use this term, the mass media has a crucial\r\n\r\nrole  to  play  in  the diffusion  of  culture  and\r\n\r\nconstitutes    an    invaluable   instrument    for\r\n\r\ncommunication  between  the policy-makers  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral public, so that there will be understanding\r\n\r\nof  the  common  objectives which are  national  in\r\n\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, what is needed for the coming\r\n\r\ndecade is that more attention should be paid to the\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  strengthening of the  infrastructure\r\n\r\nfor  the  development of culture, which we  already\r\n\r\nhave either to a greater or a lesser degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for attention to be paid to cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment on a global scale is realised today, as\r\n\r\nit  is,  for  example, by UNESCO  which  has  begun\r\n\r\nduring  the  last few years to concentrate  on  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of culture, as it did on the problems  of\r\n\r\neducation and science during the last 25  years  of\r\n\r\nits existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tempo of urbanisation increasing day by\r\n\r\nday  in our Republic, we owe it to our citizens and\r\n\r\nto posterity not only to create material wealth for\r\n\r\nthem,  but also to provide them with the means  and\r\n\r\nwith   every  opportunity  to  live  a  happy   and\r\n\r\nmeaningful  life,  and  as proud  citizens  of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic,  in  dignity and in friendship  with  our\r\n\r\nneighbours and friends abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have pleasure in supporting\r\n\r\nthe Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the Minister for Finance should\r\n\r\nbe  congratulated  again  for  presenting  a  third\r\n\r\npainless  Budget  to this House on  26th  February,\r\n\r\n1973. I am sure all the workers, employers and  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore are happy that there is no  new\r\n\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of the fact that there is no new\r\n\r\ntaxation,  prices  of  food  and  commodities  have\r\n\r\nincreased  from 25 per cent to 100 per  cent!  Even\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers are doing the same thing. For example,\r\n\r\na  small glass of ice-water was five cents, and  we\r\n\r\nnow have to pay 10 cents. A sarabat hawker has also\r\n\r\nincreased the price of a glass of coffee or tea  by\r\n\r\nanother  five  cents, like the  coffee-shops,  even\r\n\r\nthough he is not paying any stall rental, light and\r\n\r\nwater. A bowl of kway-teow was 30 cents, now it  is\r\n\r\n50  cents; a stick of satay was 10 cents, now it is\r\n\r\n15 cents; a plate of mutton briyani\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  80 cents, now it is $1.20. With all this,  you\r\n\r\nwill  still  find that the quantity and quality  of\r\n\r\nthe food have gone down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not objecting to a reasonable\r\n\r\nincrease of prices of food and commodities, but  at\r\n\r\nthe  rates they have increased from 25 per cent  to\r\n\r\n100  per cent, it is indeed very painful to all the\r\n\r\nworkers, especially those earning less than $200  a\r\n\r\nmonth.   The  wage  increase  recommended  by   the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council was 8 per cent, of  which  4\r\n\r\nper  cent  had to be deducted for CPF contribution.\r\n\r\nFor those earning less than $200 a month they could\r\n\r\nget 6 per cent wage increase and 4 per cent to CPF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will appreciate that the\r\n\r\nwage  increase a worker could get was  from  8  per\r\n\r\ncent  to  10 per cent, and 4 per cent was  deducted\r\n\r\nfor CPF. Yet the increase in the prices of food and\r\n\r\ncommodities  went up from 25 per cent  to  100  per\r\n\r\ncent.   There  is  a  National  Wages  Council   to\r\n\r\nrecommend   to  the  Government  on   annual   wage\r\n\r\nincreases,  but there is no Council  to  guide  the\r\n\r\nreasonable  increase  in the  prices  of  food  and\r\n\r\ncommodities.  Unless  the  Government  is  able  to\r\n\r\nenforce and control reasonable increases in  prices\r\n\r\nof  food  and commodities comparable to the  annual\r\n\r\nwage  increase  recommended by the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil, it is quite definite that the workers will\r\n\r\ndemand   higher   wages   or  high   cost-of-living\r\n\r\nallowances to meet the increases in prices of  food\r\n\r\nand commodities. How can you expect the workers  to\r\n\r\naccept  8  per  cent  to 10 per  cent  annual  wage\r\n\r\nincrease  when prices of food and commodities  went\r\n\r\nup from 25 per cent to 100 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget statement is indeed painless, but\r\n\r\nthe  prices  of  food  and  commodities  which  the\r\n\r\nworkers  have to pay daily are really very  painful\r\n\r\nand quite unbearable, especially those in the lower\r\n\r\nincome  bracket. The Government must  do  something\r\n\r\nabout  it and the sooner the better and as soon  as\r\n\r\npossible, because we do not want to be faced with a\r\n\r\nlabour  situation like in the United Kingdom  where\r\n\r\nthe workers have to resort to strike action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a well-known fact that a good number\r\n\r\nof  hawkers are making a good monthly income.  Some\r\n\r\npopular  stalls  like chicken  rice,  satay,  fried\r\n\r\nhokien  mee  and  turtle soup  can  easily  make  a\r\n\r\nmonthly  profit  of $1,000 or even more.  Some  are\r\n\r\nearning  more  than  Members of  Parliament!  I  am\r\n\r\nwondering how many hawkers are paying income tax. I\r\n\r\nunderstand that some well-to-do hawkers  own  cars,\r\n\r\nhouses, and are partners of some finance companies.\r\n\r\nIf  hawkers keep on increasing the prices of  their\r\n\r\nfood,  workers and their unions may  have  to  find\r\n\r\nways and means to live within their monthly income.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the time has come for workers  to  request\r\n\r\ntheir employers to enter into a joint venture in co-operative  canteens to supply food  and  drinks  at\r\n\r\nreasonable  prices at various offices  and  factory\r\n\r\nworksites. The Government and the NTUC can play  an\r\n\r\nimportant  role in these co-operative canteens  for\r\n\r\nthe  workers in the private and public sectors.  It\r\n\r\nis  unfair  to request the workers to refrain  from\r\n\r\ndemanding  higher wages for the sake of  industrial\r\n\r\npeace   and  national  interest,  whereas  hawkers,\r\n\r\nsundry  shops,  provision  stores  and  other  food\r\n\r\nsuppliers  can increase their prices  at  any  time\r\n\r\nthey   like   without  any  concern  for   national\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time the Government considered forming\r\n\r\na   National  Council  to  give  guidance  on   the\r\n\r\nincreasing   prices   of  food   and   commodities,\r\n\r\nincluding  non-edible items, if we want to  achieve\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak on the\r\n\r\nfantastic increase in the prices of flats,  terrace\r\n\r\nhouses  and semi-detached houses. Prices are  still\r\n\r\nrocketing.  Perhaps this is due to the manipulation\r\n\r\nof  big  financial investors. Also, rich foreigners\r\n\r\nfrom   Hong  Kong,  Taiwan,  Indonesia  and   other\r\n\r\ncountries are buying these flats and houses without\r\n\r\nhesitating to pay the high prices. They  know  very\r\n\r\nwell  that  prices  of flats, houses  and  land  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will never come down and will always  go\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote a few advertisements\r\n\r\nfrom  the  New  Nation's \"Houses & Land  For  Sale\" column: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>New Nation 3-3-1973\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) \"Tanglin Area, luxurious maisonette flat\r\n\r\nfacing  swimming  pool.

I believe some  of\r\n\r\nthe  big  financial investors deliberately jack  up\r\n\r\nthe prices to make big profits. I would suggest  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government to limit the number of construction\r\n\r\nprojects  by the private sector in building  multi-storey  flats, terrace houses, semi-detached houses\r\n\r\nand   office/shopping  complexes,  and  to  further\r\n\r\nincrease  the  building target of HDB  multi-storey\r\n\r\nunits to, if possible, 40,000 units a year so  that\r\n\r\nthe  long  waiting  list for  HDB  flats  could  be\r\n\r\neliminated. All HDB flats are meant for the workers\r\n\r\nand  the people of Singapore so that they can  have\r\n\r\ndecent accommodation, whereas private sector flats,\r\n\r\nhouses and office/shopping complexes are meant  for\r\n\r\nbig  profit  by  the financial investors.  The  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  are  built  for national  interest,  whereas\r\n\r\nprivate  building projects are meant for individual\r\n\r\nand   sectional  interest.  Sir,  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nfantastic  increase  in the  prices  of  flats  and\r\n\r\nhouses  in  the private sector, may I  request  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to increase the family combined  salary\r\n\r\nlimit  from $1,500 to $2,500 to enable more workers\r\n\r\nto purchase or rent the Housing Board flats?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> There will be more parking of Mercedes cars!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Sir, I am glad the Government\r\n\r\napproves tax relief for taxpayers who take care  of\r\n\r\ntheir aged parents, grandparents and handicapped\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren.  I  must congratulate the Government  for\r\n\r\ntaking  the  right  step to encourage  the  younger\r\n\r\npeople to love and care for their aged parents  and\r\n\r\nhandicapped    children.   It   is    our    social\r\n\r\nresponsibility to do so and to make them happy. The\r\n\r\ntax  relief of $300 a year for each dependant  will\r\n\r\ntake  effect  from 1-1-74. I would  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance to give further consideration\r\n\r\nto  increase  the tax relief to $750  a  year.  The\r\n\r\namount  of  $300  a  year  for  each  dependant  is\r\n\r\ninadequate.  The tax relief for a  first  child  is\r\n\r\n$750 a year. Surely, to care for an aged father  or\r\n\r\nmother  could  be costly and definitely  cost  more\r\n\r\nthan  a  child,  especially when  an  older  person\r\n\r\nrequires  more  nourishing food and  medical  care.\r\n\r\nAlso,  an  older person falls sick more easily  and\r\n\r\nmore frequently because of old age and weak health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one calls a doctor to attend his aged father\r\n\r\nor mother at home in case of emergency, the medical\r\n\r\nbill  will be from $15 to $25. Therefore,  the  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  of  $25 for that particular month  will  be\r\n\r\njust  enough to pay for the doctor's bill.  If  the\r\n\r\naged parent has to be admitted into a hospital  for\r\n\r\nfurther medical treatment, then the $25 will not be\r\n\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nthat  our  success  and  progress  is  due  to  the\r\n\r\neffective  tripartite co-operation between  labour,\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  Government.  I  am  sure  we   can\r\n\r\nmaintain  our  present  healthy  climate   in   our\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations and to work harder  for  more\r\n\r\nsuccess  and  progress.  Sir,  employers  are  well\r\n\r\nprotected  by the labour legislation and they  have\r\n\r\nthe  managerial  rights  to  reorganise,  transfer,\r\n\r\npromote   and  dismiss  employees.   It   is   most\r\n\r\nregrettable that there are still some unenlightened\r\n\r\nemployers who are abusing these rights and use them\r\n\r\nin  a  subtle way to victimise their employees  who\r\n\r\nare  actively interested or participated  in  union\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a small American oil company in Singapore is\r\n\r\ndoing such a silly thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   Management  of  this  company  recently  gave\r\n\r\npromotion   to   a   foreign   executive   from   a\r\n\r\nneighbouring country and deliberately preferred not\r\n\r\nto  give it to its Singaporean executives who  have\r\n\r\nthe  experience,  qualification  and  seniority  of\r\n\r\nservice.  I  understand this  same  Management  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to give another promotion post to  another\r\n\r\nforeigner  from a neighbouring country rather  than\r\n\r\npromoting its local executives who are capable  and\r\n\r\nqualified  for  this  promotion.  Sir,  the   local\r\n\r\nexecutives of this small American oil company  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  form  a union after a general  meeting\r\n\r\namong   themselves.  They  have   submitted   their\r\n\r\napplication and Union Constitution to the Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Trade  Unions for approval and registration.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  because of this move to form a union,  the\r\n\r\nManagement  is  deliberately  depriving  the  local\r\n\r\nexecutives  from  promotion and preferred  to  give\r\n\r\nthem to non-Singaporean executives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not objecting to the Management prerogatives\r\n\r\nto  promote the right person for the job. What I am\r\n\r\nstrongly  objecting to is that the  Management  did\r\n\r\nnot  give  consideration to  local  executives  and\r\n\r\nusing  promotion as a weapon to victimise employees\r\n\r\nwho want to form a union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unless the Management of this company stops\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of  unfair labour  practice  by  subtly\r\n\r\nvictimising the local executives, just because they\r\n\r\nwant to form a union, this issue will be brought to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Labour and made known to the public\r\n\r\nthrough  the  press  in due course.  This  type  of\r\n\r\nfoolish  and  unenlightened  employers  should   be\r\n\r\npunished by law if it is proven true that they  are\r\n\r\nvictimising   their  employees  for   trade   union\r\n\r\nactivities.  The Government must put  an  immediate\r\n\r\nstop  to  this kind of subtle way of victimisation.\r\n\r\nSuch foolish employers are provoking employees into\r\n\r\nindustrial  action and should not be  tolerated  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my\r\n\r\ncolleagues in this House in giving full support  to\r\n\r\nthe  Budget statement presented by the Minister for Finance to Parliament on 26th February, 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I am very appreciative of  the  very\r\n\r\ngenerous support which has been given to the Budget\r\n\r\nstatement which I made, although there were one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  Members who did not perhaps give it quite  the\r\n\r\nsame  welcome  as the others. One Member  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  the  Budget statement was tolerable.  Another\r\n\r\nMember  apparently took exception to the manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich  I presented my Budget statement. Perhaps  he\r\n\r\nmay  have  been  unfortunate in not  receiving  the\r\n\r\nfirst portion of the statement, which was given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Clerk  of  Parliament on Friday afternoon  and\r\n\r\nshould  have  been  in  the post  for  delivery  on\r\n\r\nSaturday  morning. Nevertheless, if there had  been\r\n\r\nany delay, I would like to extend my apology to the\r\n\r\nMember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that I would not be doing\r\n\r\njustice to all the various speakers today if I were\r\n\r\nto  reply  in  a very cursory manner  to  the  many\r\n\r\nvaluable suggestions which they have made.  I  have\r\n\r\ntaken copious notes but I am afraid that I may have\r\n\r\nlost  some of the finer nuances of the comments  of\r\n\r\nthose speeches which were translated from Mandarin.\r\n\r\nI   propose   therefore  to  give  their   recorded\r\n\r\nstatements my very close attention when they appear\r\n\r\nin  Hansard. The remarks which I make now are  only\r\n\r\nin very general terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the matters which were brought up, the one\r\n\r\nwhich  had  the most popular reaction was  the  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  for  parents,  deductible  from  assessable\r\n\r\nincome.  The  comments of some Members extended  to\r\n\r\nrequests  for  tax relief not only to children  but\r\n\r\nalso   to   the  taxpayers  themselves.   On   this\r\n\r\nparticular matter, all I need say at this moment is\r\n\r\nthat, in giving tax relief for parents, a principle\r\n\r\nhas  been  established which, I think, is  probably\r\n\r\nthe  most difficult part in giving the tax  relief,\r\n\r\nand that if the amounts are required to be revised,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  given consideration  in  subsequent\r\n\r\nreviews of tax reliefs for taxpayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one comment I should make, and\r\n\r\nthat  is  in  respect of parents being required  to\r\n\r\nstay with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxpayers. The Asian concept of the extended family\r\n\r\nis  of a family living together. It really does not\r\n\r\nhelp in establishing the kind of conditions that we\r\n\r\nwant to have the taxpayer living in a Housing Board\r\n\r\nflat  and  his parent living perhaps  in  a  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Home  for the Aged. This is certainly  not\r\n\r\nthe  intention of giving the tax deduction. If  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board flats are too small for the extended\r\n\r\nfamily,  then perhaps our planners in  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  should try and plan bigger flats.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey are already doing this. The one-room flats are\r\n\r\nnow giving way to the two-room, three-room and even\r\n\r\nfour-room fiats. I suppose, if necessary, it can be\r\n\r\neven  further increased to five-room  flats.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure the cost of such replanning would be very much\r\n\r\nmore  than  if  I just agreed to increase  the  tax\r\n\r\nrelief from $300 to a higher figure. I think it  is\r\n\r\nvery  desirable  that this extended family  concept\r\n\r\nshould  be  encouraged.  The  reason  is  that  the\r\n\r\nparents  are required to be taken care  of  not  by\r\n\r\nsome  social welfare workers but by their immediate\r\n\r\nand affectionate relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next comment which was rather general was on\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of living and the effects of  inflation.\r\n\r\nMany  Members  were  eloquent  on  this  particular\r\n\r\ntopic,  and  I  do  not  need  to  single  out  any\r\n\r\nparticular  Member.  I  am very  conscious  of  the\r\n\r\neffect upon our citizens of inflation in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  I thought I had devoted quite a lot of my time\r\n\r\nin  my  Budget statement to the measures  which  we\r\n\r\nintend  to  take  to  bring down  the  inflationary\r\n\r\nspiral.  The most effective economic measure  would\r\n\r\nbe to reduce the money supply of the economy from a\r\n\r\nlevel  of  24-30  per cent last year  to  something\r\n\r\nwhich  would  be more in keeping with our  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.  I  would say round about 15  per  cent  or\r\n\r\nless.  This  is,  of course, a method  of  approach\r\n\r\nwhich would be somewhat different from perhaps  the\r\n\r\napproach of Members of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir took it from the\r\n\r\npoint  of  view  of the Consumers'  Association  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  which looks at the prices of commodities\r\n\r\nand tries to establish some control or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregulation to bring down the prices. This  kind  of\r\n\r\napproach  is valuable to some extent and, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  tried and  had  succeeded  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  down  the  prices of certain  commodities,\r\n\r\nlike  sugar  until very recently,  and  some  other\r\n\r\nessential  foodstuffs.  The  Government  is   still\r\n\r\nkeeping a very close eye on the costs of all  these\r\n\r\ncommodities  in  relation to the prices  which  are\r\n\r\nbeing charged by manufacturers or by importers. But\r\n\r\nthis is only effective to the extent that the costs\r\n\r\nare not imported costs. If inflation is rampant  in\r\n\r\nsome  other countries and we have to buy from  that\r\n\r\ncountry, then there is no way in which we can bring\r\n\r\nthe  inflation down to within the limits which  are\r\n\r\nconsidered  desirable. In the case of  rice,  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  shortage,  particularly  because   of\r\n\r\nweather  conditions,  as I  have  mentioned  in  my\r\n\r\nBudget  statement, there is no way in which we  can\r\n\r\nbring  down the price to a level at which  it  was,\r\n\r\nsay,  two  years ago. To that extent, the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  must increase if we use the cost of  living\r\n\r\nindex  which was designed previously for low income\r\n\r\nfamilies.  The effect of the increase in the  price\r\n\r\nof  rice  and basic commodities must result  in  an\r\n\r\nescalation of the cost of living, in the  same  way\r\n\r\nas when the price of rice was very low there was  a\r\n\r\nreduction in the cost of living for the low  income\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the view of the economist, which is not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  always  the  kind  of  view  that   is\r\n\r\naccepted by the person who suffers from the effects\r\n\r\nof inflation, is that it is not possible to control\r\n\r\nor  regulate prices in the way that has been  tried\r\n\r\nand  found  unsuccessful. This is by price  control\r\n\r\nwhich  merely means, as has been evidenced  in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  sugar crisis, that the commodity disappears\r\n\r\nfrom  the  shops and the housewife  has  to  beg  a\r\n\r\nfavour  from the shop-keeper in order  to  get  her\r\n\r\nusual supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another theme which Members played upon has been\r\n\r\nthe need to offset the effects of industrialisation\r\n\r\nand avoid copying the methods or the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfashion  and  the way of life of the West,  and  to\r\n\r\nspend more on cultural and other projects. There is\r\n\r\na  lot  to  be  said  for  turning  away  from  the\r\n\r\ncapitalistic,    materialistic   and    unspiritual\r\n\r\nattitudes,  which  the modern urban  industrialised\r\n\r\nsociety  normally  cultivates, into  more  cultural\r\n\r\nprojects  and  in  scientific and other  worthwhile\r\n\r\nactivities. This has been recognised already in the\r\n\r\nBudget  to  the  extent that 50  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nExpenditure is allotted for social development. The\r\n\r\ndistribution of the SO per cent between culture and\r\n\r\nother  activities, like education, medical services\r\n\r\nand  so  on, is a matter of judgment. I  hope  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  we have achieved some balance. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  matter  on which the  views  of  every\r\n\r\nordinary citizen of Singapore would be valuable. In\r\n\r\nfact, to the Economic Division of my Ministry,  the\r\n\r\namount  which has been spent for social development\r\n\r\nhas  given rise to some concern because we want  to\r\n\r\nbe   able   to   devote  to  economic   development\r\n\r\nsufficient  funds to generate a surplus which  will\r\n\r\nmake  it  possible  for us to spend  money  on  the\r\n\r\nsocial side of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another comment which is related to this is about\r\n\r\nforeign workers and importation of foreign singers.\r\n\r\nThere  were  more luxuriant descriptions  given  to\r\n\r\nthese  people. The fact is that we do have quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of foreign workers. But the plan, which  my\r\n\r\nMinistry is trying to set up or develop, will  call\r\n\r\nfor  a reduction of these workers and it should  by\r\n\r\n1975  result  in  a  very much less  dependence  on\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were comments also on the effects of\r\n\r\nforeign    industrialists    as    against    local\r\n\r\nindustrialists. I would like to assure Members that\r\n\r\nthere  is no question of favouring one against  the\r\n\r\nother.  The allocation of resources to industry  is\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  take  care  of  both  the   foreign\r\n\r\nindustrialists  whom we welcome as  well  as  local\r\n\r\nindustrialists whom we want to promote,  and  whose\r\n\r\ninterest, in fact, is the reason why we have  begun\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.      The      intention       of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation is that finally our industry  and\r\n\r\ncommerce shall largely be in the hands of  our  own\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs and workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also comments on the increase in\r\n\r\nsalaries  for  top civil servants, and  there  were\r\n\r\nsuggestions  that this revision should be  extended\r\n\r\nto  technicians and other categories of workers.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to say that the principle which we  have\r\n\r\naccepted  is that of being able to recruit  and  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the standard of the civil service. In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  technicians, we recognise that they  have\r\n\r\ncertain  values, and in the scheme for daily  rated\r\n\r\nworkers   and   so   on  we  have   given   special\r\n\r\nconsideration to the pay which should be  given  to\r\n\r\ncraftsmen  as  well as technicians. On  the  higher\r\n\r\nscale, of course, it is very much more difficult to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  technician  than  even  a  professional\r\n\r\nengineer.  We would certainly spend very much  more\r\n\r\nmoney   on   developing  as  many  technicians   as\r\n\r\npossible.  In order to attract the young worker  to\r\n\r\nbecome  a  more  highly  skilled  worker,   it   is\r\n\r\nessential  that  technicians  be  adequately  paid.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there  is  no  question  that  wherever\r\n\r\nnecessary  the salary scales will be so revised  as\r\n\r\nto enable us to recruit and maintain technicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the kind of general comments which\r\n\r\nwere  made.  In the case of many Members,  I  think\r\n\r\nthey  got  down  to rather more specific  instances\r\n\r\nrelated to particular Ministries. I do not propose,\r\n\r\nin  my  reply  to the Budget statement  debate,  to\r\n\r\ntouch on all these matters because they are matters\r\n\r\nwhich  Members  will  be debating  again  when  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  under various heads of expenditure  come\r\n\r\nup  for consideration in Committee of Supply. On  a\r\n\r\nfairly  general kind of question, e.g, the idea  of\r\n\r\nimproving  the housing programme which I have  also\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  my  Budget statement,  most  Members\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  Plan for Government to  increase  the\r\n\r\nnumber of housing units to 30,000 per year. Whether\r\n\r\nthe target should be extended beyond this to 40,000\r\n\r\nis  also a matter of the constructional capacity of\r\n\r\nthe  industry and the availability of  supplies  of\r\n\r\nmaterials,   cement,  steel,  sand   and   so   on,\r\n\r\nsufficient  enough  for  40,000  units   per   year\r\n\r\nconstruction.  If it is possible to  increase  this\r\n\r\nrate, the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  need  no  urging  to increase  the  level  of\r\n\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to private housing and the very escalated\r\n\r\nprices, the comment was that some consideration  be\r\n\r\ngiven to stimulating and perhaps making more easily\r\n\r\navailable  private housing to our own  citizens.  I\r\n\r\nthink   Members  should  be  aware  that   if   too\r\n\r\nrestrictive conditions are imposed, the effect  may\r\n\r\nbe  that  there  would be a lesser supply  of  such\r\n\r\nprivate  housing,  even of the  terrace  and  semi-detached type of housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two comments were made on why I did not\r\n\r\ntouch on buses in my Budget statement. In a general\r\n\r\nway, the question of transportation in Singapore is\r\n\r\nof interest, but the plans for a mass rapid transit\r\n\r\nsystem have not yet developed in any positive sense\r\n\r\nto   enable  me  to  give  any  statement   on   an\r\n\r\nalternative to the buses. I think the bus  services\r\n\r\nhave  been  working  somewhat better  perhaps  than\r\n\r\nunder the old system before they were rationalised.\r\n\r\nBut I recognise that there have been quite a lot of\r\n\r\ndeficiencies  in  the way of breakdowns  and  other\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also comments on my omitting\r\n\r\nagriculture  and fisheries. I am not  unsympathetic\r\n\r\nto  the need to give assistance to agriculture  and\r\n\r\nfisheries,  but the problem really is in  what  way\r\n\r\ncan  this  be  done  in  an  island  as  small   as\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Nevertheless, I  think  sufficient  has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  by  the  Ministry of Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  to  increase the  production  of  both\r\n\r\nthese  industries  by 10 per cent  over  last  year\r\n\r\nwhich is very creditable, and we ought to recognise\r\n\r\nthe  contribution which our farmers and  fishermen,\r\n\r\nwhether   deep-sea  or  off-shore,  have  made   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to make any detailed comment on\r\n\r\nEducation, which has been dealt with in some detail\r\n\r\nas  far as the training of workers is concerned. On\r\n\r\nwater conservation, which the Member for Anson  has\r\n\r\nraised,  and  on  environmental  pollution,  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres,  tourism  and labour, these  are  problems\r\n\r\nwhich  can  be raised and answered by the Ministers\r\n\r\nresponsible for those subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have generally covered most of the\r\n\r\ncomments,  but I would like to end this debate  by\r\n\r\nsaying,  as  I  have said in my Budget  statement,\r\n\r\nthat  the  need for collaboration between  workers\r\n\r\nand management requires to be emphasised if we are\r\n\r\nto  maintain  the progress we have made  over  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years. It is somewhat easy  for  us  to\r\n\r\nforget  that  only ten years ago we have  a  large\r\n\r\nscale unemployment problem and that the effect  of\r\n\r\nthe  jobs  which have been created since then  has\r\n\r\nraised the standard of living of the family  unit,\r\n\r\nif  not  of  the individual worker.  But  this  is\r\n\r\nbetter  than  if we continued to have large  scale\r\n\r\nunemployment  and  to have had some  workers  paid\r\n\r\nmuch better while others arc totally unemployed. I\r\n\r\nhope that the National Wages Council\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  find a satisfactory solution to the  problem\r\n\r\nof  dividing the benefits which have been obtained\r\n\r\nfrom our rapid growth rate of 13 per cent for last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of\r\n\r\nthe Government for the financial year 1st April,\r\n\r\n1973 to 31st March, 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to the 12th\r\n\r\nMarch, 1973.\" - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty-six</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">minutes past Six o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Monday, 12th March, 1973.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1973/19730308/19730308-HA-0320639.pdf\"\">Appendix to Mr Speaker's Announcement (col.569) (Cols 0639-0642)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
