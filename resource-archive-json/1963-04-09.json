Mr Speaker, Sir, to the people of Singapore, the 1st of September last year was a dark day. It was a day when parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy died. Throughout the whole proxies of the\r\n\r\nNational  Referendum, the people in Singapore  were\r\n\r\nable  to  see that the P.A.P., in order to  prolong\r\n\r\ntheir  political  life, did all sorts  of  shameful\r\n\r\nthings  and  utilised all means of  the  propaganda\r\n\r\nmachinery  to  intimidate the people of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  is only for the sake of a few leaders in  the\r\n\r\noligarchy  of the P.A.P. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  saw\r\n\r\nthat on that day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government  used all police  vans  with  loud-speakers. They went to every housing estate,  every\r\n\r\nlane,  every street and every village to intimidate\r\n\r\npeople,   to  coerce  them  into  voting  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's proposal as otherwise they would  lose\r\n\r\ntheir citizenship rights. We were able to see  that\r\n\r\nofficers  in  the Ministry of Health  went  to  the\r\n\r\ncoffee  shops, laundry shops and canteens. Now,  if\r\n\r\nthe  licences of these shops had to be approved  by\r\n\r\nthe  officers  in the Ministry, then  the  officers\r\n\r\nwent  and  pasted up Government posters  about  the\r\n\r\nNational Referendum on the walls of these shops and\r\n\r\nintimidated the people into voting for proposal  A,\r\n\r\notherwise they would find difficulty in carrying on\r\n\r\ntheir business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you could also see that the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  in the mass meeting  at  Fullerton \r\n\r\nSquare uttered his threats through Radio Singapore, \r\n\r\nthereby forcing the people to vote for the P.A.P.'s \r\n\r\nproposal.  From  all  these  propaganda  activities \r\n\r\nconducted by the Government, we can see their  main\r\n\r\nobject was to salvage their political life and  not\r\n\r\nfor  the  national interest or for the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you could also see that on National Referendum Day,\r\n\r\nwhen the voting came to an end, the various political \r\n\r\nParties were not able to enjoy all the facilities. \r\n\r\nThey were not allowed  to send  representatives to \r\n\r\nsupervise the counting  of the votes. We also saw \r\n\r\nthat the ballot box in every\r\n\r\ndivision  was  not  carefully  examined   and   the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives were not able to know  where  these\r\n\r\nballot  boxes came from. However, only  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npeople  knew  to  which electoral  divisions  these\r\n\r\nboxes belonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is very important. All the\r\n\r\npeople in Singapore knew that the P.A.P. would make \r\n\r\nuse  of  the  National Referendum to find  out  the \r\n\r\nextent  of  the  people's  support  for  them.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment also knew that if they openly  disclosed \r\n\r\nthe electoral boxes to the Opposition Parties, that\r\n\r\nwould  be  to their disadvantage. Because of  this,\r\n\r\nthe  whole National Referendum was conducted  under\r\n\r\nundemocratic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About three weeks ago when the Prime Minister\r\n\r\npaid  a  visit  to  Sembawang, he said  during  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of the National Referendum that many people\r\n\r\nin  the  rural areas put in blank votes.  That  was\r\n\r\nbecause the Government was not doing enough in  the\r\n\r\nfield  of propaganda in the rural areas. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister also pointed out that during the course of\r\n\r\nthe  National Referendum, the number of blank votes\r\n\r\nin  the  Jurong  area was very  high.  It  was  the\r\n\r\nhighest  throughout  the whole  of  Singapore.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  all  these speeches  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister very clearly exposed their political  aims\r\n\r\nin  conducting this National Referendum.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  why   the\r\n\r\nGovernment spent the people's money for  their  own\r\n\r\npolitical objectives and they have no reason to ask\r\n\r\nthe House to approve the $436,001 as ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon.

This is a question of principle.  No\r\n\r\nmatter  what  amount  of money  was  spent  on  the\r\n\r\nNational Referendum, it should not be paid  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore, because in the 51  electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions,  how many people voted for  proposal  A,\r\n\r\nhow  many  people voted for proposal  B,  how  many\r\n\r\npeople  voted for proposal C, how many people  cast\r\n\r\nblank votes, how many spoilt votes were there,  and\r\n\r\nhow  many  people did not turn up  at  the  polling\r\n\r\nstations? All this information about the voting was\r\n\r\nturned  into a political secret by the  P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nwas known only to the P.A.P. Therefore, this amount\r\n\r\nof  money should be defrayed by the P.A.P. and  not\r\n\r\npaid  by the taxpayers because the Members in  this\r\n\r\nHouse are all elected by the people. Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nthe  expenses were to be borne by the people,  then\r\n\r\nthe   representatives  in  this  House  should   be\r\n\r\nentitled to know the results of the referendum. But\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  able to know the detailed results  of\r\n\r\neach  electoral  division, and if the  P.A.P. kept\r\n\r\nthis  information as their political  secret,  then\r\n\r\nthey should pay for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that if they want to buy political\r\n\r\nsecrets,  they  have to pay more.  Therefore,  they\r\n\r\nshould pay a sum which doubles this amount if  they\r\n\r\nwant to buy political secrets. We are not objecting\r\n\r\nto  their buying these political secrets.  So  they\r\n\r\nhave to pay for this and not ask the people to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  it. The crux of the problem is not whether the\r\n\r\namount  is  great or small but whether or  not  the\r\n\r\nresult  of the referendum should be made  known  to\r\n\r\nthe people. Therefore, the people in Singapore have\r\n\r\nno obligation to pay for this amount of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will\r\n\r\nhave  doubtless noted that when the Member for Choa\r\n\r\nChu Kang rose to speak against this particular Head\r\n\r\nin  the Supplementary Estimates, his arguments were\r\n\r\ncompletely  political  in  nature.

Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Choa  Chu Kang said that  the  1st  of\r\n\r\nSeptember  last  year was really  a  dark  day  for\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and that, in fact, he saw the referendum\r\n\r\nwas an exercise of such evil dimensions that it was\r\n\r\na  very gloomy day for democracy. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  cannot  at all subscribe to this sentiment.  Far\r\n\r\nfrom  1st September being a dark day for democracy,\r\n\r\nit  was the brightest day, it was the turning point\r\n\r\nfor  democracy in Singapore, for it was on that day\r\n\r\nthat   the  Communists,  pro-Communists  and  their\r\n\r\nsympathisers    working   in   the    open    front\r\n\r\norganisations were completely exposed. Until  then,\r\n\r\nthey  had  tried to build a myth of invincibility\r\n\r\n- that  they  control the masses, that they  control\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions, and that anybody who  stood  up\r\n\r\nagainst them would be destroyed politically through\r\n\r\nthe  democratic processes. But eventually when they\r\n\r\ntake over the organs of State, the destruction will\r\n\r\nbe   more   than  just  a  question  of   electoral\r\n\r\nconstitutions; it will be physical elimination  and\r\n\r\nliquidation.  That was the fear, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat   they   would   spread  through   all   their\r\n\r\nmultifarious open front organisations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the time they broke away from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nin  May 1961. These are the weak men who themselves\r\n\r\nwere  for  the most part not believers in  Marxism-Leninism  as a revolutionary philosophy;  but  when\r\n\r\nthe  parting  of ways took place between  the  non-Communist   socialists  in  the  P.A.P. and   the\r\n\r\nCommunists and pro-Communists in the P.A.P.,  these\r\n\r\nmen  and women were made of straw. Subjected  to  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  amount of persuasion and  intimidation,\r\n\r\nthey  decided  to \"play with the Communists\".  That\r\n\r\nwas the only reason why they weakened and went over\r\n\r\nto  the  other  side, thinking that, with  all  the\r\n\r\npanoply  of open front organisations which we  have\r\n\r\nallowed the Communists to organise, it was  only  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  time  when they could seize  power  and\r\n\r\nbreak us up. And we took up this challenge, and  on\r\n\r\n1st September last year the battle was joined. What\r\n\r\nwas   the   result?  We  allowed   them   all   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  freedoms - they could  have  all  the\r\n\r\nmass  meetings  provided they  observed  the  laws,\r\n\r\nwhich  they  did. I must pay them  a  tribute,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir.  The  mass  meetings  were  held  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the conditions  of  the  licences\r\n\r\nstated  for the conduct of such mass meetings,  and\r\n\r\nthey  thought that they were winning. And  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  curious thing - almost to the end the Communists\r\n\r\nand  their  running  dogs in the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nbelieved that they were going to win. Never for one\r\n\r\nmoment, until perhaps a day before polling day, did\r\n\r\nthey  entertain any doubt at all as to the  outcome\r\n\r\nof the referendum; so certain were they!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, why were they routed? Why was there\r\n\r\nsuch a tremendous defeat for these people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will bear with me for a moment, I\r\n\r\nwill try to analyse the position. As I said, I have\r\n\r\ngot  to go back to basic historical processes  when\r\n\r\nthe  Communists broke with us. Their No. 1  mistake\r\n\r\nwas  to  break with the P.A.P. on a national issue.\r\n\r\nWe  said that we wanted merger with Malaya and that\r\n\r\nwe  were  in  favour  of Malaysia,  as  indeed  all\r\n\r\ngenuine  nationalists in this country must support.\r\n\r\nThey   oppose  `merger  and  Malaysia  for  obvious\r\n\r\nreasons which have been explained adnauseam  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  this  House. They  oppose  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  simply because after merger and  Malaysia\r\n\r\nthe  Internal Security Council will be in the hands\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation  Government  who  have  a  less\r\n\r\ndelicate  regard  for constitutional  niceties  and\r\n\r\nrights that can be afforded to Communists and their\r\n\r\nfellow-travellers. The Federation  Government  have\r\n\r\ngot clear views on them. We, on the other hand, say\r\n\r\nwe  will  always give them an opportunity  for  the\r\n\r\nlegal  open  confrontation so long as they  observe\r\n\r\nthe laws and the constitution of the country. But I\r\n\r\nam afraid opinion in Kuala Lumpur differs from ours\r\n\r\non  that  point. Therefore, because they feel  that\r\n\r\nafter  merger and Malaysia they will be conscribed,\r\n\r\nthey   oppose  it  purely  for  their  own  selfish\r\n\r\npolitical  interests. That is  their  No.  1  error\r\n\r\nwhich led to their defeat on 1st September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their No. 2 mistake, which combined with their\r\n\r\nNo. 1 mistake proved fatal, was that they said they\r\n\r\nwanted  more  merger  than the P.A.P.  They  wanted\r\n\r\ncomplete merger. Therefore, since we wanted  merger\r\n\r\non  special terms and they wanted complete  merger,\r\n\r\nthe  issue  that had to be posed in this referendum\r\n\r\nwas  not  whether you wanted merger or you did  not\r\n\r\nwant  merger, but what type of merger did you want.\r\n\r\nOur  type  of  merger was Alternative  A;  complete\r\n\r\nmerger Alternative B; or the Borneo/Sarawak type of\r\n\r\nmerger  Alternative C. Those were the three  honest\r\n\r\nissues that were posed to the electorate for  their\r\n\r\nchoice.  I do not want to go through the merits  of\r\n\r\neach  of the three alternative choices; but suffice\r\n\r\nit to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the electorate of\r\n\r\nSingapore listened to all points of view. We  never\r\n\r\nstopped the Barisan from having mass meetings. They\r\n\r\nwere completely free to disseminate their views any\r\n\r\ntime  they  liked, in any way they liked,  provided\r\n\r\nthey  observed the law. And they went pretty  close\r\n\r\nto  the  brink.  For  instance, carrying  out  this\r\n\r\nphoney Gallup Poll in Tanjong Pagar and Kreta Ayer - strictly speaking, according to the Municipal  bye-laws  and  a  few local laws, these exercises  were\r\n\r\nillegal.  But we said. \"Well, it does not  matter.\"\r\n\r\nThey wanted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nradio time and we offered them radio time. We wrote\r\n\r\nto them, \"Please come to Radio Singapore and let us\r\n\r\ndiscuss  matters in a human and adult manner.\"  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I am sad to relate that after  about\r\n\r\nten days of the open confrontation before the radio\r\n\r\nmicrophone,  the  Barisan  decided  that  they  had\r\n\r\nenough  of  it  and would not appear  before  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people knew exactly what was fought for, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir.  No  amount of sophistry,  of  half-cooked  Marxism-Leninism or  what-have-you  on  the\r\n\r\nother  side  can deceive the people that  the  best\r\n\r\ninterest  in the near future is to have  a  limited\r\n\r\nconditional  form of merger whereby Singapore  will\r\n\r\nhave a considerable measure of local autonomy.  And\r\n\r\nbecause the Barisan were foolish enough to  try  to\r\n\r\noutbid  the P.A.P. in wanting more merger  than  we\r\n\r\ndid,  they failed in the result because the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore at the present moment are prepared to\r\n\r\ngo  only so far and no further in a merger with the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. The Barisan Sosialis  thought\r\n\r\nthat  complete merger was out of the  question.  In\r\n\r\nfact, Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may let the House into\r\n\r\nthe  secret for the first time as to the reason why\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis tried to outbid the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\ndemanding  complete merger. Mr  James  Puthucheary\r\n\r\nwas  an  old colleague of ours. In 1959 we unlocked\r\n\r\nthe  gates  of  Changi Gaol and  released  him  and\r\n\r\nplaced  him  in a position of responsibility.  When\r\n\r\nthe fight between the P.A.P. and the pro-Communists\r\n\r\ndeveloped  into  a crisis, I could  see  Mr  James\r\n\r\nPuthucheary -  he    was    working     in     my\r\n\r\nMinistry - weakening from day to day.  Eventually  he\r\n\r\ntold me that he was going over to the other side as\r\n\r\nhe  found his position as a supporter of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nintolerable. And he said they were going  to  wreck\r\n\r\nmerger, \"This is absolutely on the cards.\"  I  said\r\n\r\nto  him,  \"James, why do you say so?\" Then  he  did\r\n\r\nsome  calculations on a piece of  paper.  He  said,\r\n\r\n\"There are 105 seats in the Federal Parliament. The\r\n\r\nAlliance has 60 votes; the Opposition has 40 votes;\r\n\r\na  margin of 20. If Singapore were to go in on full\r\n\r\nmerger, Singapore would get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanything  between 20 and 25 votes, the majority  of\r\n\r\nwhich  would  be  anti-Alliance  votes.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nunder   no   circumstances  will   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  contemplate complete merger.\"  Complete\r\n\r\nmerger,     of    course,    means    proportionate\r\n\r\nrepresentation. Therefore, he said, \"We  are  going\r\n\r\nto outbid you, and that will put you in a fix.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the No. 1 reason. I do not know if that\r\n\r\nwas the No. 1 or No. 2 reason - the strategist  in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis who led them up  the  garden\r\n\r\npath.  It was absolutely a basic error in political\r\n\r\nstrategy. If at that time in May or June 1961  they\r\n\r\nhad   said,   \"Nonsense  with  merger.   Absolutely\r\n\r\nnothing.  We  want an independent  Singapore,  come\r\n\r\nwhat  may\",  then, Mr Speaker, Sir, if  we  had  a\r\n\r\nreferendum,  the choice must be either merger  with\r\n\r\nthe   Federation   on  those  terms   or   complete\r\n\r\nindependence. And if the alternative posed  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum was either merger with the Federation or\r\n\r\ncomplete  independence  for Singapore,  the  result\r\n\r\ncould  have been one way or the other. But given  a\r\n\r\nchoice  of  limited  and  conditional  merger,  and\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger, we had no doubt at all  what  the\r\n\r\nresult  would be - a shattering defeat for the  pro-Communists who on that occasion were trying  to  be\r\n\r\ntoo clever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, although we had no doubt as to the\r\n\r\noutcome,  we  took the precaution of ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthe  electorate  understood all  the  basic  issues\r\n\r\ninvolved in the referendum. The Barisan accused  us\r\n\r\nof using the radio to put forward these views. What\r\n\r\nis  so wrong about it? What is the radio for but to\r\n\r\nexplain  to  the people the nature of the  decisive\r\n\r\nchoice which they had to make on 1st September?  It\r\n\r\nwas  quite  proper. We had to do  it.  We  have  no\r\n\r\napologies  at  all. We are not at all ashamed.  In.\r\n\r\nfact,  we are very proud and we are very glad  that\r\n\r\nthey  found  out how the use of the  radio  was  so\r\n\r\neffective.  That is why we have advanced  the  time\r\n\r\nfor  starting Television. It is going  to  be  even\r\n\r\nmore  effective - not  only sound,  but  audio-visual\r\n\r\naids!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not really enjoy tormenting the young men and women on the other side, but I think it is about time they listened to a few home-truths, having wandered, like the lost tribes, through the desert and not being able to come out. Now, Sir, not oily did we use the radio\r\n\r\nbut  we  made sure - after all, not every  family  in\r\n\r\nSingapore owns a radio set - that there had to  be  a\r\n\r\nface-to-face explanation. The Member for  Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang  complained about the use of police  cars.  We\r\n\r\nused  police  cars simply because - I have  forgotten\r\n\r\nthe exact number; I think there were about eight or\r\n\r\nnine police cars - we could commandeer them at  the\r\n\r\ntime  for  use  to explain to the people,  face  to\r\n\r\nface. We told them what this was all about. We used\r\n\r\npolice  cars because some of them have loud-speaker\r\n\r\nequipment. If the Barisan Sosialis think  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  our field propaganda outfit consists  of\r\n\r\npolice  cars, they are absolutely wrong. The police\r\n\r\ncars amounted to more than 10 per cent of the loud-speaker vehicles which we sent out. We sent out  75\r\n\r\nsuch vehicles equipped with radio, loud-speaker and\r\n\r\ntape-recorder. On the average, each of these  teams\r\n\r\ncarried  out between 30 and 50 \ufffd-hour meetings  per\r\n\r\nday,   bringing  a  total,  during  the  referendum\r\n\r\nperiod,   of  between  6,000  and  8,000   meetings\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  towns, streets and  villages.  Let\r\n\r\nthem not believe that this is just a matter of half\r\n\r\na  dozen  police  cars. We arranged the  referendum\r\n\r\npublicity  campaign with all the  thoroughness  and\r\n\r\nenergy  that we could command. There is  absolutely\r\n\r\nno apology for what we did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the broadcasting of Fullerton Square\r\n\r\nspeeches.  What is wrong with that? I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhy  they  even  raised that subject.  But  on  the\r\n\r\nfourth point which they raised, that is, the result\r\n\r\nof  the  referendum was not known to  the  Barisan.\r\n\r\nSosialis,  they complained, saying, \"You must  know\r\n\r\nwhat the results are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the referendum was conducted on the 1st of September. I thought the result was published on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd  of  September last year.

To these  two  particular\r\n\r\nAssemblymen,  for their own peace of mind,  I  say,\r\n\r\nthe  less said, the better. They want to know!  Why\r\n\r\nshould  they know? The law does not say  that  they\r\n\r\nmust  know. No referendum results in any democratic\r\n\r\ncountry,  or even in any undemocratic country,  are\r\n\r\npublished  constituency by constituency.  You  will\r\n\r\nremember,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we went  through  all\r\n\r\nthis   in  Select  Committee.  We  challenged   the\r\n\r\nrepresentors  in Select Committee  to  produce  any\r\n\r\nprecedent,  and they were completely unable  to  do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon said that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. know the result and that therefore we should\r\n\r\npay for it.

However, from the practices  employed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government, I can say that they still consider\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Members as a  group  which  cannot\r\n\r\nextend  their co-operation in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. I say as a  Member  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  as  an  elected  representative  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, that it is accepted in the Constitution  of\r\n\r\nthis State that each representative represents  his\r\n\r\nrespective constituency irrespective of whether the\r\n\r\nconstituents voted for him or not. However, in  the\r\n\r\nlight of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntactics adopted by the Government, it does not even\r\n\r\nconsider    such   representatives    as    elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, let alone extend respect to  them.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I am unable to understand the concept\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. democracy when, as the representative\r\n\r\nof the Southern Islands, I was not consulted on the\r\n\r\noccasion of the visit of the Head of State  to  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands. I feel that it should have  been\r\n\r\nproper  on  the  part  of the  Government  to  have\r\n\r\nconsulted me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister will visit\r\n\r\nthe  rural  constituencies throughout Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  Prime  Minister  has  visited  the\r\n\r\nKampong    Kembangan   constituency    where    the\r\n\r\nrepresentative is my colleague. I was informed that\r\n\r\nthe  `Member for Kampong Kembangan was only invited\r\n\r\nto  participate  just  for  name's  sake  only.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the Prime Minister will be visiting\r\n\r\nmy  constituency - the Southern Islands - either on the\r\n\r\n21st  or  the  28th.  This  came  to  my  knowledge\r\n\r\nunofficially. Meetings were conducted by the  heads\r\n\r\nof  the Islands to prepare for the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nvisit.  At  these meetings, the question was  asked\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Member for the Southern Islands was  left\r\n\r\nout at the meetings to discuss the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nvisit.  The Government's reply was that the  object\r\n\r\nof  the proposed visit is for the Prime Minister to\r\n\r\nknow the extent of the difficulties encountered  by\r\n\r\nthe people in this constituency. The question which\r\n\r\nI  have  posed,  Mr Speaker, is not  motivated  by\r\n\r\nsheer jealousy for fear of loss of my constituency,\r\n\r\nbut it was motivated more by our attempt to achieve\r\n\r\na democratic society. I think the time When we have\r\n\r\ndifferent views on political ideologies was  during\r\n\r\nelection time. It is up to the people to make their\r\n\r\nchoice according to the Constitution. In accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the practice of parliamentary democracy,  the\r\n\r\ncandidate  who  gets  the most  votes  is  elected.\r\n\r\nSurely  the  intention  is not  to  carry  on  this\r\n\r\nideological  battle  continuously.  We  should  not\r\n\r\nengage in activities which will confuse the people.\r\n\r\nIf  we are sincere and are dedicated to the service\r\n\r\nof  the  people, we should not have any  qualms  or\r\n\r\nfear as to whether we may or may not be elected  at\r\n\r\nthe next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelection.   That  is  the  accepted   practice   of\r\n\r\nparliamentary   democracy.  We   will   have   more\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to shoulder in the next 4\ufffd months.\r\n\r\nIf this practice based on party ideology is carried\r\n\r\non,  as  expressed by the Member for Geylang Serai,\r\n\r\nthere  is bound to be that feeling of provincialism\r\n\r\nwhen  Malaysia  is achieved. This will  lead  to  a\r\n\r\nstate   of   affairs  which  no  one   wishes.   As\r\n\r\nunanimously  agreed, we should set  an  example  to\r\n\r\nfulfil our duties to our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I further wish to touch upon the Communist activities as mentioned in the speech delivered by His Excellency. We must be ready to face any eventuality which may be posed by the Communist threat in future. It is appropriate that we should shoulder this responsibility. We cannot face this responsibility all by ourselves. When we\r\n\r\nrealise the manoeuvres of our enemies arc to  wreck\r\n\r\nour hopes, we should not' hesitate and be afraid to\r\n\r\ntake positive steps which we are certain will bring\r\n\r\nprosperity  and security to our State.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  in  this  House on a number of occasions,  we\r\n\r\nhave  shown  the  dangers and  yet  the  Government\r\n\r\nfights shy of taking action, or is passing the buck\r\n\r\nto the others to take action - I cannot say which. If\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government, which is non-Communist,  is\r\n\r\nshy to declare openly that it is anti-Communist but\r\n\r\nsincerely  believes  that the  Communists  have  no\r\n\r\nsympathy towards humanity and are constantly taking\r\n\r\ndestructive  action, I hope it will  really  behave\r\n\r\nlike  non-Communists. I hope it will not  keep,  in\r\n\r\nits  midst pro-Communist elements who are still  at\r\n\r\nlarge  in Singapore. Mr Speaker, this matter  will\r\n\r\nbe  mentioned again in the next motion.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nintend now to make a lengthy speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the amendment moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  wherein he expresses  his  regrets,  it\r\n\r\nseems  to  me  that  he is not satisfied  with  the\r\n\r\ndecision taken by the people at the referendum held\r\n\r\non  1st September last year. I realised that it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  satisfy people like the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  who cannot accept the decision  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The call for honest general elections  can\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nset aside so that we will not be bothered by that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the future policy of the Government, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to mention the treatment given  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for equal opportunities.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMalays  in  Singapore are ready to live in  harmony\r\n\r\nwith  the  other communities, but the  Government's\r\n\r\nhope  to establish an egalitarian society will  not\r\n\r\nbe  achieved. I respect the P.A.P. Government  with\r\n\r\nits  socialistic policies. But it has been stressed\r\n\r\nin the Constitution, as mentioned by the Member for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai, that it should be the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  any government to promote the interests of  the\r\n\r\nMalays in all spheres. The object of including this\r\n\r\nclause  in  the Preamble is not because the  Malays\r\n\r\nwant  to  supersede the other races. It  is  but  a\r\n\r\nrequest  for the non-Malays to consider the special\r\n\r\nposition  of  the  indigenous people  so  that  the\r\n\r\nMalays will not be treated like the Red Indians  in\r\n\r\nAmerica and the Maoris in New Zealand. What harm is\r\n\r\nthere in the Government helping the Malays to  lift\r\n\r\nup  their standard of living irrespective of  their\r\n\r\npolitical  beliefs?  I have to  mention  this,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, because this has been misrepresented as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  different political beliefs. There  are\r\n\r\npolitical Parties who are afraid to implement  this\r\n\r\nclause in the Preamble. For instance, if there  are\r\n\r\nnon-Malay leaders, such leaders are not prepared to\r\n\r\nput forward a scheme for the Malays because the \r\n\r\nnon-Malays will not support their political Parties  in\r\n\r\nfuture.  If  there are Malays voicing  the  special\r\n\r\nposition  of  the  Malays,  those  Malays  will  be\r\n\r\naccused  of indulging in communalism. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  awakening of the Malays to survive and to live\r\n\r\nhas   been  proved  by  their  acceptance  of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution. If they are hard pressed and there is\r\n\r\nno   change  in  their  status-for  instance,   the\r\n\r\nprovision  of flats. The Malays are not  accustomed\r\n\r\nto  living in flats. If it is within the  means  of\r\n\r\nthe Malays to live in flats, there is no doubt that\r\n\r\nthey will be prepared to live in them. On the other\r\n\r\nhand, if he is a fisherman or a hawker\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearning $2 or $3 a day, surely he cannot afford  to\r\n\r\nlive  in  and pay a rental for a flat. The  Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Board expect that rentals for flats\r\n\r\nmust  be paid promptly, otherwise the tenants  will\r\n\r\nbe evicted. This aspect must be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the environments here are pleasant, but\r\n\r\nin  the  Southern Islands there is really  a  sorry\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs,  to  the extent  that  talented\r\n\r\nchildren, who are keen to further their studies and\r\n\r\nwho  have passed their examinations, cannot  go  to\r\n\r\nsecondary  school  because  their  parents   cannot\r\n\r\nafford   to  send  them  to  secondary  school   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In the circumstances, the parents  have\r\n\r\nno  alternative  but  to stop their  children  from\r\n\r\nattending secondary school in Singapore. I have  on\r\n\r\nmany  occasions pressed the Government to  build  a\r\n\r\nsecondary  school in the Southern Islands  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the children there. Unfortunately,  my\r\n\r\nrequest  has not been considered by the Government.\r\n\r\nI  do  not know if it is because they consider  the\r\n\r\nrequest as coming from a non-P.A.P. member. I  have\r\n\r\nmade  arrangements  for  those  children  attending\r\n\r\nprimary school to live on the mainland. I hear  the\r\n\r\nofficials  of the Ministry are not very happy  with\r\n\r\nmy  action because they consider it is a reflection\r\n\r\non the Government. In all sincerity, Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nam prepared to assist these unfortunate children in\r\n\r\nany  way  I  can  to make available facilities  for\r\n\r\ntheir  further education. For instance, the  school\r\n\r\nat  Blakang  Mati. In 1961 I raised this  question.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Education himself, when \r\n\r\nasked when\r\n\r\nthe  school at Blakang Mati was going to be put up,\r\n\r\nreplied  that it would be in 1961. But  it  is  not\r\n\r\nuntil 1963 that the school is put up. This is  also\r\n\r\nto coincide with the forthcoming visit of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  to  the Southern Islands. Similarly,  the\r\n\r\njetty   at  Sekijang  Pelepah.  Because  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister will be visiting that island, work is  now\r\n\r\nin hand to repair the jetty. The school at Sekijang\r\n\r\nPelepah,  which was built when the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim was the then Minister for National Development,\r\n\r\nis  being  left  haunted. These are  all  political\r\n\r\nmanoeuvres  and  there is no sincere  intention  to\r\n\r\nbring facilities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  Southern Islands. We should  not  continue\r\n\r\nwith  these  practices  as  political  leaders;  we\r\n\r\nshould forget political affiliations when we fulfil\r\n\r\nour  obligations towards the people. We should  not\r\n\r\nallow  the  people to be made use of  as  political\r\n\r\npawns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of .the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard   which  is  responsible  for  the   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Singapore, many  sites  have  been\r\n\r\nprepared for industrial growth. One of the  islands\r\n\r\naffected is Pulau Ayer Limau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Deputy SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I learnt that from the newspapers and I immediately wrote to the Board about the plight of the people. Only when I wrote to the Board were they willing to communicate with me, and, of course, they were prepared to co-operate with me as an elected representative of the people. My assistance was sought on how to resettle\r\n\r\nthe  affected families because the island was going\r\n\r\nto  be  used  as  a harbour. In our  endeavours  to\r\n\r\nindustrialise, I bad hoped that the Malays who have\r\n\r\nto   be  resettled  on  Pulau  Semulut  would  also\r\n\r\nbenefit. I had also hoped that this would pave  the\r\n\r\nway for them to be in gainful employment. Hitherto,\r\n\r\nthey  are  engaged in fishing. The  setting  up  of\r\n\r\nfactories  in the vicinity will, it is hoped,  mean\r\n\r\nmore  employment  for  the islanders.  However,  it\r\n\r\nappears  that the islanders are still  waiting  for\r\n\r\nthe  setting up of factories and I feel  guilty  as\r\n\r\nthough  I  have  deceived them. When  I  got  their\r\n\r\nconsent  to shift them from Pulau Semulut to  Pulau\r\n\r\nAyer  Limau,  I  gave them an assurance  that  they\r\n\r\nwould   be  considered  for  employment  when   the\r\n\r\nfactories  are set up. They are still  waiting  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  not a single factory that has  issued  a\r\n\r\nnotice  to  the islanders asking whether  they  are\r\n\r\nprepared to work in the factories. Very few  people\r\n\r\nindeed  have  got employment. The Board  has  never\r\n\r\nrecruited  any hands from the islands. I fear  that\r\n\r\nthe affected places concern only the Malays - for\r\n\r\ninstance, Pulau Semulut or Tanjong Kling - who will\r\n\r\nbe resettled elsewhere. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is an intention to get these people\r\n\r\nto  live in flats, and if they are unemployed,  how\r\n\r\ncan we expect them to do so unless, of course, they\r\n\r\nare in steady employment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the case of Pulau Bukom. We\r\n\r\nare  happy  to  see the industrial growth  in  that\r\n\r\nisland  because  this  will mean  more  employment.\r\n\r\nHowever,   Sir,  this  growth  is   only   in   its\r\n\r\npreliminary  stage.  At  Pulau  Bukom,  the   Shell\r\n\r\nCompany  has  asked its employees to  vacate  their\r\n\r\nhouses  and find alternative accommodation  on  the\r\n\r\nmainland  of  Singapore.  This  again  affects  the\r\n\r\nMalays because the number of Malays living in Pulau\r\n\r\nBukom is great. I hope the Government will not  sit\r\n\r\ntight  and  watch  the Company  taking  such  steps\r\n\r\nwithout    first   making   available   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation for its employees. We do  nut  object\r\n\r\nto  the Company enlarging its sectors, but it  must\r\n\r\nensure  that  its  employees will  not  be  put  to\r\n\r\nhardship.  Then  again  the question  of  employees\r\n\r\nbeing dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to dwell at length on this\r\n\r\nmatter, Mr Deputy Speaker, but what I really  wish\r\n\r\nto  convey  is  the  position of  the  Malays.  The\r\n\r\nposition  of the Malays has not received attention.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it has been mentioned that the Government\r\n\r\nhas provided free textbooks and free schooling,  it\r\n\r\nis  still  found that the agents of  Government  or\r\n\r\nGovernment  officials do not give consideration  to\r\n\r\nthe  special position of the Malays. For  instance,\r\n\r\non   the   subject  of  circulars  from  Ministries\r\n\r\nregarding the provision of textbooks, some teachers\r\n\r\nhave failed to notify the students of this facility\r\n\r\nfor  the  reason that if they do so it  means  more\r\n\r\nwork  for  them. Such circulars which the  teachers\r\n\r\nreceive  from the Ministry are not relayed  to  the\r\n\r\nstudents. For instance, if certain forms issued  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  are  in  the English  language,  the\r\n\r\nparents  cannot understand these forms. So time  is\r\n\r\nwasted  in their translation. The excuse  given  by\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  is  that the applications  submitted\r\n\r\ncannot be considered as they are too late. This  is\r\n\r\nthe  method  employed by the Ministry. I  think  it\r\n\r\nmust be rectified. It is a slow process to build  a\r\n\r\njust and equal society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, Hansard Vol. 20, No. 1 is supposed to\r\n\r\ncontain the Government's policy speech delivered by\r\n\r\nthe   Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara.

I have mentioned all this, Sir,  to\r\n\r\nshow  that all these human relations are very, very\r\n\r\nimportant  and if only our Government - the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  Singapore - would practise  little\r\n\r\nappreciation of human relations like that, and when\r\n\r\nthey  have a public opportunity like that, to thank\r\n\r\npublicly the people who have given aid, hospitality\r\n\r\nand  the  like; also the civil servants,  who  have\r\n\r\ngiven their services; the Government would get much\r\n\r\nbetter results and a better feeling internationally\r\n\r\nand locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nAgong  even  mentioned them as part  of  the  whole\r\n\r\nParliament  when he gave credit to the  Parliament,\r\n\r\nand  when he said that the people looked up to them\r\n\r\nas  their  leaders  and  their  representatives   be\r\n\r\nincluded everyone in the House.

I  shall\r\n\r\nleave the Federation Hansard for the time being and\r\n\r\ncome  to  the Singapore one. Compare this with  the\r\n\r\negoistic,  selfish and arrogant atmosphere  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. policy  speech which was delivered  by  the\r\n\r\nHead  of  State  here. `The P.A.P. claims  all  the\r\n\r\ncredit  for  all  the achievements that  they  have\r\n\r\ncatalogued in the so-called policy speech.

To the P.A.P. - I think\r\n\r\nthis  is a well-known fact - the whole world is  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. world  and no one, as I have said,  neither\r\n\r\nGod  nor  man matters.

After blaming them  for  not  giving\r\n\r\ncredit  where credit is due, I give them the credit\r\n\r\nof  working  very hard. They work very  hard,  they\r\n\r\nstrive very hard not for the people of the State of\r\n\r\nSingapore but for the P.A.P. and the P.A.P. alone.\r\n\r\nDevelopment projects have been imp1emented with one\r\n\r\neye on the next election and the other eye on their\r\n\r\npresent  seats  in  this Chamber. Consequently,  no\r\n\r\neyes are left for the welfare of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, in the housing project, you\r\n\r\nwill see in Hansard, Volume 13, No. 2, 1960, column\r\n\r\n82,  it  was only after I had exposed to the public\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government had only built 124 houses  as\r\n\r\nagainst  6,734 built during the first year  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government, that they started to  wake  up\r\n\r\nand  started  building. They were  then  complacent\r\n\r\nabout public needs because they were over-confident\r\n\r\nof  their  power and their overwhelming victory  in\r\n\r\nthe last elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that they have to fight for their\r\n\r\nsurvival because of the splits in their Party, they\r\n\r\nare  pushing  ahead, building houses  in  order  to\r\n\r\ncatch votes, ignoring the vital social consequences\r\n\r\nof  their planning. For example, Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment  whether they have taken the trouh1e  to\r\n\r\nfind  out - for instance in the case of  a  squatter\r\n\r\nwho  has  been  forced by fire, or some  inevitable\r\n\r\nfactor like slum clearance, to seek a Housing Board\r\n\r\nflat  -  this squatter with a househo1d  of  twenty\r\n\r\npersons, who used to pay $2 or $3 assessment probably, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen he moves into a fiat, let us say, if he\r\n\r\ntakes a one-room flat and pays about $25; only four\r\n\r\nor  five  persons can stay in that flat? Therefore,\r\n\r\nhe  has  to rent about four or five flats  for  his\r\n\r\nentire household, bringing his expenditure on  rent\r\n\r\nto  about  $100 a month. Have the Government  taken\r\n\r\nthe   trouble  to  find  out  whether  this   extra\r\n\r\nexpenditure - such a great difference,  Sir,  $100\r\n\r\nas  compared to the previous $2 or $3 - whether  this\r\n\r\nextra  expenditure  incurred  in  paying  rent  and\r\n\r\npublic  utilities  has caused increased  crime  and\r\n\r\ndelinquency?  Whether people have  to  go  out  and\r\n\r\nsteal to make enough money to feed their family? Or\r\n\r\nwhether   the   need  for  extra  money   and   the\r\n\r\nopportunities  made available by  the  new  housing\r\n\r\nprovision have led to the economic independence  of\r\n\r\nthe   women?   The  necessity  to  work   and   the\r\n\r\nopportunities available might have made  the  women\r\n\r\ngo  out and work. Therefore, it is a good thing and\r\n\r\nGovernment  should encourage this.  Has  Government\r\n\r\ntaken the trouble to see the social consequences of\r\n\r\nits  housing  project? How and to what  extent  the\r\n\r\nmodern  provision of housing affects  and  disturbs\r\n\r\nthe  patterns of family and community life? Whether\r\n\r\nmodern housing patterns promote racial harmony?  Or\r\n\r\ndo   they  have  the  opposite  effect  of  causing\r\n\r\nfriction  among people of different races, beliefs,\r\n\r\ncustoms  and  creeds? And what role Government  can\r\n\r\nplay  to  help  minimise if not eradicate  entirely\r\n\r\nthese frictions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have heard the Member for Geylang Serai\r\n\r\nmention,  Sir, that if blocks of flats are  offered\r\n\r\nto  Malays, he feels that they would accept  blocks\r\n\r\nof  flats. Well, it is up to the Government to find\r\n\r\nout whether it is good in the long run to segregate\r\n\r\nthem  for temporary peace, or whether it is  better\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to try and  promote  tolerance\r\n\r\namong them. All this is very, very important. I  am\r\n\r\nasking  the Government to say whether all this  has\r\n\r\nbeen  thrashed  out, debated, and the  opinions  of\r\n\r\nexperts  and  those  interested  and  the  families\r\n\r\nthemselves  sought; whether a survey or a  research\r\n\r\nhas  been  made to find out the true situation,  to\r\n\r\navoid  racial friction and, what is more important,\r\n\r\nto  promote  racial tolerance; to discover  whether\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbreaking  up of large households into small  family\r\n\r\nunits  have  improved family ties among members  of\r\n\r\nthe  families  and the different  families  in  the\r\n\r\nhousehold.  This is as important as racial  harmony\r\n\r\n- this  family  harmony - because where there  is  not\r\n\r\nthis harmony in the family, it is a breeding ground\r\n\r\nfor juvenile delinquency.

Two women\r\n\r\norganisations in Singapore, the P.P.S.E.A.W.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the Wanita Singapura are jointly making a study\r\n\r\nand survey in their own limited way - I admit it is a\r\n\r\nvery  limited  way - to find out the  real  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  in  these  mutters and to  see  how  women\r\n\r\norganisations in Singapore can step in and help  to\r\n\r\nminimise  any  adverse  consequences  that  may  be\r\n\r\nrevealed  by  the  survey.  If  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nsincere  in  its efforts to raise the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  in  Singapore, they would take interest  in\r\n\r\nfinding  the answers to these questions and  assist\r\n\r\nin  the  said  survey, although it is headed  by  a\r\n\r\nMember of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the P.A.P. Government is inclined to belittle\r\n\r\nand mock all efforts except their own, I would like\r\n\r\nto  quote  a little paragraph from page 35  of  the\r\n\r\nReport  of the E.C.A.F.E. Seminar held in Singapore\r\n\r\nlast     December.    Talking    about    voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations,   women  organisations   and   youth\r\n\r\norganisations, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is only too easy to underestimate their value\r\n\r\nin  relation to the size of the problem with  which\r\n\r\nthey  are  concerned, but the fact  that  they  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  and  that within their limitations  they\r\n\r\nare    tackling   the   problem,   are   of   great\r\n\r\nsignificance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the Report of the United Nations, so I\r\n\r\nhope  the Government will not belittle it too much.\r\n\r\nIf  they think that the effect of the survey is too\r\n\r\nsmall,  they  can  come  and  help  make  it   more\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai mentioned the\r\n\r\nhousing development in Kampong Amber. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  add this. No doubt compensation is paid to  the\r\n\r\nsquatters, but it is not sufficient to find them  a\r\n\r\nnew  home. It may not be advisable, and  I  am  not\r\n\r\nhere trying to suggest that the Government stop the\r\n\r\ndevelopment - No! It may not be advisable  to  hinder\r\n\r\nprivate   efforts  in  development,  because   such\r\n\r\nefforts  do  help  to  ease  unemployment  and  the\r\n\r\nhousing  problem.  But  the poor  victims  of  such\r\n\r\ndevelopment  must  not be allowed  to  suffer.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  must help them to get new  homes;  they\r\n\r\ndeserve  this  after giving up their own  homes  in\r\n\r\norder that Singapore might be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, where labour is concerned, Sir, in column 20\r\n\r\nof the same Hansard, that is, Volume 20, No. 1, the\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid they hoped to \"build it modern industrial city\r\n\r\nout of Singapore\". May I remind them, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nsuccess of their industrialisation projects depends\r\n\r\non  labour  conditions in Singapore? If the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand  the Barisan Sosialis continue to interfere  in\r\n\r\ntrade unions and compete in encouraging strikes  in\r\n\r\norder to get the support of the trade unions,  then\r\n\r\nno amount of effort to industrialise Singapore will\r\n\r\nsucceed.  In  the  end, who will  suffer?  Not  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  not  the Barisan, not even the capitalists\r\n\r\nbecause  the capitalists have elsewhere  to  invest\r\n\r\ntheir money besides Singapore. It is the worker who\r\n\r\nwill  lose  his job if this goes on.  Trade  unions\r\n\r\nmust   be  left  alone  and  not  be  coerced   and\r\n\r\nintimidated  by  the  P.A.P. or  the  Barisan  into\r\n\r\nsupporting  them.  Psuedo advocates  of  unity  and\r\n\r\nfreedom for trade unions are now themselves causing\r\n\r\na  serious  split  in  the  trade  union  movement.\r\n\r\nEverybody  knows,  Sir,  today  there  is  a  clear\r\n\r\ndemarcation  within  the trade  union  movement - one\r\n\r\nside is the pro-P.A.P. trade unions, the other side\r\n\r\nis  the pro-Barisan trade unions. Whenever you talk\r\n\r\nabout  a  strike, they ask which, P.A.P. or Barisan\r\n\r\ntrade  union?  They  even  call  them  \"P.A.P.\"  or\r\n\r\n\"Barisan\"  trade unions.

I am\r\n\r\nnot  accusing them, Sir; I have heard them accusing\r\n\r\none  another, and I leave the world to judge  which\r\n\r\nthey are. It would be relevant here, Sir, for me to\r\n\r\nquote  what  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  said  in  his  speech  to   the   Grand\r\n\r\nAlliance. He said. \"A politician thinks of the next\r\n\r\nelection;   a   statesman  thinks   of   the   next\r\n\r\ngeneration.\"  Whether the P.A.P. and  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nthink  of  the next generation or the next election\r\n\r\nis for the world to judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, where finance is concerned, it is obvious to\r\n\r\nanyone reading column 7 of Hansard, Volume 20,  No.\r\n\r\n1,  that  the P.A.P. Finance Minister is a magician\r\n\r\nwho  just  has  to  wave his magic  wand,  and  hey\r\n\r\npresto!  the  money  in  the Treasury  begets  more\r\n\r\nmoney. But what is not so obvious, Sir, is that the\r\n\r\nmagic  wand  is  nothing but P.A.P. inactivity  for\r\n\r\nalmost  two years. No less than the Hon, the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  himself admits  that  in  Hansard.\r\n\r\nVolume 13, No. 6. Our Deputy Prime Minister said on\r\n\r\nthe 9th of August, 1960, in column 460:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The slowness - admittedly the Government was slow\r\n\r\nin getting housing development to start - was due to\r\n\r\nthe  depletion of technical staff and  the  haywire\r\n\r\nchanges  in building plans. A total of 79  \r\n\r\nmonthly-rated  staff  left the service of the  S.I.T.  They\r\n\r\nwere  dismissed, or they resigned, or they retired.\r\n\r\nAnd  of  these  79, 22 were senior  officers,  five\r\n\r\nbeing  heads of departments and five were heads  of\r\n\r\nsections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Deputy Prime Minister admitted the inactivity\r\n\r\nin  housing  development and he also  accepted  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility in column 461 for the fact that \"our\r\n\r\nhousing development programme has not got off to  a\r\n\r\nfine  start\". True, that was years ago!  But  there\r\n\r\nwere   two  years  of  inactivity,  and  the  money\r\n\r\nreserved  for that development has accumulated  and\r\n\r\nthat  has formed the magic wand that has made money\r\n\r\nbeget money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I must give credit to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance. I am prepared to respect his claim for\r\n\r\ncredit  for  having brought the  Treasury  to  this\r\n\r\nwealthy  state.  We  all know  he  is  a  brilliant\r\n\r\nFinance Minister and I give him credit. Although  I\r\n\r\ndid  say that the money has accumulated through two\r\n\r\nyears  of  inactivity, I do  give  him  credit  for\r\n\r\nbringing  Singapore into such a  wealthy  state  as\r\n\r\nthey  claim  it  is now. Singapore is  now  wealthy\r\n\r\nenough  to make, according to this Hansard,  Volume\r\n\r\n20,   No.  1,  contributions  in  loans  and  other\r\n\r\nassistance  to help develop the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\nDo  you  not think, Sir, that it is only  fair  and\r\n\r\njust that the Government should restore in full the\r\n\r\nmoney  which  has been \"illegally\"  -  Sir,  I  say\r\n\r\n\"illegally\" because not even a month's  notice  had\r\n\r\nbeen  given - illegally taken from the pay  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants  who  have given the best years  of  their\r\n\r\nlives  in  loyally serving the State of  Singapore?\r\n\r\nNow,  let  me make this very clear. I do  not  want\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have said twisted to mean my objection  to\r\n\r\nthe   Government   giving  help   to   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories. It is nothing of the sort. What  I  am\r\n\r\nsaying  is  this, I am appealing to the Government,\r\n\r\nto  borrow  a phrase of the Prime Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  when  he addressed the  Grand  Alliance\r\n\r\nrecently - this  is what he said - I am  appealing  to\r\n\r\nthem  to  \"see the elephant in front of their  eyes\r\n\r\nbefore  looking  for the needle across  the  seas.\"\r\n\r\nRemedy this great injustice that they have done  to\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  before  attempting  to  extend   a\r\n\r\nhelping  hand to others across the seas.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  good gesture to extend a helping hand:  I  am\r\n\r\nall for it. I say let us remedy this home injustice\r\n\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money is theirs by right, Sir. It was taken\r\n\r\naway   from   them  because  of  the   Government's\r\n\r\nmiscalculation and lack of foresight. Had they  the\r\n\r\nforesight to see the state of affairs we  would  be\r\n\r\nin  today,  probably the civil servants' pay  would\r\n\r\nnot  have  been  cut. The money  is  still  in  the\r\n\r\nTreasury, and it has helped to beget more money. It\r\n\r\nshould be returned to them in full now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No logical reason, Sir, can be given for\r\n\r\nreturning only part of that money. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhear  someone say in jest, \"... with interest\". That\r\n\r\nreminds me, the money has helped Government to gain\r\n\r\ninterest  on it, and the civil servants have  never\r\n\r\nasked  for interest. They have just asked  for  the\r\n\r\nmoney  that has been taken from them. They are  not\r\n\r\nasking for interest; they are pretty generous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could I end up with this? I say to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government: restore the pay cut in full  and\r\n\r\nthey  will get more goodwill and co-operation  from\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants than all the  dinners  at  Sri\r\n\r\nTamasek.

Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, regarding the\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Government as expressed by the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara  recently, I  am  glad  to  draw\r\n\r\nattention  to  that part of the speech  wherein  he\r\n\r\nsays Singapore has weathered the storm and that all\r\n\r\nis  now  calm and tranquil. But we must  always  be\r\n\r\nvigilant  because there are still some elements  in\r\n\r\nour  midst  who  are  actively  trying  to  disrupt\r\n\r\nnational  security  and  sabotage  our  plans   for\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am surprised that these anti-national elements are still against the establishment of Malaysia. Has the referendum not been held and has it not given a definite answer that the people of Singapore from all walks of life have decided how their future should be\r\n\r\nestablished?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must say in this Assembly, let this be a warning to all those anti-nationalist elements who wish to disrupt the unity of the Malaysian territories, because Malaysia is not for the Malays only, but also for the Chinese and for the peoples in the territories of Borneo\r\n\r\nand  from  various races. Malaysia is non-communal,\r\n\r\nas  has  been said by the Barisan Sosialis. If  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis try to flare up the flame -  and\r\n\r\nthey  are trying very hard to do this - then I  say\r\n\r\nit is possible this will mean loss of life and will\r\n\r\nresult   in  bloodshed.  There  have  been   enough\r\n\r\nexamples of this in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in Malaysia who adhere to\r\n\r\nforeign ideologies and who would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstand  by  Djakarta.  We are  firm  in  our  stand.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  people who are the  leaders  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring country, Indonesia, are people of  our\r\n\r\nown   kind   and   they   are   against   Malaysia,\r\n\r\nnevertheless we pay no heed to them at all  and  we\r\n\r\nwill proceed with Malaysia. So the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nshould  be  aware of this and consider  the  matter\r\n\r\nvery,   very  carefully,  because  to  be   against\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  to be against a nationalist  movement\r\n\r\namong  people  who have the same  outlook.  So,  if\r\n\r\nthere are still those elements within our midst who\r\n\r\nadhere to foreign ideologies - it is possible  that\r\n\r\nthey in their dislike for Commonwealth troops would\r\n\r\nprefer foreign troops - they should  not  dream\r\n\r\nthat  we will give them an opportunity to bring  in\r\n\r\nforeign  troops, who are tinted red, to look  after\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of these territories. I  myself.  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, will defend  my  homeland  no\r\n\r\nmatter  what happens.

One of their  leaders  asked  a\r\n\r\nseaman, \"Are you Lee Kuan Yew's man or Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman's? I asked that person, \"Did he ask  whether\r\n\r\nyou  are  Lim  Ching Siong's man?\" The  reply  was,\r\n\r\n\"No.\"  Mr  Speaker, that means  that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  do have an ulterior motive as  stated  by\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mr Speaker, I have made investigations\r\n\r\ninto  the  labour  movement before  and  after  the\r\n\r\nformation of the Barisan Sosialis who can  be  said\r\n\r\nto  have control of the leadership of S.A.T.U.  The\r\n\r\ninvestigations were in connection with the  workers\r\n\r\nin Shaw Brothers. As a leader of the people, as one\r\n\r\nwho  has the interest of the trade unions at heart,\r\n\r\nI  have found that all the statements published  in\r\n\r\nthe  papers  used  the name of the persons  without\r\n\r\ntheir  knowledge.  I  asked one  man.  \"During  the\r\n\r\nelection,  whom did you vote for?\" The answer  was,\r\n\r\n\"I voted for the P.A.P.\" I asked him, \"Why have you\r\n\r\nchanged  your  attitude now?\" The  reply  was  that\r\n\r\nbecause of the formation of Malaysia he was  forced\r\n\r\nto  vote  for  the  P.A.P. and  also  because  the\r\n\r\nstatements  given  to the Press  were  without  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  of the persons concerned. It is  certain\r\n\r\nthat   such  things  are  not  carried  out  in   a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  country; and the Barisan Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nused all these methods for their own interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the members present at that meeting, \"Are\r\n\r\nyou  or  are you not aware that you are all members\r\n\r\nof the unions under the administration of S.A.T.U.?\r\n\r\nDo  you know that the money you pay is used against\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.

I know  well\r\n\r\nthe  attitude  of the Barisan Sosialis  Members.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to explain in this Assembly. When I  was\r\n\r\nabout   to  have  discussions  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nMaritime  Employees' Federation  at  a  meeting,  I\r\n\r\nrecognised  who the Barisan Sosialis members  were.\r\n\r\nThey  were arrogant. They ignored us. They did  not\r\n\r\nwant  to speak to us. Are these the people who  are\r\n\r\nin  control? I am surprised why they have  such  an\r\n\r\nattitude. But we went with open hearts in order  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  matters which concerned the  workers.  But\r\n\r\nthey showed their true colours. They were angry and\r\n\r\nthey  did  not care for us. They wanted to  discuss\r\n\r\nbetween themselves and the employees only. And this\r\n\r\nis  their  attitude, which I know. It has  been  an\r\n\r\nexample to me and I must be careful about what I do\r\n\r\nwhen  I meet such people. I hope we have noted  the\r\n\r\ntrue  character  of  the  Central  Control  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker. I fully agree with the findings of the Prime Minister on the wishes of the Member for Anson in order to inquire into the position of the labourers, whether they want to know who will sit in the labour unions, people who wish to bring in foreigners, or people who are working against this ideal. It is time that this\r\n\r\nmatter be settled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker. I am rather concerned now about the working of the S.A.T.U. group. As we know, the S.A.T.U. group, as published in the Working Paper, have not been registered, and since they have not been registered, why have the Government given them the opportunity to exist? I am surprised. It is not that I want to defend the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government at this time. With regard to  the\r\n\r\naccusation  thrown  against the P.A.P.  Government,\r\n\r\nnamely,  that  democracy does  not  exist  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  it is clear that the body which  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  registered is, according to the  law,  wrong.\r\n\r\nThe  law  says  it is wrong, but it is  allowed  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on.  Does that mean that democracy  is  \r\n\r\nnon-existent? I therefore hope that the group that  has\r\n\r\nbeen twisting all the statements should be careful.\r\n\r\nI  say  this  because there will be a time  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  when I believe a change will take place  in\r\n\r\nthe  labour  movement; because the  workers  today,\r\n\r\nwhether Chinese or Malays, are still influenced  by\r\n\r\na  number of people who can speak, and who speak so\r\n\r\nthat  they can influence these people. But the time\r\n\r\nhas  conic,  I believe, when especially the  Malays\r\n\r\nwill  rise - I  am  not bringing up the  question  of\r\n\r\ncommunalism  - but they are aware that they  have  a\r\n\r\nduty :o participate in the controlling body of  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement both in Singapore  and  throughout\r\n\r\nthe Federation. We cannot allow this opportunity to\r\n\r\npass to a number of adventurers who try to make use\r\n\r\nof  us  for purposes of election or to grab  power.\r\n\r\nThere is current today a new sense of awareness and\r\n\r\nwe  bear it in our bodies. It is not that we do not\r\n\r\nbelieve in centralised control of trade unions, but\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  want them to use this opportunity  for\r\n\r\nbettering  their  own position  or  for  any  other\r\n\r\nmotives. That, Mr Deputy Speaker, is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  far  as I can say here which can be of guidance\r\n\r\nto the people concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question of housing, I feel\r\n\r\nproud  and  satisfied  with  the  ability  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to increase the number of houses in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of its administration of the country.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  able to state, but I hope the Government  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to clarify when the Malay Settlement  will\r\n\r\nbe  divided  and  allocated to the people  who  are\r\n\r\nentitled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I appeal to the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider  the position of the people who under  the\r\n\r\npresent  policy of Government cannot get  aid  from\r\n\r\nthe.  Social  Welfare Department. Until  today  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore who do not have families do not\r\n\r\nget  aid  from the said Department because they  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  dependants. But we should remember  that\r\n\r\nthey are the people of Singapore just the same, and\r\n\r\nare   entitled  to  receive  aid  when   they   are\r\n\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I appeal to the Government and to the\r\n\r\nrespective   Ministries  to  review  the   position\r\n\r\nregarding   the  traders  and  hawkers,  especially\r\n\r\nroadside  operators alt night markets.  Within  the\r\n\r\nKembangan  area,  Jalan Eunos,  the  road  is  very\r\n\r\nsmall,  and  on every Friday night when  there  are\r\n\r\nnight markets all traffic along that road cannot go\r\n\r\nthrough  safely, and it is very dangerous.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  authorities  concerned will take  this  as  an\r\n\r\nexample  so  that  all night markets  are  allotted\r\n\r\nfixed  and  proper places where there is  not  much\r\n\r\ntraffic in order to avoid accidents and danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also cases which I have brought to the\r\n\r\nMinistry  concerned, namely, that  hawkers'  unions\r\n\r\ndemand  coffee money from hawkers who cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  pay  it.  Because of this, the opportunity  for\r\n\r\nthose  people to hawk is nil. I believe this matter\r\n\r\nis   within   the   knowledge  of  the   respective\r\n\r\nauthorities, and I hope they are able to  help  all\r\n\r\nparties concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, on behalf of the Opposition group, I am\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the Government once again  in  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  fulfilled 100 per cent of  the  appeals\r\n\r\nthat come from my constituency, and although \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am responsible to my constituency I appeal\r\n\r\nto  the Government particularly not to forget other\r\n\r\nconstituencies,   although   those   constituencies\r\n\r\nrepresent Parties that the Government do  not  like\r\n\r\nespecially  in  Kampong  Ayer  Gemuroh  and  Padang\r\n\r\nTerbakar where all essential requirements are  very\r\n\r\nlittle.  I  hope the Government can look into  this\r\n\r\nmatter  so that the residents in that area  can  be\r\n\r\nsaid  to  have their own father and will  get  full\r\n\r\nattention. That is more or less all that I can  say\r\n\r\nin this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thank the Government for taking a great\r\n\r\ninterest  in  matters which I have brought  to  its\r\n\r\nnotice,  including the appeals  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nKampong  Amber,  where  the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  has  already  carried  out  its   work\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have one matter\r\n\r\nwith which I am not satisfied. That is the question\r\n\r\nof  building  drains in Kampong Kembangan.  I  find\r\n\r\nthere are about 200 houses or families who will  be\r\n\r\nthe  victims.  I hope the Government  will  try  to\r\n\r\ncarry out other plans to deepen the existing drains\r\n\r\nso  that the occupants of the houses who have taken\r\n\r\nthe   trouble  to  build  these  houses   are   not\r\n\r\ninconvenienced and that their houses  will  not  be\r\n\r\ndemolished, because that would become a big problem\r\n\r\nboth to me and to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, there are one or\r\n\r\ntwo  points which I wish to bring to the  attention\r\n\r\nof the House. The Prime Minister in his speech said\r\n\r\nthat  private  enterprise, so far  as  building  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  concerned,  was  estimated  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to contribute at least 6,000  units  per\r\n\r\nannum during the course of the ensuing year. And  I\r\n\r\nwish  to bring to the notice of the House a problem\r\n\r\nwhich  intensive  private development  is  bringing\r\n\r\nabout in Singapore, and, unless it is checked, will\r\n\r\nlead  to  great difficulties in the future. Private\r\n\r\ndevelopment now confines itself to building\r\n\r\nmulti-storey  flats  to a very large extent  and  selling\r\n\r\neach  of these flats to people in the middle income\r\n\r\ngroups.  Now, it raises a problem of management  of\r\n\r\nthese houses, a problem of ownership\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the future, and the problem of maintenance  and\r\n\r\nupkeep of these flats and of the block in which the\r\n\r\nflats  are situated. The Housing Board builds these\r\n\r\nflats and lets them out to private individuals. But\r\n\r\nwhile  they are let out, the Housing Board sees  to\r\n\r\nit  that  the  passages and stairways are  properly\r\n\r\nmaintained,  lighted and looked after.  So  far  as\r\n\r\nthese  private flats are concerned,  they  arc  now\r\n\r\nbeing  sold  by  the hundreds to the middle  income\r\n\r\ngroup  people. The private developer is  a  private\r\n\r\nlimited  company. The point I wish to  stress,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, is this: that these are all private\r\n\r\nlimited  companies,  and in the  conveyances  which\r\n\r\nthey  give to the purchasers of these flats,  these\r\n\r\ncompanies    give   certain   covenants,    certain\r\n\r\nundertakings to the purchasers of these flats, such\r\n\r\nas that they would maintain the stairways, see that\r\n\r\nthey are lighted, that they are repaired and so  on\r\n\r\nand so forth, which makes it possible for the\r\n\r\nflat-dwellers to enjoy living in those flats. Now it has\r\n\r\nalready  come  to  our notice that  some  of  these\r\n\r\nprivate limited companies which started, say, five\r\n\r\nor   six   years  previous  to  today  have   wound\r\n\r\nthemselves  up. They have wound themselves  up  and\r\n\r\ndisappeared  from the scene and have ceased  to  be\r\n\r\nlegal entities. `The net result now is that some of\r\n\r\nthe  people who bought the houses from them do  not\r\n\r\nhave  anybody against whom they can proceed in case\r\n\r\nthe covenants they have undertaken to carry out are\r\n\r\nnot implemented. But if it is a private person, you\r\n\r\ncan  either  go against him or against his  estate.\r\n\r\nBut if it is a private limited company and once  it\r\n\r\ngoes  into  liquidation, it ceases  to  exist,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  nobody against whom you can  proceed.  I\r\n\r\nbring  this  problem to the attention of Government\r\n\r\nwho  are  now taking a liberal view with regard  to\r\n\r\nhouses which are owner-occupied. I think one of the\r\n\r\nresults  of  that attitude is going to be  an  even\r\n\r\nmore  intensive  development of  flats  by  private\r\n\r\ncompanies with a view to idling them to the  middle\r\n\r\nincome groups. My own view, Mr Deputy Speaker,  is\r\n\r\nthat  these private limited companies which  go  in\r\n\r\nfor  housing  development should be  treated  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent category, and separate legislation should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  brought about whereby they could be kept  under\r\n\r\nproper  control, so that these middle income  group\r\n\r\npurchasers, in five or ten years' time, will not be\r\n\r\nleft  high  and  dry with their stairways  rotting,\r\n\r\ntheir  roofs  leaking, and all  the  covenants  not\r\n\r\nbeing  able  to be implemented. That is  the  first\r\n\r\npoint  I  thought I should bring to the  notice  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point, Mr Deputy Speaker, on which I\r\n\r\nwish  to address the House is the question  of  the\r\n\r\nwater  supply  of  Singapore, on  which  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister spoke. The Prime Minister has indicated in\r\n\r\nhis  speech that during the last three years  there\r\n\r\nhas  been an increase of 9 million gallons  in  the\r\n\r\nconsumption  of water, so that the yearly  increase\r\n\r\nat the moment is 3 million gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has given figures that the consumption of water today is 73 million gallons per day. He has also indicated that so far as Tebrau is concerned, he can get a maximum intake into Singapore of 45 million gallons per day, and that the rest of the water supply for every day conies from the impounding reservoirs. He has also\r\n\r\nindicated  that in the impounding reservoirs  there\r\n\r\nis  only  54  per cent of the maximum  supply.  The\r\n\r\nposition,  to  my  mind, is  a  very  serious  one,\r\n\r\nparticularly as the Government is pressing on  with\r\n\r\nthe  building  of flats. The more  flats  that  are\r\n\r\nbuilt, the more water will be consumed. And if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  builds another 12,000 houses,  as  they\r\n\r\nsay  they  will,  then  the consumption  will  most\r\n\r\nassuredly rise beyond 3 million gallons next  year.\r\n\r\nIf the scheme in Jurong materialises in the way the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance hopes that it will, and if the\r\n\r\nsteel mill in Jurong goes up, in the way we hope it\r\n\r\nwill,  the  steel mill alone will account  for  one\r\n\r\nmillion gallons per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has suggested that it wil1 build\r\n\r\nsome sort of a natural reservoir in Jurong. How far\r\n\r\nthat  project  has  progressed Government  has  not\r\n\r\ninformed us, although schemes are afoot, it  seems.\r\n\r\nWhether  the  reservoir will  be  in  readiness  to\r\n\r\nreceive  the steel mill is another matter.  All  in\r\n\r\nall,  Mr Deputy Speaker, the position with  regard\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  water supply is a very grave one, and I regret\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government does not seem  to  be  unduly\r\n\r\nworried about the position, because it seems to  be\r\n\r\ntaking  its time over augmenting our water  supply.\r\n\r\nIt has started a scheme at Scudai, and it says that\r\n\r\nunder the Scudai scheme it hopes to get in about 15\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons per day. It says that  that  river\r\n\r\nwill be brought into operation, so far as our water\r\n\r\nsupply is concerned, towards the end of next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the position with regard to Scudai and\r\n\r\nTebrau  is this: these two rivers are tidal  rivers\r\n\r\nand  they are subject to a dry weather flow  and  a\r\n\r\nwet  weather flow. When the Prime Minister says  he\r\n\r\ncan get a maximum of 45 million gallons per day,  I\r\n\r\nthink  what  he really means to tell the  House  is\r\n\r\nthat from the river at its wettest, he will get  45\r\n\r\nmillion gallons per day. But when Tebrau is at  its\r\n\r\ndriest,  he cannot get more than 10 million gallons\r\n\r\nper  day. Similarly Scudai is also subject to a dry\r\n\r\nand wet weather flow, and when it is at its driest,\r\n\r\nhe  cannot get from it more than 5 million  gallons\r\n\r\nper day. Assume a very dry season, such as we might\r\n\r\nrun  into in the course of the next few months, the\r\n\r\nresult  will  be that even with Tebrau  and  Scudai\r\n\r\nworking to its full dry weather capacity, we  could\r\n\r\nhave  a  water shortage in Singapore, and we  will,\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker. I regret very much  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is not pressing on as fast  as  it  can\r\n\r\nwith the Johore River scheme, and I regret that the\r\n\r\nfirst  intake  from the Johore River, according  to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister, will not be  until  the  year\r\n\r\n1967,  which is 4 years away. Unless and  until  we\r\n\r\ncan  get to Johore as quickly as possible, we shall\r\n\r\nalways  be faced with the danger of a water shortage\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  Nobody likes to predict  ill,  but,\r\n\r\nunless  we  get to the Johore River as  quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible,  we will always be faced with the  danger\r\n\r\nof a shortage of water supply during the dry season\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  The  dry season in  Singapore  also\r\n\r\ncoincides  with  the dry season  in  the  south  of\r\n\r\nJohore where these two rivers are situate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to raise, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  is a matter raised by the leader  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan,  the Member for Queenstown.  Sir,  he  has\r\n\r\nindicated  to  the House how strongly  he  and  his\r\n\r\nParty  support  the parliamentary system  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  adopted in Singapore. One of the basic things\r\n\r\non  which parliamentary democracy rests is that  we\r\n\r\nmust  accept  the verdict of the majority.  Let  us\r\n\r\nfight  as  hard  as we can until  that  verdict  is\r\n\r\ndelivered, but once the verdict has been delivered,\r\n\r\nthen,  however  hard we might have  objected,  how'\r\n\r\never  hard  we have fought against it, I  think  we\r\n\r\nmust accept the verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the referendum, on the\r\n\r\nquestion of Malay sin, the Barisan were entitled to\r\n\r\nfight  as hard as they could, and they fought  very\r\n\r\nhard  indeed. They have lost the battle, they  have\r\n\r\nlast  the  fight.  And  I do  ask  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  and his followers in this  House -  that\r\n\r\nthe verdict having been delivered by the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   after   a   hard   contest,   as   good\r\n\r\nparliamentarians,  they  should  now   accept   the\r\n\r\nverdict, and not lead Singapore to bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, on  the  policy  speech\r\n\r\ndelivered by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  both  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Party and the Opposition  Parties  have\r\n\r\nexpressed their views, if they say that there is no\r\n\r\ndemocracy in Singapore, no freedom of speech,  then\r\n\r\nthey are blind or they are out of their minds.  Let\r\n\r\nus   examine  the  arguments  put  forth   by   the\r\n\r\nOpposition Parties. Of course, they come  from  the\r\n\r\nvarious different Parties, but all of them  have  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  grouses,  hut  when  we  ask  them  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething, they cannot do it. Therefore,  they  are\r\n\r\nforced  to make use of this Assembly as a forum  to\r\n\r\nvoice their grouses. The contents of their speeches\r\n\r\nare nothing more than abuses or boasting. We have a\r\n\r\nstrange   phenomenon  today  among  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties - there is one common feature. In all  their\r\n\r\nspeeches  they have not been able to deny that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have done\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsomething  for  the people and they have  not  been\r\n\r\nable  to deny that we, the P.A.P., have done a  lot\r\n\r\nfor  the  people. This is worthy of our  attention.\r\n\r\nWhy  do they not say the P.A.P. is incompetent? Why\r\n\r\ndo  they  not accuse the Government of not building\r\n\r\nbridges,  roads,  schools  and  hospitals  for  the\r\n\r\npeople?  Why can they not, on behalf of the people,\r\n\r\nput  forward constructive schemes to better the lot\r\n\r\nof  the  people? Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir,  we  know\r\n\r\nthat the Members in the Opposition Parties have all\r\n\r\nalong  professed to be the representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople but they have not suggested any constructive\r\n\r\nschemes to improve the lot of the people. There are\r\n\r\nsome  neighbouring  countries  which  claim  to  be\r\n\r\nprogressive,  that  they are trying  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard of living of the people by providing  them\r\n\r\nwith  food  and  clothing.  Now,  when  we  compare\r\n\r\nSingapore with these countries, we can see that the\r\n\r\nstandard  of living of the people here is far,  far\r\n\r\nhigher  than it is there. Opposition Party  Members\r\n\r\nhave  seen the achievements of the P.A.P.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  they have not been able to criticise the  work\r\n\r\nof the Government. They know full well that all the\r\n\r\nschemes carried out by the Government are aimed  at\r\n\r\ntrying  to  improve  the  living  standard  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  building of bridges and repairing  of\r\n\r\nroads   will  go  towards  improving  their  living\r\n\r\nstandard.  The Members in the Opposition are  blind\r\n\r\nto  all  these facts. What the Government has  been\r\n\r\ndoing  is to bring a better life to the people.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Government  builds another outpatient  clinic,\r\n\r\nthis  will benefit the people not only in the urban\r\n\r\narea but also in the rural area. People who are ill\r\n\r\ncan  get treatment from this clinic, and they  will\r\n\r\nsave a lot of time and energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with more police stations the crime situation\r\n\r\nhas improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the elected Government, we have many problems\r\n\r\nto  solve.  If  you  do  not  talk  about  bringing\r\n\r\nelectricity  and water to the people, you  have  to\r\n\r\nsolve the problem of employment for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961 the Government started carrying out the\r\n\r\nFour-Year Development Plan. When these projects are\r\n\r\ncompleted,  in  conjunction with the  other \r\n\r\nsmall-scale industrial projects, they will bring more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities to the people.

Can we  live\r\n\r\non slogans alone?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one paragraph in the speech of the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown yesterday which merits  our\r\n\r\nattention.  He  said the open rebellion  in  Brunei\r\n\r\nwill  lead  to guerilla warfare. Now, if  we  study\r\n\r\nclosely his speech, we will know that he has  shown\r\n\r\nhis  true  colours. Although they have  been  quiet\r\n\r\nafter the referendum, today they are trying to  ape\r\n\r\nthe  cocks  in Bali Island, to recover  their  past\r\n\r\nglory. Only people with foresight can conceive  the\r\n\r\nidea   of  Malaysia.  Only  people  who  have   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the people at heart will  appreciate\r\n\r\nthe importance of national unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has warned the people\r\n\r\nthat a constitutional struggle is possible only  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  avenues for a constitutional  struggle,\r\n\r\notherwise  the people will resort to  other  means.\r\n\r\nThe  people  will  clearly understand  what  he  is\r\n\r\ntalking  about.

In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I listened to\r\n\r\nhim, my admiration grew for the iron discipline and\r\n\r\nthe  dedication to duty which permitted him to read\r\n\r\nthrough reams of praise for pigs and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a policy document, Sir, the speech which was\r\n\r\nprepared  for  him  to read - the  last  speech  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will ever prepare - was the crowing of a cock\r\n\r\non a dunghill. The dishonesty of that policy speech\r\n\r\nlies  not only in its drooling self-praise, hut  is\r\n\r\nparticularly noticeable for the remarkable omission\r\n\r\nto explain the major inroad into the rule of law in\r\n\r\nthe  arrest  of 133 persons during a period  which,\r\n\r\naccording  to the policy statement of  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nwas  characterised by \"peace and tranquility\". That\r\n\r\nis their phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the arrests were under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance, a measure passed to meet emergency situations endangering the security of the State. I am not interested in scoring a debating point. I know it might be amusing to go back to Hansard in the days when the Government were in the Opposition and to\r\n\r\nquote their many statements about the P.P.S.O. and\r\n\r\nwhat   a  dreadful  measure  it  was  that  I   had\r\n\r\nintroduced. Nor is it necessary to go back  to  the\r\n\r\ndays  when in 1959 the Government extended the life\r\n\r\nof  the P.P.S.O. by five years - this Government, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government, together with the gentlemen  and\r\n\r\nthe  ladies  on the Barisan Sosialis  side,  and  a\r\n\r\nlittle to their left where the leader is missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic, Sir, that these people who\r\n\r\nsupported  the  extension  and -  never   mind   the\r\n\r\nextension, it may have been necessary and  probably\r\n\r\nwas - who supported the removal of the protection of\r\n\r\nthe Judges from it, now complain of suffering under\r\n\r\nit.  If  they had had the respect for human  beings\r\n\r\nthat was embodied in that Ordinance, they would not\r\n\r\nhave  been screaming today about the abuse,  as  in\r\n\r\nfact it is an abuse, of these provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, you have been told blatantly that the\r\n\r\nPreservation  of  Public Security Ordinance,  which\r\n\r\nwas  intended  for emergency situations,  is  being\r\n\r\nused in a period of peace and tranquility. What  is\r\n\r\nthe  excuse  for this action? There is an  indirect\r\n\r\nreference  in the policy statement to the \"decision\r\n\r\nof  the Internal Security Council to remove persons\r\n\r\nactive in a Communist united front conspiracy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, that is a cowardly phrase. Constitutionally it is the duty of this Government to govern in Singapore and decisions under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance are decisions of the Government. It is true that under our Constitution the Internal Security Council has power to issue orders to the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.  That power was not exercised, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nThere  was  no  order  from the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.  The order came from this Government,  and\r\n\r\nit  is cowardly to seek to hide behind the skirt of\r\n\r\nthe  Internal Security Council. You will  no  doubt\r\n\r\nremember  how I foresaw just this type of manoeuvre\r\n\r\nwhen  I  fought  the  provisions  of  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council  in the Constitution  many  years\r\n\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the statement issued by the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council, and the most interesting part  of\r\n\r\nit  is  that nowhere is there any direct indication\r\n\r\nor  allegation  of  a threat of imminent  violence;\r\n\r\nnowhere  in  that document, and, consequently,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, no right to exercise emergency powers  for\r\n\r\nan emergency situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, there is a motion; the\r\n\r\nnext motion will deal with this particular subject.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it would not be in order for the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson then to deal with this matter rather than\r\n\r\non  a broad motion on a general statement of policy\r\n\r\nof the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was listening to the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson very carefully.

I wish that were true. But\r\n\r\nI  say  it is but an act of cowardice of trying  to\r\n\r\npass  the  buck. There will be no solution  to  the\r\n\r\nissue  of attracting the loyalty of a vast  segment\r\n\r\nof the population in Singapore to the traditions of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and to a sense of unity within ourselves\r\n\r\nand  within  Malaysia except  with  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. If we, the people of Singapore,  do  not\r\n\r\nfind the solution, Kuala Lumpur will not be a great\r\n\r\nhelp. Sure they can arrest; so can this Government,\r\n\r\nas it has proved, arresting people and calling them\r\n\r\nsubversives. Mr Speaker, there are times  when  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  to  take sharp  measures  for  one's\r\n\r\nhealth, but there are times, as one does in a  case\r\n\r\nof  surgery,  when  sharp  measures  can  kill  the\r\n\r\npatient,  not cure him. It is easy to  call  people\r\n\r\nsubversives,  to  damn  them  as  Communists.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  know myself that I am as Communist  as\r\n\r\nthe Pope, but that has not prevented the Government\r\n\r\nand, its stooges, it has not prevented malice, from\r\n\r\nseeking  to  paint me red. I speak from experience.\r\n\r\nWe  have  heard the Government seek to connect  the\r\n\r\nghastly tragedy of that criminal folly in Brunei as\r\n\r\nan excuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You supported them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, you see, I am glad you\r\n\r\nare  elsewhere  engaged.  Their  falsehoods,  their\r\n\r\ndishonesty - oh,  but  why  talk  of   it,   we   are\r\n\r\naccustomed  to  it  every day.  The  Workers  Party\r\n\r\nissued  a  statement soon after the  Brunei  revolt\r\n\r\ncondemning  it in no uncertain terms,  and  it  was\r\n\r\npublished  for  a change; but two  of  the  Workers\r\n\r\nParty members, who are no friends of mine - at least\r\n\r\nnot   politically - find   themselves   amongst   the\r\n\r\ndetainees.  They were not at any time  publicly  or\r\n\r\notherwise  associated  in  supporting  the   Brunei\r\n\r\nRevolt.  Mr  Speaker, the tragedy of Singapore  is\r\n\r\nthat we have inherited the results of the omissions\r\n\r\nof   the  Imperial  Government  in  the  field   of\r\n\r\neducation, seeking not to have income tax  so  that\r\n\r\nthe over-worked expatriate may have enough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofits  and his directors at home may have  enough\r\n\r\ncream.  We had no education policy other  than  the\r\n\r\npolicy of having a few English-speaking clerks  for\r\n\r\nthe  commercial machine, and a few Malay peons; and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the vast Chinese community had  to  fall\r\n\r\nupon  its  own resources through charity,  to  give\r\n\r\neducation to its own youth. A youth that  has  been\r\n\r\nbrought up to Chinese language naturally seeks  and\r\n\r\nis inclined towards mainland China for its cultural\r\n\r\npatterns and for its thinking. At no time  have  we\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  really made an effort to  give  this\r\n\r\nyouth hope and a meaning in the future. They are in\r\n\r\na  spiritual vacuum, Mr Speaker, and though it  is\r\n\r\nregrettable,  it  is  by  no  means  difficult   to\r\n\r\nunderstand.  In that vacuum are to be found  echoes\r\n\r\nof  the  ways of thought which are now  current  in\r\n\r\nmainland  China  and  we find what  I  have  termed\r\n\r\n\"Peking  Parrots\",  net  Communists  as  such,  not\r\n\r\nunderstanding    what   they   are    doing,    not\r\n\r\nunderstanding  the realities of  the  situation  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own territory, but \"Peking Parrots\"  echoing\r\n\r\nweakly,  without understanding, a line  of  thought\r\n\r\nwhich happens to be the vogue in mainland China  at\r\n\r\nany    material   time,   not   with   any   malice\r\n\r\naforethought,  Sir,  on  the  part  of   the   vast\r\n\r\nmajority,  but because they have nothing else.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  far  from being lost to us,  I  say  with\r\n\r\nrespect  that  we  can fill that  vacuum  with  the\r\n\r\nvalues of the ideals of democracy, with a sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging  to Malaysia, a sense of unity  with  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  races.  We must act  with  patience  and\r\n\r\nhuman   wisdom,   respect   for   human   failings,\r\n\r\nrecognition   that  it  is  through  patience   and\r\n\r\nperseverance  that  one can  win  through,  not  by\r\n\r\nabusing  and maligning them perpetually. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  his hysterical efforts  to  save  his\r\n\r\nParty  from  doom,  which is its due, has  divided\r\n\r\nSingapore into two - the subversives and \"the rest\".\r\n\r\nAnd  that  is  the  evil which  they  now  make  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us to inherit. An evil  perpetrated\r\n\r\nfor  no  other  purpose  than  the  survival  of  a\r\n\r\npolitical Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have failed, and I will say this for the P.A.P. - I will not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay  for  all of them, but I will say for  some  of\r\n\r\nthem - that there are and there have been efforts  on\r\n\r\ntheir part - as there have been efforts on the part\r\n\r\nof  others  - sincere efforts to seek  to  bring  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of the democratic  process, of  the\r\n\r\nvalues  and virtues of democracy, of the  unity  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore to the Chinese  youth  and\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese industrial workers. And it is true  we\r\n\r\nhave  failed,  but it has only been a short  period\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  sought  to bridge  this  gulf  that\r\n\r\ndivides  us  culturally and educationally.  However\r\n\r\noften we fail, even more often must we try, because\r\n\r\nif   we  are  to  admit  failure,  like  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  and  divide Singapore into  two  unequal\r\n\r\nparts,  that will be the end not only of those  who\r\n\r\nare not of our way of thinking but it will also  be\r\n\r\nthe  end of us - the people of Singapore. The conduct\r\n\r\nof   this  Government  has  not  been  helpful   in\r\n\r\nattracting the loyalty and respect of this  segment\r\n\r\nof our population to the democratic process. I say,\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  that  it  is  bad  policy  to  keep\r\n\r\nattacking our Chinese youth and industrial  workers\r\n\r\nas  Communists. Not only is it bad policy but it is\r\n\r\nalso not true. These are our fellow citizens and  I\r\n\r\nam  not prepared to condemn them and to slough them\r\n\r\noff  and  to cleave to the new peoples of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthrowing  away these fellow citizens who  form  the\r\n\r\nmajor part of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is astonishing too that the policy statement has not seen fit to contain at least some indication of the tragedy of the conditions of detention which have been imposed on these people, conditions which have been made public, and which I repeat, Sir, are far worse than\r\n\r\nanything perpetrated by the Imperial Government  or\r\n\r\nby any previous Government. I do not intend to seek\r\n\r\nto  shock  you tonight. I received with a sense  of\r\n\r\nhope   yesterday  the  assurance  from  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  that  he would allow a  delegate  of  the\r\n\r\nInternational Red Cross to investigate  conditions.\r\n\r\nI  know  what  that means, that  by  the  time  the\r\n\r\ndelegate   gets   here  or  gets  the   invitation,\r\n\r\nconditions  will have improved to an  extent  which\r\n\r\nwill  make it bearable for the detainees; and  that\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  enough for me.

It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  decided  by  this House that  the  Referendum\r\n\r\nOrdinance  should pass into law and it  has  passed\r\n\r\ninto law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I say infamous law, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Passing on to the falsehoods  that\r\n\r\nhave  been  perpetrated in your  presence  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse   by   Government  Ministers   in   answering\r\n\r\nquestions  as  to the conditions of detainees,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, these people have the impudence to talk of\r\n\r\nintegrity!  I  say  to  you  that  it   will   take\r\n\r\ngenerations  for  Singapore  to  recover  from  the\r\n\r\ntraditions of political dishonesty which the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  displayed.  Mr  Speaker,  much  that  I  find\r\n\r\nrepugnant  in this policy statement,  I  find  that\r\n\r\nnevertheless  I am in no position to  vote  against\r\n\r\nit,  because I am certainly not going to  vote  for\r\n\r\nthe  amendment. I, Mr Speaker, have no regret that\r\n\r\nthe  Government did not keep its promises. I  never\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  it  would.  I  can  understand  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis regretting and the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  and  his colleague regretting. They belong  to\r\n\r\nthe  group.  Maybe they were taken in.  I  was  not\r\n\r\ntaken in, Mr Speaker, Sir, I knew they would welsh\r\n\r\nand  they  have  welshed. How can I regret  what  I\r\n\r\nanticipated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there will be no question of my voting for the amendment. As for voting against the motion itself, Mr Speaker, I mention this only in passing, since some Members seem to be unaware that it is an act constitutionally of discourtesy even to seek a division on the motion of thanks, that an attempt to defeat it should be made on any\r\n\r\namendment  before the House which may be acceptable\r\n\r\nto  Opposition  Members, but once those  amendments\r\n\r\nhave  been  defeated and the main motion is  before\r\n\r\nthe  House, whatever one might think of the speech,\r\n\r\nlet  us  remember that the motion is  a  motion  of\r\n\r\nthanks  to His Excellency and nobody should refrain\r\n\r\nfrom that gesture of thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

You will recollect, Sir, that yesterday,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Hong Lim in his speech quite rightly\r\n\r\navoided making any judgment on the achievements  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. insofar as they were referred to them in\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech. He  confined\r\n\r\nhimself  quite wisely to making an election  speech\r\n\r\nin  which he appealed to all groups, as the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson has done today, because this is the first\r\n\r\ntime  I  have  seen the Member for An-son  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber disavowing the Barisan Sosialis for whom he\r\n\r\nhas  acted as adviser and back-room boy until  now.\r\n\r\nBut now he knows that the Barisan Sosialis is going\r\n\r\ndown  and  that new masters are coming up  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  has quite wisely  made  certain\r\n\r\nobeisance to the Federation Government. This  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  a  person, Sir, who has in his lifetime  lost\r\n\r\nthree political parties which have been stolen from\r\n\r\nunder his nose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Three?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Then you will remember the occasion\r\n\r\nwhen  he was in the Labour Party but prior to  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  talk of his forming a Socialist  Party,\r\n\r\nand  it  eventually ended up as the  Labour  Front.\r\n\r\nThen  he  had  the Workers' Party and  we  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber  advised  him that his Workers'  Party  was\r\n\r\nbeing  divided.  He refused to accept  our  warning\r\n\r\nthat if he was not careful the carpet was going  to\r\n\r\nbe  pulled away from under his feet. But now he has\r\n\r\ndecided the best way to play this game is to make a\r\n\r\nbid for the remnants of the Barisan Sosialis if and\r\n\r\nwhen  it  comes  a  cropper. In fact,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  quite  well  aware that if not the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson at least the Member for Hong Lim is making  a\r\n\r\nbid  to  inherit the revolution and in fact in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  issue of the Plebeian of 21st March,  1963,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Queenstown in an article  entitled\r\n\r\n\"Socialism will be Victorious\" said this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As for the leader of a certain political party,\r\n\r\nDr  Lee  said, like what Lee Kuan Yew  said,  this\r\n\r\nperson was waiting for the arrests of all Left-wing\r\n\r\nleaders so that he could come out and pose  as  the\r\n\r\nLeft-wing leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee said, \"If the person [that is the Member for Hong Lim] is really anti-colonial, we will sincerely welcome him to our ranks.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim is quite bright; he knows\r\n\r\nthat  if  he joins their ranks he is also finished.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Dr Lee said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But we will not tolerate him if his Party organ\r\n\r\nsmeared  and  jeered at our comrades  who  are  now\r\n\r\nunder  detention.  We will attack all  opportunists\r\n\r\nand support all anti-colonialists.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  the Member for Anson, like the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  too, is expounding the cause of the detainees.\r\n\r\nHe  has  been engaged, I think, in a duel  with  my\r\n\r\nPolitical   Secretary  over   the   conditions   of\r\n\r\ndetainees, because if they stand up for  the  issue\r\n\r\nof  detainees  now, then they hope  that  when  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis comes a cropper they will inherit\r\n\r\nthe  revolution. We can tell the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nthat  he  who has not been able to look  after  two\r\n\r\nsmall political Parties will not be able to inherit\r\n\r\nthe  revolution  from the Communists.  So  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest to him that he should rather play the  role\r\n\r\nof  an observer and an independent socialist, as  I\r\n\r\nhope he would be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think neither the Member for Anson nor the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim does really matter when the big\r\n\r\nbattle starts, because I think the real force  here\r\n\r\nis  the  Barisan Sosialis. Listening to the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis amateur revolutionaries, I could not  help\r\n\r\nnoticing  that they were this time like  bewildered\r\n\r\nsheep  bleating for their lost shepherds. At  least\r\n\r\non  previous occasions when they had their  battery\r\n\r\nof  ghost-writers, they had scripts which at  least\r\n\r\nmade them sound like militant and confident cheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, in particular, gave a\r\n\r\ncreditable performance of a leader who was  leading\r\n\r\nhis  Party  towards recognizable goals-that  is  in\r\n\r\nthose days-even though the more perceptive among us\r\n\r\nknew  that  he was being remotely controlled.  This\r\n\r\ntime,  I  must however congratulate the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown for making a speech that sounded for the\r\n\r\nmost  part  like the Member for Queenstown.  Though\r\n\r\nthe  broad lines of policy have been laid down  for\r\n\r\nhim  by  others,  I  could not  help  feeling  that\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the lines was his own; it has all\r\n\r\nthe  hallmarks  of authenticity; it  was  confused,\r\n\r\nillogical,  groping and, of course, hilarious.  For\r\n\r\nthe most part, the speeches of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers  consisted of repetitions of what they  had\r\n\r\nsaid  in this Chamber and outside for the last  two\r\n\r\nyears.  We  had, Sir, the same old arguments  about\r\n\r\nphoney  merger, about genuine reunification,  about\r\n\r\nMalaysia  being  a  British  plot  and  about   the\r\n\r\ndishonest  referendum. I would  have  thought  that\r\n\r\nafter  his  hazardous and expensive trip to  London\r\n\r\nand  after having sat at the feet of Mr John Eber,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown would have come out with\r\n\r\nsomething  fresh, startling and original.  But  all\r\n\r\nthat  we  had  from the lost sheep of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis was that they confined themselves  to  \r\n\r\nre-opening  an issue that had already been decided  on\r\n\r\nby this Assembly and by the electorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, we heard angry complaints from\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis that free  speech  was  dead\r\n\r\nbecause  this session of the Assembly was not  long\r\n\r\nenough.   But  would  this  complaint  carry   much\r\n\r\nconviction with the people when an Assembly Session\r\n\r\nis  used  to  re-discuss issues which have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  decided  upon and repeat arguments  which  we\r\n\r\nhave heard over and over again in this Assembly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,  before  I go on to the amendment  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Members, I would like to deal with\r\n\r\nsome  of the astonishing comments made by the\r\n\r\nparlour   revolutionaries  on  the   Yang   di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's speech. Both the Member for Queenstown and\r\n\r\nthe Member for Thomson dismissed as of no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat  consequence  references  to  the  number  of\r\n\r\nhouses,   standpipes,  roads,  factories,  schools,\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres and things of  that  kind  which\r\n\r\nconstitute  concrete achievements. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  found  all these tangible  achievements\r\n\r\nirritating. Because he could not deny the existence\r\n\r\nof  schools, flats, standpipes, he was  reduced  to\r\n\r\nmaking  a  very  remarkable observation.  He  said,\r\n\r\n\"Take   away   the  houses,  the  standpipes,   the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres and all that, and what  have  you\r\n\r\ngot?\"  And  he  gave  the  answer,  \"You  have  got\r\n\r\nnothing.\"  Of course, Sir, any school boy  who  has\r\n\r\ndone  any elementary mathematics can tell you  that\r\n\r\nif  you  take away everything, then there  will  be\r\n\r\nnothing. But the same school boy could have pointed\r\n\r\nout  to the Member for Queenstown that in fact  you\r\n\r\ncannot  take  away houses, roads, schools,  clinics\r\n\r\nand  stand-pipes that have been built however  much\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis might try to wish them away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the irritation of the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown over such things as houses and  clinics.\r\n\r\nI  understand that his constituency is one of those\r\n\r\nareas  where buildings and clinics are shooting  up\r\n\r\neven  as  he tries to convince the people  in  that\r\n\r\narea  that they are being oppressed by the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthat they are ill-fed, ill-housed and neglected and\r\n\r\nthat only after the revolution, can people get more\r\n\r\nschools, houses and the good things of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Member for Thomson dismissed all\r\n\r\nthese   concrete  achievements  as  of   no   great\r\n\r\nconsequence.   In   building   schools,   community\r\n\r\ncentres,   houses  and  the  like,  he  said,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was only carrying out its  obligations.\r\n\r\nBut  that is the point. Sir,If we are carrying out\r\n\r\nour  obligations,  then instead of  denouncing  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Barisan Sosialis should commend  us\r\n\r\nand  exhort us to build more houses, more  schools,\r\n\r\nmore  roads, more clinics and, more factories. They\r\n\r\nshould  come forward with concrete and constructive\r\n\r\nsuggestions on how the livelihood of the people can\r\n\r\nbe improved still further. Instead, as we all know,\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis tactics have been  to  hinder\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects as in the case of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh and create an atmosphere of tension  and\r\n\r\ncrisis to ensure that no economic development takes\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will have noticed, Sir, how irritated the\r\n\r\nMembers for Queenstown and Thomson were by the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara's references to the atmosphere of\r\n\r\ncalm  and  tranquility now prevailing in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  irritates  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and  their\r\n\r\nCommunist puppet masters for two reasons. The first\r\n\r\nis  that  this  air of calm and tranquility  should\r\n\r\nprevail after the recent arrest of Communists is  a\r\n\r\nsocial  embarrassment to them. The  fact  that  the\r\n\r\ndisappearance  of prominent Communists,  \r\n\r\nCommunist-front  men, should have been received so calmly  by\r\n\r\nthe people, and even with relief by the people,  is\r\n\r\na mortal blow to the Communist propaganda that they\r\n\r\nenjoyed  the  esteem, support and  loyalty  of  the\r\n\r\nmasses.  So  too  in the case of  houses,  schools,\r\n\r\nroads  and the like, the Barisan Sosialis  have  to\r\n\r\ndeny the fact that there is calm and tranquility in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why they find references to\r\n\r\ncalm and tranquility so irritating is that, so long\r\n\r\nas  there  is  calm and tranquility,  the  pace  of\r\n\r\neconomic   development,  investments  in  business,\r\n\r\nindustry  and construction work generally would  be\r\n\r\naccelerated,  thus exposing the Communist  argument\r\n\r\nthat only after a Communist revolution can people's\r\n\r\nproblems  of livelihood be solved. They  know  that\r\n\r\nthis   thesis  is  false.  They  know  that  in   a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialist  Singapore  we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nsteadily improve the welfare of the people  without\r\n\r\nimposing  hardships, the terror and the intolerable\r\n\r\nburdens  which  are  the  inevitable  preludes   of\r\n\r\nCommunist  forms  of reconstruction.  Every  house,\r\n\r\nevery  school, every standpipe, every  factory  and\r\n\r\nevery  road built under a non-Communist,  socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment is one more nail to the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nlie  that only a Communist revolution can make life\r\n\r\nbetter  for  the  people. The thesis  that  only  a\r\n\r\nCommunist regime can solve the livelihood  problems\r\n\r\nof  the  people is obviously refuted by the  steady\r\n\r\nand  concrete achievements. Therefore,  every  time\r\n\r\nthey see a flat, a standpipe, a road,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have now to wish them away. They cannot  deny\r\n\r\nthese  achievements  and, in  fact,  they  made  no\r\n\r\neffort to deny the existence of these achievements.\r\n\r\nAll  that the Barisan Members did was to claim,  as\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Queenstown  said,  that  if  you\r\n\r\ndisregard all these achievements, then there are no\r\n\r\nachievements worth talking about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from time to time, we, on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse,  have given free advice to Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nmembers.  I  know, they have stubbornly refused  to\r\n\r\nheed  such  advice,  presumably because  they  were\r\n\r\nfree,  but  had they listened to our  advice,  they\r\n\r\nwould  not  be in this sorry plight that  they  are\r\n\r\ntoday.  Sir, I propose to give them another bit  of\r\n\r\nadvice which may possibly be the last bit of advice\r\n\r\nwe  will be able to give them. Anyway, Sir,  having\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  present  state  of  neurosis   and\r\n\r\nanxiety,  this  advice  may  well  be  disregarded.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,   the  advice   is   this:   do   not\r\n\r\nunderestimate  the intelligence of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. They are not duffers and morons  as  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis discovered during the referendum.\r\n\r\nThe  people will judge the Government and forms  of\r\n\r\ngovernment not by oratory, not by promises of a pie\r\n\r\nin  the  sky,  not  by abstract talks  of  freedom,\r\n\r\nrevolution, anti-colonialism, democracy  and  other\r\n\r\nverbal mishmash, but by what the Government does to\r\n\r\nmake the day to day life of the people better.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown and the Member for  Thomson,\r\n\r\nfairly  well-fed, well-housed, possessed of  steady\r\n\r\nincomes,   may  think  that  things  like   houses,\r\n\r\nschools, stand-pipes, roads, factories, and so  on,\r\n\r\nare   trivial  matters  compared  with  the   vague\r\n\r\nabstractions   about   anti-colonialism,    genuine\r\n\r\nunification  of Malaysia with Indonesia,  with  the\r\n\r\nrevolutionary struggle and so on. But I think, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore have reached  sufficient\r\n\r\npolitical   maturity  to  be  able  to  distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween gentlemen who keep talking on and on  about\r\n\r\nrevolution and Utopia at some undefined future  and\r\n\r\nthose  who, while not promising a workers' paradise\r\n\r\nor  a Utopia in some future period, produce houses,\r\n\r\nschools, standpipes and so on, now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis and their Communist mentors\r\n\r\nmay   not   think  very  much  about  our   housing\r\n\r\nachievements,  but  I can tell them - and  they  must\r\n\r\nhave read - that international experts on housing who\r\n\r\nhave  visited Singapore have been impressed by what\r\n\r\nhas  been achieved so far and these experts, unlike\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis, not only  know  more  about\r\n\r\nthese  matters, but they have no political  axe  to\r\n\r\ngrind one way or the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, the Member for Queens-town, not\r\n\r\nknowing how to minimise or refute the facts as laid\r\n\r\nout  in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech and not\r\n\r\nknowing  how to attack us, went even so far  as  to\r\n\r\nblame  the  Government for the water  shortage.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  his  argument  is even  more  hilarious.  He\r\n\r\nargued  that  since  a  lot of  rain  fell  on  the\r\n\r\ntropical  isle of Singapore he could not understand\r\n\r\nwhy   there   should  be  any  water   shortage - the\r\n\r\nimplication presumably being that the wicked P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  somehow hoarded  all  this  excess\r\n\r\nwater and deliberately created a water shortage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another noticeable source of irritation to\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis was television. The Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  was more than usually distraught  every\r\n\r\ntime  he  referred to television which for want  of\r\n\r\nsome  stronger term he described as a new craze.  I\r\n\r\nthink  that in describing television as a new craze\r\n\r\nhe  is not showing the progressive outlook expected\r\n\r\nof  good revolutionaries, because even in Communist\r\n\r\ncountries  including Moscow and Peking,  television\r\n\r\nis described as the hallmark of an advanced society\r\n\r\nand  as  a  useful  mass media for  increasing  the\r\n\r\ncultural  and  intellectual level  of  the  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore, by establishing television as in  Moscow\r\n\r\nand  in  Peking, not to mention Jakarta,  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoo  is  in the vanguard of progress, and  I  am  a\r\n\r\nlittle surprised that the Barisan Sosialis who  are\r\n\r\nso  anxious  to  see Singapore in the  vanguard  of\r\n\r\nprogress  should  manifest such  hostility  towards\r\n\r\ntelevision. It is not that the Barisan Sosialis did\r\n\r\nnot  know  that  the  Government  had  planned   to\r\n\r\nintroduce  television. In fact some of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members while still in the Government  had\r\n\r\nlooked  forward to the introduction  of  television\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat  eagerness.  Now  that  television  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced,  I would have thought they  would  have\r\n\r\ncongratulated  the Government for  having  realised\r\n\r\ntheir  dearest wish a little bit ahead of schedule.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  know why the Barisan  Sosialis  are  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit anxious about television. It is one more\r\n\r\nmass  medium - and a very powerful medium - with which\r\n\r\nto  combat and circumscribe the Communists  in  the\r\n\r\nopen encounter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Government realise that there is\r\n\r\nnothing  the  Communists dread more than  the  open\r\n\r\nencounter, the open argument. During the  past  two\r\n\r\nyears the argument, particularly over Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nmerger, was carried out with the Communists in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers and radio. Members will remember how  we\r\n\r\ninvited the Communists and their front men to radio\r\n\r\nforums  which at first they accepted with  alacrity\r\n\r\nbelieving  that here at last was a  chance  to  put\r\n\r\nforward  their  case to hundreds  of  thousands  of\r\n\r\npeople. But the first encounter in which the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown participated proved to  be  such  a\r\n\r\ndisaster  for  the Communist cause that  subsequent\r\n\r\ninvitations  to  such forums were very  reluctantly\r\n\r\naccepted  and then finally, consistently  rejected.\r\n\r\nWith  television,  the Member for Queenstown  knows\r\n\r\nfull  well  not only will he be heard but  seen  as\r\n\r\nwell.  And  to this extent, he knows that  he  will\r\n\r\ninflict twice and probably thrice as much damage to\r\n\r\nhis  cause  as he was able to inflict by his  radio\r\n\r\nappearance.  That  is  why I thought  he  looked  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit disconcerted yesterday when  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   extended  an  invitation  for   him   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in a television forum.  I  advise  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queens-town that he can do  no  better\r\n\r\nservice  to  the  cause of non-Communist  socialist\r\n\r\ndemocracy  than by appearing in a television  forum\r\n\r\nand   pleading   the  cause  of  the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nBarisan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state here that the battle against\r\n\r\nCommunism and anti-national forces is as  much  one\r\n\r\nof   restraining  their  propensity  to  resort  to\r\n\r\nviolence as it is a battle of ideas. In the  battle\r\n\r\nof  ideas,  mass  media like radio, television  are\r\n\r\nvital,  and the Government intends to use  them  as\r\n\r\neffectively as possible to safeguard the democratic\r\n\r\nsystem as well as the security of Malaysia.

He said that the  Government  was\r\n\r\npressing  ahead with plans to have more radios  and\r\n\r\nT.V. sets  in  the rural areas because  the  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  were higher in the rural areas.  This  is  a\r\n\r\ncorrect  appraisal of the situation. In  the  urban\r\n\r\nareas,   thanks  to  fuller  coverage   by   radio,\r\n\r\nnewspapers  and  Rediffusion,  the  open   argument\r\n\r\nbetween  the  democratic forces and the  Communists\r\n\r\nreached  the  ears of the ordinary men who,  having\r\n\r\nheard   both  sides  of  the  case,  rejected   the\r\n\r\nCommunist case in favour of the democratic case. In\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas, however, Communist propaganda was\r\n\r\npressed   through  such  outfits  as  the   Country\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association  and  the  Rural   Dwellers'\r\n\r\nAssociation. The democratic case did not reach  the\r\n\r\nears of the rural people as widely as the Communist\r\n\r\ncase,  or  rather Communist rumours and falsehoods.\r\n\r\nSo the Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown knows that once T.V. and radio  are\r\n\r\nintroduced into the rural areas as well, we can not\r\n\r\nonly  begin to nail down every Communist  falsehood\r\n\r\nand  rumour but bring home to the rural people  the\r\n\r\nsimple  truth, that the democratic system can  give\r\n\r\nthem a better life. Therefore, this violent dislike\r\n\r\nfor  television  and radio by the Communists  means\r\n\r\nthat  we  have done the right thing in establishing\r\n\r\nthese new mass media and it would certainly be  one\r\n\r\nbig nail in the Communist coffin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis may also be interested to\r\n\r\nknow  that towards the latter part of the  year,  a\r\n\r\nsecond television channel will be established,  and\r\n\r\nnext  year  a  third channel and  television,  like\r\n\r\nother  mass  media,  will be  effective  allies  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  against the Barisan Sosialis  and  their\r\n\r\nCommunist manipulators. Unable, therefore, to offer\r\n\r\nserious  criticism  of  the  achievements  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the Barisan Sosialis  leaders  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  to  do. All they can offer  by  way  of\r\n\r\nimprovement  to  the motion on the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's speech is an amendment \"to truthfully  and\r\n\r\nhonestly ascertain the views of the people on their\r\n\r\nconstitutional future\". This is, I  think,  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  most  astonishing cases of collective  amnesia\r\n\r\nthat  I  have come across, because many of us  will\r\n\r\nremember  that  some  eight  months  ago,  on   1st\r\n\r\nSeptember,  the  people of Singapore  went  to  the\r\n\r\npolls  to  decide  on their constitutional  future.\r\n\r\nThey  had to decide whether they wanted merger with\r\n\r\nautonomy  in  education  and  labour,  or  complete\r\n\r\nmerger, or merger on terms available to the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.  I  distinctly  remember  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis running around telling the people that all\r\n\r\nthese  three  alternatives were bad  and  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore should show their disapproval\r\n\r\nof these three alternatives by casting blank votes.\r\n\r\nWe  all know that the outcome was that over 70  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the people voted for alternative A,  that\r\n\r\nis, merger with autonomy, and only some 25 per cent\r\n\r\neast blank votes. We know that the result came as a\r\n\r\nshock to the Communists, and also to the Member for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim,  who  also had been running  around  for\r\n\r\nreasons of his own asking the people to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncast blank votes. The fact that the Communists  got\r\n\r\nonly  25  per  cent  of  the  votes  exploded   the\r\n\r\nCommunist  myth  which  they  got  even  many  non-Communists  to  believe, that  the  Communists  had\r\n\r\nunassailable   influence   over   the   masses   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. This myth of the mass influence  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  was often used to neutralise  the  \r\n\r\nnon-Communists  with  the threat that  if  they  openly\r\n\r\nopposed  the Communists, then they would  be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  when  the  Communists won  the  next  general\r\n\r\nelection. So the fact that the Communists were able\r\n\r\nto   influence  only  25  per  cent - and  even  that\r\n\r\npercentage must be shared with the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim because he also campaigned for blank votes;  so\r\n\r\nif  we  give  him  5  per cent, then  at  best  the\r\n\r\nCommunists were able to influence only 20 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the electorate to follow their line. And  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the explosion of this myth of Communist\r\n\r\nmass  influence,  today more and  more  people  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to stand up to the Communists. The  power\r\n\r\nof  Communist  intimidation has  been  considerably\r\n\r\nweakened  as a result of the exposure of this  myth\r\n\r\nof Communist mass influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more disastrous for the Communists has been\r\n\r\nthe  impact of this defeat on the weaker  of  their\r\n\r\nCommunist   supporters.  These  weaker   of   their\r\n\r\nCommunist  supporters, these weaker  comrades,  had\r\n\r\ntrailed after the Communists in the fond hope  that\r\n\r\nthey  were on the winning side, that they were with\r\n\r\na Party which had the majority of the masses behind\r\n\r\nit. But now the Party which could only mobilise  25\r\n\r\nper  cent of the electorate, and that by and  large\r\n\r\nfrom the rural areas, could no longer hold the  old\r\n\r\nfascination  for  the  weaker  followers   of   the\r\n\r\nCommunist  cause. So, therefore,  one  myth  having\r\n\r\nbeen   destroyed - the   myth   of   Communist   mass\r\n\r\ninfluence - it  became necessary for  the  Communists\r\n\r\nand the Barisan Sosialis in the interest of its own\r\n\r\nsurvival  to create yet another new myth to  repair\r\n\r\nthe  damage and prevent demoralisation among  their\r\n\r\ndwindling  supporters. Therefore, the new  myth  is\r\n\r\nnow  being  developed  that  the  defeat  that  the\r\n\r\nCommunists suffered at the referendum was  illusory\r\n\r\nand that they, in fact, had the masses behind them.\r\n\r\nThe myth, as propagated  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  is  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum was dishonest and rigged. In fact,  Sir,\r\n\r\nyou  will  remember that hilarious moment yesterday\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Member for Queenstown drew attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  results  of the two Gallup polls conducted  in\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  and Kreta Ayer by Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nand  Communist supporters or dupes in  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity   and  the  Singapore  University.   The\r\n\r\nreferendum    in   which   some   600,000    voters\r\n\r\nparticipated, he dismissed as unrepresentative. The\r\n\r\nresults   of  that  referendum,  he  dismissed   as\r\n\r\nunrepresentative  of public opinion.  But  the  two\r\n\r\nGallup  polls  conducted by pro-Communist  students\r\n\r\nand dupes supervised by Communists and limited to a\r\n\r\nfew  thousand selected subjects in these two  areas\r\n\r\nare  now  held  forward seriously as evidence  that\r\n\r\nthese  two  Gallup polls proved that the Communists\r\n\r\nhad  a  vast  majority of the people  behind  them.\r\n\r\nApparently in these two Gallup polls, well over  90\r\n\r\nper  cent  of the people cast blank votes, implying\r\n\r\ntherefore that the 25 per cent blank votes  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  was  not  truly representative  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. Surely. Sir, the Member for Queenstown, who\r\n\r\nis a fully grown adult male, does not expect either\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly or the people to take what  he  says\r\n\r\nseriously.  This business of a private Gallup  poll\r\n\r\nbeing  more  reliable  than a nationally  organised\r\n\r\nreferendum  may go down well among the infants  who\r\n\r\nformed  the  large proportion of the crowd  at  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis rally held a few weeks ago at  the\r\n\r\nBadminton  Hall. But surely, Sir,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  must  be  on  the  verge  of  a  mental\r\n\r\nbreakdown  if  he  expects adults  to  accept  this\r\n\r\nthesis,  that his own Gallup poll is more  reliable\r\n\r\nthan the nationally organised referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, the Member for Thomson suggested\r\n\r\nthat  the  referendum was rigged.  If  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis really believe this, then they could  very\r\n\r\nwell  have taken the matter to Court, produced  the\r\n\r\nevidence and set aside the referendum. But  as  far\r\n\r\nas  I know, Sir, they have not done so. I know they\r\n\r\nmade art attempt just before polling day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto get the Supreme Court to restrain the Referendum\r\n\r\nSuperintendent from exercising his powers, but  the\r\n\r\nargument   was  so  unconvincing  that  the   Court\r\n\r\nrejected  their plea. But, I think, Sir,  there  is\r\n\r\none  authority whose testimony about  the  honesty,\r\n\r\nthe  regularity of the referendum, no single member\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis can question.  And  that\r\n\r\nauthority  is none other than Mr Lim Ching  Siong.\r\n\r\nOn  the night of the 1st of September after polling\r\n\r\nhad  closed,  Mr  Lim Ching  Siong  was  asked  by\r\n\r\nPressmen  to  comment on the polling, and  this  is\r\n\r\nwhat he said, and I quote from the Sunday Times  of\r\n\r\nSeptember 2, 1962:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Said Mr Lim: \"We are sure the majority of the\r\n\r\npeople have cast blank votes in protest against the\r\n\r\ndishonest referendum.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if Mr Lim Ching Siong had thought that\r\n\r\nthe  referendum  had  been rigged  or  in  any  way\r\n\r\ntampered   with,  he  would  not   have   said   so\r\n\r\ncategorically that he was certain that the majority\r\n\r\nof  the people had cast blank votes. If the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis leaders had thought that the balloting had\r\n\r\nbeen  so  rigged that it would have  precluded  the\r\n\r\npeople  from  casting blank votes,  the  Communists\r\n\r\nwould  not have got their followers to camp outside\r\n\r\nBadminton  Hall that night to celebrate a  possible\r\n\r\nvictory. If the Barisan Communists had thought that\r\n\r\nthe referendum had been rigged, they would not have\r\n\r\nwaited until the very early hours of the morning to\r\n\r\nwatch  the  ballot  papers being  counted  and  the\r\n\r\nresults  announced; nor would  they,  if  they  had\r\n\r\nbelieved  that the balloting had been rigged,  have\r\n\r\nasked  for a recount and then scooted off from  the\r\n\r\nBadminton  Hall immediately after the counting  had\r\n\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communists know that the referendum was\r\n\r\nfairly  held. The only trouble is that they  really\r\n\r\nbelieved their own myth, that their influence  over\r\n\r\nthe  masses was unassailable. So when they got only\r\n\r\na  25 per cent vote which was worse than even their\r\n\r\nmost pessimistic prediction, they knew that the end\r\n\r\nhad  come.  What angered them even more,  I  think,\r\n\r\nSir, was that the Government had at the last moment\r\n\r\ndecided to accede to the plea that they had made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the blank votes should be counted separately.\r\n\r\nI  think they would have given their right arm that\r\n\r\nnight  for the Government to have decided to  count\r\n\r\nthe  blank votes with the other votes because  then\r\n\r\nthey  could have gone out and said, \"Yes, you know.\r\n\r\nBut  the blank votes exceeded all other votes.\" But\r\n\r\nnow,   once   having  declared  the   blank   votes\r\n\r\nseparately, it was shown with mathematical accuracy\r\n\r\nthat  at  their  best,  the Communists  could  only\r\n\r\nmuster  about 20 to 25 per cent of the  electorate,\r\n\r\nand  that from the rural areas where our propaganda\r\n\r\nhad  not been able to reach the rural masses.  This\r\n\r\nfact,  the realisation that they no longer had  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the people, has pushed the  Communists\r\n\r\nand  the  Barisan Sosialis into a new and dangerous\r\n\r\ncourse.   They   knew  that  they  had   lost   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional struggle in Singapore and that  with\r\n\r\nthe  advent  of Malaysia their chances  of  winning\r\n\r\npower constitutionally were gone for good. So  they\r\n\r\ndecided  on violence. The only way they could  halt\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia was not by  a  constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle  in  Singapore, but by violence;  and  the\r\n\r\nbattlefield of violence was first Brunei. Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to go into details about the involvement\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis members and Communists  in\r\n\r\nthe  armed revolt that took place in Brunei.  There\r\n\r\nis a White Paper on the subject. I think there is a\r\n\r\nmotion  when Communist Barisan Sosialis  connection\r\n\r\nwith  the  violent revolt in Brunei would be  spelt\r\n\r\nout.  However,  the fact to be noted  is  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Communists knew that they could no longer\r\n\r\nrely on the people of Singapore to fight their \r\n\r\nanti-Malaysia  and  anti-merger  battle  and  that   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Communists had now to rely on Azahari and\r\n\r\nforeign  volunteers  to fight  their  anti-Malaysia\r\n\r\nbattle  for them. The Singapore Communists and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis hoped that the violent struggle in\r\n\r\nBrunei  would  then spread to Singapore,  and  that\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore they could provide fuel and support\r\n\r\nfor  the  violence  in Brunei and  other  parts  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  If the violence which started in  Brunei\r\n\r\ncould  spread  to  Singapore, the Communists  hoped\r\n\r\nthat this would give them a chance of imposing,  by\r\n\r\nforce, what they could not get the people of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore to do by constitutional means,  that  is,\r\n\r\nto  break up Malaysia. Fortunately, Sir, the Brunei\r\n\r\nrevolt fizzled out, and so there was one last  hope\r\n\r\nfor  the so-called anti-colonialists. Just as  they\r\n\r\nwent  to  see  certain  colonialists  in  the  U.K.\r\n\r\nCommission to help to break up merger, to come to a\r\n\r\ndeal. So this time, after the revolt in Brunei  had\r\n\r\nfizzled  out,  they were banking on the  fact  that\r\n\r\nrelations between Malaya and Indonesia would worsen\r\n\r\nso that the confrontation would pass from a passive\r\n\r\nto   an   active  stage  when  they  hoped  foreign\r\n\r\nvolunteers  and  armies would invade  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nhelp to break up Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was when the Barisan Sosialis and the\r\n\r\nCommunists  not only openly supported violence  but\r\n\r\nwere  also engaged in playing the treacherous  role\r\n\r\nof  supporting  intervention by foreign  volunteers\r\n\r\nthat the Internal Security Council decided that the\r\n\r\nCommunists  now  constituted not  anti-colonialists\r\n\r\nbut fifth columnists in our midst. These Communists\r\n\r\nwere  arrested not because they were our  political\r\n\r\nopponents. We tolerated them for two years. We gave\r\n\r\nthem  every  opportunity to say  or  do  what  they\r\n\r\nliked.  So  it  was  not  because  they  were   our\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents but because  they  had  become\r\n\r\nfifth  columnists - to sell Singapore  and  Malaysia\r\n\r\nnot  only to racketeers, \"bums and liars\" like  Mr\r\n\r\nAzahari, and like Osmena who says he is prepared to\r\n\r\ndo  a  deal  on  Malaysia for  something  like  $10\r\n\r\nmillion.  But worse than that. The Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  become stooges of foreign powers and  foreign\r\n\r\ngroups like the Indonesian Communist Party.  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause the people know of this role that they  are\r\n\r\nplaying  today - that the Barisan  Sosialis  are  not\r\n\r\nanti-colonialists - that the detention  of  over  100\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis supporters has not brought about a\r\n\r\nsingle  reaction from the people.  We  know  for  a\r\n\r\nfact, Sir, that the Barisan Sosialis leaders on the\r\n\r\nday  some of them were arrested, tried to get  some\r\n\r\nof  the  unionists like those in the Singapore  Bus\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union to go on strike. But this time  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore had come to know the real  role\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis - that they were treacherous\r\n\r\nfifth columnists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore,  when the Barisan Sosialis leaders  were\r\n\r\nlocked  up, there was not a tear shed. That is  why\r\n\r\nunlike before, in 1956-57 when the Communists  were\r\n\r\narrested,  there was reaction because they  managed\r\n\r\nto  wangle  into the real anti-colonial  front  and\r\n\r\npose as anti-colonial martyrs. But today they stand\r\n\r\ncondemned  as traitors to our country  and  to  our\r\n\r\npeople.  So  however much they  tried  to  mobilise\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the  100-odd  people  who  had   been\r\n\r\ndetained,  they  could  not get  a  single  protest\r\n\r\nmeeting.  They  held  a  protest  meeting  at   the\r\n\r\nBadminton Hall where over 40 per cent of those  who\r\n\r\nattended  were school children. In fact,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Upper  Serangoon made  an  observation - over  40  per cent were school children, the  same\r\n\r\nkind  of school children whom they used during  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  debate as a cover to precipitate conflict\r\n\r\nbetween the police and school children in order  to\r\n\r\nwork  up  indignation. At that protest meeting  the\r\n\r\nsame  school children were there, so much  so  that\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  tipper  Serangoon  said,  \"Well,\r\n\r\nfriends,  at  this meeting we can  see  very  young\r\n\r\npeople.  It is only the old people who support  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\" What he meant was that they could fool\r\n\r\nonly  infants. And perhaps there will come a  time,\r\n\r\nSir, when at a mass meeting of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nwe  would  see  hundreds of perambulators,  because\r\n\r\nthey  would have stopped deceiving school  children\r\n\r\nof 15 and 16 years of age and would have to deceive\r\n\r\nchildren of 5 and 6 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> From the kindergartens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> So that is the reason, Sir - not\r\n\r\nbecause they are our political opponents, since  we\r\n\r\nwere  prepared to tolerate them - but  because  the\r\n\r\nmoment   they   entered  into  a  conspiracy   with\r\n\r\nforeigners  and  racketeers to sell out  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthey  had  become  the stooges  of  racketeers  and\r\n\r\nforeigners. It was then that the I.S.C. felt  that\r\n\r\nthe time had come to call a halt to people who were\r\n\r\nusing the democratic system to stage not a national\r\n\r\nrevolution  or even a Communist revolution  but  to\r\n\r\nsell out Singapore to foreign elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had confirmation yesterday of the real\r\n\r\nrole  of  the  Barisan Sosialis -  that they  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  a national Party. We always said they  were\r\n\r\nanti-national,   but  nobody   believed   it.   But\r\n\r\nyesterday the Member for Queenstown came out with a\r\n\r\nstartling  statement. After  nearly  two  years  of\r\n\r\nsaying  that at least the Barisan Sosialis supports\r\n\r\nthe  concept of Malaysia, he yesterday argued  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  now  no  affinity  between  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories, Singapore and Malaya. He said that the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories  have nothing  in  common  with\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya, but that they should  instead\r\n\r\nforge  a  link  with Indonesia. That fits  in  with\r\n\r\nanother  statement which they denied - a report  made\r\n\r\nover  a  year ago in the Bintang Timur, a Communist\r\n\r\npaper,  that  Lim  Ching Siong  had  said  that  he\r\n\r\npreferred a merger of Singapore with Indonesia to a\r\n\r\nmerger  of Singapore with the Federation. When  the\r\n\r\nreport    was   made   known,   some    of    their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives here denied that such  a  statement\r\n\r\nwas  made. But now it fits, in again with a  remark\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Thomson made in this  Chamber.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  he  opposed Malaysia unless Malaysia included\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  which  was, he said, the  heartland  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  And  the  Member  for  Queenstown   said\r\n\r\nfurther that Malaysia should exclude Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaya, and the Borneo territories should be handed\r\n\r\nto Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have now been\r\n\r\nreduced to being traitors, of acting as stooges  of\r\n\r\nforeign  elements. Their only hope today is  for  a\r\n\r\nreal  open  conflict,  a violent  conflict  between\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and Malaya. They have a vested  interest\r\n\r\ntoday  in a warfare between the peoples of the  two\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would suggest that the 13 Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   Members  have  today   ceased   tot   be\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people of  Singapore.  They\r\n\r\nare  not  the representatives of those who  elected\r\n\r\nthem.  They  have become representatives  of  alien\r\n\r\nracketeers and of foreign Communist Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the communist position is such that they\r\n\r\ncan only save their political skins by the betrayal\r\n\r\nof their country and their people to foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nracketeers  amid  by pleading in this  chamber  the\r\n\r\ncause  of alien Communists. Therefore, I say it  is\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis who are today real  colonial\r\n\r\nstooges - stooges of new colonial masters. This  is\r\n\r\nthe   shameful   state  to  which   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nCommunists have been reduced, and they have been so\r\n\r\nreduced  because  they  have  underestimated   the\r\n\r\nstrength  and  the intelligence of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Queenstown warned that\r\n\r\nblood  would be shed if Malaysia was pushed through\r\n\r\nby  31st  August. I would like to  ask  him:  whose\r\n\r\nblood  is  going to be shed? If the blood  that  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be shed is that of the 14 Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers, well, that is their own business.  But  if\r\n\r\nthey are planning to shed other people's blood,  if\r\n\r\nthey  are planning to use school children, as  they\r\n\r\nhave  done  in  the  past,  as  cover  tot  protect\r\n\r\nthemselves and get blood to flow, or use workers or\r\n\r\nother innocent victims, then let us tell them  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the people are ready to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  if any blood flows, it will not be the  blood\r\n\r\nof  innocent  people.  Or, knowing  full  well  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  tactics over  Brunei,  are  they\r\n\r\nhoping  for foreign volunteers to shed their  blood\r\n\r\nfor them, as the Brunei workers shed their blood to\r\n\r\nsustain  the Barisan Sosialis? Obviously,  what  is\r\n\r\nquite  clear  is  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis  are\r\n\r\npreparing  to  go  down with  a  bang  before  31st\r\n\r\nAugust. The threats of violence and bloodshed  that\r\n\r\nhave  been uttered by Barisan Sosialis leaders from\r\n\r\nlime to time may be intended as a bluff to frighten\r\n\r\nthe  people, to show how tough they are.  Well,  if\r\n\r\nthat  is all that they are doing, we wish them good\r\n\r\nluck.  But  if  they  are contemplating,  or  their\r\n\r\nmasters behind them are contemplating  - one thing we\r\n\r\nare  quite  sure,  the people who are  manipulating\r\n\r\nthem  regard  the Barisan Sosialis  Assemblymen  as\r\n\r\nexpendable  material - to shed the blood of  innocent\r\n\r\npeople,  then I warn them that they will  not  find\r\n\r\nthis  Government wanting in resolution and  courage\r\n\r\nto deal with Communist violence and subversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  expressed  surprise  and  hurt  that\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Opposition did not pay tribute  or\r\n\r\ncommend  the P.A.P.

Even  after  the  visit  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  the  by-election is  still  not  in  the\r\n\r\nbooks. It could be June, it could be July, it could\r\n\r\neven  not be held at all. It is left to the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment - a  Government, according  to  their  own\r\n\r\nclaim,  that has done so much and so well  for  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister in his speech yesterday,\r\n\r\nin  moving the motion that is now before the House,\r\n\r\nsaid  this - and I quote page 34 [col.  169]  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  copy of the first half of Hansard.  He  said\r\n\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We must never make the grave error of the last\r\n\r\nGovernment in believing that the neutralisation  of\r\n\r\na  few united front activists could mean the end of\r\n\r\nthe Communist capacity to organise and agitate when\r\n\r\nthe  time  comes  for elections. This  has  been  a\r\n\r\ntemporary setback for them in what is a grim\r\n\r\nlong-term struggle for power.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking of a grave error, I do not know what\r\n\r\nthey  mean.  Perhaps it was a grave error  for  the\r\n\r\nprevious   Government  to   stand   up   to   their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and declare that the action  taken\r\n\r\nagainst the Communists was an action taken  by  the\r\n\r\nelected  Government  of  Singapore,  although   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for internal security  rested  with\r\n\r\nthe Chief Secretary who was a colonial official. We\r\n\r\nneed not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave to declare that it was our responsibility, but\r\n\r\nbecause  we  believed, and honestly believed,  that\r\n\r\nthe  security  of the people of Singapore  demanded\r\n\r\nsuch  an  action  on  our part,  we  stood  up  and\r\n\r\ndeclared that it was on our own initiative that  we\r\n\r\nput  the  Communists in gaol for the  good  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. When we compare that -  talking\r\n\r\nof  a  grave error now - the P.A.P. Government, under\r\n\r\nthe   Constitution:  \"Internal  security   is   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Government,\" and yet, in  the\r\n\r\nmotion that is to come very soon, \"No, no, net  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Government,   the   Internal   Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.\"  Well, that could be a grave error.  They\r\n\r\nare  clever now; it is better for them to deny that\r\n\r\nthey  are  responsible or that  the  responsibility\r\n\r\nrests  with  them. It was foolish for the  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock   Government  to  say  that  they  were  fully\r\n\r\nresponsible  when  they need  not  have  to  accept\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  So, on the one  hand,  you  had  a\r\n\r\nGovernment   that  need  not  have   accepted   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility but accepted it, and, on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  you have the P.A.P. Government that  has  to\r\n\r\naccept the responsibility, and denying it. It could\r\n\r\nbe  a  grave  error. Another grave error  could  be\r\n\r\nthis.  I  think  it  was  a  grave  error  now,  on\r\n\r\nreflection. It was a grave error that the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  did not arrest the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar. I would have done it if I had known that the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar consorted with the Plen in\r\n\r\n1956   and  1957 - as  confessed  by  him;  a \r\n\r\nself-confessed  collaborator with the Communists.  If  I\r\n\r\nhad  known, I would have taken him in. That  was  a\r\n\r\ngrave  error. That, I am prepared to admit,  was  a\r\n\r\ngrave error. [Interruption] But next time, we  will\r\n\r\nknow how to correct the grave error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now here again, the Minister for Culture said,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, in 1956 when the silly Lim Yew Hock Government\r\n\r\ntook  action  against the Communists  there  was  a\r\n\r\nreaction. But now, peace and tranquility.\"  Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain. In 1956 when we put the Communists in, the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar, using his position  as  a\r\n\r\nMember of the Opposition,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecame  so irresponsible that he fought the  battle\r\n\r\nof the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, if you see the 14 men behind me, I am\r\n\r\nsure  they  themselves will admit that they  cannot\r\n\r\nmeasure up to the stature of the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  who  is now the Prime Minister.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  who  was  then the  Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  was  prepared to fight  the  cause  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists in order to win the battle, and  to  sit\r\n\r\nthere  as the Prime Minister. That is what he  did.\r\n\r\nThat  was  why  there was so much trouble,  because\r\n\r\nthere was someone with ability who was prepared  to\r\n\r\nsell the interest of Singapore for the interest  of\r\n\r\nhis  Party and himself. At present, if these people\r\n\r\nwere  as capable as the Prime Minister, I think  he\r\n\r\nwould  have  a  more miserable time,  but  for  the\r\n\r\npresent  I do not think they could be that capable.\r\n\r\nAt that time, was it not true, Sir, when I arrested\r\n\r\nthese  people,  up  jumped the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  \"Motion of censure\"? Now he arrested  them,\r\n\r\nbut  there is no motion of censure. And yet we  are\r\n\r\nsupporting him. We say his action was right. All we\r\n\r\nsay is that he should have done it earlier. What he\r\n\r\ndid  wrong  was  in  not doing it  earlier  and  he\r\n\r\nallowed the interest of the people of Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbe  jeopardised, because he wanted to play the game\r\n\r\nof  \"confrontation\" -  that is the word used  by  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  too, \"confrontation\" - and zugzwang.  He\r\n\r\nwanted  to fiddle and play a zugzwang confrontation\r\n\r\nwhile Singapore burned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is why you are still\r\n\r\nsafe here, you know that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I will not touch on the next\r\n\r\nmotion.

Therefore, they said,\r\n\r\n\"Let  us  wait  until we can conclude an  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation to join Malaysia, then we  can\r\n\r\nreconvene  the Assembly.\" If they had succeeded  in\r\n\r\nconcluding the agreement, their policy speech would\r\n\r\nhave been a very stirring one, \"We got this; we got\r\n\r\nthat;   we   got  everything  for  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"  And why it took such a long  time  for\r\n\r\nthem   to  succeed,  for  them  to  conclude   that\r\n\r\nagreement?   it  was  not  because  there   was   a\r\n\r\ndeliberate delay on the part of, shall we say,  the\r\n\r\nother  party,  but it was due to the cleverness  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister, who is sometimes far, far  too\r\n\r\nclever. He thought that it was a wonderful thing to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  in  the Press. He told the Press  first,\r\n\r\n\"This is what I want to do. This is our stand,\" and\r\n\r\nlie  left  the Federation alone. It was because  of\r\n\r\nthat that hurt their feelings. You cannot negotiate\r\n\r\nimportant  matters of that kind in the Press.  Next\r\n\r\ntime  they  should  do it on television!  No,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  they did it, that caused the  delay.  That\r\n\r\ncaused  the  other party to stand up and  say,  \"If\r\n\r\nthat is the way that man is going to do it, let  us\r\n\r\ntell  him a few home truths.\" And that is too  bad.\r\n\r\nIf  he  had not shown his cleverness but kept quiet\r\n\r\nand  not  talked as much as he wanted, thumped  the\r\n\r\ntable  as much as he wanted in the Conference Room,\r\n\r\nthings  would have been solved by now.  As  it  is,\r\n\r\nthey have not solved it. Tomorrow he is going again\r\n\r\ntot  talk and I wish him luck. But I bet they would\r\n\r\nhave delayed the reconvening of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis Assembly had it not been for the fact that His\r\n\r\nExcellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has to  visit\r\n\r\nCambodia  and go on his pilgrimage to  Mecca.  They\r\n\r\nwere  caught.  Therefore  they  produced  a  policy\r\n\r\nspeech.  It  is  no policy speech  at  all.  I  can\r\n\r\nsympathise  with the Government, and  generally  we\r\n\r\nextend  sympathies to people who are going to  die,\r\n\r\nor  to  people  who are already dead and, to  that\r\n\r\nextent, I extend our sympathies to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me come to the speech of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture. He was saying how clever  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwas:  beat the Communists in every round, at  every\r\n\r\ncount,  the opening encounter; they won, yes,  they\r\n\r\nwon.  They won because they are mare adept  in  the\r\n\r\nart of double-talk. Definitely double-talk, Sir! To\r\n\r\ntake  a very simple illustration. According to  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Ordinance, blank votes should be counted\r\n\r\ntogether  with votes for A. That was the  law.  But\r\n\r\nbecause  they  found out that,  \"Oh,  blank  votes,\r\n\r\ntidak  apa,  lah.  Let us have some  fun  with  the\r\n\r\nBarisan.  Count separately.\" If they had  meant  to\r\n\r\ncount  separately, why did they resist an amendment\r\n\r\nfrom  me  and  from  the Barisan that  blank  votes\r\n\r\nshould  be  declared separately?  They  dared  not.\r\n\r\nBecause  they  were not so sure. Because  if  blank\r\n\r\nvotes were to be declared separately, it would turn\r\n\r\nthe  tables  on them. But because they  found  that\r\n\r\nblank  votes meant nothing to them, and they  could\r\n\r\nuse  that  to  twist the tail of the Barisan,  they\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Count  blank  votes!\"  And  they  called  a\r\n\r\nspecial  sitting of this Assembly just to  ridicule\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan. \"Oh, you can have the blank votes  in\r\n\r\nany  way  you want - B, C, or whatever you like.  All\r\n\r\nthe  blank votes. Never mind, \"whereas the law says\r\n\r\nblank  votes mean A. In this double-talk, they  are\r\n\r\nmore adept, they are cleverer. The Barisan are poor\r\n\r\ninnocents and do not come up to the standard of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. Sir, I would have  exposed  this - I\r\n\r\ncannot  use the word \"trickery\" - double-talk had  it\r\n\r\nnot  been  that  the  cause  was  a  sacred  cause,\r\n\r\nMalaysia ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

In fact, all I can say is, \"Next  \r\n\r\ntime if they try to he too clever and say that ---\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They found a hatchet man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> A hatchet man is usually a very short man,\r\n\r\nSir, not a man of stature. Maybe  there is a hatchet man there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is why they said, \"Oh, this confrontation!\" They are sure to win, because they are more clever. In fact, when the P.A.P. came in, what did they say? \"Ban rock and roll!\" But now they are indulging in a new dance - the twist. And they twist so cleverly that the twist is a first-class dance with the P.A.P. Government. Every time they twist. They know how to twist all the words they use. First-class double-talk! These poor ex-comrades of the P.A.P., left behind, do not know how to twist the P.A.P., whereas the P.A.P. keep on twisting their tail, and there is no response. It is not for me to try and save them from any dilemma that they are now in. But what I want to say to the P.A.P. is this, \"Do not crow. The fact that you are able to get this quiet, this peace, was because men of responsibility side with you.\" If we had wanted to play politics in the way that they have been playing when they were here, there would have been merry hell. But that is not our way of looking after the interests of the country. We will support them on their motion. Sorry, Sir, I should not anticipate the debate on the next motion. We have said we are with them so long as they do the right thing. But at any time when they do the wrong thing, we will chop them. In fact, in this Assembly, after Sembawang, it will be the Alliance who will declare the funeral day of the P.A.P. and not the Barisan Sosialis who, now that all their ghost-writers have been taken away, do not know how to reply to all the twists and double-twists rind treble-twists of the P.A.P. Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I forget, there is a wonderful twist here. Sir, you\r\n\r\nremember that when the  P.A.P. came  to power,  they created Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries  and Political Secretaries, and the question was  asked, \"What \r\n\r\nis  a  Parliamentary Secretary?  What  is  a Political  Secretary?\" And the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  in Hansard,  Volume  11, No. 9, dated  2nd  September,\r\n\r\n1959, column 536, said: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Parliamentary Secretary, as the term designates,\r\n\r\ncarries the burden of  the  Minister's parliamentary  duties, and \r\n\r\nto the extent  that  the Minister  designates or delegates, he  carries\r\n\r\nthe burden of the Minister's ministerial duties.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That   means  he  is a  junior  Minister  in   the Government.  Sir,  the Acting Minister  for  \r\n\r\nLabour stood  up yesterday and said how good their  policy is,  how well they look after labour, and how  much they  allow trade unions to run on proper lines.  I have  said  in  this Assembly that a  Parliamentary Secretary can never be a Secretary-General  of  any trade   union,  and  what  is  worse  is   that   a Parliamentary Secretary is the Secretary-General of a  union of Government employees. And yet they talk of yellow unions, and all sorts of things. I do not know  what  to call it. I warned them. I told  them that  it  could  not  be  done.  I  did  tell   the Parliamentary  Secretary concerned to  declare  his loyalty. He is either with the Government  or  with the  workers. He cannot have dual loyalty.  It  has now  happened. The Parliamentary Secretary  to  the Minister  for  Culture  said,  \"The  Minister   for Finance  is  all  wrong. The A U.P.E. will  go  on strike.\" The Minister for Finance said, \"The  Union is  all rotten. It is bad. It should wait till 31st August before it presses on with its claim.\"  There was   so   much  argument  that  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture had a  ballot taken and his union is going on strike. And that is not  too  bad. But what came out in this  morning's Malayan Times at page 5, takes the cake. \"Kandasamy Accuses  P.A.P.  Government\".  Sir,  Kandasamy   is accusing himself! \"The Amalgamated Union of  Public Employees  yesterday  accused the  People's  Action Party  Government of cowardice, and Radio Singapore of  slanting the news.\" Radio Singapore, Sir? Under his Ministry? He is the Parliamentary  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Culture. The  control of  Radio \r\n\r\nSingapore is under his  Ministry.  Radio Singapore  distorts the news! \r\n\r\nI do not know.  Well, maybe  Kandasamy,  the  Secretary-General,  \r\n\r\naccuses Kandasamy,  the  Parliamentary Secretary.  This  is what  I \r\n\r\nmean by P.A.P. first-class twist and  turn. They know how to twist. \r\n\r\nThis is what he said. Fancy the  Parliamentary Secretary saying that! \r\n\r\nThis  is terrible,  Sir, if what he said is  right.  I  hope somebody  \r\n\r\nin the Malayan Tunes is not going  to  be put in under the P.P.S.O. \r\n\r\nThis is what he said:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Apparently the Government has only the nerve and courage to fight\r\n\r\nand threaten the young  girls  of the midwifery service who are prepared \r\n\r\nto fight for their  rights.  They have no guts [I  do  not  know whether \r\n\r\nit is parliamentary, but it is all  right; it  is in the newspapers] to\r\n\r\ntackle the postal  and telecommunication workers.'  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  what Kandasamy said. Now, I do  not  know whether  Kandasamy will get the sack or whether \r\n\r\nhe will sack the Government. I do not know. Maybe this is  P.A.P. style\r\n\r\nwhich I find very  difficult  to understand. And then he accuses Radio \r\n\r\nSingapore  of distorting news. He says that Radio Singapore tells all \r\n\r\nsorts of things:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Touching on Radio Singapore, Mr Kandasamy, who is also Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Culture,  whose portfolio includes Radio \r\n\r\nSingapore, said,  \"Radio  Singapore has been  announcing  that only  the \r\n\r\nunresolved claims would be  directed  to arbitration,  thus giving the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  the other  claims are settled. If Radio Singapore would\r\n\r\ncare  to compare the Gazette notification [I  would say  if \r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Culture  would  care to \r\n\r\ncompare  the  Gazette notification] and the strike notice,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nvery obvious that all claims, with the exception of the  claims  for  the\r\n\r\nmidwives,  were  directed  to arbitration.\"' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  this  is  just putting the  Government  in  a ridiculous position. \r\n\r\nA Parliamentary Secretary,  in the  words  of  the Prime Minister, shares\r\n\r\nin  the ministerial responsibility of the Minister, and  he shares  in the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of controlling  Radio Singapore. And now he says that\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore  is distorting  his  own news! Well, I  would  ask  the \r\n\r\nGovernment to solve it the P.A.P. style.  They  can only  solve it in the \r\n\r\nP.A.P. style! I do  not  know how to solve it myself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few things here I would like to touch on. The Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech  contains this little  passage  at column 5, \"Because of \r\n\r\nthe careful budgeting and the economy  measures taken in 1959-60 --- \".\r\n\r\nWhat  are the  economy  measures?  An arbitrary  slashing  of salaries \r\n\r\nimposed on the civil servants!  And  they were  told  that  if \r\n\r\nthey started  squealing  they should go down on their bended knees and\r\n\r\nthank  the gods  that nothing worse had happened to  them.  At that  time,\r\n\r\nthere were 43 of them. Therefore,  they put out their chests and said,\r\n\r\n\"You had better take it,  brothers, or you get worse.\" So they took  it. \r\n\r\nThen  when  three of their numbers went  over,  and another 14 went over, \r\n\r\nthey felt that something  was wrong; so they restored the allowances of\r\n\r\nthe civil servants  but then they restored them  only  for  a certain \r\n\r\nperiod. So there is a period  between  the time   when   the   cut  \r\n\r\nwas   imposed   and   the restoration - that  little  bit.  Is  the \r\n\r\nGovernment going  to wait until election time and say,  \"Okay, civil\r\n\r\nservants! I give you back this salary cut  of yours.  You  know that \r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. is  a  very  good Government.  Vote, lah.\"? Do not do  that.\r\n\r\nIf  the salary  cuts  had been restored because  they  were wrongly \r\n\r\nimposed, then come out into the  open  and say,  \"We did it. We thought\r\n\r\nthat we were facing  a deficit.  But now we find that we have  a\r\n\r\nsurplus. Okay,  we  will  repay it to you  because  that  is rightly your \r\n\r\nmoney.\" It is most immoral to try  and say  that  they have got a very good\r\n\r\nbalance  when they  took  that money arbitrarily from  the  civil servants!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I talk on housing? The Government are very fond of showing off.\r\n\r\nLook at what the Housing Board have  done. We have done so much now. My \r\n\r\nquestions have  elicited,  Sir, that insofar  as  housing  is concerned, \r\n\r\n3,098 units were vacant on  31st  March this year. That is not such a big\r\n\r\nfigure, but if we are  to  consider it in terms of money lost to  the \r\n\r\nHousing Board - the amount I worked out is $165,510 a month - that  is  the\r\n\r\nrevenue lost  to  the  Housing Board,  because these Units are vacant. \r\n\r\nThat  I  am sure the Finance Minister would not and should  not tolerate.\r\n\r\nHouses are built to be occupied. This  is a  waste  of $165,510 a month.\r\n\r\nI did ask  how  many units  were  vacant for a year and more,  \r\n\r\nhow  many were vacant for six months  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto a year, and from three months to six months. And the  amount worked out  - even on a very conservative estimate - is  that they lost half a million \r\n\r\ndollars in   rents  last  year,  because  the  houses  were unoccupied. \r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to get  people  to occupy  those  houses, what did \r\n\r\nthey do?  Yes,  the Crawford Street reverted property suddenly occurred \r\n\r\nto  them. Wonderful! If we could tell the residents of  Crawford Street, \r\n\r\n\"This is reverted property. We want  to  rebuild this area. Come  on,  go\r\n\r\nto  the Housing  Board  houses.\"  \"Sixty  dollars?\"  \"Never mind,  you \r\n\r\npay.  These are wonderful  flats.\"  The tenants there appealed to the \r\n\r\nGovernment that  they could  not  afford  a rent of $60  nor  could  they\r\n\r\nafford  the rent of $40. But they were prepared  to move. From the figures\r\n\r\nI got from the Minister  for National  Development,  the  Government,  it\r\n\r\nwould seem, are forcing people to take up Housing Board flats because\r\n\r\nthey are empty, and because they  are losing  revenue. That is why they \r\n\r\nhave  told  these people they are going to build. Why are they  going to \r\n\r\nbuild? Where are they going to get the money to have  a  big housing estate\r\n\r\naround Crawford Street? You cannot do that. They have less than year before \r\n\r\nthey  are buried. What are they trying to do?  They are trying to force \r\n\r\npeople to go into Housing Board flats. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. In Henderson\r\n\r\nRoad, that  is Tiong Bahru Road, the previous much-maligned S.I.T. built  \r\n\r\nhouses  prewar and rented  those  houses  at $7.00 a month. After the war, \r\n\r\nI think the rent  has been  increased to $11.00. The Government  says \r\n\r\nto the  occupiers of these houses - a few  hundred  of them   - that the \r\n\r\nmaintenance cost is very  high  and \"You  had  better go; we have a lot \r\n\r\nof  houses  for you.\" They are forcing them to give up cheap houses to  \r\n\r\ntake  up  Housing Board houses that  have  been vacant for nearly a year \r\n\r\nin order to cover up their over-zealousness in housing, although there is \r\n\r\nless demand  for it. The supply is more than the  demand now.  On  the \r\n\r\nground that the Trust flats in  Tiong Bahru  require a lot of maintenance\r\n\r\nand  are  most uneconomical, the  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHousing  Board offer them new flats but  at  higher rent. \r\n\r\nBut the tenants say, \"If it is uneconomical, we will bear the cost of the \r\n\r\nmaintenance.\" I do not know  how they are going on with this. This is  the \r\n\r\nkind of housing they have. In their desire to prove that  they  are doing \r\n\r\nsomething, they put  up  more houses  than  required. And half-a-million  \r\n\r\ndollars has gone down the drain, Mr Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other point. The Prime Minister's visits to the rural areas. At the bottom\r\n\r\nof column 11:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Prime Minister's visits to the rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies have helped get closer co-ordination between Government\r\n\r\nplanners and the rural people...'.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is what the Government says. What\r\n\r\nthe  people know is this. Before the prime Minister goes on his visits,  \r\n\r\nthe names of a good number of  people  who are  of  some influence there \r\n\r\nwill be taken to  the Prime  Minister's Office, and invitations  will  be \r\n\r\nsent  out, and they will be invited to Sri Tamasek. There will be a very\r\n\r\nfriendly discussion. They will come  back  to the rural areas and try to \r\n\r\nget  the people  to  appreciate the importance of the  Prime Minister's \r\n\r\nvisit. And they will say, \"Oh, you know, on  Sunday  the great Prime \r\n\r\nMinister is  coming.  I think  we should do something about it. I think\r\n\r\nwe should  give $30.00.\" So the poor shopkeeper  says, \"What  am  I \r\n\r\nto do? If I say no, mati, my  licence might  be stopped. If I say yes,\r\n\r\nwhy should I waste $30.00?\"  Take  the line of least resistance,  give\r\n\r\n$30.00. So, big fireworks, crackers and what-not to welcome  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  It  looks  well  on Television  and in photographs. It could \r\n\r\nhave  got the  Barisan people all stumped. But what  happened as  soon as \r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister stepped down? People were  cursing. There were loud \r\n\r\ncurses.  \"Never  saw such a man; never came to us. And now come to us to\r\n\r\noffer what? Sweets, with poison inside?\" \"You  want a community centre?\r\n\r\nO.K., it will be there. What do you  want, a school? It will be there;\r\n\r\nI will  even come and build it. Do not worry.\" And they have  to accuse  \r\n\r\nus of corruption. That is worse, Sir.  That is nothing but political\r\n\r\ncorruption. They lay plans for the next general  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelection that is going to come next year. That kind of  making use of \r\n\r\nthe public money to go round  and get  the  people  to say how good the\r\n\r\ngreat  Prime Minister  is.  The great Prime Minister  was  never good\r\n\r\nbefore because he never saw them; and now  he goes round. He even went\r\n\r\nto Sembawang, the scene of the  by-election  to  come. He shed  tears. \r\n\r\n\"Ahmad Ibrahim  was  a brave man with guts.\" I  feel  like shedding tears\r\n\r\nand saying, \"Thank God, poor  Ahmad, you  had died. If you had remained,\r\n\r\nyou would  have died  of shock at the way the P.A.P. is now doing.\" Anyway, \r\n\r\na good man always gets gathered  unto  the Father much earlier. It\r\n\r\ncould be that he was  taken back to heaven ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is why he had lived so long.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Because he had joined the wrong Party!

That is the shame  that Ahmad  Ibrahim would have\r\n\r\nsuffered if  he  had  not died.  And  it was because of them that  maybe\r\n\r\nthe Prime  Minister cried.

And the Prime Minister says in column 19:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The implementation of these arrangements after 31st August will\r\n\r\nrequire a great deal of tact  and patience.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>A great deal of tact and patience.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are confident that with understanding and brotherly give-and-take,\r\n\r\ntemporary dislocations can be kept to a minimum.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Would  you call it tact, Sir, if what I read in  a newspaper \r\n\r\npublished in Kuala  Lumpur  is  correct? Here  you  have  a  great\r\n\r\nPrime Minister  going  to declare the  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJurong  Wharf  open.  That is  grand - all  pomp  and grandeur.  Was\r\n\r\nthere tact when  he  said  that  he invited  the  Prime Minister of \r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya  to  come  to witness this  opening  but \r\n\r\nhe declined?  He  preferred to go to the races.  Would you  call it \r\n\r\ntact - the P.A.P. style of tact? And yet as  far  as  I  know no invitation  \r\n\r\nhad  ever  been issued. That is tact, that is the wonderful  P.A.P. style  \r\n\r\nof  tact. Let us have less of  that  and  it would   be  better  for  the \r\n\r\nrelationship  between Singapore and the Federation. That is not the  kind\r\n\r\nof  tact  we  want.  That  does  not  help  in  the relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry if I take time because I am trying to cut down on this.\r\n\r\nColumn 6: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Honourable Members of the House must have known of the deep\r\n\r\nregret  the  people  felt  over  the differences that have arisen between \r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya and the Republic of Indonesia.' \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>And further down:  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`So whatever minor differences may arise from time to\r\n\r\ntime  between Singapore and Kuala  Lumpur  over chickens  and  eggs, or\r\n\r\npigs and paints,  we  stand solidly  with them on all the vital questions\r\n\r\nthat affect Malaysia,...'. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  support  that. But against that,  what  did \r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister do? You know, in one of his tours in the  rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies he said, \"Our policy with Indonesia  is  the  right \r\n\r\npolicy.  The  Federation policy is the wrong policy.\" So much so that\r\n\r\nthere has  been talk in town. Is it because Lee & Lee are the  legal \r\n\r\nadvisers  to the Indonesian  Government that their policy is the right\r\n\r\npolicy? And yet here they  say  that in everything they support  Malaya.\r\n\r\nThat  again is P.A.P. culture, P.A.P. twist, P.A.P. double-talk. Let\r\n\r\nthem mean what they say.  We  will always  support  them in what they mean - what  they say, or to mean what they want to mean to say. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come to the Communist one later. I do not think I\r\n\r\nshould worry about the Communist  one.  I support this one. Column 8:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Borneo territories need capital for development.\r\n\r\nThe Central Government has promised to do  its  utmost  to provide \r\n\r\nthe necessary  finance.

And  it  would  be  a wonderful  gesture\r\n\r\non the part  of  the  Singapore Government  if  we  could have  one \r\n\r\nroad  in  each territory and name it \"Singapore Road\". That  would forever\r\n\r\nbe  a reminder to the peoples in  Sarawak, Borneo  and Brunei that we in \r\n\r\nSingapore share  with them  their  hopes, their aspirations and  will  do \r\n\r\nwhat we can to help them in their development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, all this talk about the Internal Security Council saying such a\r\n\r\nthing as at column 4: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But we must always be vigilant. There are still some in our midst actively\r\n\r\ntrying  to  disrupt national  security  and  sabotage  our  plans  \r\n\r\nfor Malaysia.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Who is to be vigilant, the P.A.P. Government or the I.S.C.?\r\n\r\nI agree we all must he vigilant. We call on the  Prime Minister to be more\r\n\r\nvigilant. If he  has not  yet disclosed who the Plen is, where he lives, \r\n\r\ntell  it to his Special Branch. If a Prime Minister can do that kind of a \r\n\r\nthing, who knows who the Plen is,  and where he is, and hides it; and yet\r\n\r\nthe law says, if  I know where a Communist lives and  know that he is \r\n\r\nwanted, and if I do not go and tell  the police,  I will go to gaol. \r\n\r\nBut the Prime  Minister is   above  the  law,  especially  a  P.A.P.  \r\n\r\nPrime Minister. He is well above the law. If he wants the public to\r\n\r\nco-operate and work, and be more vigilant so  that the Communists are \r\n\r\ntotally wiped out,  let him  show  an  example. Do not turn  round  in\r\n\r\nhis Battle  for Merger, \"I talked with the Plen in  the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly.\" If I had known in  1956  and 1957  that the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar could  have been keeping company with Lim Ching Siong. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not like to take up too much time on this.

I  am concerned with that portion  of  his\r\n\r\nspeech dealing with Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis, as the leading\r\n\r\nCommunist  front  organisation  in  Singapore,  has\r\n\r\n\"fought\"  Malaysia,  though the campaign  conducted\r\n\r\nhas  not  been as skilful as it should  have  been.\r\n\r\nThey   have  lost  the  open  confrontation   which\r\n\r\nculminated  in  the referendum last September.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown is now trying to pretend that\r\n\r\nthey  did not really lose the referendum.  He  said\r\n\r\nyesterday  that  if only Members of  this  Assembly\r\n\r\nwould accept the result of the Nanyang students'\r\n\r\nso-called  academic research project  carried  out  in\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  and Kreta Ayer, then  we  would  be\r\n\r\npersuaded that the people of Singapore were  indeed\r\n\r\nagainst  merger and Malaysia. But, Sir,  I  am  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  waste the time of the House in rebutting\r\n\r\narguments  as feeble, as foolish and as  futile  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Queenstown has advanced  on  this\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the main substance of his argument, and\r\n\r\nit consists of this. He said that for the immediate\r\n\r\nfuture, the constitutional development in Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  consist  of the immediate and  unconditional\r\n\r\nrelease  of  the Communist agents and  sympathisers\r\n\r\nwho  were detained by the Internal Security Council\r\n\r\nlast  February.  Then after the  release  of  these\r\n\r\npersons, the general elections should be held.  The\r\n\r\nelected Government which he actually hoped would be\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis Government would then re-open\r\n\r\nwith  the  British Government the whole subject  of\r\n\r\nthe   constitutional  future  of   Singapore,   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia presumably would then be abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is his idea of democratic,\r\n\r\nconstitutional progress in Singapore.  Needless  to\r\n\r\nsay,   that   is   not  our  idea  of   democratic,\r\n\r\nconstitutional progress in Singapore.  The  subject\r\n\r\nof detainees will be debated in a subsequent motion\r\n\r\nand I shall say no more about this. But I think  it\r\n\r\nis fair for me to remind him of certain words which\r\n\r\nI said to him more than a year and a half ago, when\r\n\r\nI  warned  him  of  the consequences  of  willingly\r\n\r\nsupporting  the Communist cause. It is no  use  for\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown to pretend that there are\r\n\r\nno  Communists  in Singapore or that,  in  his  own\r\n\r\nwords, \"the whole thing is a myth and a bogey\".  We\r\n\r\nare  entitled to assume, in view of his age and his\r\n\r\napparently  sober and sane demeanour,  that  he  is\r\n\r\ncapable of rational judgment on the basis of  facts\r\n\r\nwhich  are known and acknowledged by everyone.  If,\r\n\r\non  the  face of all this, he continues  his  fairy\r\n\r\ntale  that he does not know that his Party was  and\r\n\r\nstill  is the major open-front political instrument\r\n\r\nfor  the Malayan Communist Party, then we must draw\r\n\r\nthe inevitable conclusion that of his own free will\r\n\r\nand choice he supports their cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as I have said, the next stage of\r\n\r\nSingapore's political development, as he  envisages\r\n\r\nit,  is the unconditional and immediate release  of\r\n\r\nthe Communist agents and sympathisers, and this  is\r\n\r\nto be followed by the general elections and the\r\n\r\nre-opening of the whole issue of merger and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he knows, and any sane man in Singapore must\r\n\r\nknow, that this is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing to happen - merger and Malaysia will proceed as\r\n\r\nscheduled, namely, on the 31st of August this year.\r\n\r\nThe  newly  independent State of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia will be proclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what will then happen? In the words of the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown  - and here I quote from  page\r\n\r\n52 [col. 196] of yesterday's Hansard:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Should Britain so unwisely still impose Malaysia\r\n\r\non  the people against their will it can only  last\r\n\r\nso  long  as  there are British bayonets  and  jets\r\n\r\naround.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us ponder on the meaning and\r\n\r\nsignificance of these words. There are  two  points\r\n\r\nwhich  come to the mind. The first is that Malaysia\r\n\r\nis  to  be  imposed by force upon  the  people.  We\r\n\r\nalready  know  that this is completely  untrue.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  referendum  has  been  held  and  the\r\n\r\njudgment  of  the  people is  clear  beyond  doubt.\r\n\r\nElsewhere  the Parties in support of Malaysia  have\r\n\r\nwon  a  great majority of seats contested in  local\r\n\r\nelections  and the constituted governments  of  all\r\n\r\nthe   territories  which  constitute  Malaysia  are\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  bring  about  the  establishment  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  on  schedule.  Therefore,  to  say   that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  will have to be imposed against the  will\r\n\r\nof  the people is literally untrue. But there is  a\r\n\r\nmost  sinister significance of these words which  I\r\n\r\nshall explain later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that this possible imposition\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia  can only be carried  out  by  British\r\n\r\nforce  of  arms.  If I understand  the  meaning  of\r\n\r\nwords, what the Member for Queenstown is saying  is\r\n\r\nthat  there would be violent opposition to Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  violence of such a nature that it  has  to  be\r\n\r\nrestrained by the use of military power.  And  this\r\n\r\nis  the only possible construction that one can put\r\n\r\non  his  words, for just in the succeeding sentence\r\n\r\nafter the one that I quoted, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But this will mean a heavy price in blood...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown is the Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis. We have the Chairman  of  a\r\n\r\nmajor  political  Party in Singapore  saying  quite\r\n\r\nbluntly  and  in so many words that bloodshed  will\r\n\r\nfollow  upon  the establishment of Malaysia.  These\r\n\r\nare serious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwords.  They  are not words uttered by students  or\r\n\r\nintellectuals or ordinary men in the  course  of  a\r\n\r\ncarefree  conversation. They are not words  uttered\r\n\r\nin  the  heat  of discussion. They  are  not  words\r\n\r\nspoken  under  the influence of alcohol.  They  are\r\n\r\nwords openly and solemnly uttered in the course  of\r\n\r\nan  important debate in the Legislative Assembly on\r\n\r\nmatters   of  national  policy.  We  are  therefore\r\n\r\nentitled to draw the inevitable inference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as we read further on in page 52 [col.\r\n\r\n198] of Hansard we find in the penultimate sentence\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the last door to constitutional struggle is\r\n\r\nclosed to the people, then there can remain but one\r\n\r\nfinal answer.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the last door to the constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle  - Malaysia - has been closed. There is no  way\r\n\r\nby   which  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  or  any  other\r\n\r\nCommunist   front  organisation,   can   stop   the\r\n\r\nformation  of  Malaysia by constitutional  methods.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   in  the  words  of  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  there can remain but one  answer,  the\r\n\r\nfinal  answer. What answer, Mr Speaker?  The  only\r\n\r\nfinal  answer  in  this  context  is  quite  clear,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  unconstitutional methods of  violence\r\n\r\nand bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the threat is unmistakable. He is saying in\r\n\r\neffect, \"Stop Malaysia now or else he prepared  for\r\n\r\nviolence and bloodshed,\" and these are words spoken\r\n\r\nin  a  solemn  policy statement  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly by the Chairman  of  a  major\r\n\r\npolitical Party. We are therefore entitled to  take\r\n\r\nhis words at their face value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a curious feature that in the newspaper\r\n\r\nreports  of  his  speech this morning  very  little\r\n\r\nprominence was given to this part of his speech  in\r\n\r\nthe   English  language  newspapers.  Perhaps   the\r\n\r\nEnglish language newspapers may not he aware of the\r\n\r\nfull  implications  of  this  statement.  But   the\r\n\r\nChinese language newspapers did not miss the  point\r\n\r\nand  published this part of his speech  practically\r\n\r\nverbatim. There was even a minor headline  attached\r\n\r\nto the report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so we can take it that the strong and tough men\r\n\r\nbehind the Barisan Sosialis, the shop stewards  and\r\n\r\nthe  tough  characters in the  pro-Barisan  unions,\r\n\r\nwill  read  this speech in the Chinese  papers  and\r\n\r\nwill draw their conclusions, and that conclusion is\r\n\r\nthat   if   Malaysia  proceeds,  then  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSocialis and all the other open front Communist, as\r\n\r\nwell  as underground Communist, organisations  will\r\n\r\nresort    to   violence.   Now,   Sir,   if    this\r\n\r\ninterpretation is incorrect, let the other  Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis in this Chamber  say  so\r\n\r\nunequivocably, let them denounce the  Chairman  for\r\n\r\nhis criminal stupidity in threatening violence.  It\r\n\r\nis  no use for them to say that what the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown is saying is that there might be a  risk\r\n\r\nof a spontaneous outburst of violence. Outbursts of\r\n\r\nviolence  in  Singapore, as  we  all  know  through\r\n\r\nbitter  experience,  have never  been  spontaneous.\r\n\r\nViolence   is   calculated   and   organised    and\r\n\r\nprearranged. In this instance, it is very clear, on\r\n\r\nthe  admission  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  himself,  where the centre  of  organised\r\n\r\nviolence will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me tell the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown - unfortunately he is not here but perhaps\r\n\r\nhis  colleagues  will pass on the message  intended\r\n\r\nfor  him -   the  great import of his  words.  If  he\r\n\r\nresorts to violence, he must expect the constituted\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Malaysia  to  resort  to   adequate\r\n\r\ncounter  measures to contain such violence  and  to\r\n\r\napprehend  the  criminals  responsible   for   such\r\n\r\nviolence and bring them to justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the Barisan Sosialis and other\r\n\r\nCommunist  front organisations are content  to  use\r\n\r\nnon-violent methods of subversion, then  the  worst\r\n\r\npenalty  that they can expect will be a  period  of\r\n\r\ndetention until such time as they are persuaded  of\r\n\r\nthe  follies  of their ways. But when  there  is  a\r\n\r\nresort   to  violence,  punishment  is  not  merely\r\n\r\ndetention  in  gaol  either  in  Singapore  or  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  punishment is death  by  hanging.  Not\r\n\r\nonly  the  immediate perpetrators of violence  will\r\n\r\nsuffer this fate, but those who are responsible for\r\n\r\ninciting and organising them will also have to  pay\r\n\r\nthis ultimate price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not for the Member for Queenstown to\r\n\r\nsay that death by hanging meted out te perpetrators\r\n\r\nof  violence  constitutes Fascist  or  undemocratic\r\n\r\nmethods.   Armed  revolt  against  any  constituted\r\n\r\ngovernment  amounts to treasonable action,  and  in\r\n\r\nany  democratic government the penalty for  such  a\r\n\r\ncrime of treason is death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to accept also that with such\r\n\r\nmomentous words being uttered, the policy statement\r\n\r\nof  the  Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis has  been\r\n\r\ncleared and has been accepted by all his colleagues\r\n\r\nin  the Party leadership. Therefore, both they  and\r\n\r\nhe  will  be jointly and severally responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  consequences  of such a policy.  I  make  this\r\n\r\nobservation,  Mr Speaker, Sir, because  there  are\r\n\r\nmoments when I tell that the Barisan Sosialis  open\r\n\r\nfront  leadership, as distinct from  the  real  and\r\n\r\neffective   underground  direction,   consists   of\r\n\r\neccentric   lunatics  or  ill-tempered  maladjusted\r\n\r\nsocial  misfits,  or just downright  imbeciles  and\r\n\r\nidiots. Sometimes I gather the impression that they\r\n\r\nbehave  like  Little  children  playing  with  sand\r\n\r\ncastles  on the beaches, not knowing what they  do,\r\n\r\nwhy they are doing it, nor the serious consequences\r\n\r\nthat  could follow from their action. It is because\r\n\r\nI  get  the impression that they sometimes  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand the grave implications of their  actions\r\n\r\nthat  on various occasions I bring upon myself,  at\r\n\r\ngrave  risk  of being misunderstood,  the  duty  of\r\n\r\npointing  out  to  them the dire consequences  that\r\n\r\nmust follow upon their proposed line of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the referendum\r\n\r\nheld  last  year  is now seven months  old.  It  is\r\n\r\naccepted  in the minds of the people that  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill be established on 31st August, in spite of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis conspiracy to abort Malaysia  with\r\n\r\nthe  assistance  of foreign opposition.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhen the Member for Queenstown keeps on talking  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  as  an  imperialist  and  neo-colonialist\r\n\r\nplot,  and  that  the  Borneo territories  have  no\r\n\r\naffinity  with  Malaya and should  be  returned  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia, he betrays the mental groove into  which\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis has fallen. It is  a  tragedy\r\n\r\nfor Members of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis   when  their   leaders   cannot\r\n\r\nreorientate their political thinking and persist in\r\n\r\nplaying  a  worn-out  record of  Malaysia  being  a\r\n\r\ncamouflage for British colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prediction of the Chairman of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis that there will be bloodshed when Malaysia\r\n\r\nis established will no doubt be duly noted by those\r\n\r\nwho are responsible for the safety and security  of\r\n\r\nthis country. It is said that \"prevention is better\r\n\r\nthan  cure\",  and I have no doubt that prophylactic\r\n\r\nmeasures  will  be taken to prevent such  bloodshed\r\n\r\noccurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown talks of poverty,\r\n\r\ndisease,  ignorance and want. There is  no  one  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who is so poor that he cannot  have  his\r\n\r\ndaily  meals  of  rice. The per  capita  income  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is $1,300, which is the highest  in  the\r\n\r\nFar  East. There is no epidemic which afflicts  the\r\n\r\npeople:  the  standards of our  public  health  and\r\n\r\nhospital  care  have  made  Singapore  one  of  the\r\n\r\nhealthiest places to live in. There is free primary\r\n\r\neducation  for  children of all races  and  we  are\r\n\r\nalready  expending 23 per cent  of  our  budget  on\r\n\r\neducation. If there are poverty, disease, ignorance\r\n\r\nand  want,  they  exist only  amongst  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  But here I must make a clear definition.\r\n\r\nI  cannot  say  that  the leaders  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are materially poor. Their poverty  is  a\r\n\r\nmental  poverty caused by their inability  to  free\r\n\r\nthemselves  from  Communist  cliches,   and   their\r\n\r\nblindness  to  the real political  situation  which\r\n\r\nfaces  us  today.  The poverty of  their  political\r\n\r\nthinking  and  ignorance of the real needs  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  have brought upon them a disease  in  which\r\n\r\neverything they see is only of one colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After merger and Malaysia have been established,\r\n\r\nthe  anti-colonial cry will only be an echo of  the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are entering into a new phase in which is\r\n\r\nrequired leadership with positive ideas and  plans,\r\n\r\nwhich will advance not only the material welfare of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore but also the development of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  A  country  which  has  previously  been\r\n\r\nsubject to colonialism inevitably throw up a type\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  militant leadership which is uncompromising  in\r\n\r\nits tight against foreign domination. With Malaysia\r\n\r\nthis  phase of the battle is past and gone.  A  \r\n\r\nre-adjustment  of political thought becomes necessary.\r\n\r\nThe  old anti-colonialism war cries will not  cause\r\n\r\nmanna  to  fall  from heaven or  turn  stones  into\r\n\r\nbread.  Nor  will  cries of \"Bersatu\"  create  more\r\n\r\njobs. Only by careful planning and by the sweat  of\r\n\r\nour  brows can we hope to maintain the high  living\r\n\r\nstandards  that we enjoy in Singapore and generally\r\n\r\nin Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate of Singapore is now one of\r\n\r\nconstruction. Energy and time previously  frittered\r\n\r\naway  in political excitement have been devoted  to\r\n\r\nintense work and construction. The fruits of  these\r\n\r\nlabours  have been detailed in the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech. The intense building activity  of\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board, the Public Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  private builders is  changing  the\r\n\r\nskyline of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong, once upon a time an evil-smelling marsh,\r\n\r\nhas  been converted into an industrial estate. Land\r\n\r\nis  being  reclaimed  in the East  lagoon  and  new\r\n\r\nwharves will be built. Television Singapura  though\r\n\r\nbarely  two months old has been a whacking  success\r\n\r\nand  will  no doubt in time to come make an  impact\r\n\r\nupon the pattern of living in Singapore. These  are\r\n\r\nindeed  achievements of which we can be  proud  but\r\n\r\nthey have been made possible by the technical skill\r\n\r\nand ability of Singapore's workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the number of students who leave secondary and\r\n\r\nprimary   schools  increases  year  by  year,   the\r\n\r\npressure of jobseekers must cause concern among all\r\n\r\nthese who have the welfare of our society at heart.\r\n\r\nThe problem is being tackled in two directions. The\r\n\r\nfirst  step  is to stimulate capital investment  in\r\n\r\nindustrial  enterprises so that new factories  will\r\n\r\nbe  built and ancillary services expanded. In order\r\n\r\nto  achieve  this  object, not only  a  climate  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the political future  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  be  created but also there must be industrial\r\n\r\npeace. With\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  participation of Singapore  in  Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nunsureness of our political future will disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board has been the\r\n\r\nspearhead  in our industrialisation programme,  but\r\n\r\nif  industrialisation is to succeed it is essential\r\n\r\nthat  there  must  be  available  in  Singapore   a\r\n\r\nreservoir for skilled technical manpower. For  this\r\n\r\nreason, emphasis has been placed on the development\r\n\r\nof  technical education. The Polytechnic is now  in\r\n\r\nits fifth year and the time has now come to develop\r\n\r\nit  into an institute of advanced technology. Steps\r\n\r\nare being taken to remove the Craft Courses out  of\r\n\r\nthe Polytechnic to Balestier and they will form the\r\n\r\nnucleus  for  a  future vocational  institute.  The\r\n\r\nscope  for undergraduate courses at technician  and\r\n\r\nprofessional   level  will  be  expanded   in   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic   and  past-graduate   work   will   be\r\n\r\nintroduced.  The  graduates which  the  Polytechnic\r\n\r\nhave  produced have shown their worth, particularly\r\n\r\nto  employers in industry. It is now time to  carry\r\n\r\nthe   development  of  the  Polytechnic  one  stage\r\n\r\nfurther.  We intend later in the year or next  year\r\n\r\nto   introduce  a  Bill  which  will   enable   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic to confer degrees upon those  who  hold\r\n\r\nprofessional diplomas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are confident of maintaining the present\r\n\r\npace  of  construction, we must be equally vigilant\r\n\r\nthat the prosperity of Singapore now enjoyed is not\r\n\r\ndestroyed  at  one fell stroke by an  unpredictable\r\n\r\nslump  in  trade or a fall in the price of  rubber.\r\n\r\nThe  reserves  that have been accumulated,  and  to\r\n\r\nwhich  considerable reference has been made by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  during this debate, are a useful  asset\r\n\r\nfor the wintry days should there be a short-fall in\r\n\r\nrevenue  and  development funds which are  hard  to\r\n\r\ncome  by.

Over\r\n\r\nthe  last two days I think the Assembly itself  has\r\n\r\nreflected  a new mood and Members find it difficult\r\n\r\nto  get exuberant or really angry over anything.  A\r\n\r\ncertain  finality  prevails over everything  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  to the good that everybody  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry,   including  Members  on  the   Opposition\r\n\r\nBenches,  understands that there is a  finality  in\r\n\r\nthe state of things in Singapore and in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the way we have discharged our duties in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  leave it to concrete evidence - and\r\n\r\nliterally concrete, bricks, stones, cement,\r\n\r\ngirders - to  bear testimony to some of the work we have done\r\n\r\nover  the  last  3\ufffd years and will continue  to  do\r\n\r\nbetween now and 31st August. After 31st August, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, a new phase opens and  perhaps  when\r\n\r\nthat time comes we will chart briefly, again before\r\n\r\nyou,  what  we think lies ahead. But I think,  like\r\n\r\nall  good thrillers, one must never anticipate.  We\r\n\r\nhave  enough to keep everybody happy and  contented\r\n\r\nbetween now and 31st August. I hope Members on  the\r\n\r\nother side will take my words to heart that the 1st\r\n\r\nSeptember really settled a lot of things  and  that\r\n\r\nit  will be utter folly to go on - as the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown   yesterday   went   on - fighting   that\r\n\r\nverdict.  For  him  to suggest that  North  Borneo,\r\n\r\nwhich  does  not belong to him but belongs  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Malaysia, should be given away  to  some\r\n\r\nforeign power. I think that is the sign of reckless\r\n\r\nfoolhardiness which is bound to end up with a great\r\n\r\ndeal  more unhappiness all round. All I can say  is\r\n\r\nthat,  every time after the event, like  Cassandra,\r\r\n\r\nmore  in  sorrow  than in anger, we  have  pleaded,\r\n\r\nalbeit in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nadded, be there added.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

It decided that action\r\n\r\nshould  be taken immediately to safeguard  national\r\n\r\ndefence and security of Singapore and of the  other\r\n\r\nterritories   of   Malaysia.   It   decided    that\r\n\r\ncertain - not  all - of  those  known  to   the   three\r\n\r\nSecurity Authorities to he deeply implicated in the\r\n\r\nUnited  Front  working  for Communist  and  foreign\r\n\r\ninterests must be arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours of Saturday morning, the 2nd\r\n\r\nof  February, operations were launched from  Johore\r\n\r\nby Singapore and Federation Special Branch officers\r\n\r\nand  a  number of persons were detained. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink the public were surprised at the action taken\r\n\r\nagainst  these  Communists and their  United  Front\r\n\r\nworkers.  For that matter, the Communists were  not\r\n\r\nsurprised either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a word of explanation, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nSince  it  is  rather late in the  evening,  it  is\r\n\r\ninadvisable to drink tea and it is better to  drink\r\n\r\nwater.  To those Members of the Opposition  Benches\r\n\r\nwho find it difficult to keep awake in the evening,\r\n\r\nI  recommend Chinese tea, particularly  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956, when Mr Lim Ching Siong and his\r\n\r\nCommunist United Front friends were taken to  gaol,\r\n\r\nthe action was accompanied by riots and civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommotion. This was because the Communists had then\r\n\r\nsucceeded   in  creating  an  issue  over   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation  and in exploiting a series  of  strikes.\r\n\r\nThousands of Chinese students camping at the  Chung\r\n\r\nCheng and Chinese High Schools  - Eton and Harrow for\r\n\r\na  lot  of Chinese parents in Malaysia - were broken\r\n\r\nup  by tear-gas. They marched down Bukit Timah Road\r\n\r\nwith arms linked, in tears particularly because  of\r\n\r\nthe  tear-gas. The action against the students gave\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  a chance to claim that  they  were\r\n\r\ndefending   Chinese  civilisation,  education   and\r\n\r\nculture.  As  a  result, an air  of  martyrdom  was\r\n\r\nassumed by these Communist detainees. They appeared\r\n\r\nto be defenders of Chinese culture and champions of\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  This  time,  on  the  contrary,  the\r\n\r\ndetention  of these Communists has not  caused  any\r\n\r\nsurprise,  let  alone  consternation,  amongst  the\r\n\r\npublic.  On the contrary, there is an air  of  calm\r\n\r\nand tranquility. Instead of broken shop-windows and\r\n\r\nbarbed wire and troops, there is peace and business\r\n\r\nas usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists wanted an emergency meeting of\r\n\r\ntheir  United  Front  cadres, wanted  an  emergency\r\n\r\nsitting of this Assembly in the hope of whipping up\r\n\r\nexcitement  and  tensions,  all  under   cover   of\r\n\r\nprivilege.   However,  because   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, for his own reasons, also asked for  it,\r\n\r\nwe  agreed.

The meeting  in  the  house  at\r\n\r\nSembawang went on throughout the night and into the\r\n\r\nearly hours of the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this important discussion, these senior\r\n\r\ncadres,  including Lim, held a series  of  meetings\r\n\r\namongst  themselves to work out the  details  of  a\r\n\r\nplan to be implemented straightaway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communists preferred Singapore not to\r\n\r\nmerge  with the Federation. They wanted to make  it\r\n\r\ninto  a  Cuba  from which they hoped  to  mount  an\r\n\r\noffensive  against the Federation of  Malaya.  When\r\n\r\nthey  lost  the referendum last September  and  the\r\n\r\noverwhelming   majority  of   us - the   people - voted\r\n\r\ndecisively  for merger, for a peaceful  and  stable\r\n\r\nfuture  in Malaysia, they knew that their fate  was\r\n\r\nsealed.  They knew that after the 31st  of  August,\r\n\r\nthey  will face security action. The first team  of\r\n\r\nopen leaders were well known and could not withdraw\r\n\r\nand  go into hiding. Also, if they had done  this,\r\n\r\ntheir  rank  and  file would have  lost  heart  and\r\n\r\nmelted  away.  So their first team of  open  united\r\n\r\nfront  cadres  in  the political  Parties,  unions,\r\n\r\nrural  associations and cultural organisations  had\r\n\r\nto  be  sacrificed. The Communists treated them  as\r\n\r\nexpendables to be sacrificed. However,  there  were\r\n\r\nother   less  well-known  expendables - the   reserve\r\n\r\nteam - cadres  whose names and faces were  less  well\r\n\r\nknown  to  the  public. These, the  Communists  had\r\n\r\nhoped, could escape action when the first team  was\r\n\r\nremoved. They could go into hiding, since they were\r\n\r\nnot  so  well known. Their plan was that  when  the\r\n\r\nfirst team had gone after the purge, and some  time\r\n\r\nhad elapsed and things looked safe, they could come\r\n\r\nout and take over the key positions left vacant  by\r\n\r\ntheir  first  team,  and carry on  the  conspiracy,\r\n\r\nrestarting  and  re-forming the  united  front.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the three Governments knew of this  and  as\r\n\r\nthe   reserve   team  withdrew  and   took   cover,\r\n\r\nintelligence men followed to keep track of them. In\r\n\r\nsome  cases,  however, they have not  as  yet  been\r\n\r\nfound. No doubt after some time, when they think it\r\n\r\nis  safe,  they  will  come out  and  resume  their\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lim Ching Siong and his friends prepared for\r\n\r\ntrouble. They knew what they were doing was  wrong.\r\n\r\nThey  knew they were deliberately defying the  will\r\n\r\nof  the  people expressed clearly in the referendum\r\n\r\nand  they  were plotting with Azahari to  frustrate\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they failed to stop Malaysia through\r\n\r\nSingapore, they began to look around for  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans to stop Malaysia through fellow Communists in\r\n\r\nthe S.U.P.P. in Sarawak. They even plotted with  an\r\n\r\nanti-Communist adventurer like Azahari  in  Brunei.\r\n\r\nThey  knew that without the Borneo territories  the\r\n\r\nTunku  would not agree to Malaysia. So they plotted\r\n\r\nin  various  was to create trouble  in  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  to stop merger between  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. To achieve this,  Said  Zahari,  a\r\n\r\nformer editor of Utusan Melayu, who was banned from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  in 1961 after the  Utusan  strike,\r\n\r\nplayed a great part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Governments knew that Said was Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong's closest Malay associate. Said was  in\r\n\r\ntouch  with  an  intelligence agent  of  a  foreign\r\n\r\npower.  In  fact, he was in their  pay.  The  three\r\n\r\nGovernments  also  knew  that  Said  was  Azahari's\r\n\r\nadviser and contact man in Singapore. Said arranged\r\n\r\nseveral  secret meetings between Lim  and  Azahari.\r\n\r\nTheir  last meeting was four days before the revolt\r\n\r\nbroke out in Brunei. Lim Ching Siong had previously\r\n\r\ndiscussed  a  request by Azahari for money  to  buy\r\n\r\narms.  In  fact, Lim and his friends were  debating\r\n\r\nwhether to give Azahari the money for this purpose.\r\n\r\nBut  they  had their misgivings about  whether  the\r\n\r\nmoney  would be spent for the purchase of  arms  or\r\n\r\nwhether it would he spent on women for Azahari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  will  understand  from  the  brief\r\n\r\nsummary   of   these  facts  that  the   Communists\r\n\r\nknowingly took the risk of action upon themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 16th of December last year, when action\r\n\r\nhad  been  taken in Sarawak and the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, they took special preventive measures. They\r\n\r\nknew  that security actions were usually  taken  in\r\n\r\nthe early hours of the morning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen   people  were  at  home.  Lim  Ching   Siong,\r\n\r\ntherefore, gave instructions to all his first  team\r\n\r\nunited  front  cadres to stay in a different  place\r\n\r\neach night, so that the largest number of men might\r\n\r\nescape  when the purge came. It took the  police  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  trouble and men to  mark  out  the\r\n\r\ndifferent places where each of these people  stayed\r\n\r\nin the course of one week. Some of them had as many\r\n\r\nas four or five different places in a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lim himself and some leading lights in the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, including several hon. Members on\r\n\r\nthe  other  side,  took special  precautions.  They\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  since the security  action  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation and Sarawak had been taken in the  early\r\n\r\nhours  of  Sunday morning, so every Saturday  night\r\n\r\nthey  went  to a midnight show, so that they  would\r\n\r\nnot  get  home till well after two or three o'clock\r\n\r\non the Sunday morning. In this way, they would hear\r\n\r\nof  any  action that may already have been  started\r\n\r\nand  so  have time to dive for cover and elude  the\r\n\r\npolice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operations were mounted with great secrecy\r\n\r\nfrom  Johore. Yet, in spite of the strict security,\r\n\r\npartly  because  of  their early counter  measures,\r\n\r\nlike  withdrawing  their reserve team  and  getting\r\n\r\ntheir  first  team to change their sleeping  places\r\n\r\neach  night, some 18 of their important first  team\r\n\r\nmembers  could not be found, and quite a number  of\r\n\r\ntheir reserve team who had taken cover could not be\r\n\r\ntraced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members may ask why security action was\r\n\r\ntaken  on 1st February, 1963, instead of some other\r\n\r\ntime,  like  after 31st August, 1963.  Well,  there\r\n\r\nwere  urgent reasons why it had to he taken in  the\r\n\r\nearly  hours  of  the morning of 2nd  February.  An\r\n\r\nimportant  member  of the Communist  united  front,\r\n\r\nSaid  Zahari, was leaving that morning for  Jakarta\r\n\r\nwhere Azahari had just arrived the day before  from\r\n\r\nManila.  The  last  time when intelligence  reports\r\n\r\ncame to the notice of the Federation Government  of\r\n\r\nan impending revolt in Brunei by persons trained in\r\n\r\nIndonesian Borneo, no action was taken.  The  Tunku\r\n\r\nsaid  that, although he informed the British,  they\r\n\r\ndid  not  take sufficient preventive steps. British\r\n\r\nIntelligence did\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  altogether accept the imminence of the danger.\r\n\r\nIn  retrospect now, had the report been  acted  on,\r\n\r\nperhaps the Brunei revolt, which has cost a lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney,  involved  movements  of  troops  and  arms,\r\n\r\ncaused  deaths and built up an atmosphere of crisis\r\n\r\nwith some of our neighbours, may not have happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, however, none of the three Governments\r\n\r\non  the Internal Security Council was willing to be\r\n\r\ncaught  napping.  And partly because  the  security\r\n\r\naction  has been successful, the things which  were\r\n\r\nbeing  planned have not taken place. A part of  the\r\n\r\nplan   was  to  mount  demonstrations  and  violent\r\n\r\nprotests in Singapore at the same time as so-called\r\n\r\n\"volunteers\"  were  moved to renew  the  revolt  in\r\n\r\nBrunei.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three Governments on the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council, and the Intelligence information\r\n\r\navailable to the Security Council was derived  from\r\n\r\nthree intelligence agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in a position to disclose only information\r\n\r\ncollected  by  the Singapore security  organisation\r\n\r\nand  part  of  the  information  collected  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation  security organisation. The  British  do\r\n\r\nnot    wish    to   disclose   their   Intelligence\r\n\r\ninformation,  particularly information  from  their\r\n\r\nIntelligence sources in the capitals of  South-East\r\n\r\nAsian  countries. They have their reasons  for  not\r\n\r\nwanting   to   disclose   information   which   may\r\n\r\njeopardise their sources and may, even worse,  make\r\n\r\ntheir  position vis-a-vis certain powers in \r\n\r\nSouth-East   Asia  more  difficult.  Each  of  the  three\r\n\r\nGovernments  on the Security Council has  different\r\n\r\nimmediate interests, and the British have different\r\n\r\nlong-term objectives from the Federation Government\r\n\r\nand us. But nevertheless, all of us were agreed  on\r\n\r\nthe  need for immediate action. For one thing, Sir,\r\n\r\nat  that time, the Singapore Communists were making\r\n\r\nveiled threats to resort to violent struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as the 1st January this year Mr Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong, in his New Year message, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The ruling clique in the Federation is heavily\r\n\r\ncommitted  to the imperialists and will  pursue  an\r\n\r\nanti-democratic policy in the hope  of  maintaining\r\n\r\nthemselves in power indefinitely'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he ominously said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Left forces must then make the necessary\r\n\r\njudgment on the matter.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is the meaning of this? Members will\r\n\r\nremember  that every now and then Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nleaders  have  made similar statements.  They  have\r\n\r\ndone so many times in this Chamber and did so again\r\n\r\nyesterday. To us who have known the Communists  for\r\n\r\nso  long,  and  studied their  thinking  and  their\r\n\r\nmethods,  the  meaning  is  clear.  They  will  use\r\n\r\nconstitutional methods as long as these are  useful\r\n\r\nto  them. At the same time, they are ready  to  use\r\n\r\nmore  violent methods - strikes, riots, and,  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  resort, armed insurrection. These  considered\r\n\r\nstatements were made by persons of authority in the\r\n\r\nCommunist  front  movement  and  were  intended  to\r\n\r\nprepare  their cadres for stronger action when  the\r\n\r\ntime was ripe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2nd February, immediately the arrests were\r\n\r\nknown, the Member for Queenstown issued a statement\r\n\r\nin which he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the time for the people to consider\r\n\r\nseriously  whether  the present  arrests,  and  the\r\n\r\nrepressive actions have not already closed all  the\r\n\r\ndoors to constitutional struggle,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He repeated that again yesterday:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the last door to constitutional struggle is\r\n\r\nclosed, then there remains but one final answer.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  goes  on to talk of bloodshed if Malaysia  were\r\n\r\npushed through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question for the Internal Security Council\r\n\r\nwas  when  will  violence  be  mounted - before  31st\r\n\r\nAugust,  1963, or after 31st August,  1963?  It  so\r\n\r\nhappened  that events in Brunei gave  them  another\r\n\r\nopportunity to try and stop Malaysia. Let  me  give\r\n\r\nhon. Members the main outline of how the Communists\r\n\r\nin Singapore tried to exploit the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheik Azahari is not a Communist. He is too fond\r\n\r\nof  the  good life. Nor are the persons immediately\r\n\r\naround  him Communists. But for different  reasons,\r\n\r\nhe  was opposed to Brunei entering Malaysia, unless\r\n\r\nit  was  on  his terms. And the Communists  saw  in\r\n\r\nAzahari  and  the  few thousand Malays  be  led  in\r\n\r\nBrunei a convenient cover for their conspiracy. The\r\n\r\nrevolt would be made to appear as the forefront  of\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliberation  movement in Borneo and so  prevent  the\r\n\r\nBorneo   territories  from  joining  Malaysia   and\r\n\r\nwithout Borneo, the Tunku would not have Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  luck  would  have  it for the  Communists,  the\r\n\r\nFilipinos,  also  known to be anti-Communists,  had\r\n\r\nmade  claims  on North Borneo. Some  Filipinos  had\r\n\r\ndiscussions with Azahari last November and  certain\r\n\r\nFilipino   personalities  established  links   with\r\n\r\nAzahari  and settled a deal on mutually  profitable\r\n\r\nterms.  Here was the perfect blind, for nobody  can\r\n\r\naccuse   Azahari's   revolt   to   establish    the\r\n\r\nindependent  State of Kalimantan  Utara,  otherwise\r\n\r\nknown  as the United States of Borneo, as  being  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  conspiracy,  for  Azahari  was   not   a\r\n\r\nCommunist and the Filipino personalities who backed\r\n\r\nhim  were also known anti-Communists. But the irony\r\n\r\nis that the Communists made good use of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one will ever know how lucky we were that\r\n\r\nAzahari's  revolt  went off at half  cock,  earlier\r\n\r\nthan  originally  planned,  and  flopped.  Had  the\r\n\r\noriginal  plan which was co-ordinated  to  coincide\r\n\r\nwith  events outside Borneo succeeded,  the  Sultan\r\n\r\ncaptured  and made to proclaim the independence  of\r\n\r\nKalimantan  Utara,  as may well have  happened,  we\r\n\r\nwould  all have been in a very dangerous situation.\r\n\r\nBut  as  things  turned out Sheik  Azahari  was  no\r\n\r\nFerhat Abbas of Algeria. Nor was he made of sterner\r\n\r\nstuff of men like Ben Bella or Ben Khedda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Lim Ching Siong met Azahari at 11.15 on  the\r\n\r\nnight  of  4th  March,  1962,  in  secret  at   118\r\n\r\nTembeling  Road.  They met again  on  the  12th  of\r\n\r\nApril.  On  the  3rd of December,  just  four  days\r\n\r\nbefore the revolt, all the three, Messrs. Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong, Said Zahari and Azahari met at the Tiong Hwa\r\n\r\nRestaurant in Prinsep Street. Then within less than\r\n\r\n24  hours after the outbreak of the revolt  on  the\r\n\r\n8th,  the Barisan Sosialis came out in open support\r\n\r\nof the revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as May last year, Mr Lim Ching Siong\r\n\r\nwas already aware of the plans for an uprising.  He\r\n\r\nwas  then actively considering an offer of  weapons\r\n\r\nbeing made either in Singapore or in Borneo through\r\n\r\nhis  links with the S.U.P.P. He was not quite clear\r\n\r\nabout  the situation then prevailing in Brunei  and\r\n\r\nthe  offer  of weapons \"to his side\". He feared  it\r\n\r\nmight  be  a trap because he was worried  that  top\r\n\r\nlevel  \"fellows may betray him\". He also knew  that\r\n\r\nthere was a promise for troops to be sent from  the\r\n\r\nborder at the time when the revolt was mounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this while the Communists in Singapore knew\r\n\r\nwhat  was  being  hatched. In  October  last  year,\r\n\r\nseveral   weeks  before  the  revolt,   the   three\r\n\r\nGovernments  knew  that even Mr  Mahadeva  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times, now detained, knew of the impending\r\n\r\nrevolt  and had told some people that Malaysia  may\r\n\r\nnot  come  off as there was going to  be  an  armed\r\n\r\nrevolt in Brunei.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captured rebel leaders in Brunei have revealed\r\n\r\nthat Azahari had told them that he had arranged for\r\n\r\na  simultaneous uprising in Singapore at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime as.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey attacked in Brunei, Sarawak and Sabah. Lim and\r\n\r\nSaid  had  promised Azahari that they  would  mount\r\n\r\ndemonstrations  and hamper British troop  movements\r\n\r\nin  Singapore when counter action was taken by  the\r\n\r\nBritish,  and  they promised to rally  support  for\r\n\r\nthis so-called \"revolution\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a number of reasons they did not succeed. A\r\n\r\npending  retrenchment  of  over  a  thousand   Army\r\n\r\ncivilian  workers made the climate  unsuitable  for\r\n\r\ngetting  Army  civilian  workers  to  take   action\r\n\r\nagainst  base installations. Civilian employees  of\r\n\r\nthe  Army are employed in order to keep these bases\r\n\r\nready  for  an  emergency.  The  workers  were  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to  jeopardise their rice bowl  just  for\r\n\r\nCommunist  tactics. They failed to get the  workers\r\n\r\nto do things against the workers' own interests. In\r\n\r\nanger Lim issued a statement condemning the use  of\r\n\r\nthe  British bases in Singapore in crushing the\r\n\r\nso-called  \"liberation\" struggle of Kalimantan  Utara.\r\n\r\nThey  also  got  the President of  the  Naval  Base\r\n\r\nLabour  Union, Mr De Cruz, to condemn the  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  bases  in  putting down the revolt.  This  was\r\n\r\nimmediately echoed in all their other united  front\r\n\r\npublications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They called two so-called \"mass rallies\" at\r\n\r\nHollywood  Park, rather inappropriately  named  for\r\n\r\nmass  rallies,  the first by the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ndirected at the Chinese, the second by Party Rakyat\r\n\r\ndirected at the Malays. Both meetings were cold and\r\n\r\ndrew small crowds. Again they failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier they had even tried to get arms for the\r\n\r\nrebels. On 6th December last year, two days  before\r\n\r\nthe revolt broke out, Azahari went in Said's car to\r\n\r\nJalan  Spencer,  off West Coast  Road,  to  meet  a\r\n\r\ncontact to get stolen arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, the link between Lim Ching Siong and\r\n\r\nAzahari, was all this while in the pay of an  agent\r\n\r\nof an Intelligence agent of a foreign power. He has\r\n\r\nnow,  under interrogation, admitted his links  with\r\n\r\nthem.  Some  time  ago his agent was  arrested.  He\r\n\r\ndisclosed  that Said was in his pay. The agent  was\r\n\r\nreleased  and  he  returned  to  his  own  country.\r\n\r\nShortly  afterwards another man came to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe became Said's \"handling agent\", a technical term\r\n\r\nto describe a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson  who  keeps contact with  an  agent  for  an\r\n\r\nintelligence  agency.  The  first  agent  who   was\r\n\r\narrested  and released obviously did not report  to\r\n\r\nhis  organisation  that  he  had  already  revealed\r\n\r\nSaid's connections with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Azahari was last in Singapore just before he\r\n\r\nfled  to Manila, he was in constant touch with  the\r\n\r\nleading  conspirators in Singapore  and  also  with\r\n\r\ncertain  persons connected with foreign consulates.\r\n\r\nSurveillance was kept on all the key conspirators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after the revolt in Borneo, Said secretly\r\n\r\ntried  to start a movement for volunteers to  fight\r\n\r\nfor  the liberation of Azahari's Kalimantan  Utara,\r\n\r\njust  like the volunteers who were going  to  fight\r\n\r\nfor the liberation of West Irian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all this may sound a little bit ambitious now\r\n\r\nin retrospect, if  not  comic,  but these  men take themselves seriously, \r\n\r\nand we  would have  made a grave mistake if we did not take  them seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These men knew that they had lost the battle in\r\n\r\nSingapore  against Malaysia. So  they  resorted  to\r\n\r\nevery   available   device,  and  exploited   every\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  create  trouble  in   the   other\r\n\r\nterritories, particularly in Sarawak and Brunei, in\r\n\r\norder  to  stop  Malaysia. Honourable  Members  may\r\n\r\nrecall  reading  in the newspapers  of  the  sudden\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  number of Barisan  Sosialis  and\r\n\r\nother united front cadres who began to tour Sarawak\r\n\r\nand Brunei in the last few weeks before the revolt.\r\n\r\nSome  will also remember that when the revolt broke\r\n\r\nout,  they  were immediately detained and  expelled\r\n\r\nfrom  Brunei  and  Sarawak. I do  not  think  their\r\n\r\ncapacity  for harm was very great but  the  Sarawak\r\n\r\nand Brunei Governments did not think that they were\r\n\r\njust sight-seeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the experience of the Brunei revolt, it\r\n\r\nwould  be  a  mistake  to  underestimate  Communist\r\n\r\nintention  or capacity for harm. They had  said  in\r\n\r\nthe past that there would be bloodshed and violence\r\n\r\nand  they said again yesterday, through the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown, that there would be  bloodshed  if\r\n\r\nMalaysia  came about or was pushed through,  as  he\r\n\r\nput  it. This was said by some of their leaders now\r\n\r\nin detention,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Ching Siong, Mr Fong Swee Suan  and  Mr\r\n\r\nSandra   Woodhull.   Yesterday   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown repeated this threat under the cloak  of\r\n\r\nprivilege. Some people did not take them  seriously\r\n\r\nin  the  past.  Events have shown  that  they  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to  use  the Brunei  Malays  and  involve\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  conspiracy with foreign  groups  to\r\n\r\nprecipitate  armed revolt in the Borneo territories\r\n\r\nto  stop  Malaysia. Action could  not  be  delayed.\r\n\r\nAlready   relations  between  the  Federation   and\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries are gravely strained, and we\r\n\r\ncan  only  hope that goodwill from all sides,  with\r\n\r\nthe   help   of   conciliation  and  mediation   by\r\n\r\ndisinterested     officials    of     international\r\n\r\norganisations, will ease the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communists did their calculations\r\n\r\ncarefully. They knew that on or after 31st  August,\r\n\r\ntheir  united  front would be disrupted.  In  their\r\n\r\neagerness  and  recklessness to escape  this  fate,\r\n\r\nthey  involved themselves with persons who ii  turn\r\n\r\nwere   involved  with  foreign  powers.  They  have\r\n\r\nbrought  retribution  upon themselves  sooner  than\r\n\r\nthey had expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been easier for the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  leave them alone until  after  31st\r\n\r\nAugust,  for  then  the  Central  Government  would\r\n\r\nassume  complete  responsibility  for  defence  and\r\n\r\nsecurity,  and  take  over direct  control  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  and  Intelligence. But when the  Communists\r\n\r\nthreatened  the  security of Malaysia,  we  had  to\r\n\r\nagree  to  take  immediate  action  to  curb  them.\r\n\r\nProbably,  as far as Singapore alone was concerned,\r\n\r\nthey  could  not have created much trouble  because\r\n\r\nthey had already been discredited. After nearly two\r\n\r\nyears  of open confrontation and public debate  the\r\n\r\nground  was  growing  cold for  them.  The  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation  issue  they  mounted  had  failed.  Last\r\n\r\nDecember  they  had  to  abandon  their  plans  for\r\n\r\nanother  examination boycott.  Their  strikes  were\r\n\r\nfailing,  and  in fact only a few days  before  the\r\n\r\narrests,  after  fierce talk and strike  action  at\r\n\r\nMetal  Box,  Mr  Fong Swee Suan had  to  tell  the\r\n\r\nworkers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  go back with very little benefits gained and  a\r\n\r\nlot  of face lost. Their unions were breaking  away\r\n\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been able to hold the Communists down\r\n\r\nbecause we had exposed their deceit and selfishness\r\n\r\nin  opposing merger and Malaysia and isolated them,\r\n\r\nby  public  debate  and  the  open  argument.  They\r\n\r\nsuffered a humiliating defeat at the hands  of  the\r\n\r\npeople in the referendum last September. Since then\r\n\r\nwe  have  been spared a great deal of this bragging\r\n\r\nby  the  Communists  and their supporters  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that they had the masses behind them.  We\r\n\r\nhave not heard of the masses, Mr Speaker, Sir, for\r\n\r\nthe last few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons why the purges of the last\r\n\r\nGovernment were accompanied by riots and arson, and\r\n\r\ntroops had to be called out, was that Ministers  of\r\n\r\nthe  last  Government were unable or  unwilling  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the Communists in the open and argue it  out.\r\n\r\nThe result was that they lost the argument and lost\r\n\r\nthe  battle  for  hearts and minds.  So  when  they\r\n\r\ndetained  leading figures, a lot of public sympathy\r\n\r\nwas  for the Communists and against the Government.\r\n\r\nWe  must never make this error. We are prepared  to\r\n\r\njoin issue with the Communists at any time, and all\r\n\r\nthe  time, here in this Assembly, on the radio,  in\r\n\r\nT.V.,  in public forums, in public rallies, a,  the\r\n\r\nUnited    Nations,   in   Moshi,   in    Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nconferences, anywhere and everywhere. We have  even\r\n\r\ninvited  the Chairman of the Movement for  Colonial\r\n\r\nFreedom  in  London, Mr Fenner Brockway,  to  come\r\n\r\nhere,  investigate  and satisfy himself  about  all\r\n\r\nthis  rubbish of so-called torture that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown had told him about  in  his  recent\r\n\r\ntrip  to London. I am happy to say that he will  be\r\n\r\ncoming, not as early as I hoped he would be able to\r\n\r\ncome in April, but some time in May. The Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  should  remember this  before  he  goes\r\n\r\naround spreading rumours and falsehoods, that  this\r\n\r\nis  a  Government that never flinches from the open\r\n\r\nconfrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is they who fear the public debate. The\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Communists  and  other  Communist  bloc\r\n\r\ndelegates   at   the   Afro-Asian   Conference   in\r\n\r\nTanganyika feared\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe arguments of our delegates. As Members know, on\r\n\r\n1st   February  we  sent  a  delegation   to   this\r\n\r\nconference.  We  knew  that  this  conference   was\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  a Communist-dominated  Secretariat.\r\n\r\nAzahari  himself  had  said  in  Jakarta  that  the\r\n\r\nConference was dominated by Communists and that  he\r\n\r\nwas  not  going on that account. We knew  that  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  bloc  led  by  the  Communist  Party  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia would try to move a resolution condemning\r\n\r\nMalaysia  as neo-colonialist and giving support  to\r\n\r\nAzahari  as  the leader of the so-called revolution\r\n\r\nin Kalimantan Utara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian and other Communists were afraid\r\n\r\nof  our  facts  and arguments, so  they  stubbornly\r\n\r\nopposed our delegates from even presenting the case\r\n\r\nfor Malaysia before the Afro-Asian delegates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Before Lim Shee Ping was arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Shee Ping?

The\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Communists wanted to  rally  Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nopinion against Malaysia. They will try hard  first\r\n\r\nin conferences like that in Tanganyika, and if they\r\n\r\nsucceed,  then finally in the United  Nations.  The\r\n\r\nvery  fact that they have made no mention  of  this\r\n\r\nattenuated   resolution  that   has   been   passed\r\n\r\nsupporting  Azahari's Kalimantan Utara,  either  by\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian Communists in Jakarta or  by  local\r\n\r\nagents in Singapore, is an indication of the defeat\r\n\r\nthey suffered at Moshi. Sir, if they could get  the\r\n\r\nnon-aligned  countries  of  Afro-Asia  to  denounce\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  it would provide for them  a  cover  for\r\n\r\nintervention without the danger of a world war. For\r\n\r\nonce  non-Communist Afro-Asia supports a liberation\r\n\r\nmovement,  as it did in Algeria, to aid  rebels  in\r\n\r\nthe  way of arms and volunteers by other Afro-Asian\r\n\r\npowers,   it   cannot   be  easily   countered   by\r\n\r\nintervention by a major Western power.  Then  there\r\n\r\nwill  be no danger of its provoking a world war  or\r\n\r\nleading to United States intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was what happened in the case of West Irian.\r\n\r\nOnce   Afro-Asia  solidly  backed  Indonesia,   the\r\n\r\nAmericans  being practical persuaded  the  stubborn\r\n\r\nDutchmen  to give up West Trim rather than  risk  a\r\n\r\nwar  in which Afro-Asia would be against them. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  do  not say that Sarawak and Sabah is like  West\r\n\r\nIrian.  In  fact,  the  Indonesian  Communists  are\r\n\r\nrapidly  finding  that this  is  a  very  different\r\n\r\nproposition.  Sarawak, Brunei and  Sabah  were  not\r\n\r\npart  of  the Dutch empire. They belong to us,  the\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the territories which together were part of the\r\n\r\nBritish  empire  in South-East Asia.  They  do  not\r\n\r\nbelong  to the Member for Queenstown alone, and  it\r\n\r\nis  not his to give away to the Indonesians,  as  I\r\n\r\nheard  he wanted to do yesterday. If Azahari claims\r\n\r\nthe  support of 40,000 Malays in Brunei, then there\r\n\r\nare  1.2  million people in Sarawak and  Sabah  who\r\n\r\noppose  him. However, we must expect the Indonesian\r\n\r\nCommunists  to keep on trying. Our business  is  to\r\n\r\ndefeat their diplomatic and propaganda offensive at\r\n\r\nevery turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent security action was taken in a\r\n\r\ndifferent  situation from 1956. In 1956,  when  the\r\n\r\nCommunists were purged, they were part of an \r\n\r\nanti-colonial united front when we nationalists  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. were together with them fighting  a  common\r\n\r\ncolonial  enemy for our freedom. The last time,  in\r\n\r\n1956, they were purged by a Chief Secretary who was\r\n\r\na   British   official.  It  was  a   semi-colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment  whose understanding and  grasp  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist problem in an anti-colonial situation was\r\n\r\nfeeble,  and  whose  ability to  counter  Communist\r\n\r\ntactics  was pathetic. This time they were arrested\r\n\r\non   the  decision  of  the  three  Governments - the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya, an independent  nationalist\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Government of Singapore, consisting\r\n\r\nall   of   elected  Ministers,  and   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which has a defence  treaty  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya and is also responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  external  defence of Singapore. Sir,  we  have\r\n\r\ndifferent    immediate   policies   and   different\r\n\r\npolitical attitudes and different methods.  But  we\r\n\r\nall  agreed  with  the  decision  of  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council  because it  was  vital  that  no\r\n\r\nchances  should he taken that would upset  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  because we in Singapore share vital  long-term\r\n\r\nobjectives  with the Federation Government  on  the\r\n\r\ndefence and security of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persons detained were known not just to one\r\n\r\nbut  to all three security authorities of the  thee\r\n\r\nGovernments   to  be  deeply  implicated   in   the\r\n\r\nCommunist conspiracy. So there was no question of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical  victimisation or personal vendetta.  The\r\n\r\ndecision  on  who  were  to  be  detained  was   an\r\n\r\nimpersonal    one,    dispassionately    made    by\r\n\r\nprofessional  security officers whose  instructions\r\n\r\nfrom their respective Governments were to blunt the\r\n\r\nCommunist   capacity  to  mount  trouble,   leading\r\n\r\nperhaps  to violence, and to break their  lines  of\r\n\r\nconspiracy with foreign groups. The decision of the\r\n\r\nI.S.C. was not immediately to destroy all Communist\r\n\r\nunited  front  organisations. The operation  had  a\r\n\r\nlimited objective, for a specific purpose, to  meet\r\n\r\na  particular situation. So no political  Party  or\r\n\r\ntrade  union or rural association has been  banned,\r\n\r\nalthough  they are known vehicles of the  Communist\r\n\r\nunited front. Only those persons who were known  by\r\n\r\nthe  three  different security  authorities  to  be\r\n\r\ndeeply implicated in the conspiracy - in other words,\r\n\r\nthe  key activists in the political Parties, unions\r\n\r\naid rural organisations, who were their open points\r\n\r\nfor   mobilising   support   to   violent   action,\r\n\r\nmobilising their workers of farmers who  belong  to\r\n\r\nthese organisations, were detained. Because of this\r\n\r\ndirective, certain other persons, although known to\r\n\r\nthe  security organisations to be Communist  united\r\n\r\nfront cadres, were not detained in this action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956 after the purge, the Communists and their\r\n\r\nsupporters felt that victory was around the corner.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. had been fighting with them in an\r\n\r\nanti-colonial united front. They knew that when  we  won\r\n\r\nthe  general elections in 1959 and got the keys  to\r\n\r\nChangi  Prison,  we would have to open  the  prison\r\n\r\ngates  for  them.  Otherwise  we  would  have  been\r\n\r\naccused of being traitors to fellow fighters  in  a\r\n\r\ncommon anti-colonial cause. This time, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  they  know  the  e is no victory  around  the\r\n\r\ncorner.  Whoever  wants to open  the  prison  gates\r\n\r\neither   of   Changi - there  would  not  be   Outram\r\n\r\nanymore - Pudu,  Taiping  or  Johore,  must   conquer\r\n\r\nMalaya    and   Malaysia   by   force,   or    must\r\n\r\nconstitutionally win the majority of the  seats  in\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian Parliament. Neither of these two ways\r\n\r\nappears even remotely possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the most dangerous aspect of this\r\n\r\nlimited purge of Communist front organisers is that\r\n\r\nthe  country  may be lulled into a sense  of  false\r\n\r\nsecurity.  Without  the  leading  Communist   front\r\n\r\nfigures  in the open, without their wild  postures,\r\n\r\ntheir   fierce   statements,  their   strikes   and\r\n\r\ninflammatory  speeches, people may be  lulled  into\r\n\r\nbelieving that the Communist threat is gone. Let us\r\n\r\nnever  deceive  ourselves  that  this  action   has\r\n\r\nremoved  the Communist threat. Even if the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council had arrested all the other  united\r\n\r\nfront  cadres  and banned their organisations,  the\r\n\r\nproblem  would  only  be slightly  diminished.  The\r\n\r\nbasic threat remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons for this. First, the\r\n\r\nunderground  party  is still  there.  Our  security\r\n\r\norganisation  has  not succeeded  in  locating  and\r\n\r\nbreaking  up  the underground network  as  yet.  In\r\n\r\nCommunist   plans   and  calculations   they   have\r\n\r\nanticipated  the  removal  of  their  united  front\r\n\r\norganisers.  These are the \"expendables\",  the  men\r\n\r\nwho pay the price of detention in the hope that the\r\n\r\nCommunist  revolution may eventually  triumph.  Any\r\n\r\nman who is really valuable to the Communists and is\r\n\r\nnot  yet  known to security intelligence, is  never\r\n\r\nput  to  work  in  the  open to  run  the  risk  of\r\n\r\ndetention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second reason why the threat is there is that the united front framework is left intact. They have arranged the temporary withdrawal of their reserve team in the united front. A number of these men cannot immediately be traced. After some time, they will come out and\r\n\r\ncarry  on  where the first team left off.  And  the\r\n\r\nunderground leaders can always throw in a few  more\r\n\r\ntrained  cadres to help the reserve team reactivate\r\n\r\nand  revitalise  the united front, particularly  at\r\n\r\nthe  time  of elections after election  writs  have\r\n\r\nbeen  issued. Members will remember that in several\r\n\r\nmajor  pronouncements  after  the  referendum  last\r\n\r\nyear, when they knew that they had decisively  lost\r\n\r\nin  the fight against merger and Malaysia, Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong warned of the difficult struggle ahead\r\n\r\nand of the need to conserve their strength and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarry on the struggle. Well, they have done exactly\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable number of the leaders involved in\r\n\r\nthe  Communist united front are men who  have  come\r\n\r\nfrom  the Federation. Because of conditions  during\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency in the Federation and because of the\r\n\r\nsterner   measures   there   taken   against    the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  some  of their best  Communist  cadres\r\n\r\nhave come to Singapore. One of our problems is that\r\n\r\nnot  only  do  we have our own share  of  Communist\r\n\r\ncadres, but that we also have in our small island a\r\n\r\nconsiderable number of Federation Communist cadres.\r\n\r\nThis  time some 20 of them, key organisers, all  of\r\n\r\nFederation origin, have been ordered by the  I.S.C.\r\n\r\nto  be sent hack to the Federation; and there  they\r\n\r\nwill remain. They will not be allowed to return  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  to frequent their old haunts  and  cause\r\n\r\ntrouble again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those detained and those still not detained\r\n\r\nengaged  in the conspiracy should remember that  it\r\n\r\nis up to them to decide if they want a decent place\r\n\r\nin  our  society.  If they give up  this  dangerous\r\n\r\nnonsense of revolution for a Communist Malaya,  and\r\n\r\nnow  a  Communist Malaysia, and stop  taking  their\r\n\r\ndirectives  from  foreign  groups,  they   can   be\r\n\r\nreleased  immediately. We have no  desire  to  keep\r\n\r\nanybody  out of a fair share of the fruits  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  whether Chinese-educated, Malay-educated,\r\n\r\nTamil-educated, or English-educated. Everybody  can\r\n\r\nshare  in  the fruits of freedom and  join  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me remind those who are still determined\r\n\r\non  violent  revolution and the  setting  up  of  a\r\n\r\nCommunist   society,  that  this  time  they   face\r\n\r\nnationalism,  a much more formidable  and  enduring\r\n\r\nopponent   than   colonialism.   Colonialism,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, is on the way out.

He has already been totally exposed,  and\r\n\r\nnow he can only shed crocodile tears. If I were  to\r\n\r\ncompare  what  the Prime Minister says  today  with\r\n\r\nwhat  he used to thump his chest about not so  very\r\n\r\nlong   ago,   it  would  provide  very  interesting\r\n\r\nreading.  And I did tell the Prime Minister  during\r\n\r\nthe  Anson  by-election that I was running  through\r\n\r\nall his past speeches and he laughingly admitted at\r\n\r\nthat  time  that  what he said  in  July  1961  was\r\n\r\nentirely different from what he had previously said\r\n\r\nin   1954,   1955,  1956,  1957,  1958  and   1959.\r\n\r\nTherefore, today we see in the Prime Minister  only\r\n\r\na  contrast,  a shell of what he was. He  does  not\r\n\r\nspout  anti-colonialism any more. He does not spout\r\n\r\nthe cause of the exploited and of the oppressed any\r\n\r\nmore. He does not hurl defiance at the imperialists\r\n\r\nany  more.  But  now  he cows before  the  colonial\r\n\r\nmaster.

In\r\n\r\nfact, it means just the opposite, and it means  the\r\n\r\nprolongation  of colonialism only in another  form.\r\n\r\nBut,  however, I shall refer to all this  a  little\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister talks of our trying to sell the interests of Singapore and Borneo to a foreign power. Later on in my speech I will touch on many of these points, and you will be able to see that it is not us in the Barisan Sosialis who are selling the interests of our country to a foreign power. It is those people opposite who are traitors\r\n\r\nof our country and who are selling the interests of\r\n\r\nour people to a foreign power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the call for freedom in the Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.  We support the hopes and  aspirations\r\n\r\nof   the  people  in  Borneo,  and  if  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters were ever genuine in what they say,  they\r\n\r\nwould have done the same, as I will try to prove to\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir,  because at one time  they  talked  very\r\n\r\ngrandiloquently of their help and support  for  the\r\n\r\nAlgerians. The Prime Minister referred to it just a\r\n\r\nlittle while ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Prime Minister waxes eloquent\r\n\r\nwhenever  he talks on the subject of Communism.  He\r\n\r\nalways  talks of the united front organisation;  he\r\n\r\ntalks  of  the  Communist plot, and  he  refers  to\r\n\r\nMahadeva having known of the revolution in Brunei a\r\n\r\nfew  months  before. If the memory of  the  P  A.P.\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  so  short, they  would  also  have\r\n\r\nremembered  that  we  in  this  Chamber  have  been\r\n\r\ntalking of revolutions in Brunei and in the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories   many  months  before  that,   because\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is a plan meant to subjugate the  people.\r\n\r\nAnd  people  are ever ready to fight  for  justice,\r\n\r\nequality and freedom and will not submit easily  to\r\n\r\nplans imposed on them against their will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in Brunei are fighting with shotguns\r\n\r\nagainst jets and warships. Yes, with blowpipes too,\r\n\r\nand  that  shows  our Ministers opposite  that  for\r\n\r\nfreedom  people are willing to sacrifice  anything,\r\n\r\neven their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Prime Minister talks of decisions having\r\n\r\nbeen taken dispassionately by security officers. By\r\n\r\nthat,  of  course,  the Prime  Minister  means  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch. I will refer to the Special  Branch\r\n\r\na little later. And he also refers to the wisdom of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. in having the concurrence of the  three\r\n\r\nGovernments in the arrests.

If  they  were   so\r\n\r\ncourageous, let them have the Sembawang by-election\r\n\r\nstraightaway. Why are they scared in spite  of  all\r\n\r\nthe   tours  of  the  Prime  Minister  to  all  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  with  all the  beautiful  pictures\r\n\r\ntaken?  With the so-called \"support\" of the people,\r\n\r\nwhy  should they be scared? They had ample time  to\r\n\r\nprepare  the electoral registers. I have worked  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Home Affairs before,  and  I  know\r\n\r\nexactly  how  long  it takes to get  the  electoral\r\n\r\nregisters  ready. It is a patent falsehood  on  the\r\n\r\npart of the Ministers to say that they have not  as\r\n\r\nyet got ready the electoral registers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, I shall just mention the so-called\r\n\r\nconstitutional  methods  that  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwaxes  so  eloquent  about.

If  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  has  no  chance to oppose,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nBritish   Government  that  is  encouraging   armed\r\n\r\nstruggle, and all responsibility must lie with  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government and with their  P.A.P. stooges\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear that the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nMovement for Colonial Freedom.

What\r\n\r\nhappened  on that day - the black day of Singapore - \r\n\r\nis  now  history. In the early hours of the morning\r\n\r\nof 2nd February, sudden repressive action was taken\r\n\r\nagainst leaders of political Parties, trade unions,\r\n\r\nrural    organisations,   hawkers'    associations,\r\n\r\nuniversities, old boys' associations, intellectuals\r\n\r\nand   other  progressive  individuals.

The total number  under\r\n\r\ndetention,   together   with   those   from   other\r\n\r\norganisations, we now learn, is 133. Nine have been\r\n\r\nreleased,  leaving 124 still under  detention.  124\r\n\r\ninnocent  persons,  deprived  of  their  individual\r\n\r\nfreedom   and   kept  behind  walls   in   solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement, and given treatment worse than that of\r\n\r\nconvicted  criminals. Why? All because they  oppose\r\n\r\nimperialism  and neo-colonialism. All because  they\r\n\r\noppose  the British-sponsored Malaysia, and because\r\n\r\nthey,  oppose  the P.A.P. The powers  that  be,  in\r\n\r\norder  to give an excuse for locking them up,  made\r\n\r\nthem  out  to be dangerous men. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsays,  \"These  are the people who  will  mount  the\r\n\r\nbarricades.\" Yet, not so very long ago, he used  to\r\n\r\nridicule  them  as beer-hall revolutionaries.  Now,\r\n\r\nbecause  4  suits the purpose of the  P.A.P.,  they\r\n\r\nhave suddenly become dangerous men. And, of course,\r\n\r\nit  suits  the Prime Minister. But let us ask:  Did\r\n\r\nthey steal or rob? No. Did they kill or murder? No.\r\n\r\nDid  they take part in riots? No. Did they take  up\r\n\r\narms  against the Government? Again, no!  Yet,  all\r\n\r\nthese  124  persons have been arbitrarily  arrested\r\n\r\nand  detained without charge or trial, and  treated\r\n\r\nworse than convicted criminals! Why? Why, Mr Prime\r\n\r\nMinister? Why, Mr Deputy Prime Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as a result of the arrests, threats and\r\n\r\nintimidations a change has come over Singapore. The\r\n\r\npeople  prefer  not  to  talk  so  very  loudly  of\r\n\r\npolitics  these days. Many clam up on politics  the\r\n\r\nmoment  they  see  strangers around.  There  is  an\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  suspicion,  uncertainty  and  fear.\r\n\r\nThere  are so many spies and informers around  that\r\n\r\nno one can be certain that what he says will not be\r\n\r\ncarried  back  to  the ears of the  fearful  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, Singapore has become a Police State.\r\n\r\nThose in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthority  can resort to arbitrary arrests  at  any\r\n\r\ntime. The only law in the State seems to be the law\r\n\r\nof the Police, the Special Branch and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has taken place and is taking place today\r\n\r\nmerely confirms what we have all along been saying,\r\n\r\nnamely,  that  the P.A.P. is endangering  democracy\r\n\r\nand  that parliamentary democracy under the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas already become Fascist dictatorship. If such  a\r\n\r\nPolice  State  is  going  to  be  the  blessing  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, then we must be prepared for worse things\r\n\r\nto come. We need only see from how the arrests were\r\n\r\ncarried out the things to expect with the formation\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia. Innocent people engaged in legitimate\r\n\r\npursuits  have been arrested and some very  quickly\r\n\r\nwhisked  off to the Federation without the families\r\n\r\neven  notified  where they were sent.  It  is  like\r\n\r\nbeing  shanghaied, or kidnapped, and that,  by  the\r\n\r\npowers   that  be  in  the  country.   It   is   so\r\n\r\nunbelievable. The brutality and callousness of  the\r\n\r\npeople  have to be seen to be believed.  And  I  am\r\n\r\nvery glad that Mr Fenner Brockway will come  ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and see what is happening in\r\n\r\nSingapore today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And you did not even have the\r\n\r\ndecency to - [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Inquiries from anxious parents\r\n\r\nand  families  were  put off, and  in  the  anxious\r\n\r\nmoments  after  the arrests, no attempt  whatsoever\r\n\r\nwas  made  by  the  police to give any  information\r\n\r\nconcerning  the detainees in order to  allay  their\r\n\r\nanxiety.  There seems to have been a conspiracy  to\r\n\r\ninflict  mental agony and torture on the wives  and\r\n\r\nfamilies  of  the  detainees  simply  because  they\r\n\r\nhappened  to  `be  the wives and  families  of  the\r\n\r\ndetainees.    Has   the   P.A.P.   Government    no\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  principles  left?  Repeated  attempts\r\n\r\nwere  made  by us in the Barisan Sosialis,  in  our\r\n\r\ncapacity as Legislative Assemblymen, to enquire for\r\n\r\nnews  of the whereabouts of detainees and how  they\r\n\r\nwere  being detained, but our efforts were  all  in\r\n\r\nvain.   Our   requests  for  news  were  completely\r\n\r\nignored.

Is this\r\n\r\nwhat the people of Singapore had elected the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nin  1959 for - to inflict on them mental torture  and\r\n\r\nagonising anxiety, and fear of spies and informers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, there was the question of detainees\r\n\r\nbeing  sent  to  the Federation.  As  citizens  and\r\n\r\nresidents  of Singapore, why have they to  be  sent\r\n\r\noutside Singapore? The talk of \"those of Federation\r\n\r\norigin  to  be  sent  back  to  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya\", smacks too much of the imposition of\r\n\r\nextra-territorial  rights by the Federation on  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday.  In  so  transferring  persons  detained  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  the Federation, the two  Governments\r\n\r\nhave  already  violated and trampled underfoot  the\r\n\r\nfundamental human rights of the individual. Already\r\n\r\nbad  enough in the case of Singapore residents,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes   worse  in  the  case  of  the   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens. A person becomes a Singapore citizen with\r\n\r\ngreat difficulty. Yet his rights of citizenship are\r\n\r\nsummarily  swept  aside. Under  the  circumstances,\r\n\r\nwhat  legal and constitutional safeguard  is  there\r\n\r\nleft  for  the common man? The arrest of  Lim  Shee\r\n\r\nPing  is  a case in point. This is a good case  for\r\n\r\nthe   attention   of  international   jurists   and\r\n\r\nconstitutional experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Secretariat in\r\n\r\nCairo sent an invitation to the Barisan Sosialis to\r\n\r\nsend  an  observer  delegate to the  Conference  at\r\n\r\nMoshi, Tanganyika. It was decided by us to send Lim\r\n\r\nShee  Ping  as  our delegate. He left Singapore  on\r\n\r\nFriday, 1st February, 1963, and was on his  way  to\r\n\r\nMoshi when his Federation passport was withdrawn at\r\n\r\nNairobi.  The  Straits Tunes of the  4th  February,\r\n\r\n1963, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Authoritative sources disclosed tonight that he\r\n\r\nwas  intercepted at Nairobi, Kenya, on his  way  to\r\n\r\nDar-es-Salaam.   There  the   British   authorities\r\n\r\nwithdrew his Federation passport...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise, Sir. The British authorities\r\n\r\nwithdrew his Federation passport at the request  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government. He was then  put  on  a\r\n\r\nplane  hound  for Malaya. It is not  that  he  went\r\n\r\nvoluntarily by himself. But he was bodily put on  a\r\n\r\nplane bound for Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is not known when he left Nairobi and whether\r\n\r\nhe  will  be  flown  back  to  Singapore  or  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.\"   This  is  the  high-handed   action   of\r\n\r\narbitrary  arrest carried out across the high  seas\r\n\r\nand  across international boundaries. And for  what\r\n\r\nreason?  Did  he  commit  murder  or  some  serious\r\n\r\ninternational  crime that needed  the  services  of\r\n\r\nInterpol? Lim Shee Ping committed no crime. He  had\r\n\r\nbeen seen off only the day before at the Airport by\r\n\r\nmany  of  us,  and he was then on  his  way  to  an\r\n\r\nInternational  Conference. Yet he  was  arbitrarily\r\n\r\nstopped, arrested and sent back to Malaya! A  cable\r\n\r\nwas   received  from  him  informing  us  that  his\r\n\r\npassport had been withdrawn and that he expected to\r\n\r\narrive  back in Singapore at 12 midnight on Monday.\r\n\r\n4th  February,  1963. We made several  attempts  to\r\n\r\nmeet  him, but of course they were all to no avail.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter is - and here I challenge the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs in his answer to me  only\r\n\r\nyesterday - Lim Shee Ping was secretly transferred en\r\n\r\nroute  in  Bombay, or at Calcutta,  from  a  Qantas\r\n\r\nflight to an Air India flight. If, according to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home  Affairs,  he  came  back  just\r\n\r\nbecause   he   did  not  have  his  passport,   the\r\n\r\nauthorities would not have transferred him from one\r\n\r\nflight to another. And instead of arriving back  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  12  midnight as expected  or  on  an\r\n\r\nearlier Qantas flight at 7 p.m. he arrived back  in\r\n\r\nSingapore at 5 p.m instead. Instead of 12  midnight\r\n\r\nor  instead  of  a  bit earlier at  7  o'clock,  he\r\n\r\narrived  back  at  5  o'clock. This  was  specially\r\n\r\narranged by the British authorities to ensure  that\r\n\r\nwe   would  not  have  a  chance  of  meeting  him.\r\n\r\nNewspapers next morning headlined, \"In and out  and\r\n\r\nnobody knew\". \"Detainee Lim expected on one plane .\r\n\r\n.  . He came by another.\" This is the Machiavellian\r\n\r\nplotting  of  pro-colonial stooges  and  agents  in\r\n\r\norder to deprive people of their freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>(00.01 a.m., 10th April, 1963)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, 6th February, 1963, the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes, at column 4, page 5, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Reporters who were waiting near the V.I.P. Room\r\n\r\nto  interview  Dr  Subandrio, Indonesia's  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister,  did  not see him [Lim Shee  Ping]  being\r\n\r\nhustled [I wish the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs will listen to this] from\r\n\r\nthe  plane  to a police land rover. He  was  driven\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Airport through a little used gate  near\r\n\r\nthe site of the new terminal building. Later he was\r\n\r\ntransferred  to another land rover  and  driven  to\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur under a strong police escort.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such is the cloak-and-dagger story of the\r\n\r\narrest   of   Lim  Shee  Ping,  Central   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  member  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis   and\r\n\r\nadviser to the Singapore Business Houses Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion.  Yet  the arrest which was done  in  such  a\r\n\r\nsecretive manner (like the arrests of the others in\r\n\r\nthe  small  hours of the morning)  shows  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. knows  how objectionable and  hateful  such\r\n\r\narrests are in the eyes of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  arrest of Lim Shee Ping shows clearly too  how\r\n\r\nthe  abhorrent police work in Singapore.  It  shows\r\n\r\nthat  persons  can  even be arrested  in  far  away\r\n\r\ncountries in Africa. Lim Shee Ping was arrested  by\r\n\r\nthe  British authorities in Nairobi, Kenya, not  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This again shows that it is the colonial\r\n\r\noctopus,  stretching  across  countries,  seas  and\r\n\r\ncontinents, that is the real monster in Malaya. The\r\n\r\nBritish  still  control all, behind the  facade  of\r\n\r\nindependence in Malaya. The Federation merely  acts\r\n\r\nas  British  agents, protecting British  interests.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. are  only  the flunkies  of  both  the\r\n\r\nBritish  and  the Federation Governments!  Did  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore elect the P.A.P. in  1959  to\r\n\r\nbecome   flunkies   to   colonialists  and  \r\n\r\nneo-colonialists?  No,  Sir.  The  people  elected  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to carry on the anti-colonial struggle.  But\r\n\r\nnow  that  the  P.A.P. leaders have become  willing\r\n\r\nstooges of colonialism, no amount of so-called good\r\n\r\nwork  and  social  reforms, like  the  building  of\r\n\r\nflats - which  are white elephants - clinics, creches,\r\n\r\npost offices and community centres, will be able to\r\n\r\nsave  them from the wrath of the people. It is only\r\n\r\na  matter of time, and time is fast running out for\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. `colonial stooges. Though arrests by the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. were not unexpected, and I shall enlarge  on\r\n\r\nthis  a  little later, nevertheless, the suddenness\r\n\r\nof the so-called \"dawn swoop\" and the extensiveness\r\n\r\nof  the  arrests surprised the whole of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially   when  there  was  not  the   slightest\r\n\r\njustification for the arrests. Many just could  not\r\n\r\nbring  themselves to believe that  the  P.A.P. had\r\n\r\nreally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngone  to  the  extent  of repaying  past  help  and\r\n\r\nsupport  with  such gross ingratitude and  outright\r\n\r\ntreachery.  Measured by any moral standard,  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  believe  that  anyone  could  be  so\r\n\r\nungrateful.

The P.A.P. no\r\n\r\ndoubt  preferred to wait for the heat to  cool  off\r\n\r\nbefore   embarking  on  a  debate  on  the  matter.\r\n\r\nAttempts  were  made  to  use  Radio  P.A.P. as  a\r\n\r\nsubstitute for the Legislative Assembly. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhad  hoped to manipulate the radio and the  meeting\r\n\r\nfor  P.A.P. propaganda. The Government had prepared\r\n\r\nfor a very long Assembly holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Budget, you will remember, Sir, for the  first\r\n\r\nhalf  year of 1963 was passed in 1961 in  order  to\r\n\r\nallow  the  Government  to  skip  holding  Assembly\r\n\r\nsittings until the end of June. And, however  brave\r\n\r\nand  courageous, whatever front the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nmay think of putting up, we all know that it is the\r\n\r\npressure   of  public  opinion  that   forced   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to reconvene the Assembly.  We  realise\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. today will do its best to make  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for us.

What a sorry plight to see P.A.P. Ministers\r\n\r\ngrovelling  before  those whom  they  had  not  the\r\n\r\nslightest  opinion of only a short while ago!  They\r\n\r\nhave  had  no  sitting for the last  eight  months,\r\n\r\nsince the middle of July, except for a \r\n\r\nGilbert-and-Sullivan  affair on the 5th of September after  the\r\n\r\nreferendum. Many people in the United Kingdom  find\r\n\r\nit  very  difficult  to  believe  that  we  have  a\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly in Singapore today.

Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not forget that today there is a\r\n\r\nnews-gag  on us in the Barisan Sosialis. I  touched\r\n\r\non  this yesterday. The Government wants to  create\r\n\r\nthe   impression,   inside  as  well   as   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore, and the Borneo territories as Well, that\r\n\r\nthere  is  very little opposition to  Malaysia.  In\r\n\r\nfact,   there   is  a  news-gag  on  anything   and\r\n\r\neverything that is against Malaysia. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  slightest bit of pro-Malaysia  news  is\r\n\r\nplayed  up  and given big headlines.  Not  only  is\r\n\r\nthere a news-gag on the Barisan Sosialis and on all\r\n\r\nwho  are  anti-Malaysia,  but,  as  you  know,  ten\r\n\r\npublications  of  trade unions,  universities,  and\r\n\r\neven political Parties, have also been banned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince  the  arrests. There is  now  no  freedom  of\r\n\r\nassociation  and assembly. On top of all  this,  we\r\n\r\nare now denied the freedom of publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis has not been proscribed, and\r\n\r\nthe  organs  of our Party - the Chinese Barisan,  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Plebeian,  and the Malay  Rakyat - have  not\r\n\r\nbeen banned, hut attempts have been made to ban our\r\n\r\norgans  indirectly, as I mentioned  yesterday.  Our\r\n\r\nprinters had their licences suspended and they were\r\n\r\nforced  to  go out of business for ten  days.  They\r\n\r\nhave   - been given back their yearly printing  press\r\n\r\nlicences,  but  they no longer dare  to  print  our\r\n\r\nParty organs. This is the type of democracy we have\r\n\r\nin    Singapore   today:   arrests,   banning    of\r\n\r\npublications,  cruel  and  inhuman   treatment   of\r\n\r\ndetainees, and a complete denial of the fundamental\r\n\r\nrights  of  mankind. How can the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nstill  pretend to practise parliamentary  democracy\r\n\r\nin  Singapore?  No,  Sir,  this  is  the  death  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. Singapore has become a police State. The\r\n\r\nselfish interests of P.A.P. leaders and their  lust\r\n\r\nfor  power  have  turned them into Fascists.  Power\r\n\r\ntends   to  corrupt  and  absolute  power  corrupts\r\n\r\nabsolutely. This dictum is self-explanatory. It  is\r\n\r\nclear  too that State power in Singapore has fallen\r\n\r\ninto  wrong  hands, and the earlier the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nremoved  from  office, the better it  will  be  for\r\n\r\nSingapore and for every one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a number of allegations in the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council's statement issued  after\r\n\r\nthe arrests on 2nd February, chief among which are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that the Barisan Sosialis and other\r\n\r\norganisations   are  under  control   of   the Communists;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that the three Governments concur in the\r\n\r\narrests:   (this,  according  to   the   Prime Minister,   is  the  wisdom  of   the   P.A.P. Ministers)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) that the persons were arrested to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the security of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nterritories of the proposed Malaysia;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) that they were arrested because of their open\r\n\r\nsupport  of the uprising in Brunei  and  their\r\n\r\nresorting to violence and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us examine these allegations one by one,\r\n\r\nas  well  as other points in the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil's  statement  and  see  whether  they   are\r\n\r\njustifiable allegations. Let us first deal with the\r\n\r\nsubject of Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communism is the pet subject of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and is an accusation that is always raised\r\n\r\nby  the  colonialists to justify  every  repression\r\n\r\nagainst anti-colonial forces. Ever since the Second\r\n\r\nWorld   War,   and   even  before  that,   national\r\n\r\nliberation  movements,  which  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nnowadays  speaks so slightingly of, in all colonial\r\n\r\ncountries have been daily gaining in momentum,  and\r\n\r\ncolonial powers have always used this accusation to\r\n\r\ndeny   the  people  their  legitimate  rights   and\r\n\r\naspirations  in  the colonies and semi-colonies  in\r\n\r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America. The Communist bogey\r\n\r\nhas always been used to frighten and intimidate the\r\n\r\npeople. Almost all nationalist leaders in countries\r\n\r\nthat have now gained their independence had at  one\r\n\r\ntime  or  another been accused of being Communists,\r\n\r\npro-Communists  or Communist-front men.  This  has,\r\n\r\nhowever,  not  prevented  their  helping   in   the\r\n\r\nliberation of their own countries from the yoke  of\r\n\r\nforeign domination, nor the inevitable collapse  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism. Many were imprisoned for their beliefs\r\n\r\nand for the part they played in their just national\r\n\r\nstruggles. But, in almost every case, the  colonial\r\n\r\npowers had been compelled ultimately by pressure of\r\n\r\npublic  opinion and the inevitable march of history\r\n\r\nto  release  them  and to recognise  them  as  true\r\n\r\nnational leaders of their countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our country, all anti-colonial stalwarts, all\r\n\r\nwho   wage   an  uncompromising  struggle   against\r\n\r\nimperialism and colonialism, and all true patriots,\r\n\r\nhave   at   one  time  or  another  been   labelled\r\n\r\nCommunists  of  one hue or another. Even  Lee  Kuan\r\n\r\nYew, the McCarthy type anti-Communist of today, and\r\n\r\nironically     the     self-professed     Communist\r\n\r\ncollaborator\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   yesterday,  was  at  one  time  also  labelled\r\n\r\nCommunist.  He was then wearing the mask  of \r\n\r\nanti-colonialism and he was pretending to fight  against\r\n\r\nimperialism and colonialism. Of course, he  is  now\r\n\r\ncompletely unmasked. He is now exposed through  and\r\n\r\nthrough - he is now seen in his true colours - an  \r\n\r\nout-and-out  colonial  stooge, a  running  dog  of  the\r\n\r\nimperialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this charge of Communism is not new. In\r\n\r\nfact,  so long as colonialism in whatever shape  or\r\n\r\nform  exists,  and  so long as we struggle  against\r\n\r\ncolonialism, so long will this charge of  Communism\r\n\r\nhang over us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This business of the Communist conspiracy is so\r\n\r\nwidespread that it haunts even the countries of the\r\n\r\nsovereign  powers themselves. I was informed  by  a\r\n\r\nBritish  Member of Parliament, Mr William  Warbey,\r\n\r\nwhen  I was in London recently that the stories  of\r\n\r\nthe  Communist conspiracy in Singapore reminded him\r\n\r\nvery much of the stories put out before the war  by\r\n\r\nthe British Government in Britain itself. Thus, one\r\n\r\ncan see that this Communist bogey is something that\r\n\r\nis  not confined to the colonial territories alone.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also present in the very heartland  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  power  itself. In  fact,  it  is  present\r\n\r\nwherever privileged groups exist and when they  try\r\n\r\nto prolong their oppression and exploitation of the\r\n\r\npeople.  It is especially used by Fascist dictators\r\n\r\nand tyrannical oppressors who find in the Communist\r\n\r\nbogey an excuse for all sorts of repressive actions\r\n\r\nand  terror. Hitler made use of this bogey, and  we\r\n\r\nknow today what the world thinks of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In British territories the world over today,\r\n\r\nwherever there is a national liberation movement or\r\n\r\nsome  strong Opposition to colonial rule  there  is\r\n\r\nthis Communist label bandied around. So, in Malaya,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Federation  politicians  and  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister make this same accusation, they are merely\r\n\r\nechoing  the words of British colonialism  in  many\r\n\r\nparts of the world. Indeed, they are merely joining\r\n\r\nthe  chorus  of  men like Chiang Kai-shek,  Syngman\r\n\r\nRhee  and Ngo Dinh Diem - Fascist dictators  who  use\r\n\r\nanti-Communism as an excuse for all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsorts  of  repressions. We have  already  seen  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education making friends with Ngo Dinh\r\n\r\nDiem,  a  person  whom the Prime Minister  used  to\r\n\r\ncondemn not so very long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember, when we talk of Communism, that\r\n\r\nthe M.C.P. has been an illegal organisation for the\r\n\r\nlast  15  years, and every effort has been made  by\r\n\r\nthe  police and colonial troops to hunt down  every\r\n\r\nCommunist.  It  is convenient to label  all  strong\r\n\r\nopposition as Communists, as it paves the  way  for\r\n\r\nthe  colonial power to invoke the law against  such\r\n\r\nopposition.  But  what  is  the  result   of   such\r\n\r\nCommunist-labelling?  It  does   Snot   solve   the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  poverty.  It  only  results  in   the\r\n\r\ncrippling  of  all democratic forms  Of  expression\r\n\r\nthat  exist.  Already  we see the  Communist  label\r\n\r\nbeing  used in Singapore to deny workers and  trade\r\n\r\nunions  their  fundamental  rights  of  freedom  of\r\n\r\nassociation  and  assembly. Even political  Parties\r\n\r\nhave   been  similarly  denied  their  freedom   of\r\n\r\nassembly.  I do not need to mention the banning  of\r\n\r\nthe  ten  publications  and journals  of  political\r\n\r\nParties,  trade  Unions,  universities  and   other\r\n\r\norganisations.  Those who wish to  oppose  Malaysia\r\n\r\nconstitutionally, like our comrades and friends  in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis and other political  Parties,\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and civic organisations,  have  been\r\n\r\narbitrarily arrested and detained. This  Government\r\n\r\nsimply  hangs  the Communist label  on  them.  This\r\n\r\nlabel  of  Communism is, with few exceptions,  only\r\n\r\napplied  to  persons of Chinese origin.  The  Party\r\n\r\nRakyat  and  the people of Brunei revolted  against\r\n\r\nthe imposition of Malaysia, but being mostly of the\r\n\r\nMalay race, the charge of Communism is not levelled\r\n\r\nat  them. Of course, this is only an example Of the\r\n\r\ncolonial   policy   of   divide   and   rule.   The\r\n\r\ncolonialists  hope  to  fan the  flames  of  inter-communal  suspicion and discord. The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  played  the  some colonial  game  when  he\r\n\r\n\"advised\"  the  Chinese in Sabah  to  quickly  join\r\n\r\nMalaysia  by  emphasising that the Brunei  uprising\r\n\r\nwas mainly a Malay revolt. This is only one example\r\n\r\nof the communal policies of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the opposition to Malaysia has a genuine\r\n\r\nbasis  and  has  nothing to do with  any  Communist\r\n\r\nplot,  indeed,  this opposition is because  of  the\r\n\r\nimperialist   plot.  Instead   of   answering   the\r\n\r\ninjustices  of  the  Malaysia  Plan,  the  British,\r\n\r\nFederation and Singapore Governments run away  from\r\n\r\nanswering  by calling us Communists and by  putting\r\n\r\nleaders,  who  oppose  Malaysia,  in  prison.  They\r\n\r\ncannot   answer   our  proof   that   Malaysia   is\r\n\r\nunacceptable  to the majority of the people.  Their\r\n\r\nanswer  is  the answer of Fascist dictators - arrest,\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and torture. By crying Communism,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  they  hope to side-track the attention  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  from their oppression and exploitation\r\n\r\nand to confuse them. By arresting the leaders, they\r\n\r\nhope  also  to intimidate the people into  abjectly\r\n\r\naccepting   Malaysia   and   to   prevent   further\r\n\r\nopposition  to the Malaysia Plan. As I  have  said,\r\n\r\nthey  want to create the impression to the  outside\r\n\r\nworld  that  there  is  very little  opposition  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and that the majority support  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nOf   course,  the  reverse  is  the  case  but   so\r\n\r\nfrightened  are they of the true facts being  known\r\n\r\nto  the outside world that they have to arrest  Lim\r\n\r\nShee  Ping,  our  delegate to the Moshi  Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nConference, before he arrived there. And  when  the\r\n\r\nuninvited  P.A.P. delegation failed  to  gate-crash\r\n\r\ninto the conference, they turned round to cry \"sour\r\n\r\ngrapes\"   and  accused  the  conference  as   being\r\n\r\nCommunist-dominated.  This alone  shows  how  ready\r\n\r\nthey  are to use the Communist label on those  who\r\n\r\ndo not accept their policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, therefore, that no weight can be put\r\n\r\non  the allegation in the Internal Security Council\r\n\r\nstatement  that the Barisan Sosialis is  controlled\r\n\r\nby  the Communists. As I have said on many previous\r\n\r\noccasions,   the  Communist  label   means   strong\r\n\r\nopposition.  To  say that the Barisan  Sosialis  is\r\n\r\nunder the control of the Communists only means that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. recognise  the  strength  and  popular\r\n\r\nsupport of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.32 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch a little on why the P.A.P. is so\r\n\r\nfond  of this Communist line. Why is the P.A.P. so\r\n\r\nfond  of  the  Communist bogey? The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ndelights  in  talking  about Communism.  He  enjoys\r\n\r\ntalking  Communism and for very good  reasons  too.\r\n\r\nWhy? Let us analyse why. The Prime Minister and his\r\n\r\nopportunistic friends like the Communist line. Why?\r\n\r\nBecause  with  this Communist bogey, they  hope  to\r\n\r\ndeceive  the  people  and  frighten  them.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  mentioned  that.  They  hope  to  use  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  bogey  as  a  tool  by  which  to  crush\r\n\r\npolitical  opposition  and if political  opposition\r\n\r\ncould  be crushed, then, of course, there would  be\r\n\r\nno great difficulty in their maintaining themselves\r\n\r\nin office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis today offers the greatest\r\n\r\neffective  opposition to the P.A.P. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  objective of the P.A.P. is to  identify  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  with the  Communist  bogey,  and\r\n\r\nthrough the excuse and pretext of dealing with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  the P.A.P. hope to hit at the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and  all other organisations  that  offer\r\n\r\neffective  Opposition to the P.A.P. That is  reason\r\n\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is the Prime Minister uses the\r\n\r\nomnipresent Communist as a ready-made scapegoat for\r\n\r\nall  the  sins  of commission and omission  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Thus blames the Communist for  all  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. mistakes and failures, for all  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbroken  promises,  for all the P.A.P. undemocratic\r\n\r\nand  Fascist  repressive actions,  for  all  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nreactionary  and  pro-colonial policies.  In  fact,\r\n\r\neverything  that  goes  wrong  is  indiscriminately\r\n\r\nblamed on the omni-present Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is this. It follows from this\r\n\r\nthat since all mistakes and faults are laid at  the\r\n\r\ndoor-step   of  the  Communist  bogey,  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   and  his  P.A.P.  Ministers  can   claim\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  be  always  right,  to  be   always\r\n\r\ninfallible. They then hope to absolve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthemselves  from all blame under all circumstances,\r\n\r\nand  on all big vital issues that have aroused  the\r\n\r\nindignation of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth reason is this. The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nalso  uses  this Communist bogey with the  hope  of\r\n\r\nsilencing  opposition  to P.A.P. undemocratic  and\r\n\r\nFascist  ways. As the M.C.P. is an illegal body  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation, no one will  be  able\r\n\r\nto  speak up in public on its behalf without at the\r\n\r\nsame  time  being  smeared  as  Communist  or \r\n\r\npro-Communist. Thus the Prime Minister hopes to silence\r\n\r\neven the uncommitted into not daring to openly  and\r\n\r\npublicly  oppose or criticise P.A.P. leaders.  With\r\n\r\nluck,  the  Prime  Minister  also  hopes  even   to\r\n\r\nintimidate them into \"supporting\" the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reason No. 5 is this. With this Communist bogey,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. hopes also to alienate certain sections\r\n\r\nof  the people from us in the Barisan Sosialis  and\r\n\r\nthus  restrict and limit the growing  strength  and\r\n\r\ninfluence of the Barisan Sosialis. Thus,  from  the\r\n\r\nvery beginning, since our break with the P.A.P., we\r\n\r\nin   the   Barisan  Sosialis  have  been   labelled\r\n\r\nCommunist   and  pro-Communist,  and  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and other anti-P.A.P. organisations  have\r\n\r\nbeen labelled Communist front organisations, and so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12 radio talks and the publication of\r\n\r\nthousands  and thousands of The Battle  For  Merger\r\n\r\nbooklets  were all designed to scare  and  frighten\r\n\r\npeople away from us in the Barisan Sosialis.  Thus,\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  bogey becomes the  useful  tool  by\r\n\r\nwhich   P.A.P. leaders  hope  to  crush  political\r\n\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All through the past two or three years, we have\r\n\r\nseen  how  the  P.A.P. work this  bogey  line.  For\r\n\r\ninstance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) In an attempt to crush political opponents\r\n\r\nand  to  salvage their personal political fortunes,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. leaders support the  British-sponsored\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan. They strain every sinew  and  exert\r\n\r\nthe utmost effort to sell the Plan to the people of\r\n\r\nthe five territories and proclaim that all this  is\r\n\r\nmeant to fight Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Similarly they claim that the obnoxious clause 29 and the whole sham referendum itself were meant ---\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  have used the Communist  bogey  to  good\r\n\r\npurpose;  all to serve their own personal interests\r\n\r\nand,  of  course, the interests of  their  colonial\r\n\r\nmasters. All this Communism business, of course, is\r\n\r\nlinked  up with the Special Branch and the P.P.S.O.\r\n\r\nAnd  since  the  P.A.P. leaders have  served  their\r\n\r\ncolonial masters so very faithfully, they  are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  entitled  to  full  encouragement  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  The P.A.P. now have the  active \r\n\r\nco-operation of the organs of repression used  by  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists  and imperialists for  the  oppression\r\n\r\nand  exploitation  of the people.  Their  so-called\r\n\r\nIntelligence  Department  of  Singapore   is   this\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch. The Special Branch is one  of  the\r\n\r\nmain  organs of colonial repression. It is the most\r\n\r\nnoxious  organ of imperial rule, and  in  a  colony\r\n\r\nlike Singapore, it can be said that the real rulers\r\n\r\nare not the P.A.P. Ministers but the Special Branch\r\n\r\nof the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Emergency in June 1948, repressive\r\n\r\nlaws  have turned our country into a police  state.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Emergency Regulations were withdrawn  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  1955,  they  were  replaced  by  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O. and under the P.P.S.O., large numbers  of\r\n\r\nour  patriots and anti-colonial stalwarts have been\r\n\r\narrested and detained without trial. Many are still\r\n\r\nlanguishing  in  prison after seven  years  without\r\n\r\ncharge  or trial, detained at the pleasure  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonial masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\r\n\r\nArticles  18 and 19 have this to say. This  is  the 1945 \r\n\r\nUnited Nations Universal Declaration of Human\r\n\r\nRights. Article 18 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Everyone has the right to freedom of thought,\r\n\r\nconscience and religion. The right includes freedom\r\n\r\nto change his religion or belief and freedom either\r\n\r\nalone  or  in  company  with others  in  public  or\r\n\r\nprivate  to  manifest  his religion  or  belief  in\r\n\r\nteaching, practice, worship and observance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 19 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and\r\n\r\nexpression.  This right includes  freedom  to  hold\r\n\r\nopinions without interference and to seek,  receive\r\n\r\nand  impart information and ideas through any media\r\n\r\nand regardless of frontiers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This   is  our  Universal  Declaration  of   Human\r\n\r\nRights, Articles 18 and 19. But what do we find  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   the   Borneo   territories   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation?  It  is  entirely  different  from  the\r\n\r\nrecognised United Nations Universal Declaration  of\r\n\r\nHuman  Rights. The Constitution lays it  down  that\r\n\r\nthere   is   freedom  of  speech  and  publication,\r\n\r\nassociation and assembly. But it is not the  rights\r\n\r\nthat  exist  on paper that count. It is whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  these rights can be exercised and enforced  in\r\n\r\npractice  that really counts. Voltaire  many  years\r\n\r\nago said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I detest your views. But I am prepared to die for\r\n\r\nyour right to express them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Can  the  Prime Minister and his Ministers rise  to\r\n\r\njust one-hundredth of the stature of Voltaire?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today to deny these rights to the people,\r\n\r\nsubterfuges  and cover-up charges are laid  at  the\r\n\r\ndoor-steps of the people. And under the pretext  of\r\n\r\nsafeguarding   the   \"security   of   the   state,\"\r\n\r\nrepressive  action  has been  extensively   carried\r\n\r\nout! The mere fact that these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallegations  are made and no charge  and  trial  is\r\n\r\ngiven shows the hollowness of the allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Special Branch? I had worked in the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Home Affairs for a short period  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  come  to learn a number of detestable  things\r\n\r\nabout  the  Special Branch. We all  know  that  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch in Singapore is merely an off-shoot\r\n\r\nof  the secret police started in the middle of  the\r\n\r\n19th  century in England itself. Spies  and  agents\r\n\r\nwere  employed by the Government at the  time  when\r\n\r\nthe   struggle  between  the  capitalists  and  the\r\n\r\nworkers were assuming significant proportions.  And\r\n\r\nthese  spies and agents were employed to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe working class in the land of the very heart  of\r\n\r\nimperialism itself. This secret police very rapidly\r\n\r\nexpanded its influence all-pervadingly to  all  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  departments, not  only  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom, but very quickly also to the colonies. Its\r\n\r\npowers  are  extensive.  Even  Parliament  and  our\r\n\r\nAssembly  have no say in the running of the  secret\r\n\r\npolice,  and  I  dare say even the Ministers,  more\r\n\r\noften  than not, know nothing of what is  happening\r\n\r\ninside   the  Special  Branch  in  Robinson   Road,\r\n\r\nSingapore,   to   say   nothing   of   Assemblymen,\r\n\r\nBackbenchers and other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned the other day, when one of the\r\n\r\nMinisters  was  asked why there should  be  arrests\r\n\r\nthis time, that he said he knew nothing of what was\r\n\r\nhappening. He did not know a single thing  and  yet\r\n\r\nhe  is  a  Minister of the Government  today!  This\r\n\r\nmerely proves my point, Sir, that even Ministers do\r\n\r\nnot know what is happening in Robinson Road Special\r\n\r\nBranch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Branch is there to serve not the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  people  of  Singapore  but  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  colonialism  and  imperialism.   The\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch is directly linked with the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  Commissioner in Singapore and the big-wigs\r\n\r\nof  the British Military Forces who are here not to\r\n\r\nserve the interests of the people of Singapore, but\r\n\r\nto serve the interests of people outside Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  are  here,  not to give us  freedom,  but  to\r\n\r\noppress  and to deny the people of Singapore  their\r\n\r\nlegitimate  hopes and aspirations. The wide  powers\r\n\r\nof arrests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand detention given to the Special Branch under the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O. surprised even the people of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  itself. There in the United  Kingdom,  the\r\n\r\npowers of the secret police are strictly limited by\r\n\r\nthe  safeguards in the habeas corpus. This  is  not\r\n\r\npossible in Singapore today under the P.P.S.O.  And\r\n\r\nfrom this alone, Sir, we should be able to see what\r\n\r\na  repressive instrument the P.P.S.O. is  today  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Special Branch, being merely a\r\n\r\ncolonial  organ  of repression, maligns  all  \r\n\r\nanti-colonial   political  Parties,  organisations   and\r\n\r\nprogressive individuals as Communists and those who\r\n\r\noppose  the  P.A.P. are, of course,  automatically\r\n\r\nCommunists. The Prime Minister tells us  there  are\r\n\r\nonly  300  Communists  in  Singapore.  But  because\r\n\r\nhundreds  of thousands in political Parties,  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and civic organisations oppose the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthese  hundreds  of  thousands  have  all  suddenly\r\n\r\nbecome  Communists.  The  Prime  Minister  used  to\r\n\r\nridicule  them and called them all sorts  of  fancy\r\n\r\nnames. They were all beer-hall revolutionaries,\r\n\r\narm-chair revolutionaries and what-not. But because  he\r\n\r\nfears  their  opposition today, he has  arbitrarily\r\n\r\narrested  them, detained them. Now he has a  chance\r\n\r\nto  pose  to  the  people again, not  as  an  \r\n\r\nanti-colonialist, but as an oppressor of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Branch, of course, is served very\r\n\r\nwell  with  spies and informers. We see  them  very\r\n\r\nfrequently  nowadays. They are  always  waiting  in\r\n\r\nlanes  and all sorts of odd places. In our  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  headquarters, we have  spies  and  agents\r\n\r\nopposite us, around us, below us ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Above us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- and there are Special Branch\r\n\r\nofficers who are permanently stuck to coffee shops,\r\n\r\nand just do not budge. Some of them, of course,  do\r\n\r\nit  very  openly. They know that we know  them  and\r\n\r\nthey  do not even bother to cover up the fact  that\r\n\r\nthey are undercover agents. Sometimes they pose as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloving  couples. But, of course, it does  not  make\r\n\r\nmuch  difference as to how they pose. We  can  deal\r\n\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few people understand how the Special Branch\r\n\r\nworks.  That they open letters, tap our telephones,\r\n\r\ncensor our communications coming into and going out\r\n\r\nof  the country and tail people around like dogs is\r\n\r\nan open secret. But how spies, informers and agents\r\n\r\nprovocateurs work is not so well-known. But however\r\n\r\nthe spies and informers work, they have been proved\r\n\r\nto be the most unreliable of witnesses. The case of\r\n\r\nTommy Koh is still fresh in our minds. I have  read\r\n\r\nhow  the Un-American Committee works in America and\r\n\r\nI  have  read  also how thousands and  millions  of\r\n\r\npounds have been put aside for the secret police in\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom. But all of us know that  these\r\n\r\ninformers do not speak the truth. They cannot speak\r\n\r\nthe  truth and all of them mix a little truth  with\r\n\r\nlots of falsehood. The very nature of spying itself\r\n\r\nrequires that they keep on lying. They spy and  lie\r\n\r\nall  the  time. An undercover agent has to  deceive\r\n\r\nassociates  into  thinking  him  to   be   one   of\r\n\r\nthemselves. And the longer the spies and  informers\r\n\r\nare  at  their jobs the greater is the blurring  of\r\n\r\nthe  thin  line between truth and falsehood.  These\r\n\r\nspies,  in order to gain the good favours of  their\r\n\r\nsuperiors, very, very often have great imagination.\r\n\r\nThe  imagination turns to beautiful embroidery  and\r\n\r\nfabrication of events that did not take  place  and\r\n\r\nof  words that were never said. Moreover, there  is\r\n\r\nno  possibility of verifying the reports  of  spies\r\n\r\nand   informers.  The  mistakes  of   doctors   and\r\n\r\naccountants can be checked, but the only witness to\r\n\r\nso-called conspiracy is the victim the spy wants to\r\n\r\npunish. Under those circumstances, how can we  ever\r\n\r\nbelieve the words of these spies and informers  the\r\n\r\nweight  of  whose information the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\ndepends on so heavily?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obsession about anti-Communism and so-called\r\n\r\nsecurity  have  merely  degenerated  into  outright\r\n\r\nattacks  on  freedom  of  speech  and  publication,\r\n\r\nassociation  and  assembly.  For  those  who   seek\r\n\r\nemployment,  there is the screening  apparatus  and\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade full use of this to deny many innocent persons\r\n\r\nof  their  means  of livelihood. There  are \r\n\r\nscare-headlines of the Communist menace like the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  poster headline this morning of \"inquiry  of\r\n\r\nReds   in  trade  unions.\"  I  am  sure  tomorrow's\r\n\r\nheadline   will  carry  further  dangers   of   Red\r\n\r\ninfiltration  in Singapore. These are all  intended\r\n\r\nto  strike fear into the hearts of the ordinary man\r\n\r\nin  the  Street and to restrain him and to  silence\r\n\r\nhim  and  to  caution him, if he  should  be  brave\r\n\r\nenough to oppose the P.A.P., to be careful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore today, because of the Special Branch\r\n\r\nand  the  exploitation  of  anti-Communism  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  there  is, as I have said,  fear  in  many\r\n\r\nplaces - fear of being named by the Special  Branch\r\n\r\nto be linked with the Barisan Sosialis, so much so'\r\n\r\nthat  there  is also fear of coming out  boldly  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  just  causes  and  movements  for  the\r\n\r\nimprovement of the livelihood of the workers --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Who wrote that for you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- and fear of being seen by\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch informers attending Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nrallies.  The Prime Minister himself said a  little\r\n\r\nwhile  back  that  it was to see who  attended  our\r\n\r\nrally  that he gave us a permit for our rally.  The\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch men were there to intimidate all who\r\n\r\nattended  our rally. Then again, there i5  fear  of\r\n\r\nopenly  buying  anti-P.A.P. newspapers,  like  the\r\n\r\nPlebeian,  and  there  is fear  of  buying  reading\r\n\r\nmaterial, books and literature which are considered\r\n\r\nundesirable  by  the Special Branch;  the  fear  of\r\n\r\nbeing  seen to be chummy and friendly with  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis leaders, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal a little bit with the so-called\r\n\r\nconcurrence  of the three parties and the  security\r\n\r\nof   the   State.  The  I.S.C. statement  stresses\r\n\r\nconcurrence  of the three parties - the British,  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  the  Singapore Governments - on  the\r\n\r\narrests  on  2nd February, 1963. It  was  not  just\r\n\r\nbecause the United Kingdom wants to take repressive\r\n\r\naction,  not just because the Federation  wants  to\r\n\r\narrest  anybody, not  - just he cause  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment wants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  lock  someone up, not because any  one  of  the\r\n\r\nTroika of the I.S.C., but because all the three - the\r\n\r\nBritish,   the   Federation,  and   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernments - concur  and  want  to  take  repressive\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister calls this the wisdom of the P.A.P. But why this emphasis? The answer is simple, it is obvious that none of the three alone would like to face the music of (he wrath of the people. But let us first find out why the British and the Federation Governments want to take repressive action. The British are cunning and experienced\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  They  have  been  at  the  game  for\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  years and from past  experience  they\r\n\r\nknow  that repressive action of any sort will  only\r\n\r\nengender  resentment and bitter  hatred  among  the\r\n\r\npeople.  If  the  British alone were  to  take  any\r\n\r\nrepressive  action,  they alone  would  become  the\r\n\r\nobject of opprobrium and hatred of the people, They\r\n\r\nwould  therefore prefer that repressive  action  be\r\n\r\ntaken  by stooges, if possible. It would take  away\r\n\r\nthe  sharp  edge  of  criticism  of  world  opinion\r\n\r\nagainst them. The stooges would then have to  share\r\n\r\nand  even  take the brunt of resentment and  hatred\r\n\r\nthat  such repressive action would cause. Moreover,\r\n\r\nit  would  allow the British to present  themselves\r\n\r\nstill  as  democrats. And if embarrassing questions\r\n\r\nare  asked in the British Parliament, for instance,\r\n\r\nthey could pass the buck on to the local Government\r\n\r\nand   their   stooges,  and  let  them   fend   for\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Thus we see the pantomime  enacted  in\r\n\r\nthe   British  Parliament  immediately  after   the\r\n\r\narrests. In the U.K. Hansard of 4th February, 1963,\r\n\r\ncol. 37, Mr Warbey is quoted to have said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Secretary of State said that the people who\r\n\r\nhave  been  arrested  were  all  known  Communists,\r\n\r\nengaged  in subversive activities. Can we take  it,\r\n\r\nthen,  that all of them will he immediately put  on\r\n\r\ntrial?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And then Mr Sandys replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That will be for the Government of Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Just  one small sweet sentence: \"That will  be  for\r\n\r\nthe Government of Singapore.\" [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, the British imperialists\r\n\r\nare  the  arch  enemies of the  people,  but  their\r\n\r\nstooges,  the  P.A.P. Ministers of Singapore,  will\r\n\r\nhave  to answer to the people. Here we see how  the\r\n\r\nBritish  work:  they  always leave  the  unpleasant\r\n\r\nthings  to be answered by their stooges,  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this aim in view, the British had for a long\r\n\r\ntime cajoled and egged the P.A.P. on, praising  the\r\n\r\ncleverness,  intelligence,  ingenuity,  brilliance,\r\n\r\nand  what-not, of the P.A.P. leadership and leading\r\n\r\nthem  on by the nose and soft-soaping them all  the\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, fearing the strength of the working\r\n\r\nclass  support  for the policies  which  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  then pretended to adhere to, the  British\r\n\r\nhad done everything they could to prevent the P.A.P\r\n\r\nfrom  gaining power. But the popular will  at  that\r\n\r\ntime  could  not be thwarted, and in spite  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  the  P.A.P. came to power in  1959.  Since\r\n\r\nthey  could not prevent the P.A.P. from coming into\r\n\r\noffice,   they  did  the  next  best  thing.   They\r\n\r\nmanoeuvred and engineered a situation such that the\r\n\r\npersonal  interests of the P.A.P. leadership  would\r\n\r\ncoincide  with  the interests of the British.  Once\r\n\r\ntheir interests coincide, they would then goad  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. into taking repressive action  as  part  of\r\n\r\ntheir desperate efforts to check the advance of the\r\n\r\ngrowing strength of the anti-colonial movement.  In\r\n\r\nthis manner the British would achieve the objective\r\n\r\nof protecting and preserving their interests in the\r\n\r\narea and, of course, getting the stooges to do  the\r\n\r\ndirty work for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this situation that has been engineered\r\n\r\nand  manoeuvred by the colonial master? It  is  the\r\n\r\nsituation  that has arisen with, and is the  result\r\n\r\nof,  the  development of Malaysia. It  has  already\r\n\r\nplaced the P.A.P. in the most absurd and ridiculous\r\n\r\nposition of a political Party that professees to be\r\n\r\nanti-colonial having to fight instead  the  battles\r\n\r\nfor  the  colonial  master  and  having  to  defend\r\n\r\ncolonialism against the masses. It is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  British that has to sell the idea of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nbut   their  No.  1  salesman - the  Lee   Kuan   Yew\r\n\r\nclique - that travels all round the world  hoping  to\r\n\r\ndeceive other countries about Malaysia. It  is  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew and Company and not the British  who  are\r\n\r\nthe   most  vociferous  and  demonstrative  in  the\r\n\r\npropaganda promotion and defence of Malaysia.

He  was showered with  praise  from  the\r\n\r\ncolonial master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally today the ridiculous position in which\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. has found itself has caused it to  take\r\n\r\nrepressive  action against the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\na  treachery  which  will condemn  the  P.A.P. for\r\n\r\ngenerations to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British lion indeed has very seductively and\r\n\r\ncunningly  manoeuvred the P.A.P  into  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  the P.A.P. willy-nilly becomes the  handmaid\r\n\r\nand  errand boy of British imperialism. The British\r\n\r\nwant  to  protect and preserve their  interests  so\r\n\r\nthat they may continue to exploit the resources  in\r\n\r\nthe   region:   and   this  they  have   apparently\r\n\r\ntemporarily  succeeded in so doing, thanks  to  the\r\n\r\nmass  arrests. Thanks to the collaboration of their\r\n\r\nminions and stooges in the P.A P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the British, therefore, to concur with the\r\n\r\nrepressive action on 2nd February, 1963, or at  any\r\n\r\ntime   for   that  matter,  is  not  difficult   to\r\n\r\nunderstand.  The history of the United Kingdom  and\r\n\r\nthe  history of the British Empire abound with such\r\n\r\nrepressive actions. Pick up any history book,  even\r\n\r\na British one, and we see repression and oppression\r\n\r\nwritten on every page - repression which they  have\r\n\r\neuphemistically   called  \"the  glory   of   Empire\r\n\r\nbuilding\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what of the Federation Government? The\r\n\r\nFederation  Government is a Right-wing, feudalistic\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It  represents the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nfeudalists,  the Right-wing reactionary compradores\r\n\r\nand the privileged few. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.   Alliance,  catering  for   opportunists,\r\n\r\ncommunalists  and political careerists,  have  long\r\n\r\nbeen  schooled and nurtured by the British as their\r\n\r\nfaithful ally, collaborator and agent, so that they\r\n\r\nmay continue to look after British interests. In so\r\n\r\ndoing,   they  of  course  look  after  their   own\r\n\r\ninterests as well, the privileged and the  selected\r\n\r\nfew.  The  interests of the vast  majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  -  of the workers, farmers and\r\n\r\nfishermen  - are but of secondary importance to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reactionary Government in the Federation\r\n\r\nfears  the growing strength of the socialist forces\r\n\r\nand,   dominated  by  the  communal  and  sectional\r\n\r\ninterests,  it has already from time to  time  made\r\n\r\narrests  of  anti-colonial forces to  prevent  them\r\n\r\nfrom  reaching and enlightening the masses  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas. The Alliance would prefer  to  benumb\r\n\r\nthe  masses  with communal propaganda  and  prevent\r\n\r\nthem from knowing the real causes and root of their\r\n\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Singapore is different compared\r\n\r\nto  that in the Federation. Here the masses through\r\n\r\nyears  of  anti-colonial  struggle  have  gained  a\r\n\r\nbetter   insight  into  the  workings  of  colonial\r\n\r\npropaganda. They know that their interests coincide\r\n\r\nwith  the interests of the working class as a whole\r\n\r\nand,  with the guidance and leadership of a  strong\r\n\r\nLeft-wing movement, they are daily marching forward\r\n\r\nwith the advance of socialist forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government, being reactionary and\r\n\r\nfeudalistic,  therefore, fears a  strong  Left-wing\r\n\r\nmovement    in    Singapore.    Communally-inspired\r\n\r\npoliticians  in  the  Federation  fear   that   the\r\n\r\ninfluence  of Left-wing forces will extend  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation. They fear that Singapore will become  a\r\n\r\n\"Cuba\",  as  the Prime Minister says, and  just  as\r\n\r\nPresident  Kennedy  wants to remove  the  so-called\r\n\r\nsubversion  of Cuba, so the Federation  politicians\r\n\r\ntoday want to contain and control and, if possible,\r\n\r\ncompletely  suppress  the  Left-wing  movement   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Emmanuel Pelaez, Vice-President of the Philippines, had said in London that they were given to understand that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  primary purpose of the proposed Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is, as it were, to \"sterilise\"  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  centre of so-called Communist influence.  In\r\n\r\naddition, should Malaysia really be imposed on  the\r\n\r\npeople against their will through the use of  brute\r\n\r\nforce  and  in  complete disregard  of  the  danger\r\n\r\nsignals,  the  Left-wing forces in Singapore  could\r\n\r\nstill become a constant headache, to say the least,\r\n\r\nto  whatever  Grand  Alliance the  Tunku  and  \r\n\r\npro-Malaysia  forces may be able to form in Malaya  and\r\n\r\nin the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, the Federation most\r\n\r\ncertainly   would   like  to  remove   all   strong\r\n\r\nopposition in Singapore whenever possible.  So  the\r\n\r\nFederation's  concurrence with the arrests  on  2nd\r\n\r\nFebruary is also not unexpected. The British  agree\r\n\r\nto  the  arrests and the Federation agrees  to  the\r\n\r\narrests; and what does the P.A.P. do? Being stooges\r\n\r\nand  lackeys  of  the British, the  P.A.P. has  to\r\n\r\nlisten  to  its  master's voice and carry  out  its\r\n\r\nmaster's instructions. Moreover, the P.A.P. has its\r\n\r\nown selfish reasons for joining the British and the\r\n\r\nFederation Governments in their dirty work. I  will\r\n\r\ncome to more of this by and by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fearful of repercussions following the\r\n\r\narrests  and  hoping to confuse public opinion  and\r\n\r\nhoping  to  deceive a section of  the  people,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. comes  out with those high-sounding  words,\r\n\r\n\"security of the State\". And according to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  repressive actions had to be  taken  and\r\n\r\nmass  arrests  carried out on 2nd February  because\r\n\r\nthe  so-called Communist front men in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  constitute a danger to  the  security  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and to the other territories that  go  to\r\n\r\nform Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason which the Straits Times, the\r\n\r\nmouthpiece    of   the   colonialists    and    the\r\n\r\nimperialists,  praised  so  forcefully   that   its\r\n\r\neditorial on the 4th of February states:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Justification for their arrests could hardly be\r\n\r\nargued more powerfully than that.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"More  powerfully than that\".

But  let us take a look at  the  so-called\r\n\r\npowerful argument and see what the argument  really\r\n\r\namounts   to.   \"A  danger  to  the   security   of\r\n\r\nSingapore\" -  such a high-sounding justification  for\r\n\r\nthe  arrests.  But under the cloak  of  these  four\r\n\r\nmagical  words,  \"security of the State\",  all  the\r\n\r\nsins  in  the world have been committed  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  ages. On the excuse to safeguard the  security\r\n\r\nof the State, the most blatant cases of imperialist\r\n\r\naggression,   exploitation   and   enslavement   of\r\n\r\ncountless weaker nations have been perpetrated  and\r\n\r\nso-called \"justified\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard the security of the State, the\r\n\r\ntyrants  and  Fascist dictators  have  resorted  to\r\n\r\nrepressive actions at home and abroad: at home,  to\r\n\r\npreserve  the  privileges of the tyrannical  ruling\r\n\r\nclass;  and  abroad, to exploit and  oppress  other\r\n\r\nweaker and less developed nations. For the security\r\n\r\nof  the  State,  demands of the people  for  urgent\r\n\r\nreforms  have been rejected out of hand, and  their\r\n\r\nlegitimate   rights  and  aspirations  denied   and\r\n\r\nsuppressed.  In  the name of the  security  of  the\r\n\r\nState, the most fundamental rights of man have been\r\n\r\nviolated,   justice   denied,  democracy   trampled\r\n\r\nunderfoot.  Under  the cloak of this  high-sounding\r\n\r\nphrase,  the  four magical words \"security  of  the\r\n\r\nState\",  millions and millions of people have  been\r\n\r\ntortured  and  enslaved, oppressed  and  exploited.\r\n\r\nUnder  the cloak of the security of the State,  the\r\n\r\nforeign  master  rules  over an  unwilling  subject\r\n\r\npeople  with  an iron hand, and they are  not  even\r\n\r\ngiven a chance to determine their own future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history abounds with lurid examples of the\r\n\r\ngrave  abuse  of these four simple words  in  every\r\n\r\ncountry, in every epoch, and in every age. Thus, to\r\n\r\nsafeguard   the  security  of  the  State,   Hitler\r\n\r\nunleashed  the  world war on  the  people  and  had\r\n\r\nmillions  of Jews murdered. Similarly, to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  security  of  the State,  South  Africa  today\r\n\r\npractises   apartheid,   racial   segregation   and\r\n\r\ndiscrimination,  and denies the true  sons  of  the\r\n\r\nsoil  of  their  most basic and  fundamental  human\r\n\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years go, to safeguard the security of the\r\n\r\nState, Eden ordered the invasion of the Suez  Canal\r\n\r\nand the United Arab Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What about Budapest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And only a few months ago, to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  security  of  the  State,   Kennedy\r\n\r\nthreatened to invade Cuba and bring about a nuclear\r\n\r\ndestruction of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Stalin?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Do we need more examples?\r\n\r\nNearer home, we see, Sir, in South Vietnam ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Stalin?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- under the cloak of the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  the State, democracy  being  trampled\r\n\r\nunder-foot with millions of people subjected to the\r\n\r\nmost  humiliating  tortures  and  denied  the  most\r\n\r\nfundamental  of  human rights.

We have friends all  over  the\r\n\r\nworld who give us solidarity support. It is only  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  time  before all our  efforts  will  be\r\n\r\ncrowned with success. No one can stop the wheels of\r\n\r\nhistory  from  moving forward. The advance  may  be\r\n\r\nslow or fast, but we advance.

Yet  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  allege  that we are dangerous  men.  How\r\n\r\ncould  our struggle, which the P.A.P. also  claimed\r\n\r\nnot   so  very  long  ago  to  be  their  struggle,\r\n\r\nconstitute  a danger to the security of  Singapore?\r\n\r\nIt simply does not add up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel honoured indeed that we constitute a\r\n\r\ndanger  to  imperialism and colonialism.

How then could this danger to imperialism  and\r\n\r\ncolonialism constitute a danger to the security  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  which,  after all, belongs  to  all  the\r\n\r\npeople  in the island? Does the Prime Minister  not\r\n\r\nsee how absurd and ridiculous and contradictory  he\r\n\r\nis?

Only the colonialists,\r\n\r\npro-colonialists, and their stooges need  be  perturbed\r\n\r\nby  strong  anti-colonial action from any  quarter.\r\n\r\nOnly  the enemies of the people need fear our \r\n\r\nanti-colonial  struggle.

Our\r\n\r\nstruggle is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirected  against  the  vested  interests  of   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists and the feudalists ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I draw the attention of\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member to the fact that he is, in  fact,\r\n\r\nrepeating  his arguments?

As I have  said,  Sir,  we  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  British  colonialists  and   their\r\n\r\nfeudalist  allies in the Federation being perturbed\r\n\r\nby our action. Our struggle is directed against the\r\n\r\nvested  interests  of  the  colonialists  and   the\r\n\r\nfeudalists,  and  we have openly said  so.  But  it\r\n\r\nappears  the  P.A.P. too is most perturbed  by  our\r\n\r\nanti-colonial action; so perturbed and so  alarmed,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  that the P.A.P. has to join the colonial\r\n\r\nforces to take urgent repressive action against the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and other anti-colonial stalwarts\r\n\r\nimmediately  and  not be left  until  the  31st  of\r\n\r\nAugust.  Are  these really justifiable reasons  for\r\n\r\ntaking repressive action against the people? No.  A\r\n\r\nthousand times no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let there be no doubts in our minds as to what we\r\n\r\nstand  for.  Lest  I  be  accused  of  again  being\r\n\r\nrepetitious,  let  me just say once  more  that  we\r\n\r\nstand  for  the  rights of the  exploited  and  the\r\n\r\noppressed,  and  we  stand for  justice,  equality,\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  self-determination and  freedom.  These\r\n\r\nare  the  hopes  and aspirations not  only  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis but also of the vast majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, not only in Singapore, the  Federation\r\n\r\nand  the  Borneo  territories, but also  the  world\r\n\r\nover.  No  one need fear the realisation  of  these\r\n\r\nhopes  and  aspirations. The only forces that  need\r\n\r\nfear and oppose the realisation of these hopes  and\r\n\r\naspirations  are the forces of the enemies  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today because the colonialists want to retain the\r\n\r\nvested  interests and deprive the people  of  their\r\n\r\nlegitimate  rights and aspirations, they  have  not\r\n\r\nhesitated  to  resort to arrests and detentions  of\r\n\r\nanti-colonial stalwarts in a desperate  attempt  to\r\n\r\nslow  down  and impede the advance of the  movement\r\n\r\nfor  colonial  freedom. But these  are  only  their\r\n\r\ndeath   throes   before   final   destruction   and\r\n\r\nelimination. This has been proved many  times  over\r\n\r\nin  history. For an elected Government now to forgo\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of  the  people  and  instead,  for\r\n\r\nselfish  reasons, now to go into cahoots  with  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists and imperialists in order  to  further\r\n\r\nexploit  and  oppress  the  people,  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nunforgivable.   There  can  be   no   justification\r\n\r\nwhatsoever for the arrests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of Singapore today, when Singapore\r\n\r\nis  still  a  colony, a danger to the  security  of\r\n\r\nSingapore can only mean a danger to the security of\r\n\r\ncolonial  interests. For an elected  Government  to\r\n\r\nuse  the  trite phrase of - \"a danger to the security\r\n\r\nof  Singapore\"  as  a  cloak  to  arrest  political\r\n\r\nopponents,  merely shows how bankrupt and  ruthless\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. leaders have become.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repressive action should never have been taken\r\n\r\nagainst persons who fight for the interests of  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority of the people. \"Political  detainees\r\n\r\nare and indeed should be regarded as an anomaly  in\r\n\r\na  democratic society.\" So say Devan Nair  and  Jek\r\n\r\nYuen  Thong,  both top brass of the P.A.P.  From  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. admission,  it  is  clear  that  repressive\r\n\r\naction  should never have been taken. If repressive\r\n\r\naction must be taken, let it be taken against those\r\n\r\nwho   wax   rich   through  the  exploitation   and\r\n\r\noppression  of  others, and those who  continue  to\r\n\r\nhelp impose foreign rule over us in Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stress on the three Governments concurring in\r\n\r\nthe   arrests  does  not  add  any  weight  to  the\r\n\r\nargument.  It  only shows that they are  trying  to\r\n\r\nprop  up weak and untenable arguments by the weight\r\n\r\nof  numbers. It might allow one party to shift  and\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre,  and to pass the buck to  others  in  an\r\n\r\nattempt  to  escape the justifiable and  inevitable\r\n\r\nhatred and opprobrium of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  can  show how closely allied is the  P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nreaction,  feudalism, colonialism and  imperialism.\r\n\r\nBut  it  adds  nothing  to the  strength  of  their\r\n\r\narguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the P.A.P. to gloat over the fact that the\r\n\r\ndecision for repressive action was not the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nalone,  but  of  three Governments  together,  only\r\n\r\nfurther  shows  that  the  P.A.P. does  not  truly\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  the  so-called justification  for  the\r\n\r\narrests!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need to go into the shameful episode of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. trying to pass the buck to the  British\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation for the arrests.  Knowing  how\r\n\r\nabhorrent  such  repressive action  is  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders do not even have the guts to stand up to \r\n\r\nso-called  \"justify\" -  the unjustifiable  arrests.  The\r\n\r\nverdict  of the people indeed is a terrible  thing.\r\n\r\nIt frightens the insides of the P.A.P. Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis have too often\r\n\r\nbeen accused of being anti-national. And because of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. control of the radio, Rediffusion  and\r\n\r\nthe  Press,  the voice of the Barisan Sosialis  has\r\n\r\nnot  been easily heard. Just what is meant by being\r\n\r\na  nationalist?  When we talk of a person  being  a\r\n\r\nnationalist,  we  mean  that  he  places   national\r\n\r\ninterests  above sectional and personal  interests.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a person places sectional and\r\n\r\npersonal  interests above national interests,  then\r\n\r\nhe becomes anti-national.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal interests are interests of the\r\n\r\nindividual; for example, the personal ambitions  of\r\n\r\npower  and  wealth  of P.A.P. Ministers.  Sectional\r\n\r\ninterests are interests of small groups of  people,\r\n\r\nfor   example,  the  vested  interests  of  foreign\r\n\r\nmonopoly-capitalists  and of  the  compradores  and\r\n\r\nfeudalists.   But  what  are  national   interests?\r\n\r\nNational interests are the basic interests  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and of its people. They are the  interests\r\n\r\nof  the  vast  majority of the  people.  And  these\r\n\r\ninterests   are  the  interests  of   the   toiling\r\n\r\nmasses - the   workers,   peasants,   hawkers,   shop\r\n\r\nassistants,  intellectuals, small  businessmen  and\r\n\r\nnational businessmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been under colonial rule for 150 years.\r\n\r\nWe  are still under the heel of foreign domination.\r\n\r\nThe country's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwealth   has   been  taken  away  to   enrich   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists and the imperialists. And we are still\r\n\r\nbeing oppressed and exploited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A true nationalist, therefore, is he who looks\r\n\r\nafter the interests of the exploited and oppressed,\r\n\r\nand  he  who  fights to eradicate  colonialism  and\r\n\r\nimperialism.  A nationalist is he who struggles  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen   the  unity  of  the  people,   without\r\n\r\ndistinction of race, colour or creed,  to  rid  our\r\n\r\ncountry of foreign domination. A nationalist is  he\r\n\r\nwho  struggles  to  improve the livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\ntoiling masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who helps the colonialists and the\r\n\r\nimperialists  to  enslave  the  people   is  \r\n\r\nanti-national. He who seeks to destroy the unity of  the\r\n\r\npeople by playing on their communal fears is \r\n\r\nanti-national.  He who collaborates with the  foreigners\r\n\r\nand the colonialists, and promotes colonial schemes\r\n\r\nto  enslave the people is anti-national. And he who\r\n\r\nhelps  to  keep  foreign  troops  on  our  soil  to\r\n\r\nsuppress  the legitimate aspirations of the  people\r\n\r\nis anti-national.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some politicians try to equate\r\n\r\npersonal  and  sectional  interests  with  national\r\n\r\ninterests.  In this way, opportunities, like  those\r\n\r\nin   the   P.A.P.,   would  then  call   themselves\r\n\r\nnationalists  in order to confuse and  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now ask the Prime Minister and his other\r\n\r\nMinisters   a   few   simple  questions.   Who   is\r\n\r\ncollaborating with the colonialists today?  Who  is\r\n\r\nthe  errand boy of the imperialists today?  Who  is\r\n\r\npromoting the British-sponsored Malaysia today? Who\r\n\r\nis  selling  our country to a foreign power  today?\r\n\r\nWho  is  collaborating to subjugate the peoples  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation,  Singapore,  Sarawak,  Brunei  and\r\n\r\nSabah  under  colonial domination and denying  them\r\n\r\ntheir fundamental rights of self-determination  and\r\n\r\nindependence? Who wants to keep foreign  troops  on\r\n\r\nour  soil  for  the suppression of  the  legitimate\r\n\r\naspirations  of the people? And who  is  trying  to\r\n\r\njustify  the  use  of  the British  bases  for  the\r\n\r\nsuppression of the national liberation struggle  in\r\n\r\nKalimantan Utara? The answer is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclear  to  all in Singapore. It is none other  than\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister and his traitorous clique. It is\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. that is collaborating with the  foreign\r\n\r\npowers.  It  is the P.A.P. that is running  errands\r\n\r\nfor  the  imperialists. It is the  P.A.P. that  is\r\n\r\npromoting  British-sponsored Malaysia.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. that  is  collaborating  to  subjugate  the\r\n\r\npeoples  of  the  Federation,  Singapore,  Sarawak,\r\n\r\nBrunei and Sabah under colonial domination.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. that is denying them their fundamental\r\n\r\nrights of self-determination and independence.  And\r\n\r\nit  is  the P.A.P. again that wants to keep foreign\r\n\r\ntroops  on  our  soil  for the suppression  of  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate aspirations of our peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his tour of the constituency in Sembawang spoke very lovingly of the British bases now in Singapore, and he tried to impress on the people of Singapore that unless they have the bases they would lose their jobs. Who then is trying to keep foreign troops on our soil?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-colonial elements are, therefore, as can\r\n\r\nbe  seen  from my arguments, in the P.A.P. We  here\r\n\r\nand  now  charge the P.A.P. as the anti-nationalist\r\n\r\nelements of our country, collaborating with foreign\r\n\r\ncolonialists to control and dominate our country at\r\n\r\nthe  expense of our people! The P.A.P. clique  are\r\n\r\nthe  out-and-out anti-nationals, the  traitors  who\r\n\r\nhave  sold  the rights of our people  - the  workers,\r\n\r\npeasants,  hawkers, taxi-drivers and  students  -\r\n\r\ndown  the drain! Yes, the P.A.P., the anti-national\r\n\r\ntraitors masquerading as nationalists. That answers\r\n\r\nthis anti-nationalist allegation of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to the question of the allegation\r\n\r\nthat  the Barisan Sosialis wants to resort to armed\r\n\r\nstruggle, violence and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our open support for the Brunei uprising has\r\n\r\nbeen mentioned as one of the immediate reasons that\r\n\r\nhad led the Internal Security Council to decide  on\r\n\r\nrepressive action. The I.S.C. statement reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They have professed to be working\r\n\r\nconstitutional1y  for democratic  ends.  But  their\r\n\r\nopen  support for armed revolt in Brunei and  their\r\n\r\nclose  connections with leaders of the revolt  show\r\n\r\nthat they are ready when the opportunity \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccurs to depart from constitutional methods\r\n\r\nand  to jeopardise national defence and Singapore's\r\n\r\nsecurity  by  joining  with  groups  resorting   to\r\n\r\nviolence   and   blood-shed  as   in   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nTerritories.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>With  this  they attempt to establish the so-called\r\n\r\nconnection between the uprising in Brunei  and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and other  persons  arrested  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The Straits Times especially gave  great\r\n\r\nprominence  and  front page headlines  to  what  it\r\n\r\ncalled  the \"link\" between the uprising  in  Brunei\r\n\r\nand  the  Barisan Sosialis and arrested persons  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Because Lim Ching  Siong  had  met  the\r\n\r\nBrunei  leader,  A. M. Azahari, in  Singapore  four\r\n\r\ndays  before  the  uprising, so  according  to  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists, this  is  proof  of   some   hidden\r\n\r\nconspiracy between the two. But let us ask: What is\r\n\r\nso  secret about this meeting for which the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes gave such prominent headlines? Can the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ninform  us  what took place at this meeting?;  what\r\n\r\nwas said at the meeting?; what actually transpired?\r\n\r\nA  little while back the Prime Minister also talked\r\n\r\nof the meeting in Nee Soon and people travelling in\r\n\r\nCar  SR. 5222. What is wrong with people travelling\r\n\r\nin  cars?;  what is wrong with people going  about?\r\n\r\nWhat is all this that they are trying to bring out?\r\n\r\nSir,  I have always thought that the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhad  some  originality in him when he talked  about\r\n\r\nthe  \"Plen\"  and  things  like  that.  But  to   my\r\n\r\nsurprise, I see that he has been plagiarising  what\r\n\r\nhas  been published in the book called \"The  Jungle\r\n\r\nis  Neutral\". At page 203 of this book called  \"The\r\n\r\nJungle  is Neutral\", written by F. Spencer Chapman,\r\n\r\nD.S.O.,  a  person who was sent into the jungle  to\r\n\r\nfight  the  Japanese. I see this  very  interesting\r\n\r\nparagraph. It is only a few lines and I  will  read\r\n\r\nit  out  to you. Sir. At page 203 under the chapter\r\n\r\n\"Force 136\", it says that \"when Chin Peng first met\r\n\r\nDavis  at Sigari in September, he agreed to convene\r\n\r\na  conference with a plenipotentiary from  Guerilla\r\n\r\nGeneral  Headquarters. Owing to  the  tardiness  of\r\n\r\ntheir  communications, it was  not  until  the  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1944, that this man reached our  camp  at\r\n\r\nBlantar.  He became known to us as the  \"Plen\"  and\r\n\r\nthat is the name which I shall use for him in these\r\n\r\npages.\"  Now that I find this, I am just  wondering\r\n\r\nwhat our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has been doing? This book says  here\r\n\r\nin  the  first page, even before you start  reading\r\n\r\nthe  story: \"This book is copyright. No portion  of\r\n\r\nit may be reproduced in any process without written\r\n\r\npermission.\"  I  do  not  know  whether  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has had permission from Mr Chapman  about\r\n\r\nthe  name of the \"Plen\". He has been having stories\r\n\r\nbroadcast over the radio, but at least let us  hope\r\n\r\nin  future  that our Prime Minister will show  more\r\n\r\noriginality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding this meeting between Mr Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong  and  Azahari, we ask: What is  so  peculiar,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  so  unusual about that? If  plotting  or\r\n\r\nsubversion  is  discovered, what is the  plot -   and\r\n\r\nwhat is the subversion? Why do they not inform  the\r\n\r\npeople of it? All these stories of wanting to  buy\r\n\r\narms  and  what-not are stories given to our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  by informers and spies - people who  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  trusted,  people who will even sell  their  own\r\n\r\nfathers in order to earn some extra money. Can they\r\n\r\nreally  be  trusted? The Legislative Assembly,  the\r\n\r\nradio.  Rediffusion and the Press are all available\r\n\r\nto  the  P.A.P.  Let them give us all  the  stories\r\n\r\nabout the true \"links\" and the connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as leaders of political Parties with common\r\n\r\nobjectives,  like  our common  opposition  to  \r\n\r\nneo-colonial Malaysia, and being co-members of the same\r\n\r\nsocialist  conference, from which  the  P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nejected,  it is only natural and normal  that  they\r\n\r\nshould meet frequently and whenever the opportunity\r\n\r\noccurs,  for  the  exchange of views  and  opinions\r\n\r\nabout  political developments, as well as  for  the\r\n\r\npromotion   and  strengthening  of   friendly \r\n\r\nco-operation and friendly ties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. M. Azahari is the President of the Party\r\n\r\nRakyat  of  Brunei, the Party that won all  the  55\r\n\r\nseats  in the recent elections in Brunei. His views\r\n\r\ndefinitely   carry   weight.  Even   the   colonial\r\n\r\nmouthpiece, the Straits Times, said so. It is  only\r\n\r\nto  be  expected, therefore, that we in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis should meet him for the exchange of  views\r\n\r\nwhenever  possible and indeed many of us  have  met\r\n\r\nAzahari and discussed political events with him  on\r\n\r\nmany  occasions.  Azahari  attended  our  inaugural\r\n\r\nmeeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  spoke at the rally in the Happy World  Stadium\r\n\r\nin September 1961. He also signed a joint statement\r\n\r\ntogether   with  the  Chairman  of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nSocialist  Front,  Mr Ishak,  and  myself  on  the\r\n\r\noccasion of that visit. Other political leaders too\r\n\r\nhad visited us in Singapore at various times in the\r\n\r\npast  and we on our part had also visited political\r\n\r\nleaders in the Federation, Sarawak and Brunei,  not\r\n\r\nwith those sinister motives as alleged by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. The Prime Minister went to Moscow,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot know whether he went there to conspire with the\r\n\r\nCommunists or what. Surely, no one should be  hound\r\n\r\nto  his  home.  Surely,  as political  leaders,  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  a chance to go about and meet  people\r\n\r\nwho  deal  with the same subject and have the  same\r\n\r\ncommon   objectives.  Similarly  today,  Federation\r\n\r\nMinisters,  P.A.P.  Minister  and  other  political\r\n\r\nleaders too have many times been to see politicians\r\n\r\nin Kuching and Jesselton. Our meetings with Azahari\r\n\r\nin  Singapore were therefore nothing unusual.  Such\r\n\r\nmeetings take place in the normal course of events.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary, it would indeed be  unusual  and\r\n\r\nabnormal  if  there  were  no  such  meetings.  For\r\n\r\nobvious  reasons, the P.A.P. and the Straits  Times\r\n\r\nhave  now  gone out of their way to paint innocent,\r\n\r\nopen and normal events with loud and lurid colours.\r\n\r\nOrdinary   everyday  happenings  are  twisted   and\r\n\r\ndistorted  into  something furtive,  secretive  and\r\n\r\nmysterious.   Yet  all  the  so-called   mysterious\r\n\r\nmeetings were open secrets. Even the Straits  Times\r\n\r\nagain  admitted  so  in  their  editorial  of   4th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1963. Azahari had been  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis'  headquarters on  several  occasions  and\r\n\r\nmany  of us had met him and talked to him. But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the P.A.P. concocts mystery thrillers  out\r\n\r\nof  such normal meetings. And because of Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong meeting Azahari four days before the uprising\r\n\r\nin  Brunei. There has grown from it this  so-called\r\n\r\n\"link\"  through Said Zahari. This so-called  \"link\"\r\n\r\nis  dramatised and given a sensational  front  page\r\n\r\nplay-up.  All in order to create the impression  of\r\n\r\nsome super front page conspiracy very luckily and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  timely  discovered, of course, by  the  sharp\r\n\r\nprying  eyes of the Prime Minister and the  Special\r\n\r\nBranch.  But  for  which a major catastrophe  would\r\n\r\nhave befallen the people of Singapore! Such is  the\r\n\r\nfairy tale of the British lion and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndog - the running dog!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times representing vested interests\r\n\r\ncan of course, be expected to help the British, the\r\n\r\nFederation   and   incidentally  the   P.A.P.,   to\r\n\r\ninfluence  public  opinion  against  the   arrested\r\n\r\npersons.  But  in spite of all the efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  to spotlight this so-called  \"link\"\r\n\r\nand  this so-called \"conspiracy\", the people \r\n\r\nof   - Singapore  still cannot understand why the  arrests\r\n\r\nwere necessary. Even the Straits Times editorial of\r\n\r\n4th  February, 163, complained that the  Government\r\n\r\ncase  was weak and unconvincing. The Straits  Times\r\n\r\neditorial of 4th February states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The statement issued by the Internal Security\r\n\r\ncouncil  has little in it that has not been  hashed\r\n\r\nand  rehashed  in  the newspaper for  months  past,\r\n\r\nexcept  perhaps for the dealings which Azahari  had\r\n\r\nwith   Barisan  Sosialis  leaders  and  even  these\r\n\r\ncontacts were an open secret.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editorial went on to hope for the publication\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"the full [I am reading from a few lines above what\r\n\r\nI  have just quoted] or at least a fuller story  of\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances which forced the I.S.C. to  take\r\n\r\nstrong measures before it was too late.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, even the Straits Times admitted\r\n\r\nthat  there  was no justification in fact  for  the\r\n\r\narrests!  Yes,  there  was  no  justifiable  excuse\r\n\r\nwhatsoever   for   the  arrests.   What   are   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  which,  according  to  the   Straits\r\n\r\nTimes,  \"forced  the I.S.C. to take strong  measure\r\n\r\nbefore  it was too late\"? Was it because we held  a\r\n\r\nrally in support of the Brunei uprising?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, we held a rally in Tanjong Katong Road two\r\n\r\nweeks  after the uprising in support of the  Brunei\r\n\r\nNational   Liberation  Movement.  We  applied   for\r\n\r\npermission  for  the  rally,  clearly  stating  the\r\n\r\nreason  for  the rally in the application  for  the\r\n\r\npermits,  and the permit was granted  for  a  rally\r\n\r\nclearly staged to support the national uprising  in\r\n\r\nBrunei.  So  it  was  all  open  and  lawful.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment had given us lawful permission to hold a\r\n\r\nrally in support of Brunei.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  obviously  there  was nothing  wrong  with  the\r\n\r\nlawful  rally for which a permit was issued by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government.  We  have  not  taken  up  arms\r\n\r\nagainst  the Government. We merely held a rally  to\r\n\r\nvoice our support in a legitimate democratic manner\r\n\r\nfor  an  anti-colonial struggle in Brunei. Just  as\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. and the Alliance Government had  voiced\r\n\r\ntheir  support  for the anti-colonial  struggle  in\r\n\r\nAlgeria  only  two years ago. On  that  occasion  a\r\n\r\nrally was held in front of the Padang in which even\r\n\r\nthe employers were specifically told to let workers\r\n\r\nget off earlier so that they could go to listen  to\r\n\r\nDr  Ferhat Abbas and the Prime Minister.  In  that\r\n\r\nmass  rally,  the  Prime Minister had  spoken  with\r\n\r\nstaged  feelings  and had exhorted  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to learn from the anti-colonial  struggle\r\n\r\nof   the   Algerian  people  against   the   French\r\n\r\nimperialists.  Of course, the Prime  Minister  then\r\n\r\nwas only trying to deceive the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, if you will remember, Sir, in this very\r\n\r\nHouse a few weeks later the Government went a stage\r\n\r\nfurther and moved a motion to contribute $10,000 to\r\n\r\nthe  Algerian  fund  as  a token  of  sympathy  and\r\n\r\nsupport   and  asked  the  House  to   record   its\r\n\r\nadmiration for the determination and courage of the\r\n\r\nAlgerian  people  in  their  struggle  for  freedom\r\n\r\nagainst  the  tyranny  and  oppression  of   French\r\n\r\ncolonialism;  and  on  behalf  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  expressed its wholehearted  support  for\r\n\r\nthe  cause  of freedom for the Algerian people.  In\r\n\r\nthe  ensuing debate all P.A.P. leaders spoke brave,\r\n\r\ninspiring  words.  Even Members of  the  Right-wing\r\n\r\nS.P.A. joined in the chorus. Let me refer you, Sir,\r\n\r\nto  Hansard,  Volume 14, No. 13 of  22nd  February,\r\n\r\n1961. May I refer you to column 1020? It is a  pity\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Culture is not here because he had\r\n\r\nspoken in paragraph 4 at column 1020 of \"the rising\r\n\r\ntide  of  nationalism\" and the \"dyke of  repression\r\n\r\nagainst  the tidal wave of nationalist revolt,  and\r\n\r\nhow  the dyke broke and colonialism was swept  into\r\n\r\nthe  sea.\" Very inspiring words, Sir, and  at  that\r\n\r\ntime  I  was  taken  in myself.  I  have  mentioned\r\n\r\nparagraph 3. It was paragraph 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in column 1021 on the next page, the third\r\n\r\nparagraph,  somewhere in the middle,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Culture said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore, when confronted by the assertions of\r\n\r\nAlgerian  nationalism  and  Algerian  demands   for\r\n\r\nfreedom,  the  French  colons,  backed  by   French\r\n\r\ngenerals,   are   trying   to   counter    Algerian\r\n\r\nnationalism with repression and terror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was French extremism which forced a moderate\r\n\r\nand  conciliatory  Algerian nationalism  to  resist\r\n\r\nFrench repression and violence with violence of its\r\n\r\nown.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, these are words which nobody who calls himself\r\n\r\nan  anti-colonialist can can quarrel with. And they\r\n\r\nare inspiring words. But let us just substitute the\r\n\r\nword  \"British\" for the word \"French\" and the  word\r\n\r\n\"Brunei\" for the word \"Algeria\", and the quote  now\r\n\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore, when confronted by the assertions of\r\n\r\nBruneian  nationalism  and  Bruneian  demands   for\r\n\r\nfreedom,  the  British colons,  backed  by  British\r\n\r\ngenerals,   are   trying   to   counter    Bruneian\r\n\r\nnationalism  with  repression and  terror.  It  was\r\n\r\nBritish  extremism  which  forced  a  moderate  and\r\n\r\nconciliatory Bruneian nationalism to resist British\r\n\r\nrepression and violence with violence of its own.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It is a pity, Sir, that the Ministers do not listen\r\n\r\nto  their own words because if they did they  would\r\n\r\nsee   how  ridiculous  they  have  been  in   their\r\n\r\naccusations and allegations that we are  supporting\r\n\r\nthe  Brunei uprising and resorting to violence  and\r\n\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in column 1030 - this time the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister talked of the \"mutual feelings of sympathy\r\n\r\nbetween  the Provisional Government of the Algerian\r\n\r\nleaders   and   ourselves  in   Singapore   because\r\n\r\nSingapore  is still a colony, a semi-colony.\"  Then\r\n\r\nhe said in the second paragraph, near the end:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is because of this understanding of peoples\r\n\r\nwho have in the past been under colonial domination\r\n\r\nthat  we,  the P.A.P.

But, again, let us\r\n\r\nsubstitute the word \"Brunei\" for the word \"Algeria\"\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  word \"British\" for the word \"French\"  and  the\r\n\r\nmeaning again is very clear. It would read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is because of this understanding of peoples\r\n\r\nwho have in the past been under colonial domination\r\n\r\nthat  we,  the P.A.P.

May I suggest to the hon.\r\n\r\nMember that he is labouring on a point which he has\r\n\r\nalready made. He has made the point.

And in\r\n\r\na  debate,  once a Member, or once any debater  has\r\n\r\nmade a point, surely he should be satisfied and not\r\n\r\nlabour the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Very well, Sir, I thought of\r\n\r\njust quoting the Member for Tanglin, but anyway, he\r\n\r\nis  not  here.  However, I  must  quote  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  In column 1032 the Prime Minister  talks\r\n\r\nof  the necessity to make a gesture in the forum of\r\n\r\nworld  debate to show what we think of  the  French\r\n\r\nimperialists. He says in column 1032:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But it is significant that in a world in which\r\n\r\ntotal war means total annihilation, the conflict is\r\n\r\nreduced to a secondary plane of a limited war  with\r\n\r\nunlimited world support. There is pressure  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations. There are expressions of  sympathy\r\n\r\nand solidarity and we throw in our voice in support\r\n\r\nof  the  chorus  on behalf of the  freedom  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Algeria.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>All  I  need  say, Sir, is to substitute  the  word\r\n\r\n\"British\"  for \"French\" and the word  \"Brunei\"  for\r\n\r\n\"Algeria\" and we see that there is fundamentally no\r\n\r\ndifference  between  the  situation  then  and  the\r\n\r\nsituation today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will remember that debate, the Government\r\n\r\nfinally  asked  the Assembly to pass  a  resolution\r\n\r\nwhich, if you were to leave out the second part  of\r\n\r\nmoney contribution and if we substituted the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate words to fit in with the context of our\r\n\r\npresent situation, would read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly records its admiration for the\r\n\r\ndetermination and courage of the Brunei  people  in\r\n\r\nthe  struggle for freedom against the  tyranny  and\r\n\r\noppression of British colonialism and on behalf  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore expresses its whole-hearted\r\n\r\nsupport  for the cause for freedom for  the  Brunei\r\n\r\npeople.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Wholehearted support for the freedom for the Brunei\r\n\r\npeople!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our rally at Tanjong Katong held on the 23rd\r\n\r\nDecember,  1962, did not have the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly, and we could not  presume  to\r\n\r\nspeak on behalf of all the people of Singapore. But\r\n\r\nwe  did  hold the rally to demonstrate  our \r\n\r\nwhole-hearted support for the people of Brunei openly and\r\n\r\nfor  all to see. It was not done furtively. In  our\r\n\r\nrally we did exactly what the P.A.P. had previously\r\n\r\ndone in another rally as well as officially in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Legislative Assembly on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we in the Barisan also admire the courage\r\n\r\nand determination of the people of Brunei' in their\r\n\r\nstruggle  for  freedom  against  the  tyranny   and\r\n\r\noppression  of  British  colonialism.  We  in   the\r\n\r\nBarisan  call  on the people to give  whole-hearted\r\n\r\nsupport  for the cause of freedom of the people  in\r\n\r\nBrunei.  Can  it be that support for the  cause  of\r\n\r\nfreedom  against  the French was correct  and  that\r\n\r\nagainst  the British is wrong? Can it  be  that  we\r\n\r\nmust  condemn  French colonialism, but  must  love,\r\n\r\nadmire  and  protect British colonialism?  Is  that\r\n\r\nwhat the P.A.P. want? If our support today for  the\r\n\r\nBrunei   people   was  wrong  and  unlawful,   then\r\n\r\nsimilarly the P.A.P. and Assembly support  in  1961\r\n\r\nfor the Algerian people was wrong and unlawful.  If\r\n\r\nthe admiration for the courage and determination of\r\n\r\nthe   Brunei  people  to  be  free  was  wrong  and\r\n\r\nunlawful,   then   similarly  the  feigned   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nadmiration for the courage and determination of the\r\n\r\nAlgerian  people  was  wrong  and  unlawful.  There\r\n\r\ncannot  be two different standards of moral values.\r\n\r\nNo one has suggested that feigned P.A.P. admiration\r\n\r\nfor  the  courage and determination of the Algerian\r\n\r\npeople to be free and feigned P.A.P. support of the\r\n\r\nAlgerian   struggle  for  freedom  was  wrong   and\r\n\r\nunlawful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, only a few months back, the P.A.P. took\r\n\r\ngreat  pride  in, and gave full publicity  to,  its\r\n\r\npast so-called support of the Algerian struggle. So\r\n\r\nhow   can  anyone  suggest  that  our  support  and\r\n\r\nadmiration for the courage and determination of the\r\n\r\nBrunei  people's struggle for freedom is wrong  and\r\n\r\nunlawful? Or is it seriously suggested that what is\r\n\r\ndone by the P.A.P. is right and lawful, but what is\r\n\r\nsimilarly  done by other people becomes  wrong  and\r\n\r\nunlawful?  Is  there  one law for  the  P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nanother  law  for the rest of the people?  Is  that\r\n\r\nwhat is troubling us today in Singapore? Does being\r\n\r\nthe  Government make the P.A.P. right in everything\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. does? Does being the Government make all\r\n\r\nthe  difference between right and wrong, lawful and\r\n\r\nunlawful, loyalty and subversion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister himself had feigned support for anti-colonial struggles before, that is, until\r\n\r\nhe  had been unmasked as a mere opportunist  and  a \r\n\r\nstooge. But why this apparent turnabout, this volte-face.  \r\n\r\nThe I.S.C. statement goes on to  say  that \"their open \r\n\r\nsupport for armed revolt in Brunei  and\r\n\r\ntheir  close connections with leaders of the revolt\r\n\r\nshow  that  they  are  ready when  the  opportunity\r\n\r\noccurs to depart from constitutional methods and to\r\n\r\njeopardise   national   defence   and   Singapore's\r\n\r\nsecurity  by  joining  with  groups  resorting   to\r\n\r\nviolence   and   blood-shed  as   in   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have shown that the so-called \"connection\" and\r\n\r\n\"link\"  are but fanciful concoctions of the fertile\r\n\r\nimagination of the colonialists and their  stooges.\r\n\r\nThe  most  unconnected events and  happenings  have\r\n\r\nbeen interlaced with \"link\" and \"connections\".  The\r\n\r\nimagination  is allowed to run riot. Everything  is\r\n\r\ndominated  by  one obsession, namely, to  prejudice\r\n\r\npublic  opinion against the persons whom the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwants  to  fix  and to destroy. We in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis want to struggle constitutionally for  our\r\n\r\npolitical  aims.  But  it has  become  increasingly\r\n\r\ndifficult  to continue the constitutional struggle.\r\n\r\nI  have  already said that door after door  of  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  struggle has been  slammed  by  the\r\n\r\nFascist  and  arbitrary actions of the P.A.P.,  and\r\n\r\nthe latest spate of arbitrary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrests has forced the people to consider seriously\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  all means of such  constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle  have  been  completely  closed   to   the\r\n\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constitutional struggle, Sir, can only be\r\n\r\nundertaken when there are constitutional means left\r\n\r\nfor the people to do so. At the present moment just\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Opposition has become strong  enough  to\r\n\r\noverthrow the Government through the democratic\r\n\r\none-man-one-vote   process,  the  powers-that-be   have\r\n\r\nresorted  to the most unconstitutional  methods  of\r\n\r\narbitrary  arrests, in order to  crush  strong  and\r\n\r\neffective  opposition and to prevent the Opposition\r\n\r\nfrom gaining State power. They resort to repressive\r\n\r\naction under the cloak and excuse of our wanting to\r\n\r\ndepart from methods of constitutional struggle. But\r\n\r\nall   Singapore,  all  South-East  Asia,  know  the\r\n\r\nopposite  is  the  case. We who are  genuinely  and\r\n\r\nconsistently conducting a constitutional  struggle,\r\n\r\nare  continuously thwarted by those who  resort  to\r\n\r\nthe    most   undemocratic   and   unconstitutional\r\n\r\nrepressive  measure. We are accused of  wanting  to\r\n\r\ndepart from the path of constitutional struggle  by\r\n\r\nthose  who  resort  to Fascist and unconstitutional\r\n\r\nmethods  of repression. It is like a robber,  after\r\n\r\nhe  has  committed a robbery, calling out,  \"Thief!\r\n\r\nThief!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the argument put forward by the\r\n\r\nI.S.C. one  stage  further. Because  of  our  open\r\n\r\nsupport  for the Brunei uprising, so it is  alleged\r\n\r\nthat   we   want  to  depart  from  the   path   of\r\n\r\nconstitutional  struggle! I have already  mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  feigned P.A.P. support of the Algerian  people\r\n\r\nin  their struggle for freedom. There was a hot war\r\n\r\ngoing  on  in  Algeria with half a  million  French\r\n\r\ncolons  in  the war. Did feigned P.A.P. support  of\r\n\r\nthe Algerian people in their war of liberation then\r\n\r\nmake  the  P.A.P. depart from  the  constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle?  Could we then say that  the  P.A.P. had\r\n\r\nembarked  on the path of armed struggle? Of  course\r\n\r\nnot! No one would dream of saying so. Similarly our\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  support  for  the  struggle   of\r\n\r\nliberation in Brunei does not mean we are  embarked\r\n\r\non  the path of armed struggle. It was only a token\r\n\r\nsupport to show our sympathy and admiration for the\r\n\r\ncourage of the people of Brunei who refused to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  cowed by the superior might of a nuclear power.\r\n\r\nAnd we might add here that, as an Opposition Party,\r\n\r\nwe  in  the Barisan Sosialis just cannot  have  the\r\n\r\nsame opportunities and facilities for helping armed\r\n\r\nstruggle anywhere. Now with bow and arrow, parangs,\r\n\r\nwooden-spears  and shotguns, the people  in  Borneo\r\n\r\nare  fighting  against jets and  warships  for  the\r\n\r\ncause  of self-determination and freedom! And  they\r\n\r\nare   ready  to  fight  against  overwhelming  odds\r\n\r\nbecause  their will to be free cannot be suppressed\r\n\r\nby  threats  and  superior  force.  If  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsupport for the Algerian people's struggle  is  not\r\n\r\nregarded as embarking on unconstitutional and armed\r\n\r\nstruggle, so is the Barisan Sosialis' open  support\r\n\r\nfor the Brunei people's struggle cannot be regarded\r\n\r\nas   embarking   on  unconstitutional   and   armed\r\n\r\nstruggle.  Indeed,  we  maintain  it  is  the  only\r\n\r\ncorrect  and proper thing to do if we are genuinely\r\n\r\nanti-colonial, and if we are truly dedicated to the\r\n\r\nstruggle for justice, equality and democracy, peace\r\n\r\nand freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us take the argument just one stage\r\n\r\nfurther.  When the West Irian issue  was  at  fever\r\n\r\npitch, and peace was threatened in South-East Asia,\r\n\r\nvolunteers from Singapore were ready to go  forward\r\n\r\nto  help  Indonesia recover West Irian. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhad  at  first  ridiculed the idea of resorting  to\r\n\r\narmed  struggle  to  drive out  recalcitrant  Dutch\r\n\r\nImperialism  in  West  Irian,  simply  because  the\r\n\r\ninitial  call  in  Singapore  for  support  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  demand for the recovery of  West  Irian\r\n\r\nhad  come from the Barisan Sosialis. But the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsoon  found  itself  in  an embarrassing  position.\r\n\r\nRealising  that the vast majority of the people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  had  responded  to  our  call  and  were\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  demand for the  recovery  of  West\r\n\r\nIrian, the P.A.P. was compelled to put on the \r\n\r\nanti-colonial mask. The P.A.P. was forced to support our\r\n\r\nmotion   calling  for  support  of  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nstruggle to recover West Irian. Later in an attempt\r\n\r\nto make capital out of the anti-colonial fervour of\r\n\r\nthe  people in Singapore, P.A.P. Ministers went  so\r\n\r\nfar as to review volunteers about to fly off\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor further training in Indonesia. P.A.P. Ministers\r\n\r\ngave  them  blessing and a rousing  send-off.  Full\r\n\r\npublicity was given to the Minister for Health  and\r\n\r\nLaw   wishing  the  volunteers  good  luck  at  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airport.  If  there  was  any  talk   of\r\n\r\nencouragement given to armed struggle, this was it.\r\n\r\nWe  do -   not  have to look any further.  By  I.S.C.\r\n\r\nstandards,  it could be said that encouragement  to\r\n\r\narmed  struggle  was so blatant in this  case  that\r\n\r\nthere is no point in the P.A.P. even trying to deny\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the people of Singapore have never accused\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. of encouraging armed struggle.  Neither\r\n\r\nhave  the  British for that matter, so  far  as  we\r\n\r\nknow. It would have been silly, foolish and useless\r\n\r\nfor  them  to do so. Yet today, without seeing  any\r\n\r\nvolunteer off, without in any way urging the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore to armed struggle, without in any way\r\n\r\ninstigating disturbances, strikes or riots, we have\r\n\r\nbeen charged with wanting to resort to violence and\r\n\r\nbloodshed! How absurd and ridiculous can the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbecome?  What explanation can the P.A.P. give?  As\r\n\r\ngenuine    anti-colonialists,    we    know    that\r\n\r\nintransigent  imperialists will never budge  unless\r\n\r\nthey  are  forced to do so. This was the case  with\r\n\r\nGoa.  This  was the case with what was once  called\r\n\r\nFrench  Indo-China; and with what was  once  called\r\n\r\nthe  Dutch East Indies. And this again was the case\r\n\r\nwith  the  West  Irian issue. The intransigence  of\r\n\r\ncolonialists  is  proverbial.  Look  now  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened in Brunei.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brunei people have been deprived of all means\r\n\r\nof  constitutional struggle. In spite of the  Party\r\n\r\nRakyat  gaining  all  the 55 seats  in  the  recent\r\n\r\nelections  in Brunei, showing overwhelming  support\r\n\r\nof  the  people, the elected representatives  could\r\n\r\nonly play the role of the Opposition. They were not\r\n\r\npermitted  even  to table a motion in  the  Council\r\n\r\nNegeri  against Malaysia. Nor were they allowed  to\r\n\r\ndeclare for independence. There were no longer  any\r\n\r\nconstitutional means left for the people of  Brunei\r\n\r\nto  oppose Malaysia. Under the circumstances,  what\r\n\r\nelse  could  the  people of Brunei  do?  Submit  to\r\n\r\nfurther oppression? No, Sir, there can be no doubt,\r\n\r\nno  argument  about it! All means of constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle were denied the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  of Brunei. There was but one way  out.  The\r\n\r\nBrunei  uprising was the inevitable result.  Is  it\r\n\r\nthen  wrong to support such a heroic struggle under\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances? How can our support be  twisted\r\n\r\nto  mean  our resorting to violence and  bloodshed?\r\n\r\nHave   not  other  Afro-Asian  countries  similarly\r\n\r\nsupported the struggle of the people of Brunei?  Of\r\n\r\nthe people of Kalimantan Utara?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all such talk of our wanting to resort to\r\n\r\narmed  struggle  is therefore so much  hocus-pocus,\r\n\r\nmeant only to confuse and deceive the people and to\r\n\r\ngive  an excuse to the British, the Federation  and\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to  resort  to  repression.  There  is\r\n\r\nnothing  that the Barisan Sosialis has  done  which\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. itself has not done but a  short  time\r\n\r\nago.  For  the  P.A.P. now to claim that  what  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  has done is  unlawful  is  sheer\r\n\r\nunadulterated  bunkum. It will not deceive  anyone.\r\n\r\nThis  is only the colonial way of giving us  a  bad\r\n\r\nname  and  hanging us for it. So long as  effective\r\n\r\nopposition  to  the  P.A.P. can  be  removed,  what\r\n\r\nmatters  what reason is given for its  removal  and\r\n\r\nhow   the   P.A.P. does  it?  The   ruthless   and\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  nature of the P.A.P. is already  well\r\n\r\nknown.  The  Barisan haunts the Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nhis  Ministers day and night. The Barisan  has  too\r\n\r\nmuch support for the comfort of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nTherefore, knocking out the Barisan has  become  an\r\n\r\nobsession with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this, it is clear that excuses given by\r\n\r\nthe  I.S.C. and the P.A.P. for the arrests  do  not\r\n\r\nhold   water.  The  Prime  Minister  said  on   4th\r\n\r\nFebruary:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If it were an action by the Singapore Government,\r\n\r\nwe  would never have contemplated it. It would  not\r\n\r\nbe  necessary because we would have carried on till\r\n\r\nafter 31st August, 1963.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  this  statement alone, Sir, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nadmits,  albeit inadvertently, that there  were  no\r\n\r\njustifiable  reasons whatsoever  that  necessitated\r\n\r\nthe  arrests. \"It would not be necessary,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  is  confirmed  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech which admits that \"all  was  peace\r\n\r\nand tranquility\" for the last seven months. Yet  he\r\n\r\nnow  tells  a  story  of Said  Zahari  having  left\r\n\r\nSingapore on 1st February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ask, then why did the P.A.P. carry out the\r\n\r\narrests?  I have already explained earlier  on  why\r\n\r\nthe  British and the Federation Government want  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out the arrests. They want to protect  their\r\n\r\nimperial vested interests. They want to destroy the\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  movement, if possible. But what  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.?  There  is mention in the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech  of the vested  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government. What are these vested interests?\r\n\r\nWhat  role  do these vested interests play  in  the\r\n\r\narrests?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall that the Prime Minister made some\r\n\r\nPress  statements on his return from  Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\nafter the arrests. The Member for Cairnhill had put\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister on the mat for having tried  to\r\n\r\npass  the  blame for the arrests on to the  British\r\n\r\nand  Federation  Governments. He  asked  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  \"Why did the P.A.P. Ministers  not  vote\r\n\r\nagainst the other members of the I.S.C. if they did\r\n\r\nnot  support  the  arrests?\"  And  the  poor  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had to eat humble pie and climb down  and\r\n\r\nmake  a  second statement to the Press,  this  time\r\n\r\ncorrecting  his earlier statement and  agreeing  in\r\n\r\ntoto with the I.S.C. decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no wish to go into details, but it is\r\n\r\nalready  on record that all three parties concurred\r\n\r\nwith  the  arrests. So the P.A.P. cannot  possibly\r\n\r\nescape  censure  by trying to pass  the  buck  this\r\n\r\ntime. To understand P.A.P. vested interests and why\r\n\r\nthey want the arrests, we must first understand the\r\n\r\ndesperate  situation  in  which  the  P.A.P. finds\r\n\r\nitself today. Soon after the assumption of power on\r\n\r\nthe  support of the workers in 1959, the arrogance,\r\n\r\ndictatorship,  exposure and Rightist  deviation  of\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Ministers quickly alienated the Party  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  masses. Originally 43 in an Assembly  of\r\n\r\n51, their number soon dwindled to 40 in 1960; 39 in\r\n\r\nJuly  1961;  and finally to 26, when 13 Assemblymen\r\n\r\nwalked   across  the  Floor  to  form  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.28 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Deputy SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 43 to 26, and all in a space of two years.\r\n\r\nWho could have predicted such a complete change  of\r\n\r\nfortunes for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. in 1959? Today with only 25 seats in  an\r\n\r\nAssembly  of 51, the P.A.P. Government exists  only\r\n\r\non sufferance. It has to be propped up in office by\r\n\r\nthe  Right-wing of the Opposition. That is why when\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Cairnhill  also  pressed  for   a\r\n\r\nreconvening of the Legislative Assembly, the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister dared not offend him. Otherwise, he  might\r\n\r\nfind  that  overnight he is no more Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nAnd  so terrified is the Government of meeting  the\r\n\r\npeople  that it has not dared even to hold the\r\n\r\nby-election  in Sembawang which seat was vacant  since\r\n\r\nthe  middle of August 1962, more than seven  months\r\n\r\nago.  There  is  no  justifiable  reason  for  such\r\n\r\ndelays,  but I will have more to say on this  later\r\n\r\non  other motions if there is opportunity for me to\r\n\r\ndo  so. However, I might add in passing that if the\r\n\r\nSembawang by-election should be further delayed, as\r\n\r\nI  have indicated to the Press some months back, we\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  consider  seriously  bringing   in\r\n\r\namendments  to  the Constitution to make  good  the\r\n\r\nlacuna  in the law which has allowed the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nmake a mockery of parliamentary democracy. Everyone\r\n\r\ncan  see that the P.A.P. Government is a very shaky\r\n\r\nGovernment. The people in the whole of Malaya  know\r\n\r\nit and the P.A.P. Ministers themselves know it, but\r\n\r\nunfortunately for the P.A.P. leaders, in  spite  of\r\n\r\nall  their desperate efforts at merger-peddling and\r\n\r\nMalaysia-selling,  in  spite   of   their   bending\r\n\r\nthemselves   backwards  to  please  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, in spite of their frantically trying to\r\n\r\nbuy  support with bribes and trying to  please  all\r\n\r\nthose   whom  they  had  previously  despised   and\r\n\r\nridiculed, in spite of all their attempts at staged\r\n\r\nconstituency  visits to bolster their  own  sagging\r\n\r\nmorale  and  that of opportunistic supporters,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. nevertheless has failed  to  win  back  the\r\n\r\nsupport it has lost from the people. And indeed  it\r\n\r\nis daily losing whatever support that still exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pathetic indeed to see the arrogant P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders today doing everything they can, kowtowing,\r\n\r\nin  fact, to ingratiate themselves with the various\r\n\r\norganisations,  clan  associations  and   exclusive\r\n\r\nclubs. What a climbdown from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndays  of yore for these arrogant men! When in spite\r\n\r\nof  all  these efforts, no improvement is made  and\r\n\r\ninstead  they are daily sinking lower and lower  in\r\n\r\nthe eyes of the people, it becomes obvious that the\r\n\r\ndesperate P.A.P. will resort to desperate measures.\r\n\r\nThe  main reason why all their efforts have not got\r\n\r\nthem  very far is that the Barisan Sosialis  stands\r\n\r\nin  the way. All the sympathy and support is  given\r\n\r\nto  the  Barisan Sosialis. Very little is left  for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. What terrifies the P.A.P. more is  that\r\n\r\nwhile  its  own strength and influence is shrinking\r\n\r\nand  diminishing, that of the Barisan  Sosialis  is\r\n\r\nrapidly  expanding and growing! And that, in  spite\r\n\r\nof  its so-called \"defeat\" at the referendum! It is\r\n\r\ncommon  knowledge that Barisan has the most popular\r\n\r\nmass support in Singapore. And it is even generally\r\n\r\naccepted  that the next Singapore State  Government\r\n\r\nwill he a Barisan Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, it is not difficult to\r\n\r\nguess  the  P.A.P.'s next move.  The  fear  of  our\r\n\r\ngrowing strength and influence is the urgent reason\r\n\r\nfor  the  P.A.P. decision to try and  cripple  and\r\n\r\nparalyse the Barisan as much as possible. Hence the\r\n\r\ndecision  to arrest immediately and not after  31st\r\n\r\nAugust, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. leaders hope that, with the Barisan\r\n\r\ncrippled  and generally disabled, the people  would\r\n\r\nagain  be faced with a situation analagous to  that\r\n\r\nexisting at the time of the sham referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember that the original referendum\r\n\r\nplot was to offer unacceptable alternatives to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  They  were to be compelled to  choose  the\r\n\r\nlesser  of  two or more evils. Similarly  with  the\r\n\r\narrests,  The P.A.P. leaders hope that a  political\r\n\r\nvacuum,  so  to  speak, would  be  created  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  arena. And if there were  no  adequately\r\n\r\norganised  political parties with  sufficient  mass\r\n\r\nsupport  to  eclipse  the  P.A.P. completely,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. would still stand a chance of having some of\r\n\r\ntheir   leaders   again  being   elected   to   the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly. With luck, the P.A.P. might\r\n\r\neven   win   enough  seats  to  form  a   coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment and so still remain in power. Of course,\r\n\r\nto achieve this, the trade unions, cultural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisations,    rural    associations,    hawkers\r\n\r\nassociations,  etc., will have to be  dominated  by\r\n\r\npro-P.A.P. elements. That is why all the  prominent\r\n\r\nleaders  in these organisations have been arrested.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. hopes by temporarily paralysing  these\r\n\r\norganisations  to  be  able  to  create  conditions\r\n\r\nthrough bribes, threats and intimidation for P.A.P.\r\n\r\nstooges to infiltrate into these organisations  and\r\n\r\nso dominate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already the P.A.P. has a nucleus in the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nThere are certain other unions already dominated by\r\n\r\nP.A.P. stooges.  The P.A.P. hopes  to  extend  the\r\n\r\nsphere  of  P.A.P. influence into the other  unions\r\n\r\nand  organisations. This move is important for  the\r\n\r\nimmediate future. But it is more important  in  the\r\n\r\nlong-term  view,  as it is only by domination  over\r\n\r\nthese  organisations that the P.A.P. can ever  hope\r\n\r\nfor a comeback in the political arena of Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, these are only P.A.P. pipe-dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already trouble ahead. The\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of the A.U.P.E., namely, the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Culture, has  already\r\n\r\nopenly attacked the P.A.P. Government  - a matter  of\r\n\r\na  P.A.P.  Parliamentary  Secretary  attacking  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government! So what is the future going  to\r\n\r\nbe? We can only say that all the pipe-dreams of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will remain pipe-dreams. They  go  up  like\r\n\r\nsoap bubbles, and burst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, because of these arrests, certain\r\n\r\nother  Parties are already thinking of  filling  in\r\n\r\nthe  vacuum. They talk of possible arrests in order\r\n\r\nto  give  the impression that they are  the  forces\r\n\r\nthat   represent  the  people.  That  is   entirely\r\n\r\nerroneous and foolish. The force remains  with  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis. We still have the support of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and  the  civic  organisations.  And  this\r\n\r\nsupport  will enable the Barisan Sosialis  to  bury\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. when the time comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have now outlined the Machiavellian\r\n\r\nthinking  of  the  P.A.P. This  is  the  result  of\r\n\r\nselfish  thinking of the P.A.P. leaders.  They  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  look  after the political  fortunes  of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders - the  vested   interests   of   the\r\n\r\npolitical leaders. Today, we see frantic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nefforts to erect \"standing monuments\", according to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister, in order to remind the  people\r\n\r\nof the good work of the P.A.P. Government. And when\r\n\r\nthe  elections  come along, they  hope  that  these\r\n\r\n\"standing  monuments\"  will  help  to  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople and to win them their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that, though the P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nmight  get away with not holding the Sembawang \r\n\r\nby-election, they will not be able to skip the general\r\n\r\nelections,  that is, unless more funny  things  are\r\n\r\ncooking.  The  P.A.P. was elected for  a  five-year\r\n\r\nterm.  We have seen how desperately their Ministers\r\n\r\ncling to power on the slightest excuse. Their  lust\r\n\r\nfor  power is so great that, if they could get away\r\n\r\nwith it, they would most certainly do away with the\r\n\r\ncoming  general elections. But, alas, the gods  are\r\n\r\nnot  with  the Prime Minister. He cannot  get  away\r\n\r\nwith  it  and  there  will have  to  be  a  general\r\n\r\nelection  at  the latest in early  1964,  and  with\r\n\r\nevery indication of it being held much earlier.  We\r\n\r\nstill  know nothing though about how the 15 Central\r\n\r\nParliament  seats  are  to  be  filled.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister particularly chose to be vague in order to\r\n\r\nkeep us in the dark as to what is happening to  our\r\n\r\nconstitutional future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can understand now why the P.A.P. leaders want\r\n\r\nto   arrest  political  opponents  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. Hence the arrest of all our able leaders,\r\n\r\norganisers  and  prospective  candidates  for   the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-colonial stalwarts have long struck fear and\r\n\r\npanic  into the entrails of P.A.P. leaders.  It  is\r\n\r\nwell  known  that  the desperate politicians  would\r\n\r\nsoon   resort   to  desperate  measures   to   keep\r\n\r\nthemselves in office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, a second reason why the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. want  the  arrests. We may  call  them \r\n\r\nby-products.  Arrests  and police action  cause  fear,\r\n\r\ninstil fear into people, especially those who would\r\n\r\nfight shy of the police and ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  have no quorum.

I now come to the second reason.\r\n\r\nArrests  and  police action cause and  instil  fear\r\n\r\ninto  the people, especially those who would  fight\r\n\r\nshy  of the police and the courts at all costs. The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister remembers his success in  the  last\r\n\r\ndays  of  the referendum campaign. When he realised\r\n\r\nthat the vast majority of the people were going  to\r\n\r\ncast   blank   votes,   he   unleashed   the   most\r\n\r\nunprecedented   scare - propaganda   campaign    with\r\n\r\nthreats  and intimidation to the people about  loss\r\n\r\nof   citizenship.  With  the  help  of  the  radio,\r\n\r\nRediffusion,   the  Press  and  police   vans,   he\r\n\r\nsucceeded in coercing large sections of the  people\r\n\r\ninto  voting for the White Paper merger  proposals.\r\n\r\nSimilarly this time, since he has failed to win the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the people in spite of all his  tricks,\r\n\r\nhe  now attempts to intimidate them into supporting\r\n\r\nhim.  The ruthlessness of the P.A.P. is well known.\r\n\r\nIf  a  P.A.P. member comes to ask for contribution\r\n\r\ntowards  the  erection  of welcome  arches  on  the\r\n\r\noccasion  of  the  Prime  Minister's  visit  to   a\r\n\r\nconstituency, who can refuse and say no? Who  would\r\n\r\ndare  say  no? If you were invited to subscribe  to\r\n\r\nand  attend  a  function in  honour  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister by a fearful P.A.P. branch official or  by\r\n\r\nsome  Government official, would it not be, to  say\r\n\r\nthe least, indiscreet to refuse, even dangerous  to\r\n\r\nrefuse?  Thus  we see, Sir, staged  photographs  of\r\n\r\npeople  \"welcoming\"  the Prime  Minister  and  many\r\n\r\n\"attending\"  the  Prime Minister's  functions.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. tries to buy support. When that fails,  the\r\n\r\nnext  weapon is intimidation, and with the arrests,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhopes  to  intimidate large sections of the  people\r\n\r\ninto  supporting the P.A.P., especially after  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  given  a  dose of  bedtime  stories  of\r\n\r\nRussian  bears and the Twelve Arabian  Nights.  But\r\n\r\nlet us all say here and now, it is a forlorn hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still a third reason for the arrests is the\r\n\r\nsettling  of old scores. It is well known  that  in\r\n\r\nspite of laughters, handshakes and beer-drinking in\r\n\r\nthe  C.P.A. room, P.A.P. leaders have not forgotten\r\n\r\nthat  their  predicament today is  largely  due  to\r\n\r\nthose,  now detained, withdrawing their support  to\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. We see the settling of old scores in the\r\n\r\npunitive  and vindictive treatment of detainees  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today. I will enlarge  on  this  when  I\r\n\r\nspeak  on my amendment concerning the treatment  of\r\n\r\ndetainees.  But  this  alone shows  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders  also want the arrests because of vengeance\r\n\r\nagainst those now under detention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this, we see that the main reason for\r\n\r\nthe arrests, so far as the P.A.P. is concerned,  is\r\n\r\nthe approach of the time for general elections, and\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. leaders want to safeguard the  security\r\n\r\nof  their personal vested interests. Many had known\r\n\r\nthat  the Prime Minister was only waiting for  some\r\n\r\nexcuse,  some incident, in order to give a  pretext\r\n\r\nfor  repressive action. The Brunei uprising and the\r\n\r\nincreased international tension that followed  gave\r\n\r\nhim just the excuse and pretext he had been waiting\r\n\r\nfor.  Those  now  detained  had  talked  frequently\r\n\r\nenough   of   the  Prime  Minister   using   agents\r\n\r\nprovocateurs  to create incidents, and consequently\r\n\r\nthey  had  remained sharply vigilant and  on  guard\r\n\r\nagainst  all provocations from the P.A.P. and  its\r\n\r\nmercenary   stooges.  The  mass  arrests   on   2nd\r\n\r\nFebruary,   1963,   were   therefore   not   wholly\r\n\r\nunexpected.  Those now in Outram Prison  knew  that\r\n\r\nthe  more desperate the P.A.P. got, the greater the\r\n\r\nlikelihood of repression. As the P.A.P. was sinking\r\n\r\nfurther  and further into the quagmire, all  of  us\r\n\r\nknew  it was only a matter of time before the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister would remove the velvet glove and bare his\r\n\r\niron claws. That has happened today. And to protect\r\n\r\nthe vested interests of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., action had been taken immediately  and\r\n\r\nnot left until after 31st August, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me speak on the amendment concerning the\r\n\r\ntreatment   of  detainees.  Recently   some   press\r\n\r\npublicity  has been given to the cruel and  inhuman\r\n\r\ntreatment of detainees by the P.A.P. Government  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. You might also have noticed a small item\r\n\r\nin  the  Straits Times on the 2nd of  April,  1963,\r\n\r\nabout  families  of  detainees \"squatting\"  in  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's office. The Prime Minister himself\r\n\r\nhas  referred to the incident. From this small item\r\n\r\nof  news  one  can understand that  there  must  be\r\n\r\nsomething  pretty serious before aged  parents  had\r\n\r\nbeen  compelled to go and brave the  fearful  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the ruthless P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn swoop of the Internal Security Council\r\n\r\nand  the P.A.P.'s \"Operation Cold Store\" took place\r\n\r\nin  the small hours of the morning of 2nd February,\r\n\r\n1963. It is the 10th of April today, and they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  nearly  ten  weeks in  \"Cold  Store\"  and  in\r\n\r\nsolitary   confinement.   69   days   in   solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement.  I  am not competent enough  to  speak\r\n\r\nabout  other  countries, but so fat  as  Malaya  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, this is unprecedented in prison history,\r\n\r\neven   including  the  worst  periods  of  colonial\r\n\r\noppression   and   for  the  worst   of   convicted\r\n\r\ncriminals. I shall enlarge on this later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the arrests on 2nd February, repeated\r\n\r\nrequests   had   been  made  by  Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\nAssemblymen to find out, first, where the  arrested\r\n\r\npersons were detained and, second, when we could go\r\n\r\nto  see  them.  Many of us telephoned  the  Special\r\n\r\nBranch a number of times, but always the same stock\r\n\r\nanswer   came   back,   \"No,   interrogation    not\r\n\r\ncompleted.\"  One  of  us, the Member  for  Thomson,\r\n\r\ntelephoned the Director of Prisons, and he told  us\r\n\r\nthat we could go and see the inmates, the convicted\r\n\r\nprisoners, but we would not be allowed  to  go  and\r\n\r\nsee  the political detainees unless permission  was\r\n\r\ngranted by the Special Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a little surprised at this because I myself\r\n\r\nhad  spoken to the Director if Prisons only  a  few\r\n\r\ndays  before  the arrests, when  I  met  him  at  a\r\n\r\nconsular reception, and he had indicated to me that\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing  in the law to stop  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  from seeing persons  detained  in  the\r\n\r\nprison.  This polite refusal from him was therefore\r\n\r\na   little  unexpected.  But,  of  course,  I  also\r\n\r\nrealised that this refusal was not because  of  his\r\n\r\nown  doings  and it would be unfair to  find  fault\r\n\r\nwith  him.  I  mention this not  to  embarrass  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Prisons who, so far as we know,  is  a\r\n\r\nman of integrity, but to show how the P.A.P. itself\r\n\r\nalways breaks the laws of the land, and yet accuses\r\n\r\nother  people of doing so. It is a case, as I  have\r\n\r\nalready said, of a robber crying \"thief\". Since our\r\n\r\nrepeated   verbal  and  telephone   requests   were\r\n\r\nrefused, we were forced to write to the Director of\r\n\r\nthe Special Branch instead. Accordingly, I wrote to\r\n\r\nMr Bogaars, Director of the Special Branch, on the\r\n\r\n21st  February, 1963. My letter reads  as  follows,\r\n\r\nand I intend to table it, Sir, for the record:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n `Mr Bogaars,\r\n\r\n  D.S.B.,\r\n\r\n  Singapore.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Assemblymen have repeatedly asked to be allowed\r\n\r\nto  see the detainees arrested recently. So far  we\r\n\r\nhave not been permitted to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now three weeks since detention. We want to\r\n\r\nsee for ourselves how the detainees are being kept.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know when we may be permitted  to  go\r\n\r\nand see them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  I  signed myself as Assemblyman for Queenstown\r\n\r\nand  on  behalf  of 13 Assemblymen in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. We waited for a reply, but no reply came,\r\n\r\nnot  even  an  acknowledgment.  Meanwhile,  further\r\n\r\nverbal  requests to see the detainees were made  by\r\n\r\nus.  But  the answer that came back was always  the\r\n\r\nsame,  \"Not possible now, but will let you know  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as possible.\" We waited for one week. Finally\r\n\r\nwe wrote our second letter on the 27th of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary.  It  reads as follows. (This  is  another\r\n\r\nletter which I intend to table for the record):\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n`To the D.S.B.,\r\n\r\n Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Sir,\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 3\ufffd weeks since the arbitrary arrests.\r\n\r\nRepeated  attempts  have been made  by  us  in  our\r\n\r\ncapacity  as  Assemblymen to see  our  friends  and\r\n\r\ncomrades now detained. We had also written  to  you\r\n\r\non 21-2-63 asking when we would be permitted to see\r\n\r\nthe detainees. We have received no reply so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile we are gravely disturbed by the unduly\r\n\r\nharsh  restrictions that have been imposed  on  the\r\n\r\ndetainees,  which apparently are meant  to  further\r\n\r\npunish both detainees and families alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a few detainees in the Federation have\r\n\r\nalready been allowed to read newspapers, no one  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  as yet allowed the same \"privilege\".\r\n\r\nNo hooks are allowed and only a half-hour period of\r\n\r\nrelaxation  permitted although convicted  criminals\r\n\r\nare  allowed to play basket-ball. [I understand the\r\n\r\ntime is actually 20 minutes, not half an hour.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tin biscuits and tin foods are barred. An]\r\n\r\ndetainees  are  given no drinks the whole  day.  In\r\n\r\ncases where the detainees have no parents, wives or\r\n\r\nhusbands,  brothers  or other next-of-kin  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed to see the detainees. In addition, in cases\r\n\r\nwhere  husband and wife, or brother and sister  are\r\n\r\nboth  detained, each is not permitted  to  see  the\r\n\r\nother.  Is  it  necessary to further  inflict  such\r\n\r\ncruel and inhuman treatment on the detainees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learn also that some detainees have been\r\n\r\ninformed  verbally that they have been served  with\r\n\r\nDetention Orders. How are they to object  to  these\r\n\r\nDetention  Orders, as provided under  the  law,  if\r\n\r\nthey  are not allowed to communicate with the legal\r\n\r\nadvisers immediately?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few years ago, the Prime Minister, Mr Lee\r\n\r\nKuan Yew, himself, as a lawyer and Assemblyman, was\r\n\r\nable  to see Lim Ching Siong only three days  after\r\n\r\ndetention.  It is now 3\ufffd weeks since detention  and\r\n\r\nno  legal adviser or Assemblyman has yet been given\r\n\r\npermission to see the detainees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We demand to see the actual conditions of\r\n\r\ndetention  of the detainees. Some of  them  are  in\r\n\r\npoor  health.  We demand to see for ourselves  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no breakdown in their health as a  result\r\n\r\nof maltreatment by the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to see the detainees immediately. Solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement for political detainees is inhuman. May\r\n\r\nI  draw  your attention to the Report of the Prison\r\n\r\nInquiry   Commission.   1960,   which   unanimously\r\n\r\nrecommends as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"POLITICAL DETAINEES are, or indeed, should be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  an  anomaly in a democratic  society.\r\n\r\nWhile we shall not permit ourselves any judgment on\r\n\r\nthe justice or necessity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  detaining  persons  for political  reasons,  we\r\n\r\nmight   observe  that  disagreement  with   current\r\n\r\npolitical policies and ideas does not constitute an\r\n\r\nanti-social offence and does not call for  measures\r\n\r\nof social rehabilitation. It follows that political\r\n\r\nprisoners,  if  and when there are any,  should  be\r\n\r\nkept away from institutions for convicted prisoners\r\n\r\nand be provided with all the facilities of ordinary\r\n\r\nliving. Political Detainees should therefore  enjoy\r\n\r\nconditions  [of  detention]  as  near   normal   as\r\n\r\npossible under confinement, and they should be free\r\n\r\nfrom  penal restrictions and discipline.  Political\r\n\r\nDetainees  should, in our opinion, be eligible  for\r\n\r\nas  many visits from relatives and friends  as  are\r\n\r\nadministratively   feasible;   they   should   have\r\n\r\ncomplete  liberty  to organise  their  lives  under\r\n\r\ndetention  in any manner they choose and should  be\r\n\r\nprovided  with  adequate  facilities  for  reading,\r\n\r\nwriting, study, cooking and recreation.\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  the  end  of the quote.

Of course, Sir,  this\r\n\r\nis  not  the  first time the P.A.P. has broken  the\r\n\r\nlaw, but let us continue the story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before we went to see our friends and\r\n\r\ncomrades  in  Outram Prison, we had learnt  of  the\r\n\r\ninhuman treatment they were receiving at the  hands\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. Government. Wives and families  were\r\n\r\npermitted to see their loved ones but once a  week,\r\n\r\nand  that  only for 20 minutes. No food or material\r\n\r\nwas allowed to be sent to the prison. All detainees\r\n\r\nwere kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours  and\r\n\r\n40 minutes in the 24-hour day. They were allowed to\r\n\r\ncome  out of their cells for 20 minutes a  day  for\r\n\r\nbath and exercise. That was all. But I will enlarge\r\n\r\non this a little later, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised us greatly was that detainees were\r\n\r\neven  denied access to counsel until more than  one\r\n\r\nmonth after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrest.  Whatever  arithmetic or  addition  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs, the P.A.P. cannot  deny\r\n\r\nthat  counsel  were  only  permitted  to  see   the\r\n\r\ndetainees  more  than one month after  arrest.  The\r\n\r\nexact dates can be ascertained, and assuming that a\r\n\r\nperson  can be served a detention order  within  16\r\n\r\ndays of arrest, and a further two weeks allowed for\r\n\r\ngrounds  of detention, it only adds up to 30  days,\r\n\r\nbut counsel were allowed to see the detainees, this\r\n\r\ntime  in Outram Prison, only five weeks, six weeks,\r\n\r\nseven weeks, after arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every detainee or prisoner, as far as we know,\r\n\r\nhas  the  right to be represented by  counsel.  Why then  were  detainees denied this right until  more than   one   month  after  arrest?  Why   did   the Government,  again  knowingly,  violate  the  basic rights  of detainees? The Minister for Home Affairs tried  to  be  equivocal  in  his  answer.  He   is\r\n\r\nobviously trying to hide something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our friends were sent up to the\r\n\r\nFederation  and confined in different  centres,  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur,  Ipoh, Penang and Johore  Bahru.  We\r\n\r\nlearnt that some were treated not so badly, but  it\r\n\r\nwould be ridiculous to say that treatment was  good\r\n\r\nin  any way. We know the treatment of detainees  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation has improved considerably,  and  is\r\n\r\nmany  times better than the treatment of  detainees\r\n\r\nin  Singapore today. But lest we forget, let me put\r\n\r\non record the inhuman treatment given to our friend\r\n\r\nand  comrade,  Fong  Swee Suan,  Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  member  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  and\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the Singapore  Association  of\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions, during the first few  weeks  of  his\r\n\r\ndetention in Kuala Lumpur. We do not just follow  a\r\n\r\nline,  as  alleged  by the P.A.P.,  to  depict  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch as inhuman. No, Sir. We merely  call\r\n\r\na spade a spade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fong went to see her husband, who is of frail physique and in poor health, and she was shocked\r\n\r\nat the appalling treatment he suffered  at the  hands  \r\n\r\nof the Special Branch in Kuala  Lumpur. \r\n\r\nThese are some of her complaints:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) He was in solitary confinement. The cell was\r\n\r\nlit  by  a very powerful electric bulb 24  hours  a\r\n\r\nday.  He  could  not have a chance,  therefore,  to\r\n\r\nsleep in darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There was ringing of a bell at frequent\r\n\r\nintervals  to  jar his nerves, and to  prevent  him\r\n\r\nfrom sleeping or even relaxing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) He had no bed and he had to sleep on a cement\r\n\r\nbench.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) He was handcuffed like a convicted criminal\r\n\r\nevery time he was brought outside the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) He was allowed only five minutes for his\r\n\r\nmeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no wish to go into more details. But such\r\n\r\nwas  the  treatment Mr Fong Swee Suan received  at\r\n\r\nthe hands of the Special Branch. We learnt that the\r\n\r\ntreatment improved after protests were made to  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government by Mrs Fong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now detainees in the Federation\r\n\r\nhave  been  allowed  newspapers and  other  reading\r\n\r\nmaterials  and  may now have a  chance  to  lead  a\r\n\r\ncollective  and  social  life  though  still  under\r\n\r\ndetention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the detainees in Singapore? How are\r\n\r\nthey  being  treated after 10 weeks  of  detention?\r\n\r\nIncredible as it may sound, after 10 weeks, 69 days\r\n\r\nto  be  exact, of arrest and detention, our friends\r\n\r\nare   still  being  treated  worse  than  convicted\r\n\r\ncriminals. Sir, we visited them, as I have  related\r\n\r\non  26th  and  28th March, and we  have  written  a\r\n\r\nreport  on  what we found in our visit. I  wish  to\r\n\r\ntable  it for the record, and I might as well  read\r\n\r\nit  out here to make sure that all of us know  what\r\n\r\nthe  report is. This report was written on the 29th\r\n\r\nMarch,  1963,  immediately after our  visit  and  I\r\n\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Report of visit to Outram Prison\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Together with 3 other Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nAssemblymen I visited the Outram Prison on  Tuesday\r\n\r\n25.3.63  and  on Thursday 28.3.63.  We  were  shown\r\n\r\ncourteously round the prison and we saw  altogether\r\n\r\n98  political detainees in their individual  cells.\r\n\r\n86 were in the male A Block, 9 in a separate female\r\n\r\nblock, and 3 in the prison hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. This is the first time Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nAssembly have been permitted to visit the political\r\n\r\ndetainees  despite  repeated  verbal  and   written\r\n\r\nrequests to the Government since the arrest on  the\r\n\r\n2nd February, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were all shocked by what we saw. The conditions\r\n\r\nof   detention  are  in  direct  contrast  to   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the P.A.P.-chaired  1960  Report\r\n\r\nof Prison Inquiry Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We were particularly shocked at the prolonged\r\n\r\nsolitary  confinement of political detainees.  This\r\n\r\nappears  to be a deliberate punishment of political\r\n\r\nopponents of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since arrest, all detainees have been put in\r\n\r\nsolitary confinement. They are all locked  in  tiny\r\n\r\ncells.  They  were permitted to come  out  to  wash\r\n\r\nthemselves for only 20 minutes in 24 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 20-minute period for bath and exercise has,\r\n\r\nsince  about  one  week ago, been  extended  to  45\r\n\r\nminutes. And thus today the political detainees are\r\n\r\nstill kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours and\r\n\r\n15 minutes in a 24-hour day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Detainees are not permitted newspapers or any\r\n\r\nform  of  reading material. It is only very  lately\r\n\r\nthat  some  childish reading material is  given  to\r\n\r\nsome  detainees, and ironically, English books  are\r\n\r\ngiven  to those who read only Chinese. At one  time\r\n\r\neven   dictionaries,  Malay,  Medical   and   other\r\n\r\ntextbooks were not permitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The heat is oppressive especially in the\r\n\r\nafternoon. There is no through ventilation and  the\r\n\r\natmosphere inside the cells is stuffy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Already solitary confinement in the tropical\r\n\r\nheat  has  given  rise to unhealthy appearances  on\r\n\r\nmany  of  the detainees. Many look definitely  ill.\r\n\r\nSome have sallow appearances. Others are pale. Some\r\n\r\nlook  swollen and \"bloaty\" in the face. Then  there\r\n\r\nis  one who talks a little irrationally. He advised\r\n\r\nus to be careful of our wallets being picked inside\r\n\r\nthe  prison! It is our view that he is on the verge\r\n\r\nof  a mental breakdown. Then again many complain of\r\n\r\nweakness  of  legs  because of  prolonged  solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement.  There  are  some  who  complained  of\r\n\r\nbackache as a result of having to sit for hours  on\r\n\r\nnon-mattress spring beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. There is the case of one (already suffering\r\n\r\nfrom pulmonary tuberculosis and referred to by  Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall)  who complained on Saturday. 23rd  March,\r\n\r\n1963,  of  a boil in the back and had asked  to  be\r\n\r\nsent  to  the  Prison Hospital on  the  morning  of\r\n\r\nMonday. 25th March. 1963. This was refused but  the\r\n\r\nauthorities changed their minds and sent him to the\r\n\r\nPrison Hospital in the same afternoon. When we  saw\r\n\r\nhim  on Thursday, 28th March. 1963, he had an ulcer\r\n\r\non  his back between the shoulder blades, measuring \ufffd\" X 1\ufffd\",    with   ragged   angry   edges,    inflamed\r\n\r\nsurroundings and pus and gangrenous slough  in  the\r\n\r\ncentre.  This ulcer could easily have been  due  to\r\n\r\nimproper  care  following trauma inside  the  cell,\r\n\r\nlack of exercise and undernourishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Contrary to what Marshall has said, the food is\r\n\r\nfar from satisfactory. The fish sometimes is stale,\r\n\r\nand  no  fruit is provided. The salt fish is hardly\r\n\r\nedible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families can send in fresh fruit and tin food now.\r\n\r\nBut even eggs were not permitted three weeks ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. A major complaint is that many have to defecate\r\n\r\nand  micturate into chamber pots inside the  cells.\r\n\r\nThere  is no means for proper washing of the hands,\r\n\r\nto  say  nothing  of  proper ablutions  for  Muslim\r\n\r\ndetainees.  Any washing would mean wetting  of  the\r\n\r\ncell.  Detainees are not permitted out of the  cell\r\n\r\nto  wash and clean themselves after defecation; nor\r\n\r\nto  empty  the  chamber pots,  which  if  uncovered\r\n\r\nsometime after, would emit faecal odours that  foul\r\n\r\nand   \"poison\"   the  atmosphere  in   the   poorly\r\n\r\nventilated cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. This has resulted in some detainees not\r\n\r\nwilling  to wash their hands and mouths  the  whole\r\n\r\nday,  as  such washing must be done into  the  same\r\n\r\nchamber  pots  and  uncovering these  chamber  pots\r\n\r\nwould  mean  fouling the whole cell. For  the  same\r\n\r\nreason  some  detainees  have  been  deterred  from\r\n\r\ncleaning  the  mouth and brushing the teeth  before\r\n\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Detainees are now permitted pen and paper to\r\n\r\nwrite letters once a week. But no table or chair is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  such  writing excepting  the  female\r\n\r\ndetainees. We saw one male detainee kneeling on the\r\n\r\nfloor   and  writing  a  letter  in  that  kneeling\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Many complained that close relation and near\r\n\r\nand  dear  friends have not been permitted  to  see\r\n\r\nthem. Brothers and sisters who are both detained in\r\n\r\nthe  same prison are similarly debarred from seeing\r\n\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Many have been interrogated a number of times.\r\n\r\nSome were interrogated once soon after arrest,  but\r\n\r\nthat  was all. There are two who have not even been\r\n\r\ninterrogated at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. During our visit, certain requests were made\r\n\r\nby  detainees, for example, hand fans;  chairs  and\r\n\r\ntables  for  writing letters; two baths  every  day\r\n\r\ninstead  of  one,  better reading material,  better\r\n\r\nfood    and    daily   newspapers.   (The    Prison\r\n\r\nCommissioner, Major James, said he had instructions\r\n\r\nnot to give newspapers to detainees).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no request is more urgent than that they must\r\n\r\nhave   more  time  for  exercise;  more  time   for\r\n\r\nbreathing the fresh air and seeing the sun  outside\r\n\r\nthe cramped cells; time and opportunity for meeting\r\n\r\nfellow detainees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. It does look as if the P.A.P. Government locks\r\n\r\npolitical detainees in solitary confinement  purely\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake  of  punishment  and  vengeance   on\r\n\r\npolitical opponents. Their excuse that this is  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  interrogation is balderdash  and  sheer\r\n\r\nnonsense.  Many have been interrogated,  once  soon\r\n\r\nafter  arrests  and  they  have  been  in  solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement  ever since. A few have not  been  even\r\n\r\ninterrogated at all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long is the period of interrogation? If\r\n\r\ninterrogation should take months and  months,  does\r\n\r\nit  mean that solitary confinement will go  on  for\r\n\r\nmonths and months?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How silly and ridiculous can the P.A.P. argument\r\n\r\nbecome?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. There is no doubt that this sort of solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement   is  savage,  barbaric  and   inhuman.\r\n\r\nPolitical detainees are not convicted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncriminals  and  must not be treated as  such.  Even\r\n\r\nconvicted  criminals  are  not  given  such   cruel\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. Solitary confinement of convicted criminals is\r\n\r\nonly  given  as punishment for breaking of  certain\r\n\r\nrules  and  regulations  whilst  in  prison.   Such\r\n\r\nsolitary confinement is given only for a period  of\r\n\r\n1 day (for the lighter offences) to a maximum of 30\r\n\r\ndays  (for the heavier offences). And at least  one\r\n\r\nfull  hour is permitted for exercise and fresh  air\r\n\r\noutside the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.Today political detainees, who are not\r\n\r\nconvicted  criminals,  have been  put  in  solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement  for 8 weeks, i.e., double the  maximum\r\n\r\nperiod of 30 days given as punishment for the worst\r\n\r\noffences of convicted criminals!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, for more than 6 weeks the detainees\r\n\r\nhad  only 20 minutes in 24 hours outside the cells.\r\n\r\nOnly  recently has the period been increased to  45\r\n\r\nminutes. This is still short of the minimum of  one\r\n\r\nfull   hour  in  24  that  is  permitted  convicted\r\n\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. Today even P.A.P. backers and supporters are\r\n\r\nshocked   at   the  cruel  tortures  of   political\r\n\r\ndetainees.  The P.A.P. Government stands  condemned\r\n\r\nin the eyes of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must warn the P.A.P. Government. If the health\r\n\r\nof  the  detainees,  whether  mental  or  physical,\r\n\r\nshould  break  down  as a result  of  such  inhuman\r\n\r\nsolitary confinement, the P.A.P. will have to stand\r\n\r\nfull responsibility for all the consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appeal to the people of Singapore and other\r\n\r\ncountries to take serious note of and condemn these\r\n\r\ninhuman   atrocities  committed   by   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> On a point of order.

All available information  shows\r\n\r\nhow  callous, brutal and cruel the P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch  have been in  their  treatment  of\r\n\r\nthose now under detention in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have now mentioned here but a few instances of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. inhuman treatment of detainees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The callousness and unreasonableness of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and  the Special Branch can  be  seen  from\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude  to the reasonable  and  legitimate\r\n\r\nrequests of detainees. Take, for instance, the case\r\n\r\nof  the  three Nanyang graduates who  asked  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  attend  the Convocation  on  the  30th\r\n\r\nMarch, 1963, at Nanyang University to receive their\r\n\r\ndiplomas  on  this big day. They were ready  to  go\r\n\r\nunder escort and abide by any condition the Special\r\n\r\nBranch  might  impose. This request of  theirs  was\r\n\r\nmade  by their counsel to both the Director of  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch and to the Minister.  But  did  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the Special Branch accede  to  their\r\n\r\nreasonable  and understandable requests?  No,  Sir.\r\n\r\nAll  the requests were refused. It looks as if  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch  is completely insensitive  to  all\r\n\r\npersuasion. The three graduates - their names are Ong\r\n\r\nSujo Kook, Tan Kok Fang, Chua Siew Chuan - had to  be\r\n\r\npunished with solitary confinement instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of Peh Tian Guan shows the cruelties and\r\n\r\ntortures  the P.A.P. and Special Branch inflict  on\r\n\r\ndetainees.  Peh Tian Guan was interrogated  by  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch on 5th March, and because he did not\r\n\r\ngive answers that pleased the interrogator, he  was\r\n\r\nsqueezed  on  the  mouth  by  the  Special   Branch\r\n\r\ninterrogator.  Then  when he refused  to  admit  to\r\n\r\nthings  which he knew nothing about, he was ordered\r\n\r\nby the Special Branch interrogator to stand up, put\r\n\r\nhis  hands on top of his head, and squat  down  and\r\n\r\nget  up  160 times, himself counting the number  of\r\n\r\nsquats at the same time. The next day Peh Tian Guan\r\n\r\ncould  hardly  walk  as  a result  of  this  unjust\r\n\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was reported to the Prison authorities who\r\n\r\nsaw  the poor man in his terrible condition.

He could not even squat  down\r\n\r\nat  the toilet, as he had not had exercise for  the\r\n\r\npast  one  month. But what has the Government  done\r\n\r\nabout  this? On the 16th of March, counsel for  Mr\r\n\r\nPeh   wrote   to   the  Commissioner   of   Police,\r\n\r\ncomplaining to him of ill-treatment and manhandling\r\n\r\nof  detainees. Counsel also complained, at the same\r\n\r\ntime,  of  another  Nanyang  student  having   been\r\n\r\nslapped  in  the  face,  apparently  by  the   same\r\n\r\ninterrogator.  But  what has  the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPolice done about this complaint?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Nothing was done. There was no\r\n\r\ntruth in the allegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Home Affairs\r\n\r\nsays,  doing  nothing. Is that the way  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  treats detainees? Counsel suggested  an\r\n\r\nidentification parade as Mr Peh can recognise  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch interrogator who so ill-treated him.\r\n\r\nThere   is,   however,   no   response   from   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police. I hear that Peh  Tian  Guan\r\n\r\nhas been threatened with the punishment of death if\r\n\r\nhe should pursue the matter further. What sort of a\r\n\r\nCommissioner   of  Police  do  we  have?   Is   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Police  going  to  shelter   this\r\n\r\nculprit?  And is the P.A.P. also going  to  shelter\r\n\r\nthis  culprit? I would like to hear some words from\r\n\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the police are meant to protect the people,\r\n\r\nnot  to:  knock them about, still less to  threaten\r\n\r\nthem  with  death. A man died mysteriously  in  the\r\n\r\nC.I.D. lock-up only two years ago, Sir, as a result\r\n\r\nof manhandling by some so-called \"unknown persons\".\r\n\r\nIs  the PAP, going to connive at such ill-treatment\r\n\r\nof  detainees  until  there is  another  mysterious\r\n\r\ndeath?  Why does the P.A.P. not immediately  punish\r\n\r\nthe  culprit  and give the House an assurance  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be no such repetition of ill-treatment\r\n\r\nand  manhandling of detainees? Instead, Sir, I  see\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries  think\r\n\r\nthat  it  is a good thing for detainees to be \r\n\r\nill-treated in this manner. But, anyway they will  have\r\n\r\nto answer for all this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter which I want to touch on\r\n\r\nbefore I come to solitary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfinement of detainees. The Government  must  not\r\n\r\nforget  that many of the arrested persons were  the\r\n\r\nsole breadwinners in their families. What does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment intend to do about assistance  to  these\r\n\r\nfamilies  that need assistance? I saw one  detainee\r\n\r\nin  the  prison  hospital  (he  who  has  pulmonary\r\n\r\ntuberculosis and a large ulcer on his back) crying.\r\n\r\nHe  was extremely worried about his family and aged\r\n\r\ndependants, as he was the sole breadwinner. I asked\r\n\r\nthe  Special  Branch  officer  who  accompanied  us\r\n\r\nthroughout our visit to the Prison as to  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was doing about financial aid  to  needy\r\n\r\nfamilies.  He said the families must apply  to  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare for assistance. Let us ask:  is  it\r\n\r\nnot  the duty, the responsibility of Government  to\r\n\r\nsee   to   the  welfare  of  families  whose   sole\r\n\r\nbreadwinners the P.A.P. Government has arrested and\r\n\r\ndetained?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am at this, Sir, let me bring out another\r\n\r\ninstance of the injustice of the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\nMr  Chang  Chan Chuan, a teacher of the Nan  Chiau\r\n\r\nGirls  High School, who has an old mother and  four\r\n\r\nyounger brothers and sisters dependent entirely  on\r\n\r\nhim,  was paid only four days' salary for the month\r\n\r\nof February. Why? Even temporary staff are paid one\r\n\r\nmonth's  salary  in  lieu  of  notice.  Why  should\r\n\r\nGovernment be so harsh on Mr Chang?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was the practice for Government to pay\r\n\r\ndetainees  who had employment before, e.g.  Cyprus,\r\n\r\nsurely  the P.A.P. could do the same? Why  has  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to go out of its way to be harsh and  cruel\r\n\r\nto   detainees?  All  the  hardships  suffered   by\r\n\r\nfamilies  of  detainees are  due  to  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nrepressive  action.  The  Government  is  therefore\r\n\r\nresponsible    and    should    not    shirk    its\r\n\r\nresponsibility. Some proper scale of  allowance  to\r\n\r\nthe   detainees'   family  is  urgent.   Will   the\r\n\r\nGovernment give immediate attention to the matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are those who are detained in the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Every  time visits  are  made  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  it eats into the savings  of  families\r\n\r\nwho can ill afford the expenses incurred in travels\r\n\r\naway from home. In this instance again,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is the Government's duty and responsibility  to\r\n\r\nsee  that free transport and free accommodation  be\r\n\r\nprovided  for  the families. Detainees  should  not\r\n\r\nhave been sent out of Singapore in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the health of political\r\n\r\ndetainees.   Imprisoned   in   stuffy   cells   and\r\n\r\noppressive  heat, with no sunlight and  fresh  air,\r\n\r\ninadequate  exercise  and  poor  food,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nunexpected that we saw so many who looked ill  when\r\n\r\nwe visited the prison two weeks ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Tay Kee Chuan and Kee Swee Ban. It\r\n\r\nis my firm belief, Sir, that but for their original\r\n\r\ngood  health and high morale that cannot be crushed\r\n\r\nby threats and intimidations and ill-treatment, the\r\n\r\npunitive and vindictive treatment would have caused\r\n\r\ngrave  illness amongst many of the detainees.  Many\r\n\r\nof  the detainees look \"bloaty\" in their faces. For\r\n\r\nexample, Teo Siang Oon, Chen Ee Fong. Many complain\r\n\r\nof   weakness  in  their  legs.  Many  had   sallow\r\n\r\nappearances. For example, Wang Yuen Peow, Chua Siew\r\n\r\nChuan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some who have been confined in the Central Police\r\n\r\nStation lock-ups have lost considerable weight. For\r\n\r\nexample, Poh Choon Seng has lost 10 lbs, since  his\r\n\r\narrest,  and Chok Koh Thong, our Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee member, and one who was mentioned by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister a little while ago, has lost 19 lbs.\r\n\r\nThis  loss  of weight is a result of the detention,\r\n\r\nand their solitary confinement and cruel treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just comment slightly on Mr Ghouse. He was\r\n\r\nseen  by  his  counsel on the 2nd of April  and  he\r\n\r\ncomplained  of  chronic constipation since  arrest,\r\n\r\nwhich,  was  not  relieved by Agarol,  a  laxative,\r\n\r\nwhich  was given to him. He complained Of  pain  in\r\n\r\nthe  ears  and  stomach, and he  reported  that  he\r\n\r\nvomited  at  about 9 p.m. on 3rd  April,  1963.  He\r\n\r\nappeared   nervous  and  was  sweating   profusely,\r\n\r\nwetting in no time two handkerchiefs given  to  him\r\n\r\nby his counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such, Sir, are but a few examples of how solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement  has  affected  the  detainees.   Today\r\n\r\ndetainees  at  Outram  Prison  are  still  kept  in\r\n\r\nsolitary  confinement in cells 5 feet  by  11  feet\r\n\r\nwith tiny barred windows near the ceiling.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are still permitted only to come Out  of\r\n\r\ntheir  cells for only 45 minutes in 24  hours,  and\r\n\r\nduring  these  45  minutes they must  bathe,  wash,\r\n\r\ndefecate  and exercise. This is the only time  when\r\n\r\nthey  can breathe the fresh air outside the  stuffy\r\n\r\ncells and enjoy the sunshine. All in 45 minutes! If\r\n\r\nthey  do not feel the urge for bowel action at this\r\n\r\ntime, they will have to defecate in the cells!  And\r\n\r\nuntil about three weeks ago, the period allowed for\r\n\r\nbath  and  fresh air, as I have already  mentioned,\r\n\r\nwas only 20 minutes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspapers are still not permitted and, until\r\n\r\nrecently,  even  books  and  tin  foods  were   not\r\n\r\nallowed.  Sir,  we  can imagine how  the  detainees\r\n\r\nfeel, all alone  - 23 hours and 15 minutes out of  24\r\n\r\nhours a day inside a tiny cell, with no one to talk\r\n\r\nto,  no  newspapers to read, not  knowing  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  outside the cell, seeing no  one  except\r\n\r\nuniformed  prison  guards,  all  the  time  in  the\r\n\r\nstuffy, suffocating atmosphere and oppressive heat,\r\n\r\ngazing  at the walls around them, and looking  into\r\n\r\nspace but seeing nothing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the P.A.P. Ministers imagine what it means\r\n\r\nfor  a  man  to  be in solitary confinement  daily,\r\n\r\nhaving only a single non-mattressed spring-bed  and\r\n\r\nthe  thick drab walls as company? Would the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  like to have a taste of what  they  have\r\n\r\ngiven  the detainees? Would the Ministers  like  to\r\n\r\nchange places with the detainees just for one  day?\r\n\r\nSir,  a man is a social animal. He is horn to  live\r\n\r\namongst   men.  He  is  brought  up  in  a   social\r\n\r\nenvironment.  He  lives, works  and  plays  amongst\r\n\r\nfellow  human beings. Until death, he  is  all  the\r\n\r\ntime  associated  with  his  fellow  human  beings.\r\n\r\nExcepting for hermits and recluses, man cannot live\r\n\r\nalone. He can exist alone, but he needs the company\r\n\r\nof  fellow  human beings in order to live.  Without\r\n\r\nsocial  company, a man's faculties do  not  develop\r\n\r\nand function. He rapidly degenerates and atrophies.\r\n\r\nUltimately he becomes the shell of a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, refer you to the Prison Ordinance,\r\n\r\nsection  58  (1), and see what the law  says  about\r\n\r\nsolitary confinement;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit talks of the punishment by the Superintendent of\r\n\r\nminor prison offences. Section 58 (1)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Superintendent may punish any prisoner found\r\n\r\nafter  due  inquiry to be guilty of a minor  prison\r\n\r\noffence as hereinafter specified by ordering him to\r\n\r\nundergo one or more of the following punishments:'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And (a)  says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Confinement in a punishment cell for a term not\r\n\r\nexceeding  seven days on a diet of bread and  water\r\n\r\nor rice and water;'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will see, Sir, this is a punishment inflicted\r\n\r\nby  the Superintendent for people who are convicted\r\n\r\nprisoners and it says, \"not exceeding seven days\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, may I refer you, Sir, to section 59 (1) ,\r\n\r\nwhich talks of the punishment by the Superintendent\r\n\r\nof   aggravated  prison  offences.  These  are  for\r\n\r\nheavier  offences of convicted prisoners  while  in\r\n\r\nprison. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Superintendent may punish any prisoner found\r\n\r\nafter  due  inquiry to be guilty of  an  aggravated\r\n\r\nprison offence as hereinafter specified by ordering\r\n\r\nhim  to  undergo  one  or  more  of  the  following\r\n\r\npunishments:'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And I just refer you to (b), which states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Confinement in a punishment cell for a term not\r\n\r\nexceeding  seven days on a diet of bread and  water\r\n\r\nor rice and water.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are punishments inflicted by the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent on convicted prisoners and  it  says\r\n\r\nnothing  of  any punishment of solitary confinement\r\n\r\nthat exceeds seven days. Let me now, Sir, refer you\r\n\r\nto   section  62  (1) ,  and  section  62  talks  of\r\n\r\npunishment  by  Visiting Justices. This  refers  to\r\n\r\nmore  aggravated  offences committed  by  convicted\r\n\r\nprisoners, and it reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`62 (1) Where a prisoner is accused of any\r\n\r\naggravated prison offence and the Superintendent is\r\n\r\nof  opinion that, in the circumstances of the case,\r\n\r\nthe  power  of  punishment which  he  possesses  is\r\n\r\ninadequate, he shall forthwith report the matter in\r\n\r\nwriting to the Visiting Justice or Justices.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And (2)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Visiting Justice or Justices shall, upon\r\n\r\nreceipt  of  such  report,  attend  at  the  prison\r\n\r\nwithout undue delay and investigate the charge, and\r\n\r\nmay punish any prisoner whom after due inquiry upon\r\n\r\noath  he  or  they may find guilty of such  offence\r\n\r\nwith one or more of the following punishments:-'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And (a)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Confinement in a punishment cell for a term not\r\n\r\nexceeding 30 days upon such prescribed diet  as  he\r\n\r\nor they may think fit.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to impress upon you, Sir, that these\r\n\r\npunishments  are only for convicted prisoners,  and\r\n\r\nthe  maximum that could be inflicted is seven  days\r\n\r\nby   the  Superintendent  and  30  days  after  due\r\n\r\ninvestigation  by  Visiting  Justices.  Today   our\r\n\r\nfriends  and comrades are not convicted  prisoners,\r\n\r\nbut  they have been put in solitary confinement for\r\n\r\n70 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer you, Sir, to the penal law of India,\r\n\r\n6th  edition  of  1955, and it tells  how  solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement will affect a man. This is a law  book.\r\n\r\nI  refer,  Sir, to section 73 of the  Indian  Penal\r\n\r\nCode  which  is  on page 227. Section  73  under  a\r\n\r\nheading called \"Analogous Law\" reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Under English law, solitary confinement, though\r\n\r\nat  one  time  legal, was rarely  awarded  and  was\r\n\r\nfinally abolished by the Statute Law Revision  Act,\r\n\r\n1893.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  section  prescribes the  limit  within  which\r\n\r\nsolitary confinement may be awarded. It repeats  an\r\n\r\nold English rule, now obsolete as a form of torture\r\n\r\nwhich fails in its effect on the public.' And  this\r\n\r\nis a very important sentence, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When unduly prolonged it leads to mental\r\n\r\nderangement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And   following  this,  under  the  next  paragraph\r\n\r\n\"Principle\" it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Solitary confinement is isolation of the prisoner\r\n\r\nfrom  human  intercourse and society. It  causes  a\r\n\r\nfeeling   of   oppression  due  to  the  gregarious\r\n\r\ninstincts  of man. Prolonged isolation  from  human\r\n\r\ncommunion  becomes intolerable and often  leads  to\r\n\r\nmental derangement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And then it reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The sentence has been, therefore, reserved for\r\n\r\nhardened criminals and as a punishment for atrocity\r\n\r\nor brutality. It should not be ordered unless there\r\n\r\nappear  in the evidence some special features  such\r\n\r\nas  extreme violence or brutality in the commission\r\n\r\nof the offence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Of  course,  it  talks  of the  convicted  prisoner\r\n\r\ncommitting  some brutal offence whilst  in  prison.\r\n\r\nThere is only one more quotation here, Sir, and  it\r\n\r\nis in section 74. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In executing a sentence of solitary confinement,\r\n\r\nsuch confinement shall in no case exceed 14 days at\r\n\r\na  time,  with  intervals between  the  periods  of\r\n\r\nsolitary confinement of not less duration than such\r\n\r\nperiods,  and  when the imprisonment awarded  shall\r\n\r\nexceed three months, the solitary confinement shall\r\n\r\nnot exceed seven days in any one month of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhole  imprisonment awarded, with intervals between\r\n\r\nthe  periods  of solitary confinement of  not  less\r\n\r\nduration than such periods.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  under  the  same heading \"Analogous  Law\",  it\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This section has been enacted on medical grounds.\r\n\r\nContinuous  solitary confinement  is  conducive  to\r\n\r\nphysical deterioration and mental derangement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  you can see even the law book tells  us  that\r\n\r\nsolitary  confinement has serious  effects  on  the\r\n\r\nhealth  of a person, and because of that,  solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement  is  only given to the worst  and  most\r\n\r\nhardened of convicted prisoners and does not exceed\r\n\r\n14  days. But our friends now in Outram Prison have\r\n\r\nbeen  confined in solitary confinement for 69 days.\r\n\r\nIs that what the P.A.P. Ministers want? Are they so\r\n\r\nvindictive  and  punitive in  their  punishment  of\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents that they only allow  them  to\r\n\r\nexist  but  not  to live - and may  not  even  exist?\r\n\r\nSolitary  confinement is a terrible punishment  and\r\n\r\nit  is normally, as I have already indicated, given\r\n\r\nas  punishment  to  convicted  prisoners  who  have\r\n\r\nfurther committed grave offences while in prison. I\r\n\r\nunderstand. Sir, even the High Court Judge does not\r\n\r\nnormally   sentence  or  convict  an  offender   to\r\n\r\nsolitary confinement. But today the P.A.P. punishes\r\n\r\ninnocent  persons arbitrarily arrested and detained\r\n\r\nwith  solitary confinement. This indeed, shows  the\r\n\r\nFascist   and   sadistic  nature  of   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters!   This  cruel  and  vindictive   inhuman\r\n\r\ntreatment  given  to detainees in Singapore  breaks\r\n\r\nall  records. There was nothing like  this  in  the\r\n\r\nworst  of the worst colonial days. It does look  as\r\n\r\nif  the Prime Minister has aped his colonial master\r\n\r\nso  well that in the art of cruelty and tortures he\r\n\r\nis now master of his master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to the United Kingdom recently and there I\r\n\r\nvisited  some organisations that concern themselves\r\n\r\nwith the treatment of prisoners of conscience, i.e.\r\n\r\npolitical   prisoners.   One   of   them   is   the\r\n\r\norganisation  Amnesty, whose aims  include  seeking\r\n\r\nthe  release of those imprisoned for their opinions\r\n\r\nand  seeking  for  them fair and  public  trial.  I\r\n\r\nvisited  the  Amnesty  on  11th  March.  1963,  and\r\n\r\nexplained  to  its officials what is  happening  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey   were   very  sympathetic  and   helpful.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that Amnesty has written to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  a  letter  asking him  to  answer  a  few\r\n\r\nquestions. But so far as I know the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  not even bothered to reply to this letter from\r\n\r\nAmnesty.  I have brought back with me a leaflet  of\r\n\r\nthe  Amnesty  International, the  code  of  conduct\r\n\r\ntowards prisoners of conscience. I table it for the\r\n\r\ninformation  of hon. Members. It is a Minimum  Code\r\n\r\nof conduct towards political prisoners and has been\r\n\r\napproved by a committee of lawyers from the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  Australia, Belgium, France,  Germany  and\r\n\r\nSweden.  We  can  see straightaway  that  what  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  is doing  today  is  in  direct\r\n\r\nconflict  with  the  Minimum  Code  of  conduct  to\r\n\r\npolitical  prisoners,  as  recognised  by   Western\r\n\r\ncountries.  Let us skip through just a few  of  the\r\n\r\narticles  in  this Minimum Code and see  what  they\r\n\r\nsay. Article 5 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The authority arresting a prisoner of conscience\r\n\r\nshall  immediately  notify his next-of-kin  or  his\r\n\r\nlegal representative of his arrest and of the place\r\n\r\nwhere he is kept in custody.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The P.A.P. and the Special Branch took six days  to\r\n\r\nnotify the next-of-kin and, in fact, did everything\r\n\r\nthey  could to deny information to the next-of-kin.\r\n\r\nArticle 6 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) Upon arrest a prisoner of conscience shall\r\n\r\nhave  the right to be assisted by legal counsel  of\r\n\r\nhis own choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) He shall be informed of this right and\r\n\r\nprovided  with facilities to communicate  with  his\r\n\r\nlawyer.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  we  know, Sir, that our detainees  today  have\r\n\r\nbeen denied access to legal counsel until more than\r\n\r\none  month after arrest. Neither were they informed\r\n\r\nof  this  right  and  provided with  facilities  to\r\n\r\ncommunicate with their lawyers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 9 (a) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A prisoner of conscience shall not be induced to\r\n\r\ngive  information  by violence or  threats  or  any\r\n\r\nunfair means.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But,  as I have related, the detainees have already\r\n\r\nbeen threatened with death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 10 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A prisoner of conscience shall not be required to\r\n\r\nstand  except when his cell is inspected or  during\r\n\r\nthe first five minutes of any interrogation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, as in the case of Peh Tian Guan, the detainees\r\n\r\nhave  been ordered to stand and squat 160 times  as\r\n\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 11(a) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A prisoner of conscience on remand shall not\r\n\r\nsuffer    any    unnecessary    restrictions     or\r\n\r\ndeprivations.

If he is not brought  to\r\n\r\ntrial  within six months, he shall be deemed to  be\r\n\r\nacquitted  and shall be free from further  arrests,\r\n\r\ncustody,  imprisonment, trial or other sanction  on\r\n\r\nthe ground on which he was originally arrested.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know what has happened. There are persons\r\n\r\nwho  have  been  detained for  nearly  seven  years\r\n\r\nwithout charge or trial. Does the Government intend\r\n\r\nto give all the arrested persons a fair trial in an\r\n\r\nimpartial court?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Article 25 (a) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A prisoner of conscience shall not be subjected\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) physical violence:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) forced labour;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) cruel or inhuman punishment: or.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) a collective punishment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know what sort of punishment the detainees\r\n\r\nare  getting. They have been subjected to  physical\r\n\r\nviolence,  forced  labour, and  cruel  and  inhuman\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote one more Article. Article 32 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`During the period of his detention the state\r\n\r\nshall be obliged to pay an allowance in cash to any\r\n\r\ndependant  of  a prisoner of conscience  unable  to\r\n\r\nsupport himself.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But   the  Government  has  done  nothing  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P.'s inhuman treatment of political\r\n\r\ndetainees  has  been condemned by  friend  and  foe\r\n\r\nalike,  by those who oppose the P.A.P. as  well  as\r\n\r\nthose who actively back and support the P.A.P. Even\r\n\r\nthe  good friend of the P.A.P. Ministers, Mr  John\r\n\r\nStrachey.  Labour  M.P., has  openly  condemned  the\r\n\r\ninhuman treatment. He asked why the detainees could\r\n\r\nnot be sent to St. John's Island as in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to refer again to Paper Cmd. 17 of\r\n\r\n1962,  the 1960 Report of the Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\non   Prisons.  The  Report  recommends  that   \"all\r\n\r\npolitical  detainees should enjoy  as  near  normal\r\n\r\nconditions  of detention as possible.\"  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  had  accepted  and  implemented  certain\r\n\r\nrecommendations in the Report, like the  change  of\r\n\r\nname  from  the  \"Commissioner of Prisons\"  to  the\r\n\r\n\"Director  of Prisons\". But for reasons best  known\r\n\r\nto   themselves,   they  do   not   implement   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations   concerning  the   conditions   of\r\n\r\ndetention of political detainees. The excuse  given\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. for  the solitary  confinement  of\r\n\r\ndetainees is that it is necessary during the period\r\n\r\nof  interrogation. Yet, according to  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs, so far only  one-third  of  the\r\n\r\ndetainees  have been interrogated. Only  statements\r\n\r\nhave  been  taken  from all.  This  is  a  shocking\r\n\r\nrevelation,  Sir. More than two months have  passed\r\n\r\nand  the Minister says that only one-third  of  the\r\n\r\ndetainees have so far been interrogated. When  will\r\n\r\ninterrogation  be  over? At this rate  of  progress\r\n\r\ninterrogation  will not be completed until  another\r\n\r\nfour  or  five  months. And judging from  the  past\r\n\r\npractice,  the interrogation will not be  completed\r\n\r\nuntil  after  months  and years.  Does  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nintend  tot lock up political detainees in solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement  and with no access tot newspapers  for\r\n\r\nsix or seven months or even years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith   all  their  self-professed  brilliance   and\r\n\r\ningenuity,  the  P.A.P.  Government  today   cannot\r\n\r\ninvent  a  better  excuse for these  cruelties  and\r\n\r\ntortures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health of the detainees is the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. Government. Already there are  some\r\n\r\nwho  talk a little irrationally as mentioned in  my\r\n\r\nreport.  Does  the  Government really  intend  that\r\n\r\nthese people be detained until they become mentally\r\n\r\nunbalanced?  Sir, according to Price's Textbook  of\r\n\r\nMedicine,   illnesses  could  be  produced   during\r\n\r\nsolitary confinement, and they can be grouped  into\r\n\r\nthree   categories:  (1)   mental   disorders,   (2) \r\n\r\npsychosomatic illnesses, and (3)  somatic illness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental illnesses that can be produced as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  solitary confinement are: (1)  Affective\r\n\r\ndisorders like (a)  excitement, (b)  depression,  (c) \r\n\r\nanxiety;  (2)   Schizophrenia;  (3)   Paranoia;   (4) \r\n\r\nHysteria. Those who have a familial pre-disposition\r\n\r\nto  these  illnesses are more susceptible to  these\r\n\r\ndiseases than others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me finally quote from this medical book,\r\n\r\nClinical Psychiatry, by Dr Mayer-Gross, Slater and\r\n\r\nRoth of Cassell & Company, Limited, London 1960. On\r\n\r\npage   169,   whilst  discussing  the  psychopathic\r\n\r\npersonality of neurotic reactions, in the paragraph\r\n\r\nunder the heading of \"Precipitation\", there is this\r\n\r\nvery small paragraph, paragraph 5:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The isolation in prison and especially in\r\n\r\nsolitary  confinement is a most  fertile  soil  for\r\n\r\nparanoid reactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birnhaum (1908) has made a study of such cases.\r\n\r\nSome  prisoners  developed fantastic  delusions  of\r\n\r\nbeing  pardoned or acquitted and indemnified, which\r\n\r\ndisappeared  when  they were allowed  to  mix  with\r\n\r\nothers  or  when  the sentence had been  concluded.\r\n\r\nParanoid reactions in prisoners of war, isolated by\r\n\r\nlanguage  from  their environment, have  also  been\r\n\r\nobserved.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have learnt that even the Government\r\n\r\nPrisons  Doctor, Dr Leong Hon Koon, has complained\r\n\r\nof  the  solitary confinement. I understand he  has\r\n\r\nalready seen the Minister for Home Affairs and  has\r\n\r\ntold  him  that  as  a  doctor  he  would  not   be\r\n\r\nresponsible for the health of the detainees if they\r\n\r\nshould be further detained in solitary confinement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only ask the P.A.P. Ministers since none\r\n\r\nof  them  are here, it could he conveyed to them - to\r\n\r\nremember  the  fate that overtook all  the  Fascist\r\n\r\ndictators of the past. The verdict of the people is\r\n\r\na  terrible thing and it is especially terrible  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  go out of their way to inflict  inhuman\r\n\r\ntortures on the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now, Sir, conclude and finish with what I\r\n\r\nhave  taken considerable time to inform  the  House\r\n\r\nof. There are still one or two points mentioned  in\r\n\r\nthe  I.S.C. statement which I have not as yet dealt\r\n\r\nwith  adequately. For example, there is still  this\r\n\r\nirresponsible  talk of the sham  referendum  having\r\n\r\nindicated  the wishes of the decisive  majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  people in Singapore. It has indicated  nothing\r\n\r\nof  that sort, of course. But suffice it to say now\r\n\r\nthat  the  referendum on the 1st  September,  1962,\r\n\r\nnever  at  any  time reflected the  true  will  and\r\n\r\ndesire  of  the  people  of Singapore.  The  I.S.C.\r\n\r\nstatement  has  sought  to justify  the  repressive\r\n\r\nactions of the three Governments taken against  our\r\n\r\nanti-colonial and anti-imperialist stalwarts. But I\r\n\r\nhave now exposed the shallowness and falsity of all\r\n\r\nthese   so-called  \"justification\".  There  is   no\r\n\r\njustification whatsoever for the arrests.  All  the\r\n\r\nexcuses  put forward by the colonialists to  \r\n\r\nwhite-wash  their cruel and repressive action do not hold\r\n\r\nwater. Let me summarise:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Communist story is the usual accusation\r\n\r\nused  to  suppress  and  deny  the  people  in  the\r\n\r\nColonies  their legitimate rights and  aspirations.\r\n\r\nIt  is  an  excuse  for  repression  against \r\n\r\nanti-colonial forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The British. Federation and Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernments   cannot  answer  our  proof   of   the\r\n\r\ninjustices in the Malaysia Plan, and, instead, have\r\n\r\nresorted to arrests and imprisonment without charge\r\n\r\nor trial, and to tortures of detainees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is not the slightest evidence of\r\n\r\nviolence and bloodshed. Nether is there evidence of\r\n\r\ntheir  wanting  to resort to armed struggle.  There\r\n\r\nwere no violent demonstrations, no riots, no window\r\n\r\nbroken and no stones thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Our open support for the popular national\r\n\r\nstruggle of the people of Brunei\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Kalimantan Utara is justified. It is an \r\n\r\nanti-colonial struggle. And support of a similar  nature\r\n\r\nwas  given  by  the Federation Government  and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P Government in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The allegation that we constituted a danger to\r\n\r\nthe  security of the State is another trite  excuse\r\n\r\nfor  the  suppression  of the  fundamental  freedom\r\n\r\nrights and aspirations of the people. This has been\r\n\r\nthe same excuse given by the powers-that-be for all\r\n\r\nthe  worst tyrannies and repressions throughout the\r\n\r\nages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The P.A.P. leaders have, in fact, collaborated\r\n\r\nwith the colonial and imperialist forces to prolong\r\n\r\nforeign  domination  over our  country.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey are colonial stooges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) By their selfish actions. P.A.P. leaders have\r\n\r\nshown  that  they  are indeed the detestable \r\n\r\nanti-national elements in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) P.A.P. leaders hope that the arrests at this\r\n\r\njuncture  would  give  them  a  better  chance   to\r\n\r\npreserve their personal vested interests.  Fear  of\r\n\r\nthe  growing strength and influence of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nis the main reason for the repressive action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The emphasis on the concurrence of the three\r\n\r\nGovernments   taking  repressive  action   on   2nd\r\n\r\nFebruary,  merely confirms the fact that all  three\r\n\r\nGovernments are undemocratic Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) The banning of the publications is an\r\n\r\nattempt to deny the people their fundamental rights\r\n\r\nand  freedom of speech and publication, association\r\n\r\nand assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) The sending of detainees to the Federation\r\n\r\nis  unnecessarily cruel and vindictive.  It  denies\r\n\r\nthe citizens and residents of Singapore their basic\r\n\r\nrights as citizens and residents of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many who have asked how we may discover\r\n\r\nif  there is freedom in a country, democracy  in  a\r\n\r\ncountry. There are four basic conditions. According\r\n\r\nto  John  Dewey, the American philosopher,  if  you\r\n\r\nwant to establish some conception of a society,  go\r\n\r\nand  find  out  who is in gaol. This is  the  first\r\n\r\ncondition and we see today a large number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  in gaol. The second condition as to whether\r\n\r\nor  not there is democracy In a country, freedom in\r\n\r\na  country,  is: Is the Press allowed to  criticise\r\n\r\nthe  Government?  There  is  a  certain  amount  of\r\n\r\ncriticism, criticism of sorts, but it is clear that\r\n\r\nthe  Press  today  has been under  heavy  pressure.\r\n\r\nThird,    does    Government   prevent    political\r\n\r\nopposition? From what we have seen, it looks as  if\r\n\r\nthe  Government  wants  to  prevent  all  political\r\n\r\nopposition.  And,  fourth,  do  those  accused   of\r\n\r\noffences  against the State receive  a  speedy  and\r\n\r\npublic  trial  before  an impartial  court?  It  is\r\n\r\ncurious  that  one of the M.P.s in London,  a  good\r\n\r\nfriend  of  the P.A.P., Mr John Strachey,  frankly\r\n\r\nadmitted  that there is no democracy in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir, it is obvious that parliamentary democracy has\r\n\r\nfailed in Singapore. Parliamentary democracy cannot\r\n\r\nwork if the people in power do not want it to work,\r\n\r\nand do not allow it to work. If those in power were\r\n\r\nsincere  in  their talk of parliamentary democracy,\r\n\r\nthen they themselves must first practise democracy.\r\n\r\nThey must not preach democracy and instead practise\r\n\r\ndictatorship, oppression and tyranny. If  those  in\r\n\r\npower  were  sincere in their talk of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  the  basic minimum is  that  they  must\r\n\r\nallow the Opposition the facilities to function  as\r\n\r\nan  Opposition.  They must allow the  Opposition  a\r\n\r\nchance  to oppose. If the Opposition is not allowed\r\n\r\nto oppose democratically and constitutionally, then\r\n\r\nit is tantamount to encouraging and even urging the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to oppose unconstitutionally.  If  they\r\n\r\nclose  all doors of constitutional struggle to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  they  are guilty of urging the  people  to\r\n\r\nresort to armed struggle, forcing them to resort to\r\n\r\narmed struggle. Let us hope that the powers that be\r\n\r\nsee where they are going, what they are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.P.S.O. is an undemocratic instrument used\r\n\r\nfor  the  suppression of the legitimate aspirations\r\n\r\nof the people. We condemn the three Governments for\r\n\r\nthe  arrests. We demand that the people be restored\r\n\r\ntheir inherent democratic rights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand liberties of freedom of speech and publication,\r\n\r\nassociation  and assembly. We demand that  all  the\r\n\r\nrepressive  measures  be  immediately  stopped.  We\r\n\r\ncondemn  the  P.A.P. for  the  cruel  and  inhuman\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  detainees,  in  particular  solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement and the denial of newspapers and  other\r\n\r\nmaterial.  We  demand  that detainees  now  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation   be   immediately   brought   back   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  demand that the P.A.P. immediately\r\n\r\nstop   all  tortures  of  detainees  and  forthwith\r\n\r\nimplement  the recommendations of the  1960  Prison\r\n\r\nEnquiry  Commission Report.
