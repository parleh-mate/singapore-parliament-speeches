Another 21% were in the  chemicals\r\n\r\nindustry.   The other commitments were in the  petroleum,\r\n\r\nprecision  engineering,  transport  equipment  and  other\r\n\r\nindustries.   In  the services sector, S$1.8  billion  in\r\n\r\ntotal  business spending was committed last  year.   This\r\n\r\nwas  largely  in  projects  for the  info-communications,\r\n\r\nmedia, logistics and transport clusters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investment commitments are expected to create\r\n\r\n17,000  jobs in manufacturing and 7,500 jobs in  services\r\n\r\nover  the next two to three years, when the projects  are\r\n\r\nfully   realised.   Professionals  and  skilled   workers\r\n\r\naccount for about 70% of the total jobs created.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our target this year is to attract investment\r\n\r\ncommitments of S$9.2 billion in manufacturing, and  total\r\n\r\nbusiness  spending of S$2 billion in services.   Most  of\r\n\r\nthese  investments will continue to be in the electronics\r\n\r\nand  chemicals clusters.

Member, Mr Gan, and his\r\n\r\nteam for moving the motion for this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I recognise that this issue has been\r\n\r\nthoroughly debated in the public media and in  the  House\r\n\r\nyesterday.   But this issue must be clearly addressed  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, because policies passed by this  House  will\r\n\r\naffect  how many Singaporeans ultimately decide to become\r\n\r\nstayers  or quitters, or, more importantly, contributors.\r\n\r\nThus,  it  is  crucial that this debate gets  its  proper\r\n\r\nairtime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has presented Singaporeans with a\r\n\r\nstark  question:   \"Are  you  a  quitter  or  a  stayer?\"\r\n\r\nSeveral  MPs tried to clarify the distinction  yesterday.\r\n\r\nBut  I  find the distinction irrelevant.  It is something\r\n\r\nthat  changes with time and individual circumstances.   A\r\n\r\nquitter  then, maybe 20 years ago, can be a returner  now\r\n\r\nand contributing, like Mr Hsieh, the Chairman of McKinsey\r\n\r\nAsia, or Mr David Gerald, the President of the Securities\r\n\r\nInvestors  Association, Singapore, whereas a  stayer  now\r\n\r\ncan become a quitter when the crucial time comes.  No one\r\n\r\ncan  predict  and we will never know.  Some citizens  may\r\n\r\nquit Singapore for various reasons, but still will be our\r\n\r\ncountry's  spokespersons, ambassadors or  business  links\r\n\r\nwhile remaining overseas, and Singapore is better off for\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like to elaborate on the more\r\n\r\nimportant term \"contributors\".  What is important are not\r\n\r\npeople  who  stay  back or quit Singapore  physically  or\r\n\r\nemotionally.  The crux is people who contribute, so  long\r\n\r\nas  they are willing to contribute, whether based locally\r\n\r\nor  overseas.  This then should be the question:  Are you\r\n\r\ncontributing  in any way to Singapore - to  the  country,\r\n\r\neconomy  or  society?  All Singaporeans -  whether  based\r\n\r\nlocally  or  overseas;  whether  working,  unemployed  or\r\n\r\nretired;  whether speaking out for or against  Government\r\n\r\npolicies  -  so long as their words and actions  promote,\r\n\r\nbuild and improve the image, standing and welfare of  our\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural  Singapore,  they  are  all  contributors.\r\n\r\nWhether one is a cleaner or a CEO, one has a part in  the\r\n\r\ngrowth and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  our small beloved Singapore, and  should  be\r\n\r\nrecognised  and respected for this.  Only a few  radicals\r\n\r\nwho  plan to bomb installations or crash into the  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport  control tower are not contributors, and  we  are\r\n\r\nbetter off without them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, almost all Singaporeans, regardless of age and\r\n\r\nother factors, such as education or social mobility,  are\r\n\r\ncontributors to the success of Singapore.   Thus,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  correct  for this motion to urge the  Government  to\r\n\r\nreview  its policies and programmes in view of the  third\r\n\r\ngeneration of Singaporeans only.  Yes, we may  have  many\r\n\r\nconcerns with the younger generation and may want to give\r\n\r\nthem  greater  attention.  But, Sir, all  Singaporeans  - whether   young   or   old,  past,  present   or   future\r\n\r\ncontributors - should be treated with equal concern,  and\r\n\r\nserious  steps  should  be  taken  to  strengthen   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean's sense of belonging to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move an\r\n\r\namendment to the original motion:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 4, to leave out the words \"third-generation\".\r\n\r\nThe  Clerk  will  have copies of the proposed  amendment.\r\n\r\n[Copies of amendment distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amended motion reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House, noting the concerns of Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh Chok Tong as highlighted in his National Day\r\n\r\nRally  Speech on \"stayers\" and \"quitters\" and in view  of\r\n\r\nthe   increased  mobility  of  Singaporeans,  urges   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   review  its  policies  and   programmes\r\n\r\nthoroughly and to take meaningful measures that will help\r\n\r\nto strengthen their sense of belonging to Singapore.\".\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a Straits Times survey, the reasons\r\n\r\nthat  cause people to consider leaving include children's\r\n\r\neducation,  high  cost  of  living,  lack  of   emotional\r\n\r\nattachments  and  the  high stress  of  keeping  up  with\r\n\r\nsociety.   These  are  factors experienced  by  everyone,\r\n\r\nevery single Singaporean, not just the young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Singaporeans are mobile these days, not just\r\n\r\nthe 3G.  So, any programme\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  policy  review must be wide-reaching and  responsive\r\n\r\nenough to cater to the changing needs of citizens of  all\r\n\r\nage groups, not just the 3G.  As Ms Chua Lee Hoong of the\r\n\r\nStraits Times (ST) rightly pointed out in today's ST, the\r\n\r\nchatter is loudest still in the educated middle and upper-middle  classes,  for whom quitting  is  a  real  option.\r\n\r\nThus,  the  Government  needs  to  seriously  review  its\r\n\r\nthinking  and role to encourage Singaporeans to  be  more\r\n\r\nthan stayers, ie, be active contributors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than this small amendment, I give full support\r\n\r\nto  this  motion  to urge the Government  to  review  its\r\n\r\npolicies and attitudes, so that it can take bold and more\r\n\r\nmeaningful measures to strengthen our residents' sense of\r\n\r\nbelonging to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is still a young nation. Despite\r\n\r\nbeing  the  most  economically successful  among  younger\r\n\r\nnations,  it  is  still a small child when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\nnation-building.  We are in the pioneering stage,  trying\r\n\r\nto  find and evolve our own uniqueness.  We will take  at\r\n\r\nleast a few more generations before we can even start  to\r\n\r\nconsolidate and define what we are about.  We have  taken\r\n\r\nthree  decades to move from Third-World to First.  It  is\r\n\r\nhigh  time  now for us to spend more effort and resources\r\n\r\nto  discuss,  define and build up our own unique  culture\r\n\r\nand  values.   When  that  is established,  everyone  who\r\n\r\nidentifies  with this culture and cherishes these  values\r\n\r\nwill naturally be drawn to participate and contribute  to\r\n\r\nthis society and call it home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the time is here now. As the hon. Member,\r\n\r\nMr  Gan,  has also pointed out, the Government  needs  to\r\n\r\ngive more focus on building our heartware and EQ, and not\r\n\r\nsimply  hardware.   In  this respect,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  four  measures to help strengthen  Singaporeans'\r\n\r\nsense of belonging.  They are the four Rs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, redefine the definition of success. The\r\n\r\ncurrent path to success is too narrowly defined.  Do well\r\n\r\nin school, get a scholarship, gain admission to a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprestigious university, get a good job, own a car and buy\r\n\r\na nice house.  In themselves, there is nothing wrong with\r\n\r\nthis path.  But problems arise when individuals choose to\r\n\r\ndeviate from this narrow path.  Success is now framed  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  economic  wealth and prosperity,  and  parents\r\n\r\nexpect and demand their children to strictly follow  this\r\n\r\nnarrow path towards success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, success must not be so narrowly defined. A\r\n\r\nperson  should have the assurance from society that  that\r\n\r\nsociety  respects whatever it is he or  she  does  for  a\r\n\r\nliving and recognises their contributions, be it in arts,\r\n\r\nsports, civil society or even opposition politics.  As an\r\n\r\nexample, are we able to redefine success to include a low\r\n\r\nincome  social  worker who enjoys  working  with  a  drug\r\n\r\naddict, or a factory worker who has built a loving family\r\n\r\nand  lives  happily  in  a small  flat?   Unless  society\r\n\r\nbroadens  its views of success and respects  the  various\r\n\r\nkinds  of  contributors, there will always be people  who\r\n\r\nwill feel no sense of belonging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, review the Government's action and role in\r\n\r\nleading  and directing society.  As citizens  are  always\r\n\r\nobserving and modelling the behaviours of their  leaders,\r\n\r\nthe  kiasu  and  kiasi attitudes of Singaporeans  can  be\r\n\r\ntraced  straight  back to Government  leaders  and  their\r\n\r\nattitudes.   Its hard-nosed social and economic  policies\r\n\r\nand its push for excellence have created wealth, but they\r\n\r\nhave  also contributed to the ugly Singaporean who  lacks\r\n\r\nculture,  grace  and identity.  Also, the  Government  is\r\n\r\nalways trying to lead and direct society in the way  that\r\n\r\nit  desires.  But is that also where the rest of  society\r\n\r\nwants to head?  And at that pace?  Are Government leaders\r\n\r\npushing  our  citizens  too hard?   Will  the  Government\r\n\r\nconsider slowing down and take the time to listen to what\r\n\r\nthe  people  really want instead of constantly  directing\r\n\r\nand  telling  Singaporeans what is best  for  them.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  may have made some correct decisions  in  the\r\n\r\npast, but it does not mean that all future decisions will\r\n\r\nbe wise and correct ones.  The Government has no monopoly\r\n\r\non wisdom.  More\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndiscussions are needed to bring the citizens on board and\r\n\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, recognise the efforts of contributors, even\r\n\r\nthose  whose  contributions the Ministers  may  disagree.\r\n\r\nWhile  the Government or a Minister accepts or  adopts  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion,  it  is  always  a  good  practice  to   give\r\n\r\nrecognition,  praise or even a pat on  the  back  of  the\r\n\r\ncontributors and say, \"Good work\".  Everyone likes to  be\r\n\r\nrecognised  and praised for good work.  So such  positive\r\n\r\nreinforcements will help to promote active citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Government disagrees with an idea, it is\r\n\r\nnot  necessary for the Government leaders to tear it down\r\n\r\nimmediately   and  harshly  at  times.    Such   negative\r\n\r\nresponses  from  the top leaders only help  to  associate\r\n\r\nbeing  engaged  and speaking up with pain, not  pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis  ultimately  leads  to the conditioned  response  of\r\n\r\nbeing  disengaged,  not contributing,  and  no  sense  of\r\n\r\nemotional attachment to the issues concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and most importantly, reduce the high cost\r\n\r\nof  living  here  in  Singapore and  lower  the  indirect\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  the coffers of  the  Government.   All\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  work hard to earn a good living,  build  up\r\n\r\ntheir  nest-egg to start a family, get out  of  that  and\r\n\r\nhope  to retire peacefully.  However, with the Government\r\n\r\nand  its  linked agencies constantly taking the  lead  in\r\n\r\nraising  the  cost  of goods and services  and  depleting\r\n\r\nwhatever  limited savings one may have, is it any  wonder\r\n\r\nthen  that  Singaporeans are complaining and planning  to\r\n\r\ncall it quits, citing high cost as a reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should take a more considerate\r\n\r\napproach,  and  not  ruthlessly and relentlessly  try  to\r\n\r\nrecover  cost  and  expenses in this period  of  economic\r\n\r\ndifficulty.   When  times  are good,  these  corporations\r\n\r\nspend  the  huge  profits  on big  acquisitions  and  big\r\n\r\nbuildings, incurring high expenses.  But when the economy\r\n\r\nturns  bad,  they start looking to the public to  recover\r\n\r\ncost.   This is not the way to service and care  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.  If the Government will learn to take care of the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people in this difficult\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperiod, there will be more appreciative stayers who  will\r\n\r\nbe  willing to contribute more than their fair  share  to\r\n\r\nthe  nation, without more carrots or more sticks from the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, to quote our former Speaker, \"When it\r\n\r\ncomes  to the next election, the people will not forget\",\r\n\r\nand  I  believe that this time round, they will  not,  no\r\n\r\nmatter how many New Singapore Shares will be given out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government, as the\r\n\r\ndominant  force in society, should take a  stock-take  of\r\n\r\nall  its  actions over the years and determine how  these\r\n\r\nhave  contributed to our current situation.  Be it little\r\n\r\nacts, measures or comments, these can send out more wrong\r\n\r\nsignals and attitudes than the most massive campaigns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be more tolerant of differences in views, ideas and\r\n\r\nexpressions.    We,  Singapore,  are  not  a   homogenous\r\n\r\nsociety.   The Government needs to learn -  to  agree  to\r\n\r\ndisagree, and yet make efforts to work together with  the\r\n\r\ndetractors.   The Government also needs to free  up  more\r\n\r\nspace  for civil society to flourish, while allowing  the\r\n\r\ncitizens   to  learn  how  to  exercise  greater   social\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  Consider reducing the role and influence\r\n\r\nof   the   Government,  which  indirectly  require   less\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and less funding and thus, less  taxes  from\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A successful economy may be built with the right\r\n\r\ninvestment decisions.  But a successful society can  only\r\n\r\nbe  built by a Government forging a good partnership with\r\n\r\nthe  people.  It cannot be the case where the  Government\r\n\r\ndoes  all the dictating and ordering and the people doing\r\n\r\nall the obeying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a creative, prosperous and vibrant society\r\n\r\nis  most evident in an open and mature democracy.  Is the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government prepared to give this a try?  I  and\r\n\r\nmany others hope so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek the support of the House on the proposed\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It has been proposed as an amendment:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 4, to leave out the words \"third-generation\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, \"That the words proposed to be left\r\n\r\nout, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind hon. Members that they should restrict\r\n\r\ntheir speeches to the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I would like to seek your  indulgence  to\r\n\r\nallow me to respond to Mr Chia's proposed amendment to my\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the original motion was very carefully crafted\r\n\r\nto focus on the key issues at hand, and I went through at\r\n\r\ngreat  length  yesterday in this  House  to  explain  the\r\n\r\nwordings  and why the motion was moved.  I also explained\r\n\r\nwhy  we  need  to take into consideration the  challenges\r\n\r\nfacing  particularly  our third generation  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nAnd  with your indulgence, Sir, I would like to reiterate\r\n\r\nand  elaborate for the benefit of Mr Chia.  Mr  Chia,  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech, although he proposed the amendment, did  not\r\n\r\ngo into detail why the amendment was necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain our position. Firstly, we must look\r\n\r\nat  the  historical  factor.  I said yesterday  that  the\r\n\r\nfirst  and second generation Singaporeans fought shoulder\r\n\r\nto  shoulder against the threat of communist infiltration\r\n\r\nand  they  have built amongst themselves a  mutual  trust\r\n\r\nthat will bind them together. They also went through  the\r\n\r\nanguish  of  separation  from  Malaysia  and  they   have\r\n\r\nstruggled  together  to  find  a  way  for  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nsurvive.    Having  gone  through  the  difficult   times\r\n\r\ntogether as a people, they will stand united as a people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, the third generation Singaporeans\r\n\r\ngrew up in relative peace and prosperity.  We are blessed\r\n\r\nwith  the  fruits of our forerunners.  There  is  nothing\r\n\r\nwrong  in  that, Sir.  We too would want our children  to\r\n\r\nhave  peace and prosperity.  But the question is  whether\r\n\r\nwe can replicate the same kind of bonding and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommitment as our earlier generations while we enjoy  the\r\n\r\npeace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the present factor. I also explained\r\n\r\nyesterday  that  more and more Singaporeans  have  to  go\r\n\r\noverseas  to  work.   This is part of  the  globalisation\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government and our companies.  The majority\r\n\r\nof  these are likely to be the younger generation or  the\r\n\r\nthird generation Singaporeans.  On top of that, they  are\r\n\r\nbetter  educated.  They are more  mobile  and  they  have\r\n\r\ngreater exposure to the opportunities that await them  in\r\n\r\nother  countries.   On the other hand,  we  are  remaking\r\n\r\nSingapore  today for the benefit of this third generation\r\n\r\nwhich will inherit whatever we create.  Should we not  be\r\n\r\nconcerned of their views and perceptions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the future factor. The third generation\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will be our future leaders.   They  will  be\r\n\r\nour  future  people.  In fact, they will  be  our  future\r\n\r\nhope.   I  would therefore suggest that we cannot  ignore\r\n\r\nthe   aspirations  and  the  concerns  of   these   third\r\n\r\ngeneration  Singaporeans.  For a motion to be  vague  and\r\n\r\ntoo  broadly-based will be meaningless.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  therefore that we remain focused in this  motion\r\n\r\nto   deal   with  our  people  in  the  third  generation\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reference to the third\r\n\r\ngeneration  is an integral part of the motion.   I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  like to urge the House to reject the amendment\r\n\r\nproposed by Mr Chia.  I would like to move that the House\r\n\r\nnow takes a vote on the proposed amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That the words proposed to be left out,\r\n\r\nbe left out\", put and negatived.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment therefore falls and we\r\n\r\nreturn to the original Question that is before the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's National Day message was for the  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  reflect and make a  reality  check  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Sir, how should the 3G Singaporeans respond?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To respond to this call, the 3Gs must be given\r\n\r\nopportunities to be involved and to understand issues  at\r\n\r\nlarge.   At the same time, the 3Gs should take an  active\r\n\r\nrole  in  activities and developments around them.   More\r\n\r\nimportantly, we need a mindset change, where people  will\r\n\r\nprovide alternative suggestions and viewpoints and engage\r\n\r\nin constructive criticism.  This will add value and allow\r\n\r\nviews to take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the debate on this motion should not just\r\n\r\nrevolve around Government policies and measures that will\r\n\r\nkeep  quitters  from quitting.  To answer  our  NCMP,  Mr\r\n\r\nSteve  Chia, we worry that our 3Gs lack a sense of crisis\r\n\r\nand resilience as they practically grew up in the era  of\r\n\r\nprosperity, as mentioned earlier by the hon.  Member,  Mr\r\n\r\nGan  Kim  Yong.   Proceeding into  the  future,  what  is\r\n\r\nevolving  around them will throw them directly  into  the\r\n\r\nglobal market place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their competitors are no longer local and regional.\r\n\r\nToday,  the  global  village is their  competitor.   That\r\n\r\nbeing the case, how tough can current local pressures  be\r\n\r\ncompared  to  what they would have to face  with  in  the\r\n\r\nglobal village?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our challenge really is how can we facilitate them\r\n\r\nto develop the coping mechanisms to cushion the so-called\r\n\r\ncrisis  of  life.  If they could handle that, they  would\r\n\r\nhave  developed  this  sense of  crisis  management.   We\r\n\r\nshould  put  in  place  measures that  would  enable  and\r\n\r\nfacilitate their adaptation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to incorporate practical learning\r\n\r\ninto the academic syllabus?  For instance, to educate our\r\n\r\n3Gs  on  the  realities of the commercial world  and  the\r\n\r\nissues   in  society,  can  we  consider  some  form   of\r\n\r\napprenticeship  in  these fields?   Such  exposure  would\r\n\r\nserve  to  mature them through the experience  that  they\r\n\r\nwill face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no apology needed for Darwin's theory of\r\n\r\nthe  survival  of  the fittest.  Since  time  immemorial,\r\n\r\nsocieties  had  always  been  made  up  of  stayers   and\r\n\r\nquitters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  is not a new phenomenon and not necessarily  a  bad\r\n\r\nthing to happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stock and flow process is healthy to a certain\r\n\r\nextent   because  it  provides  a  mechanism  that   will\r\n\r\ncalibrate an eco-system balance in the environment  where\r\n\r\nthose who remain or come in to join us do so because they\r\n\r\ncan  find their own comfort level and have found a reason\r\n\r\nfor  staying.   In  other words, a  small  percentage  of\r\n\r\nattrition may not necessarily be bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge to us is how can we retain the\r\n\r\ndifferent talents across the strata of society to hang on\r\n\r\nand play their part for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that the issue before us\r\n\r\ntoday centres around the angst that we all feel about the\r\n\r\nSingaporean identity, as articulated by various hon. MPs.\r\n\r\nIs there such a thing as a Singaporean identity?   Is the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  identity slowly taking shape as  the  nation\r\n\r\nbecomes  more  rooted to its soil?  Have we cultivated  a\r\n\r\nstrong  enough and deeply-rooted enough sense of identity\r\n\r\nto  provide  ourselves with enough  cultural  ballast  to\r\n\r\nwithstand  times of stress and tensions in  our  national\r\n\r\nfabric?   Perhaps  it  is  timely  that  we  take   every\r\n\r\nopportunity to reinforce our cohesiveness as a people, so\r\n\r\nthat  we feel, we talk and we act as Singaporeans in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of the multi-cultural and multi-religious  setting\r\n\r\nthat we are in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started 10 years ago with the concept of self-help groups which saw the spawning of the CDAC, SINDA,\r\n\r\nMendaki,  Eurasian self-help groups.  These  groups  have\r\n\r\nserved  their roles well.  Going forward, in view of  the\r\n\r\npotentially divisive factors that could arise from the JI\r\n\r\ndevelopments, perhaps we should review the model  of  the\r\n\r\nself-help  grouping and consider amalgamating them  under\r\n\r\nan  umbrella body without disrupting the individuality of\r\n\r\nthe  self-help  groups.  We can do  more,  for  instance,\r\n\r\nwithin the resource sharing areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is Singapore just merely a nation of\r\n\r\nopportunistic mercenaries, populated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  people  with  a grab-and-go mentality?   Some  recent\r\n\r\nsurveys  published  in  the  newspapers  would  seem   to\r\n\r\nindicate  that  Singaporeans,  especially  the  3Gs,  are\r\n\r\nespecially  prone to the notion of seeking better  climes\r\n\r\nfor  themselves  elsewhere.  Our younger ones  are  able,\r\n\r\neducated,  talented,  and they have  a  good  command  of\r\n\r\nEnglish.   As such, opportunities abound for  our  people\r\n\r\nwho want to carve out a niche for themselves elsewhere in\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, amid the rounds of speeches and\r\n\r\nreactions  to the stayer-versus-quitter debate,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to bring a value added dimension for the stayers and\r\n\r\nquitters.   Whether  stayers or quitters,  they  all  are\r\n\r\nboosters for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I mean? Well, boosters are Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nmay  be  working or studying overseas.  Some of them  may\r\n\r\neven  have  migrated  to another  country  and  taken  on\r\n\r\ncitizenship elsewhere.  However, boosters are people with\r\n\r\na  heart  to  do  things  that will  benefit  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsociety  and  economic well-being.   For example   -  and\r\n\r\nthis  is  to assure Mr Steve Chia  -  that we  are  still\r\n\r\nconnected   with  our  overseas  so-called  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThere  are  some  Singaporeans in the United  States  and\r\n\r\nelsewhere  who have taken on jobs as research scientists,\r\n\r\nengineers  and business people.  These Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\n\"made  it\"  in their adopted country.  However,  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  still maintain ties with Singapore.  These boosters\r\n\r\nhave  forged  close  economic and business  ties  between\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  the  US   and  those  operating   out   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   So, rather than harp on the fact that  these\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   have  found  life  too   disagreeable   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  prompt  them to move  overseas,  we  could\r\n\r\nleverage  upon  the expertise, talents,  connections  and\r\n\r\nbusiness potential of the booster population all over the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Overseas Networks (SONs) and the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Contact are strategic bridges in  linking  the\r\n\r\nboosters to Singapore.  What we must continue to do is to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  boosters  with  an  easy  passage  back  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, even if it is just for a stint.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet and globalisation have brought the world to\r\n\r\nour  doorstep.  Singapore may just be a transit hotel  to\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans  who are moving beyond  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nshores to seek employment and opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there will arise new 3G boosters whom we will\r\n\r\ncultivate  for  contribution each time  they  transit  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The challenge is how can we lure  them  back\r\n\r\nfor these intermittent contributions.  It must surely  be\r\n\r\ntheir  family  and  their friends as  well  as  the  easy\r\n\r\naccess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion is concerned with the mobility of the\r\n\r\n3Gs.   We are concerned that 3Gs are vulnerable to become\r\n\r\nquitters  because  of  Government policies  to  date.   I\r\n\r\nsupport the notion that we can put in place measures  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that will inculcate values and encourage  our\r\n\r\n3Gs to take ownership of their stake.  These measures can\r\n\r\nperhaps commit them to stay in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two weeks ago, upon my return from the AIPO\r\n\r\nmeeting,  I had an interesting encounter with  a  15-year\r\n\r\nold  boy  who  told me that he was not  pleased  with  an\r\n\r\narticle  entitled  \"The 911 overload\"  published  in  the\r\n\r\nToday  newspaper of 12th September 2002.  He had  written\r\n\r\non  his own volition to the editor of Today to offer  his\r\n\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to seek the Speaker's\r\n\r\npermission to circulate a copy of the letter by this boy,\r\n\r\nthat  was published in the Forum page of Today newspaper,\r\n\r\ndated  16th  September.  I would also  like  to  seek  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker's permission to circulate the original full  text\r\n\r\nof  the  boy's letter to the Editor.  [Copies of  letters\r\n\r\ndistributed  to  hon.  Members.]  It  contains  the  full\r\n\r\ndetails  of  his  thoughts.  I have  obtained  the  boy's\r\n\r\npermission for this.  And I would like to declare at this\r\n\r\npoint that this boy is my son.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am recounting would give an interesting\r\n\r\ninsight  of what goes on in the mind of a 3G 15-year  old\r\n\r\non the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n911   tragedy  and  deducing  from  his  letter  and  his\r\n\r\nthoughts,  I think there is hope in our 3Gs.   There  are\r\n\r\nthinking 3G individuals who would not hesitate to  defend\r\n\r\nSingapore  when  it  comes to issues of  sovereignty  and\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the text of the letter, it would seem that\r\n\r\nwhen  this  boy's sense of right or wrong was  put  to  a\r\n\r\njudgment  call, when he felt that it was  time  to  speak\r\n\r\nout,  surely after some internal reflection of the tragic\r\n\r\nevents  which took away many innocent lives, he  did  not\r\n\r\nhesitate to join in the discussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article, \"The 911 overload\", was published at a\r\n\r\ntime of mourning when the whole world was remembering the\r\n\r\ntragic  loss  of  lives on 911, 2001 with the  Americans.\r\n\r\nIn  a balanced response to the article, the boy described\r\n\r\nthe  terrorist  act  as a cruel attack  on  humanity  and\r\n\r\nfreedom, and disagreed with the author's view that we are\r\n\r\n\"putting Americans on the pedestal\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reminded that we should remember \"the victims of\r\n\r\nthe  international  community, not just  Americans\".   He\r\n\r\nthen  condemned  the terrorist acts and chided  \"peoples'\r\n\r\nindifference,\" and asked, \"Do we just sit  on  the  fence\r\n\r\nand do nothing and just watch the events unfolding around\r\n\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this 15-year old can stand in front of a mirror,\r\n\r\nreflect  and take on a stand for what he believes  in,  I\r\n\r\nthink  our  3G  Singaporeans offer hope.  They  do  care.\r\n\r\nWhat  struck me more in the letter he sent to the  Editor\r\n\r\nwas  his subtle realisation and a reminder of sorts about\r\n\r\nSingapore's   vulnerability  and   obligations   in   its\r\n\r\ninternational relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote him:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore is a small nation, and we have to\r\n\r\ncontribute  and  play our part in order to  survive.   We\r\n\r\nhave  diplomatic ties with the US, and thus it  would  be\r\n\r\nright  to  offer  our  condolences  and  support  from  a\r\n\r\npolitical viewpoint.  We cannot isolate ourselves and say\r\n\r\nwe do not care about what is happening around us.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this 15-year old, like many of his peers,\r\n\r\nhas inherited that sense of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nurgency  and  survivality from his  forefathers  who  had\r\n\r\nlaboured  and stayed on in this island state despite  the\r\n\r\nearly  years of difficulties, because of their  sense  of\r\n\r\nrootedness  and their wanting to carve out  a  stake  for\r\n\r\nthemselves in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we similarly cultivate \"stayers\" who are\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  Singapore, and will fight for  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsurvival?  In the article, I also detected several facets\r\n\r\nof  a  3G Singaporean's value system and views.  He wrote\r\n\r\nabout  terrorism as an act against our national  security\r\n\r\nand  terrorists  as a common enemy of  the  world;  about\r\n\r\nstanding  up for patriotism, being brave and putting  our\r\n\r\nfoot  down  instead  of trying to appease  others;  about\r\n\r\ndenial  of one's country.  To quote him, \"I am unable  to\r\n\r\ncontemplate  on  what  has driven  some  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nactually plot with Al Qaeda.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's print media and world of connectivity and\r\n\r\nrelatedness have imprinted powerful images on  the  young\r\n\r\nminds.   3G Singaporeans have and will continue  to  have\r\n\r\nwider  and  deeper access to a wide array of  information\r\n\r\nabout  the  world,  values and  peoples.   Together  with\r\n\r\ntechnology  innovations  and a  dearth  of  distance,  3G\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   with  their  increased   mobility,   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to live in a tighter and closely knitted  world\r\n\r\nwith all its inherent risks and opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is important that 3G Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   develop  their  critical   thinking   and\r\n\r\nanalytical  skills  and  examine  hard  their  stakes  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  not  just  for  themselves,  but  for   their\r\n\r\nfamilies and fellow Singaporeans.  Whether  \"stayers\"  or\r\n\r\n\"quitters\", they must have their stakes in Singapore!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no lack of suggestions to\r\n\r\naddress  the stayer/quitter comment from PM, but we  need\r\n\r\nto  move  on.  There was a time when we placed  too  much\r\n\r\nemphasis  on the Singapore Dream of the 5Cs.   The  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis  and  the  persisting  recession   have\r\n\r\ndissipated the Singapore Dream somewhat.  While it is all\r\n\r\nright  to  have dreams, it is also a timely wake-up  call\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans  to examine how we should  realise  our\r\n\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more important to create the sort of vision or\r\n\r\nstake  that  Singaporeans  can  hold  onto,  not  in  the\r\n\r\nmaterialistic   sense,   but   in   the   emotional   and\r\n\r\npsychological  spheres  where  permanent  bonds  to   the\r\n\r\ncountry  can  be established.  Thus, what stakes  can  we\r\n\r\ncreate for the 3G Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the 15-year old boy, if his views and\r\n\r\nsentiments may represent the up and coming 3Gs, then  not\r\n\r\nall  is  lost  where  the  3Gs are  concerned.   The  two\r\n\r\ngenerations ahead have not laboured in vain for Singapore\r\n\r\nand its people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that well connected branches to the vine and\r\n\r\nregular   pruning   of  the  fruits  will   ensure   good\r\n\r\noffsprings.   So  parenting plays an important  role,  in\r\n\r\nnurturing loyalty.  Our concern over quitters may just be\r\n\r\ntransient  and  their  sense of  disenchantment  may  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily   trigger  their  mobility  if  they   remain\r\n\r\nconnected to their vine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I agree that the quitters need managing\r\n\r\nand  there still remain the expectations of people to  be\r\n\r\nfulfilled.  But alas, expectations vary and are relative.\r\n\r\nThis  begs  the question of responsibility ownership.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask Mr Steve Chia whether it must  always\r\n\r\nend up on the Government's lap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really look carefully into the profile of\r\n\r\npeople who have come back to Singapore and are willing to\r\n\r\nspeak  about  it, we would see one common  denominator  - they  already  have  a  job  waiting  for  them,  or  are\r\n\r\nsuccessful businessmen or professionals who can  relocate\r\n\r\ntheir  offices anytime or move back without  difficulties\r\n\r\nor those who are financially very stable where being with\r\n\r\nor without a job would not make any difference to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is, of course, the other group of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who have quit on Singapore, but  have  come\r\n\r\nback  as  they cannot make it on the other side as  well.\r\n\r\nDo  you see them coming out and tell it as it is and,  if\r\n\r\nso,  how many of them?  Does that make them a booster  or\r\n\r\nquitter?   I  think  if  they have another  chance,  they\r\n\r\nprobably would leave again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may want to consider using good slogans and\r\n\r\ncatchy words with good PR campaign on TV and newspaper to\r\n\r\naggressively  change  the younger  generation's  mindset,\r\n\r\nwhich  seems pretty negative judging from the  number  of\r\n\r\npeople   commenting  on  the  issues  and  those   silent\r\n\r\nobservers as well who really do not want to say too much!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the boy's letter, there will be 'fence-sitters' in our midst. Where Singapore is concerned, we\r\n\r\nmust try to swing the 'fence-sitters' from being quitters\r\n\r\nand  influence  both  the  stayers  and  quitters  to  be\r\n\r\nboosters for Singapore.  Deducing from the boy's views, a\r\n\r\ncomforting  point  is that there is an  indication  of  a\r\n\r\nsense  of awareness amongst some of our 15-year  olds  of\r\n\r\nwhat  is  happening around us and an ability to  discern,\r\n\r\nevaluate and form opinions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most reassuringly is that there is care and concern\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore amongst some of the 3G 15-year  olds.   We\r\n\r\nwould   like  our  3G  Singaporeans  to  be  articulating\r\n\r\nconfidently and candidly, so that our leadership would be\r\n\r\nable to take cue from such expressions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that, in reality, not all 15-year olds\r\n\r\nwould  have the opportunity to do that, but many  of  our\r\n\r\nschools  can  do  more  to  encourage  and  nurture   the\r\n\r\nawareness and interests of our 3G on events around  them.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  we  could encourage the schools  to  allow\r\n\r\ntheir  students  space to express their views  and  grant\r\n\r\nthem  a  say in policies affecting their performance  and\r\n\r\nparticipation.   We should extend the feedback  mechanism\r\n\r\nto the students as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact is that we do have caring and thinking\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in our midst.  In January  this  year,  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots   leaders  and  residents,  comprising   three\r\n\r\ngenerations  of a multi-racial cast of 80 people  of  the\r\n\r\nBoon  Lay  Division of West Coast GRC,  got  together  to\r\n\r\nproduce a musical production for Boon Lay's National  Day\r\n\r\ncelebration on 10th August.  The theme\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  title  of this production was \"My Heart is  still  @\r\n\r\nHome: Boon Lay.com.sg\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message of this production was that as Singapore\r\n\r\nglobalises, our children might leave our shores  to  seek\r\n\r\nopportunities elsewhere, but they would still  come  home\r\n\r\nbecause  their roots are in Singapore and  they  want  to\r\n\r\nreturn  to  their family and friends.  This is where  the\r\n\r\nemotional  bond of the family and friends  would  play  a\r\n\r\ncrucial part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Boon Lay is a real heartlander constituency\r\n\r\nand,  in  its midst, is this awareness among the old  and\r\n\r\nyoung  that  we  want  our  children  to  sink  roots  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, ie, the branches will remain connected to  the\r\n\r\nvine.  How can the family partner Government's efforts to\r\n\r\nmake this happen?  Is the Government forthcoming in this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, I am happy to note and share with the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House that the  Government  agency  is\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  support families in their efforts.   There\r\n\r\nwas a MPS case which I handled, where a quitter, who is a\r\n\r\nprofessional,  gave  up  his citizenship  to  migrate  to\r\n\r\nAustralia some 12 years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided that he wanted to quit Australia in\r\n\r\nNovember  last year and to return to Singapore where  his\r\n\r\nfamily is.  After at least seven times of meeting up with\r\n\r\nmyself  and appeals to MOM, he succeeded in returning  on\r\n\r\nemployment pass.  Today, he works for a business  venture\r\n\r\nthat  he  has established in Singapore whilst he  was  in\r\n\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an interesting case study of why a\r\n\r\nquitter  who is a professional wishes to return home  and\r\n\r\nhow accommodating Government agency makes it possible for\r\n\r\nhim  and  his family.  Sir, he has remained connected  to\r\n\r\nhis family in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I would like to advocate for a one-stop Check and Chat Centre to be set up, to help those in\r\n\r\ncrisis,  to  counsel those who wish  to  quit  to  remain\r\n\r\nconnected to the family and, in this instance, Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  to  learn more from those who have decided to return\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This supports what hon. MP Gan Kim  Yong  had\r\n\r\ntalked about when he mentioned helping those in crisis by\r\n\r\nhaving more connected Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have one-stop centres of all sorts to assist\r\n\r\nwith  economic  and commercial matters.  It  is  just  as\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  we  provide  such  support  intervention\r\n\r\ncentres to assist before these potential quitters call it\r\n\r\nquits.   The  soft aspect of dealing with  human  capital\r\n\r\nmust be quickly put in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we wish for our 3G to stay on, we must not\r\n\r\nspare    helping   the   many   retrenched    middle-aged\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  return  to the workforce.   Many  of  their\r\n\r\nchildren who constitute the 3G would take cue from  their\r\n\r\nparents'  employability and fortunes  to  decide  whether\r\n\r\nthere is hope for them to stay or they should quit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the WSTP has been well responded to but funds\r\n\r\nare drying up and I understand that there is a long queue\r\n\r\nfor  enrolment.  Lest this turn into a long march, I urge\r\n\r\nMOM  to  review the continual financing of this programme\r\n\r\nas  the  retrenched middle-aged group  still  needs  that\r\n\r\nemotional support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to reiterate that at this time, the real\r\n\r\nissues facing Singapore and the world at large are  about\r\n\r\nour  sovereignty  and security in  the  wake  of  the  JI\r\n\r\narrests and the looming war in Iraq.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the home scene is the question of employment and\r\n\r\nthe  ability to be flexible, to be ready and prepared for\r\n\r\nnew economic fronts that Singapore would be engaged in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be stress on teaching family values to\r\n\r\nthe  3G  for  after all, society at large is made  up  of\r\n\r\nindividual  family units.  In this, I urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  initiate a yearly family value campaign on \"My  Heart\r\n\r\nIs  Still At Home\", reminding Singaporeans of their roots\r\n\r\nand   the   need  to  remain  connected  to  the  family,\r\n\r\nespecially in the midst of the recent JI developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be carried under the banner of the Public\r\n\r\nEducation for Family Committee.  At the same time, Parent\r\n\r\nGroups  can  be  trained and equipped with the  necessary\r\n\r\nskills  to deliver programmes on family values.   Such  a\r\n\r\nsubject  complements the National Education programme  in\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I stress that we want\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and our 3G to be boosters for Singapore.  To\r\n\r\nengage  the  young,  the game will no  longer  be  solely\r\n\r\ndirect  control through policies.  Rather we have to  win\r\n\r\nthe hearts and minds of our young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young 3G appreciates a story quite different\r\n\r\nfrom  the  well-worn hard sell.  Is there a  tune  around\r\n\r\nwhich  our 3G can be engaged in a romantic song and dance\r\n\r\nwith the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the frequent economic rhetoric, the\r\n\r\n3G  must be engaged from the heart.  I would like to  end\r\n\r\nwith a phrase that has stood the test of time.  A phrase,\r\n\r\nwhich upon reflection, makes me recall the many instances\r\n\r\nof  how  the  old  guard truly reached  out  with  hearts\r\n\r\nconvicted  by a desire to bring about a better  life  for\r\n\r\nall:  \"People do not care about what you know until  they\r\n\r\nknow  you care.\"  In this, the family structure  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have never failed us.  Perhaps, now, it is the\r\n\r\n3G to also show that they care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Sir, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nMembers  for their contributions and suggestions  on  how\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education can help build desirable values\r\n\r\nin  our students.  I agree with them generally.  The fact\r\n\r\nis  that  our schools are already attempting  to  instill\r\n\r\nsuch   values   and   characters  through   co-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities  and other activities like the celebration  of\r\n\r\nfestivals  of  the various races and communities  by  our\r\n\r\nstudents and for our students.  But we all know  that  it\r\n\r\ntakes time to build that strong character that we want to\r\n\r\nsee  in  our students and in the younger generation,  and\r\n\r\nthis is not just the job of our schools or our teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong suggested that schools organise\r\n\r\nactivities  that  encourage teamwork  and  inculcate  the\r\n\r\nsense of accountability and responsibility and develop  a\r\n\r\nstrong  character  in  them that can  accept  failure  of\r\n\r\nothers as well as their own.  Mr Gan and Mr Chan Soo  Sen\r\n\r\nhave proposed the inclusion of more stories on patriotism\r\n\r\nand  loyalty  in the textbooks.  I thank them  for  their\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools today place good emphasis on developing\r\n\r\nthe  character  of their students.  This is  carried  out\r\n\r\nthrough  a wide range of activities and programmes,  both\r\n\r\nwithin  the class and outside.  There is thus no need  to\r\n\r\ncut  down the curriculum time for Mathematics and Science\r\n\r\nto emphasise character development in our schools.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom the teaching of civics and moral education in class,\r\n\r\nparticipation  in co-curricular activities  or  the  CCA,\r\n\r\nsuch  as uniformed groups, sports or games, would  enable\r\n\r\nstudents to imbibe sound moral values like accountability\r\n\r\nand responsibility.  CCAs like band, choir, orchestra and\r\n\r\ndance,  where pupils need to work together as a  team  to\r\n\r\nproduce  that harmonious synchronisation, teach  students\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  teamwork.   Our  students  are  also\r\n\r\nactively  encouraged in Community Involvement  Programmes\r\n\r\n(CIP)  that give them an opportunity to contribute  their\r\n\r\nefforts  to  the  good of others.  These  projects  could\r\n\r\ninclude  taking care of a school gardening plot, sprucing\r\n\r\nup  the  void  deck  of a neighbouring  apartment  block,\r\n\r\nspending time with the aged and even building a school in\r\n\r\na  neighbouring  country.  Through the CIP,  we  help  to\r\n\r\ninstill  in  our students a sense of obligation  to  give\r\n\r\nback   to   society  and  develop  them   into   socially\r\n\r\nresponsible adults.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan suggested introducing programmes to develop\r\n\r\nour  students' tolerance for failures.  In schools today,\r\n\r\nstudents  learn  about dealing with  failures  and  other\r\n\r\nlessons  in  life  not  only in the  classroom  but  also\r\n\r\nthrough  their participation in co-curricular  activities\r\n\r\nand  lifeskills  programmes.   Coaches  and  teachers  in\r\n\r\ncharge of CCAs also impart\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvalues like perseverance and determination.  That is  why\r\n\r\nMOE  places high emphasis on CCA programmes and  students\r\n\r\nare required to participate in at least one of them.   To\r\n\r\nillustrate  the  importance placed in  CCAs,  from  2003,\r\n\r\nbonus  points  for CCA participation will also  be  taken\r\n\r\ninto consideration for university admission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Soo Sen and Mr Gan Kim Yong also suggested\r\n\r\nusing  stories  to  transmit the desired  values  to  our\r\n\r\nstudents.   Teachers are encouraged to use a  variety  of\r\n\r\nteaching strategies to inculcate desirable values in  our\r\n\r\nstudents today, including story-telling.  Such values  as\r\n\r\npatriotism,  sacrifice  and  responsibility  are  brought\r\n\r\nthrough  the  use  of stories, poems and  proverbs.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  at  the  primary level where civics  and  moral\r\n\r\neducation (CME) is taught in the mother tongue languages,\r\n\r\nlocal  heroes like Lim Bo Seng and Lieutenant  Adnan  are\r\n\r\nfeatured  to illustrate personal sacrifice and  love  for\r\n\r\nthe   country.   Teachers  are  also  encouraged  to  use\r\n\r\ntraditional cultural stories, poems and proverbs to teach\r\n\r\nthe  value of patriotism.  For example, Chinese  students\r\n\r\nare  introduced to stories of heroes like Su Wu, Yue  Fei\r\n\r\nand  Wen  Tian Siang.  A poem about a warrior,  Laksamana\r\n\r\nBentan, who was willing to sacrifice himself for his king\r\n\r\nand  country is taught to Malay students.  Examples  from\r\n\r\nSangam  literature  also inculcate  patriotism  in  Tamil\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I said earlier, schools alone cannot do\r\n\r\nthe  job.  A child's education is a responsibility shared\r\n\r\nby  the  school and the family as well as the  community.\r\n\r\nSchools can only succeed in developing good character and\r\n\r\ninstilling  sound  values if parents  and  the  community\r\n\r\nreinforce the same values imparted in school.   This  was\r\n\r\nthe  reason why MOE set up COMPASS (Community and Parents\r\n\r\nin  Support  of  Schools) in December  1998  to  actively\r\n\r\nencourage parents and the community to work together with\r\n\r\nschools to help children learn better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to thank Mr Ahmad Khalis for\r\n\r\nhighlighting  the successful partnership between  schools\r\n\r\nand their stakeholders, like the Parents Support\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGroups, Parent-Teacher Associations, and the old boys' or\r\n\r\nold  students' associations.  Mr Ahmad Khalis  knows  the\r\n\r\nsuccess and the value of COMPASS very well because he has\r\n\r\nbeen a member of COMPASS for some years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Education is a responsibility shared by the\r\n\r\nschool,  community and also the family.   Here,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank  Members who give their comments  on  the\r\n\r\nNational Education programme and how the programme can be\r\n\r\nimproved.   But  schools can only succeed  in  developing\r\n\r\ngood   and  responsible  citizens  if  parents  and   the\r\n\r\ncommunity reinforce the same values imparted in school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of MOE, we are aware that an effective\r\n\r\nNational Education programme must enable our students not\r\n\r\nonly  to  understand but also to internalise the National\r\n\r\nEducation  values as well.  That is why MOE  has  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  programmes in the curriculum and  in  the  CCA  to\r\n\r\npromote   National  Education.   National  Education   is\r\n\r\ninfused  in  subjects  such  as  social  studies,   where\r\n\r\nstudents learn about Singapore's road to nationhood,  the\r\n\r\nprinciples of good governance and, through case  studies,\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  dangers of racial and religious  divide,\r\n\r\nand  appreciate  the importance of racial  and  religious\r\n\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the imparting of National Education\r\n\r\nknowledge through classroom lessons, schools also conduct\r\n\r\na  wide  variety  of  programmes such  as  the  Community\r\n\r\nInvolvement   Programme  (CIP)  to  enable  students   to\r\n\r\ninternalise  the National Education values.   Implemented\r\n\r\nsince  1998,  the CIP nurtures our pupils to be  socially\r\n\r\nresponsible   and  helps  them  understand   that   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  has  a role to play in enhancing  the  well-being of the community and the neighbourhood we live  in.\r\n\r\nAll students do a minimum of six hours of CIP a year.  In\r\n\r\nsome schools, students have done more than that.  And  in\r\n\r\none school that I have visited personally, many students,\r\n\r\nworking  with community organisations, have clocked  more\r\n\r\nthan 20 hours this year alone.  This is commendable.  So,\r\n\r\nI would like to encourage Members of Parliament, who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  also advisers of grassroots organisations,  to  work\r\n\r\nwith  schools to encourage our students to do  their  bit\r\n\r\nfor the community that they belong to, developing in them\r\n\r\nthe sense of responsibility and common partnership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since year 2000, schools have also been introduced\r\n\r\nto  the concept of service learning.  Service learning is\r\n\r\nan approach where the CIP participants not only serve the\r\n\r\ncommunity  but also learn to identify the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  to  reflect on the community  involvement\r\n\r\nprocess, so that they can better appreciate their service\r\n\r\nand  the community that they serve.  In addition, schools\r\n\r\nactively  enhance pupils' awareness and understanding  of\r\n\r\nmulit-racialism, and it is important by  celebrating  the\r\n\r\ndifferent festivals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Education has also been infused into the\r\n\r\nuniformed groups' training programmes in varying degrees.\r\n\r\nThose  of  you who were involved in uniformed  groups  in\r\n\r\nschools  can  appreciate that sense  of  camaraderie  and\r\n\r\nsense  of  purpose among the cadets and  members  of  the\r\n\r\nuniformed  groups.   And we have  also  included  in  the\r\n\r\nuniformed  groups'  programmes the  infusion  of  various\r\n\r\ntraining that can help them understand their role in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity much better.  For example, the formal  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  include  topics  and  activities   aimed   at\r\n\r\nteaching  and instilling in members the values  of  being\r\n\r\nresponsible and caring Singaporeans.  So they do not just\r\n\r\nlearn  about how to march or how to perform their  duties\r\n\r\nas  cadets  better, but they also learn how  to  be  more\r\n\r\nresponsible and caring Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of National Education, the Learning Journey\r\n\r\nProgramme  was  launched in 1998 for school  students  to\r\n\r\nvisit  relevant places in Singapore, so as  to  sensitise\r\n\r\nour students to our history, reasons for our success, and\r\n\r\nour  constraints  and vulnerabilities.  For  example,  by\r\n\r\nvisiting  places, such as Jurong Island, which they  have\r\n\r\nnow  learned to have been targetted by members of the JI,\r\n\r\nstudents  get  first-hand glimpse of  how  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nmanaged to succeed, despite her constraints of size\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand limited resources.  So they have also learned why we,\r\n\r\nas  Singaporeans, have to continually find  new  ways  to\r\n\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students in our junior colleges and centralised\r\n\r\ninstitutes   are  also  exposed  to  the   thinking   and\r\n\r\nprinciples behind Government policies and actions through\r\n\r\ndialogue  sessions  with senior  civil  servants.   These\r\n\r\nsessions not only give the students a chance to hear from\r\n\r\nthe senior civil servants themselves their experiences in\r\n\r\npolicy  formulation and implementation, but also  provide\r\n\r\nthem with an opportunity to ask questions and voice their\r\n\r\nopinions and concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Gan said that National Education indeed is a\r\n\r\nsubject of the heart.  It was formally introduced to  our\r\n\r\nschools  five years ago, and we should not expect results\r\n\r\nquickly.   It  is  also  important  that  the  dosage  of\r\n\r\nNational Education be calibrated and appropriate for  our\r\n\r\nstudents.  Excessive dosage of National Education may  be\r\n\r\nseen  as  overbearing by all students and  undermine  the\r\n\r\nNational Education effort.  So far, the response received\r\n\r\nfrom  teachers  and students has been  encouraging.   MOE\r\n\r\nwill   continue  to  work  with  parents  and   community\r\n\r\norganisations to inculcate the desired national values in\r\n\r\nour students.  We will continue to welcome Members' views\r\n\r\non  how  we can improve our National Education Programme.\r\n\r\nBut  I would, as I said earlier, also welcome Members  to\r\n\r\nwork  more closely with our schools so that our  students\r\n\r\ncan  benefit more from the service that they give to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng also asked about citizenship education.\r\n\r\nCivic  education is a major component in civics and moral\r\n\r\neducation.   Students at the secondary level  are  taught\r\n\r\nthat citizenship is more than just legal status.  It also\r\n\r\ninvolves   rights   and   responsibilities.    They   are\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  the  Constitution  of  the  Republic   of\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  how  it  safeguards  their   fundamental\r\n\r\nliberties.    Students   also   understand   the   shared\r\n\r\nresponsibilities    and    inter-relationship     between\r\n\r\nGovernment  and people.  They learn about  the  electoral\r\n\r\nprocess,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibilities  as  voters,  the  roles  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident and Members of Parliament.  The goal of  civics\r\n\r\nand  moral  education  is also to  nurture  a  person  of\r\n\r\nintegrity  who  acts  responsibly  to  the  welfare   and\r\n\r\ninterest  of others and nation in mind.  The syllabus  is\r\n\r\nbased  on our Shared Values, Singapore family values  and\r\n\r\nuniversal  values.  It emphasises commitment  in  serving\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  nation, respect for people  of  different\r\n\r\nraces,  cultures and religions, and care for  others  and\r\n\r\nthe  environment.  Students are taught to understand that\r\n\r\nputting the interest of society above individual needs is\r\n\r\na major factor responsible for Singapore's success.  They\r\n\r\nare encouraged to explore the need to develop a sense  of\r\n\r\nemotional  rootedness to Singapore so as  to  ensure  our\r\n\r\nsurvival as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude my remarks on this point by\r\n\r\nthanking   all  MPs  who  have  spoken  on  the  National\r\n\r\nEducation Programme and the character development in  our\r\n\r\nschools.   I  would  like to encourage  Members  to  work\r\n\r\nclosely  with schools again so that they can help develop\r\n\r\nin our children and our pupils good character.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn very briefly, Sir, to another point\r\n\r\nraised  by  Ms Irene Ng.  She wondered why we  should  be\r\n\r\ndealing  with  the Malay community more  and  more  as  a\r\n\r\nseparate  group,  to  be  led  by  the  Muslim  political\r\n\r\nleaders.   She  argued  for a more inclusive  and  multi-racial  approach  in  helping  the  different  groups  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Sir, I appreciate her views, but  we  should\r\n\r\nalso acknowledge the fact that the different communities,\r\n\r\njust  like  different  groups in  Singapore,  have  their\r\n\r\npeculiarities and their different aspirations.  Where  we\r\n\r\ncan help them aspire for the common goals, we should work\r\n\r\ntogether.  I appreciate Ms Irene Ng's offer of assistance\r\n\r\nto the Malay community, if I were to consider myself as a\r\n\r\npolitical  leader  of the Malay community,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nMalay  community can raise their level of performance  as\r\n\r\nother  communities in Singapore.  But, as I said earlier,\r\n\r\nwe  must also acknowledge at the same time that different\r\n\r\ncommunities  have different issues, different aspirations\r\n\r\nand  different  problems, just like different  groups  in\r\n\r\nSingapore - the better off and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe poor, male and female, young and old.  We all have to\r\n\r\nhelp  the different groups in Singapore, as we are trying\r\n\r\nto do in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to tell Ms Ng that the Minister-in-charge\r\n\r\nof Muslim Affairs, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, has plans to inform\r\n\r\nand  brief  Members of Parliament about his  concept  and\r\n\r\nvision  for a Community of Excellence.  I think in  time,\r\n\r\nyou  will know what it means and how you can play a  role\r\n\r\nin  helping the Malay community improve on par  with  the\r\n\r\nothers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise to support this Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Stayers\" and \"quitters\" have been talked and\r\n\r\nwritten  about  by  our citizenry more  frequently  since\r\n\r\nAugust  this year.  And it would appear that these  words\r\n\r\nhave  brought  about unhappiness and  uneasiness  in  our\r\n\r\nSingapore  society generally since they were  highlighted\r\n\r\non  18th August 2002 at the National Day Rally speech  by\r\n\r\nour  hon. Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong. I am sure  he\r\n\r\nwas  sad  and concerned when he said it, and  our  people\r\n\r\nwere sad when they felt some of them were being labelled,\r\n\r\nin some ways, unfairly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure our Prime Minister meant well. However,\r\n\r\non  hindsight, it could be argued that such a topic  need\r\n\r\nnot be raised, especially at a National Day Rally speech.\r\n\r\nIt  does  not  help our people at this  stage,  when  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of the nation is down and not shining as it  used\r\n\r\nto in yesteryears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was careful in his speech when he\r\n\r\nrestricted  the  ambit  of \"quitters\"  by  saying  \"fair-weather  Singaporeans will run away whenever the  country\r\n\r\nruns  into  stormy  weather.   I  call  them  \"quitters\".\r\n\r\nFortunately,   \"quitters\"  are  in  the  minority.    The\r\n\r\nmajority  of  Singaporeans are \"stayers\".  \"Stayers\"  are\r\n\r\ncommitted to Singapore.  Rain or shine, they will be with\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, this topic, having been raised and\r\n\r\ndiscussed, might give us some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninsights into our citizens' hopes and aspirations  whilst\r\n\r\nstaying in Singapore.  Thus far, from information readily\r\n\r\navailable  to  the  public,  that  is,  from  the  press,\r\n\r\ntelevision,  radio,  Internet  websites  and   Government\r\n\r\nstatements, it does not appear to be a problem or a major\r\n\r\nproblem.  If it is a problem faced by the Government,  it\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  felt too strongly by  the  people.   More\r\n\r\ntransparent evidence is required to convince the  man  or\r\n\r\nwoman  in  the  street that there are many quitters  -  a\r\n\r\npercentage that is too large for the nation's good.   The\r\n\r\npublic should be given more information and statistics of\r\n\r\npeople  migrating from Singapore, in terms of race,  sex,\r\n\r\nage  groups, educational level, income level, those  with\r\n\r\nrelatives  who  are  already  abroad,  where   they   are\r\n\r\nmigrating to and why they wish to migrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, there seems to be more \"quitters\"\r\n\r\nfrom abroad coming to Singapore to work and live and  try\r\n\r\nand  apply  to be \"stayers\" - even permanent  stayers  by\r\n\r\ntrying  to  be  permanent residents  or  applying  to  be\r\n\r\ncitizens   of   Singapore  under  the   Constitution   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Stayers\" from Singapore, or abroad, are a good\r\n\r\nthing  for Singapore as a whole.  \"Quitters\" are, we  are\r\n\r\ntold,  bad  for  Singapore.  Is the basis for  \"good\"  or\r\n\r\n\"bad\"  measured  mainly by \"economic\"  yardsticks?   Some\r\n\r\npeople  may  argue  that,  in  certain  quarters,  it  is\r\n\r\nperceived  as  an insult to Singapore and our  Government\r\n\r\nleadership for any citizen to leave Singapore because the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot understand why some of our citizens  do\r\n\r\nleave  Singapore to go abroad temporarily or permanently,\r\n\r\nalthough  the Government has put in so much of hard  work\r\n\r\nto   make   Singapore  a  success,  and   internationally\r\n\r\nrecognised as such.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is best to leave human beings alone on this\r\n\r\nmatter  -  let  them decide what to do with their  lives.\r\n\r\nQuitters  may  not  be  disloyal to  the  nation.   Also,\r\n\r\nstayers  may  not  be  the greatest  of  loyal  citizens.\r\n\r\nQuitters may want to leave Singapore for various  reasons\r\n\r\n-  and the reasons are very personal and subjective.  And\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment need not and should not decide for  them,  nor\r\n\r\nshould  they judge them.  The Government should  be  less\r\n\r\ninterventionist  in  their  approach  towards   governing\r\n\r\nSingapore in this context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferred way to ensure that not too many caring\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  leave Singapore permanently or  temporarily\r\n\r\nis to ensure that our Government (the Executive and civil\r\n\r\nservice),  the  Legislature and  the  Judiciary  run  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  our  national institutions fairly,  justly,\r\n\r\nequitably,  compassionately and democratically  -  giving\r\n\r\nspace  and choices wherever possible to all our  citizens\r\n\r\nand  residents in Singapore.  And therefore, there  would\r\n\r\nbe  less  opportunity for complaints amongst  disgruntled\r\n\r\ncitizens.   A  government that is  self-disciplined  with\r\n\r\nresponsibility  towards  the  nation  and  its  citizens,\r\n\r\nhaving compassion and kindness, doing their level best to\r\n\r\ngive  as much happiness and peace of mind as possible  to\r\n\r\nits  people,  creating friendship between government  and\r\n\r\nits   people  (whether  PAP  or  opposition  supporting),\r\n\r\nencourage better work, respect and dignity given to  each\r\n\r\nworker  and improved wages for them, spreading of  wealth\r\n\r\namongst  citizens  more  equitably,  having  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nhonesty and loyalty to citizens, creating space for  non-politicians  -  these are the areas the  Government  must\r\n\r\nreview  and  improve  upon - and more  citizens  who  are\r\n\r\nthinking  of migrating, may decide to stay in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  they want more political space and  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should have less power and control  of  their\r\n\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, most people will accept that our\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done  well in  bringing  about  economic\r\n\r\nprosperity,  security  and  a comfortable  life  to  most\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore compared to ASEAN  countries  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.    How  about  other  sectors  of  activities   in\r\n\r\nSingapore?   Will  the way Singapore is run  and  managed\r\n\r\nmake  its  people truly happy and contented?  What  about\r\n\r\nculturally,  in  terms  of liberalisation  of  the  arts,\r\n\r\ntheatre,  plays, films, forums, seminars, night life  and\r\n\r\nleisure-related activities;  what about political\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfreedom,  removal of OB markers, less fear of  defamation\r\n\r\nsuits by Ministers against opposition politicians.  There\r\n\r\nmay  be  more complaints in these fields.  The Government\r\n\r\nmay  need to be more enlightened and more liberal so that\r\n\r\nour  citizens  are exposed to and allowed  to  experiment\r\n\r\nmore.   They  need  to  be given that  choice.   Citizens\r\n\r\nshould  not be made to feel restricted, disorientated  or\r\n\r\nalienated.  Further, there should be less stress in life.\r\n\r\nThe  sector  that feels so may want to leave the  country\r\n\r\nfor good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a major decision to leave one's country for\r\n\r\nanother.   It is preferable if he or she is not labelled.\r\n\r\nAsk  ourselves why they are leaving.  Very  personal  and\r\n\r\nsubjective reasons will be given - for greener  pastures,\r\n\r\nperception  that  there is too much of  stress  at  home,\r\n\r\nschool and workplace, greater opportunities for them  and\r\n\r\nespecially  their children's future, get away  from  high\r\n\r\ncost  of living, high cost of medical care, no social  or\r\n\r\nwelfare care compared to other countries, like Australia,\r\n\r\nCanada,   England  or  United  States  of  America,   too\r\n\r\ncompetitive to get to tertiary institutions, no space for\r\n\r\ndifferent forms of liberal recreation, get away from over-regulation,  over-governance, too much  of  paternalistic\r\n\r\ngoverning, too rigid laws and too harsh punishments,  too\r\n\r\nmuch  or  overzealous  prosecution  in  court,  perceived\r\n\r\nunfairness in treatment of opponents, opposition parties,\r\n\r\nnon-political    party   individuals,    non-governmental\r\n\r\norganisations,  school system and ranking system  causing\r\n\r\ntrauma,   tension   and  unhappiness  amongst   children,\r\n\r\nparents,  teachers, principals, etc.  All these and  many\r\n\r\nmore  reasons are subjective and very personal (and  they\r\n\r\nmay  be  real or perceived) - and the Government may  not\r\n\r\nhave  all the expertise to resolve these issues,  or  the\r\n\r\nmoral  or  legal  authority to stop  these  thoughts  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  movements  or  migration  from  Singapore   to\r\n\r\nespecially Western, ASEAN or Asian countries.  Just  like\r\n\r\nso  many foreign citizens from these other countries  are\r\n\r\ncoming  to  Singapore  to  make  it  their  temporary  or\r\n\r\npermanent home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should just leave these people to decide\r\n\r\nwhether to leave\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntemporarily  or to migrate permanently.   We  should  not\r\n\r\nhave  double  standards  - on  the  one  hand  to  invite\r\n\r\nforeigners  to  come to Singapore and not be  happy  when\r\n\r\nSingaporeans leave Singapore.  One might guess that it is\r\n\r\nthe  better off citizens (financially and education-wise)\r\n\r\nwho are leaving and therefore the Government is concerned\r\n\r\nand  unhappy.   It  is part of the fear  of  brain  drain\r\n\r\nsyndrome.  These people may also be, relatively speaking,\r\n\r\nmore  critical  and cynical citizens who  have  exercised\r\n\r\ntheir  own  preference.  And unless  the  above-mentioned\r\n\r\ncomplaints  are  addressed  and  remedied,  migration  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans might not diminish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government can do to try and attempt to\r\n\r\nminimise  the  outward flow, if really necessary,  is  to\r\n\r\nreview   the   mindset   of  the  political   and   other\r\n\r\nleaderships,  to  see if they are able  to  accept  these\r\n\r\nfacts  of  life.   And if the people give  feedback  that\r\n\r\nthere must be changes and the powers-that-be do not  wish\r\n\r\nto  make  changes, then there is an impasse.  The problem\r\n\r\nwould then remain and it would be sad for the nation as a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many citizens, especially our younger people, are\r\n\r\nmore   internationalised,  having  been  better  educated\r\n\r\nbeyond O-levels, A-levels, polytechnics and universities,\r\n\r\nhaving  studied locally and abroad.  They have more  open\r\n\r\nand  liberal  minds.   They  want  political  and  social\r\n\r\nfreedoms.   And they want politicians to open up  and  be\r\n\r\nless  powerful  and  paternalistic.   They  have  greater\r\n\r\noptions.  They are more mobile and are more confident and\r\n\r\nambitious.   Their parents are wealthier and  have  fewer\r\n\r\nchildren  to  support - two or three today,  compared  to\r\n\r\nlarger  numbers in the 1950s and 60s.  Most  of  our  top\r\n\r\ncivil   servants  and  Government  officials,   Ministers\r\n\r\nincluded,  studied  abroad.   They  may  have   been   on\r\n\r\nscholarships and, therefore, bonded and had to come home.\r\n\r\nI  would like to think they came back to serve our nation\r\n\r\nbesides  their  own families.  All our  citizens  who  go\r\n\r\nabroad  temporarily or permanently should be  treated  as\r\n\r\nSingapore's  \"ambassadors\", and they can serve  Singapore\r\n\r\nas our external friends, both in the region and globally.\r\n\r\nThey will be Singaporeans at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nheart.  Treat them well.  It is never too late.  Keep  in\r\n\r\ntouch with them.  Help them where possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current exercise of remaking Singapore must be\r\n\r\ncarried  out across-the-board in all sectors of Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety.   In  discussing remaking  Singapore,  citizens,\r\n\r\nresidents  in  Singapore,  senior  civil  servants,   the\r\n\r\nCabinet, legislature and judiciary must all come  to  one\r\n\r\nlevel  playing  field and toss their ideas and  long-held\r\n\r\nbeliefs  to be tested by others.  The top echelon  should\r\n\r\nnot  only receive reports from the various main and  sub-committees  of  the Remaking Singapore Committee.   Their\r\n\r\nideas  must  be tested and approved also.   If  not,  the\r\n\r\nresult  may not be very effective for Singapore  for  the\r\n\r\nnext lap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Remaking Singapore dialogue sessions have seen\r\n\r\nmany  good  and  innovative suggestions  which,  in  many\r\n\r\ninstances,  have  been  voiced  by  citizens,   including\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  non-governmental  organisations,   think-tanks  and grassroots leaders in the last decade or  even\r\n\r\nlonger.  These ideas must now be seriously considered  by\r\n\r\nthe  top  and elite Government leaders fairly and  justly\r\n\r\nwith  an open mind.  A national debate for, say,  one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  months,  on television, radio, newspapers,  seminars\r\n\r\nand  conferences, with all sectors participating, without\r\n\r\nexception,  might  do good for the  soul  and  spirit  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.    It   will  create  a   greater   sense   of\r\n\r\ntogetherness, comradeship, camaraderie, gelling of  minds\r\n\r\nand consensual style of life in Singapore henceforth, and\r\n\r\nanyone who is against proper discussion and debate should\r\n\r\nbe  enlightened  and  led  to see  the  light  in  proper\r\n\r\ndialogue  sessions.  It must not be a top-down system  of\r\n\r\naccepting  views  and suggestions.  Singaporeans  may  be\r\n\r\ntired  of  this  style of government and want  a  change,\r\n\r\npreferably a more liberal, democratic way of governance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also review and, if thought fit in today's\r\n\r\ncontext,  amend the relevant legislation in Singapore  to\r\n\r\ncreate the right spirit and way of life in Singapore,  so\r\n\r\nthat  people  who are thinking of leaving  Singapore  for\r\n\r\ngood could be persuaded\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  change  their minds, and stay and contribute  towards\r\n\r\nthe well-being of Singapore.  These include, inter alia:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially  Articles touching on fundamental  rights  and\r\n\r\ncitizenship;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) the Societies Act, to liberalise activities of\r\n\r\nour   more   than   5,000   civic  and   non-governmental\r\n\r\norganisations, sports organisations, religious bodies and\r\n\r\nvoluntary   organisations,  and  less  control   of   and\r\n\r\nsanctions against them;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) the Internal Security Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) the Vandalism Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) the Penal Code and other criminal laws;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) the Criminal Procedure Code, and review of\r\n\r\nSingapore   society's   need  to  adopt   the   preferred\r\n\r\nprinciples    of   sentencing,   such   as    deterrence,\r\n\r\nrehabilitation and reformation, and modes  of  punishment\r\n\r\nlike imprisonment, fines, caning, probation, etc; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) Statutes governing the press and mass-media and\r\n\r\nthe  need  to liberalise these and have less governmental\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also consider the merits of introducing\r\n\r\nthe  equivalent  of  the  Race  Relations  Act,  the  Sex\r\n\r\nDiscrimination  Act,  a  Human  Rights  Act,  Freedom  of\r\n\r\nInformation   Act,  and  amend  the  various   \"stifling\"\r\n\r\nlegislation touching on life in Singapore as a whole,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  will have a more fair, just, compassionate  and\r\n\r\nmore  participative society, where citizens and residents\r\n\r\nare  given  more say and power in deciding the future  of\r\n\r\nour lives in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, it may be prudent to set up a\r\n\r\nmachinery  to  interview citizens who are migrating  from\r\n\r\nSingapore in order to obtain frank disclosure and genuine\r\n\r\nfeedback  from  them  as to why they  are  leaving.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  can then take remedial measures  to  minimise\r\n\r\nthis perceived problem.  This would, in some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nway,  reflect  the  compassionate side of  our  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I seek a clarification from the hon.\r\n\r\nNominated  Member  of  Parliament when  he  said  in  his\r\n\r\nopening remarks - I think the word used was unfortunate - to bring up this phrase on stayers and quitters?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Did he mean to imply that it was\r\n\r\nwrong  for  the  Prime  Minister to  talk  about  rooting\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Not at all.

But I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister, when he addressed Singaporeans,  he\r\n\r\nmeant well, and that is what I have stated in my speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of\r\n\r\nthe debate, a number of Members have elaborated on issues\r\n\r\nrelated  to  education as a push factor that  could  turn\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  from stayers to quitters.  I  am  not  sure\r\n\r\nwhat the hon. Nominated Member of Parliament, despite his\r\n\r\nanswer,  means.  I am not sure whether there  is  ever  a\r\n\r\nbest time to discuss when one should stay or quit.  And I\r\n\r\nhad originally intended to be an appreciative listener in\r\n\r\nthis  debate.   But  I  find so much  rubble  thrown  and\r\n\r\naccumulated at my feet in the Ministry of Education  that\r\n\r\nI  feel  compelled to join in the fray, lest I get buried\r\n\r\nin  the rubble.  Not that this feeling of being buried is\r\n\r\nnovel.   Since  day one at the Ministry of  Education,  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  subjected to an avalanche  of  feedback  from\r\n\r\nfamily,  friends,  Singaporeans and foreigners  in  every\r\n\r\ncommittee that I sit - CEOs, technicians, line operators,\r\n\r\nall sectors of society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safe to assume that there are at least twice\r\n\r\nas many views as there are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore on the Ministry of  Education.   In\r\n\r\nfact, if you ever wanted to start a conversation, all you\r\n\r\nhave to do is utter the eight magical words: what do  you\r\n\r\nthink of our education system?  You will excuse me  if  I\r\n\r\ndo  not use that line often.  Well, Minister of State for\r\n\r\nEducation, what are you going to do about it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, first, listen carefully. And I want to\r\n\r\nassure  Members that I do listen, as do the Ministers  in\r\n\r\nGovernment, Permanent Secretaries, directors and, more or\r\n\r\nless, 24,000 teachers that we have in the system, many of\r\n\r\nwhom also have children within the school system.  We are\r\n\r\nnot   impervious  or  blind  to  the  current  system   - unaffected   nor   detached  -   because   we   too   are\r\n\r\nstakeholders.   And  I  assure  you  my  stakes  give  me\r\n\r\nfeedback every dinner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, this angst among Singaporeans about our\r\n\r\neducation  system is healthy.  It implies  a  measure  of\r\n\r\nownership,  that  Singaporeans  see  themselves  as   co-travellers   and  co-builders  in  our  great   education\r\n\r\nenterprise - our investment and legacy for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sat in this House yesterday and today, this is\r\n\r\nwhat  I  heard.  Despite all the good in the system,  the\r\n\r\nhon.  MPs said our education system is too stressful.   I\r\n\r\nthink  most of them said that - not holistic, not focused\r\n\r\nenough  on  academic  attainments,  too  narrow  in   its\r\n\r\ndefinition  of success, too prescriptive,  it  gives  too\r\n\r\nlittle  choice - whether it is in the choice of a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage  or even in the choice of schools - that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  allow mainstream Singaporeans to enter international\r\n\r\nschools;  not  inclusive enough  to  address  those  with\r\n\r\nspecial needs and learning disabilities; our system  does\r\n\r\nnot  endear our students because we make them feel second\r\n\r\nor, even worse, third-class; too elitist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us will remember the ITE debate in this\r\n\r\nHouse.    Make   people  feel  good,  they   say,   about\r\n\r\nthemselves;  discover  and play up their  strengths,  not\r\n\r\ntheir  weaknesses;  create more  opportunities  to  allow\r\n\r\npeople  to progress, especially the polytechnic  students\r\n\r\nto enter the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuniversities, the ITE students into polytechnics, and the\r\n\r\nlike.    All   these  recommendations  seek   to   enrich\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  So let us ask the obvious:  why  would  we\r\n\r\nnot  want  these  egalitarian  outcomes?   If  it  is  so\r\n\r\nobviously good, why has it not already happened?  Indeed,\r\n\r\nwhy not?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know for a fact that the new MPs, who spoke so\r\n\r\npassionately on this subject, are not so arrogant  as  to\r\n\r\nthink  that enlightenment has only been endowed on  their\r\n\r\nvintage, and that the past leadership was myopic  in  its\r\n\r\npolicies.     After   all,   the   World   Yearbook    on\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness repeatedly ranks the Government  and  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure that it has built as first in  the  world.\r\n\r\nSo why have we not approached an educational utopia?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can forget ourselves; who we are. By\r\n\r\ndint of geography and a capricious twist of history,  all\r\n\r\nwe  landed up with were 640 square kilometres of land and\r\n\r\neach other.  Dr Ong Seh Hong's point bears repeating: who\r\n\r\nowes  Singaporeans a living?  Indeed, we are an  economic\r\n\r\nanomaly.   Nothing  in  our  constellation  projected  or\r\n\r\npredestined us to enjoy prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now spend about 4% of our GDP on education.\r\n\r\nAbout   25%  of  total  Government  spending  goes   into\r\n\r\neducation,  the largest component, somewhat on  par  with\r\n\r\ndefence.   In  absolute  dollar  terms,  we  spend  equal\r\n\r\namounts on our tertiary students, as do countries in  the\r\n\r\nOECD.   How  is  this possible for a small  country?   We\r\n\r\ncould do so because we took extremely hard choices in our\r\n\r\neducational   policies,  to  survive  economically   and,\r\n\r\nindeed,  socially.   Can we afford to  continue  spending\r\n\r\nvast  amounts  in education?  Is it a given?   Many  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  here, including us new ones, experienced  first-hand  the  effects of this recent economic downturn.   If\r\n\r\nthe  recession stretched longer, would we  have  had  the\r\n\r\nluxury  of  this debate on education and,  indeed,  would\r\n\r\npeople care?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as much as we malign our economic underpinnings\r\n\r\nin  our educational system, it has served us well.   With\r\n\r\nlimited resources, we focused on educational\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfundamentals.  We said let us build great schools in  all\r\n\r\nsectors  and  across  the island.   So,  whether  it  was\r\n\r\nprimary, secondary, junior college, ITEs, polytechnics or\r\n\r\nuniversities, they had to strive to be the  best  in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  teaching not some Singaporeans,  but  all  to  be\r\n\r\nliterate  and numerate.  Stated so glibly, but  think  of\r\n\r\nwhat  the  realisation  of  that  vision  entails  -  the\r\n\r\nthousands of teachers we have to attract and train,  made\r\n\r\nno  easier  by  an increasingly fractious  and  demanding\r\n\r\npublic;  the schools we have to build and the  curriculum\r\n\r\nwe have to devise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we succeeded? Unequivocally, yes. This very\r\n\r\ndebate  is  symptomatic  of  that  success.   Many  other\r\n\r\ncountries debate for generations how to arrive at what we\r\n\r\nhave  achieved,  and then some more.  Let me  illustrate.\r\n\r\nLet  us  look  at  our PSLE results - the  percentage  of\r\n\r\nstudents  who get an \"A\" or \"A+\".  More than 40%  get  an\r\n\r\n\"A\"  or  \"A+\"  in English, Mathematics and Science.   And\r\n\r\ndespite the furore over our mother tongue, 80% get \"A\" or\r\n\r\n\"A+\"  in Chinese.  It is because we have managed to raise\r\n\r\nthe tide across the island, giving opportunities and good\r\n\r\nteaching to heartlanders and cosmopolitans alike, that we\r\n\r\nnow have a problem of what we call \"stress\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made our system school-proof. What do I\r\n\r\nmean?   It  means  that if we have the aptitude  and  are\r\n\r\nwilling  to work at it, any school in Singapore will  get\r\n\r\nyou  there.  That is what creates the pressure.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  pressure-head.  So when I do my  walkabouts  in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh, or at Pei Chun School, which is one of the leading\r\n\r\nschools  in  my constituency, and see the drive  of  some\r\n\r\nstudents  and  their parents, I shudder for  my  children\r\n\r\nbecause  of the competition.  Is this drive to excel  and\r\n\r\ncompete counter-productive?  Should we try to equalise it\r\n\r\nand  distort  educational objectives  to  reduce  stress?\r\n\r\nHow?   If  I  lower the bar, more just clear  it.   If  I\r\n\r\nintroduce more subjects or events, can I be sure that the\r\n\r\nsame  driven students, who excelled previously, will  not\r\n\r\ntry  to  excel  in those new subjects and add  even  more\r\n\r\npressure for themselves and others?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nShould  we do away with examinations?  It is a rhetorical\r\n\r\nquestion.   How  do you and should you stop  parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents wanting to do well and get ahead of others?  Can\r\n\r\nwe,  for instance, legislate limits to studying hours  or\r\n\r\noutlaw or close down all tuition centres?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that the education system is a lightning\r\n\r\nrod  for  stress but the tensions emanate  from  society.\r\n\r\nSociety  filters what it deems important.  MOE  routinely\r\n\r\npublishes  information  on  schools  that  have  achieved\r\n\r\nawards  in  CCA  as well as academic results.   But  more\r\n\r\nattention is paid to the latter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our assessment of schools using the School\r\n\r\nExcellence Model, academic results only count for 15%  of\r\n\r\nthe evaluation.  As much as our processes are aligned  to\r\n\r\ndo  what many of the MPs have called for, society  steers\r\n\r\nitself  towards a preferred direction.  Society places  a\r\n\r\nhigh  premium  on certain jobs such as lawyers,  doctors,\r\n\r\netc.   And  it  is not a passive receiver.  Even  if  you\r\n\r\nchange  the system, it will respond.  It is a problem  of\r\n\r\nsuccess  and  should be seen as such, not certainly  with\r\n\r\nthe  angst, chest-beating and hair wrenching that we see.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  we  get more praise about our  successes  from\r\n\r\nforeigners than Singaporeans which, if we think about it,\r\n\r\nmust  discourage many of our teachers.  Some  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament   have  encouraged  Government   to   say   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  \"Well  done\" if they do.  I  wonder  how  a\r\n\r\nteacher feels listening to this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider this. In the Third International\r\n\r\nMathematics  and  Science  Study,  93%  and  80%  of  our\r\n\r\nSecondary  Two students were above international  average\r\n\r\nfor  Mathematics  and  Science.  Schools  in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates are using our textbooks on Mathematics and Science\r\n\r\nand MOE recently signed an MOU to facilitate transfer  of\r\n\r\nexpertise.  In my recent trips, the Deans of the top  USA\r\n\r\nuniversities  said this, \"There is only one  thing  wrong\r\n\r\nwith  the  Singapore students.  We do not get  enough  of\r\n\r\nthem.\"   I asked the programme director and lecturers  of\r\n\r\nour  SMA  Alliance, which is the Singapore-MIT  alliance.\r\n\r\nWe met in MIT.  This is a programme that they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nteach  on  video,  so  it is cross-distance.   They  have\r\n\r\nstudents  in  NUS  campus, NTU and MIT  -  same  lecturer\r\n\r\ndelivering to three different groups across the globe.  I\r\n\r\nasked  the programme director in SMA, whom we met in  MIT\r\n\r\nrecently,  if the Singapore students they teach  were  on\r\n\r\npar with their students in MIT.  I was not trying to fish\r\n\r\nfor  comments.  This was a serious question  and  it  was\r\n\r\nasked  in  that  tone.   This  was  among  the  programme\r\n\r\ndirector   and   the  MIT  lecturers.   The   reply   was\r\n\r\ninstantaneous  and  unanimous  -  definitely   so.    Our\r\n\r\nstudents are on par with them and they want more of them.\r\n\r\nMNC,  CEOs  in  Singapore tell us that we have  the  best\r\n\r\npolytechnics  in  the  world  and  how  they  wish  their\r\n\r\ngovernment and electorate would follow our model.   These\r\n\r\nare  not  CEOs from under-developed countries.  They  are\r\n\r\nfrom developed countries like Germany and other parts  of\r\n\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum total of their feedback is this. Our\r\n\r\neducational system prepares the majority of our  students\r\n\r\nto  succeed anywhere in the world.  We have been able  to\r\n\r\ndo  this  because  we focus on educational  fundamentals,\r\n\r\nbuilding  great  institutions and teachers,  rather  than\r\n\r\ntrying   to  satisfy  all  aspirations.   We   knew   our\r\n\r\nlimitations  and our constraints and we are  reaping  the\r\n\r\nfruits  of  our success.  Unfortunately, some fruits  are\r\n\r\nnot  as  sweet as we like, which is this debate.   It  is\r\n\r\nsymptomatic of our success, as I said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung pointed out yesterday that what\r\n\r\nwas   enough  for  him  appears  inadequate  for  others,\r\n\r\nsomething  which  he and I find inexplicable.   Take  the\r\n\r\nexample quoted by our MPs of the polytechnic student  who\r\n\r\nis  able to get his degree overseas in a shorter time but\r\n\r\nfeels aggrieved towards Singapore because he cannot enter\r\n\r\npublic   universities.   Thankfully,  they  are  in   the\r\n\r\nminority.   A lot of polytechnic alumni do recognise  the\r\n\r\nacademic  and  rigorous education  they  receive  at  the\r\n\r\npolytechnic, help them get a degree and remain  committed\r\n\r\nto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then do we progress having succeeded so far?\r\n\r\nFirstly,  focus on the fundamentals that have  served  us\r\n\r\nwell and let us not get distracted.  Secondly,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccommodate  diversity.  Yes, we  have  reached  a  point\r\n\r\nwhere we should and must respond to individual needs  and\r\n\r\ntalents.   Thirdly,  involve partners  in  the  education\r\n\r\nprocess.   Mr  Ahmad  Khalis and  Mr  Hawazi  alluded  to\r\n\r\nCOMPASS  where schools, parents and communities synergise\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts and inputs to plot direction and pace.   I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him  that this process of  engagement  is  a\r\n\r\nwinning formula and we could do more of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not intend at the outset to\r\n\r\nanswer  specific queries about the Ministry of Education,\r\n\r\nor  issues  raised about education.  I do not think  that\r\n\r\nthis   debate   will  end  here.   Some  of   the   older\r\n\r\nparliamentarians said they asked the same questions 15-20\r\n\r\nyears ago and we are asking them now.  And I suspect  15-20 years hence, they will be asking the same questions in\r\n\r\nthis House.  But let us see the debate as a positive one.\r\n\r\nThis engagement in the process where we contribute to the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of our educational institutions is in the  very\r\n\r\nspirit  that the motion calls for, which is a process  of\r\n\r\nengagement,  stakeholdership  and  ownership.   We   have\r\n\r\nreached  a stage where there are no easy answers  and  we\r\n\r\nwill have to plot our future together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that spirit, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.   Would the Minister of State not agree with me that\r\n\r\nour  students  do well in examinations only because  they\r\n\r\nprepare for examinations and it does not necessarily mean\r\n\r\nthat  our  students are well-trained and prepared  to  be\r\n\r\nanalytical and questioning?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, if helping to prepare them well\r\n\r\nand  do  excellently in our Ivy League  colleges  is  not\r\n\r\nconsidered analytical, or to have the ability to stand on\r\n\r\npar  with the top institutions in the world, then I would\r\n\r\nconcede the point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Would the Minister of State not\r\n\r\nagree  that  the people who qualify for these Ivy  League\r\n\r\nuniversities  are not necessarily representative  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of students in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member\r\n\r\nwould  be  pleasantly surprised if he saw the  number  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean students that has entered these universities.\r\n\r\nIt  is  said that for Stanford and UPenn, Raffles College\r\n\r\nsends the largest number of students in any school across\r\n\r\nthe world.  The truth is, even in our other institutions,\r\n\r\nfor example, the polytechnics, tracer surveys showed that\r\n\r\nas many as 50-60% get degrees five years from the time of\r\n\r\ngraduation.   In  our educational system,  the  tide  has\r\n\r\nrisen so high that the majority of our students, not only\r\n\r\nthe  cream, can enter any educational system in the world\r\n\r\nand succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Minister of State to clarify his measure  of\r\n\r\nsuccess.  From what I have been hearing in his speech and\r\n\r\nalso from the questions that he had answered, his measure\r\n\r\nof  success  is  entry into top universities  around  the\r\n\r\nworld.   But  my question is:  does the Ministry  measure\r\n\r\nsuccess  by  the  performance of  Singaporean  graduates,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  study  in Singapore or  overseas,  in  the\r\n\r\nworkplace and how do we compare our graduates with  those\r\n\r\nfrom  the rest of the world?  Do we have examples of very\r\n\r\nsuccessful Singaporeans outside Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I rephrase the\r\n\r\nquestion back to the hon. Member?  Is he suggesting  that\r\n\r\nour students have not succeeded?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my question is:\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the measure of successful graduates or students\r\n\r\nout   of  the  Singapore  system?   Yes,  they  are  very\r\n\r\nsuccessful  when  they make it into universities  because\r\n\r\nthey  score very well in examinations.  But whether  they\r\n\r\nare better off in their working life, I have my doubts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I would take offence to that\r\n\r\nstatement,  Mr  Speaker.   I  graduated  from   a   local\r\n\r\nuniversity.  I have been told I am quite successful and I\r\n\r\ndo quite well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister's National Day Rally Speech was a\r\n\r\ncall  to our people to huddle, to understand and to  find\r\n\r\nways  to  tackle the challenges that we have  identified.\r\n\r\nIt was a call to be on guard and to expect new challenges\r\n\r\nthat  will crop up as a result of situations that we have\r\n\r\nno  control over.  It was meant as the occasion was  for,\r\n\r\nto  rally  our people at a time when racial and religious\r\n\r\ntensions could make a tear at our social fabric  that  we\r\n\r\nhave so painstakingly built over the last 30 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech was a call to have people come on board\r\n\r\nand  for those who are already on board to stay on  board\r\n\r\nfor  the  Singapore  cause, and  that  is  the  continued\r\n\r\nsurvival and success of our young nation.  Along the way,\r\n\r\nthe social contract between the Government and the people\r\n\r\nwill  ensure that we continue to create new opportunities\r\n\r\nfor our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of labels of quitters and stayers sparked\r\n\r\noff fiery debates in the press and touched on reasons why\r\n\r\nsome  Singaporeans think of emigrating.  We read of  many\r\n\r\ntestimonies of stressed Singaporeans, the cry for a  lack\r\n\r\nof  space  for  individual expression, and the  demanding\r\n\r\neducation system all thrown in for good measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked a friend, a foreigner, who has since become\r\n\r\na  Singaporean,  what did he think  about  the  labels  - quitters  and  stayers.  He said  that  during  a  recent\r\n\r\ncrisis  in  this country, he had to push his cupboard  to\r\n\r\nblock  the window so that people could not break  in  and\r\n\r\nloot.   Then, he went to a bedroom and an adjoining  wall\r\n\r\nwith  the house next door and used a metal mallet to hack\r\n\r\na  hole in the wall to go into the other house.  A family\r\n\r\nmember  peeped  out  and saw his neighbours  kneeling  in\r\n\r\nfront  of  the  house being whipped,  spray  painted  and\r\n\r\ntaunted.   He  said that he became a Singaporean  because\r\n\r\nour Government spent the last 37 years thinking of such a\r\n\r\nscene and thinking of such scenarios so that our citizens\r\n\r\ndo  not have to think about it every day for the last  37\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of labels, while I will not classify\r\n\r\nSingaporeans broadly into quitters or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstayers, I cannot ignore the phenomenon revealed by  PM's\r\n\r\nuse of these two labels.  This is the crux of this motion\r\n\r\ntoday. These are real concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that some Singaporeans are stressed\r\n\r\neither  by  the pace of life or stressed by worrying  for\r\n\r\ntheir children whom they feel are unnecessarily stressed.\r\n\r\nHence,  for  this group of Singaporeans, they  feel  that\r\n\r\nmigrating  to another country will resolve and take  care\r\n\r\nof  these  problems. They are merely making  choices  and\r\n\r\ndeciding  that  they may not want to  keep  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nfrenetic pace at work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may decide to earn less or they are at a point,\r\n\r\nwhere they have enough savings and earning capacity,  for\r\n\r\nthem to make the move.  It may even be all right for them\r\n\r\nto  pay  a  little bit more tax but have  their  children\r\n\r\nlearn at a more relaxed pace. They are not quitters,  but\r\n\r\nmerely  Singaporeans who ironically have  benefited  from\r\n\r\nthe  political  and  social stability  that  afforded  an\r\n\r\neconomic growth and an education system that helped  give\r\n\r\nthe same people that global mobility that they now wield.\r\n\r\nThey  may  become Australians or Canadians but they  will\r\n\r\nstill be Singaporeans at heart.  Our best wishes to  them\r\n\r\nand  hope that they can afford to come back often  enough\r\n\r\nto  keep the links.  Of course, there are those who  have\r\n\r\nleft  due  to  attractive job offers.  For that,  we  are\r\n\r\nproud  that they are representing Singapore in a  foreign\r\n\r\nland  and  hope  that they too will return  one  day  and\r\n\r\ncontribute  their wealth of experience they  have  gained\r\n\r\nwhile being overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am also consoled by the fact that many\r\n\r\nwho  had  considered  migrating for  these  reasons  have\r\n\r\nstayed  as  they felt that some of the difficulties  they\r\n\r\nfaced  at  a  point  in  time can  be  overcome  and  the\r\n\r\nemotional  aspects  and  familial  ties  that  bind  them\r\n\r\nexisted.   And they are strong enough to keep them  home.\r\n\r\nThey  make adjustments and indeed work on reducing stress\r\n\r\non  both  themselves  and that of their  children.   They\r\n\r\nponder  about  how life would be like, as many  of  their\r\n\r\nfriends  and  family are here if they had emigrated.   As\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State, Mr Matthias Yao,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhad  said in 1997, it is actually a good thing that these\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  go through the mental process  in  deciding\r\n\r\nwhether to emigrate or not.  They would have become  more\r\n\r\naware  of  the benefits of life in Singapore  than  those\r\n\r\nwhom  the thought of leaving is furthest from even  their\r\n\r\nwildest dreams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may even realise that the preparedness of their\r\n\r\nchildren for the future can be best achieved here.   They\r\n\r\nrealise  that their children are not just competing  with\r\n\r\ntheir  fellow classmates in Singapore, or for that matter\r\n\r\nin  Australia.  But the time will come when they  may  be\r\n\r\ncompeting  for  a job, say, in Shanghai, with  his  peers\r\n\r\nnamed  Nguyen  from Vietnam, Minh from Myanmar  or  Zhang\r\n\r\nfrom Beijing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On stress faced by children, many have expressed the\r\n\r\nuphill  task of tackling Chinese in school.  I wonder  if\r\n\r\nthe Education Ministry can entertain the possibility that\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese language education in lower primary be  more\r\n\r\nfocused on conversational than anything deeper.  Let  the\r\n\r\nchild  be  comfortable in conversing in the  language  so\r\n\r\nthat  he is not overwhelmed.  Many of the parents  citing\r\n\r\nthis  problem are probably English educated and find that\r\n\r\nthey  are unable to teach their children but to employ  a\r\n\r\ntutor.  This adds to the stress level of both parent  and\r\n\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my hon. colleague, Mr Gan Kim Yong, mentioned in\r\n\r\nhis  speech  when  he  moved the motion  yesterday,  that\r\n\r\nthrough stories, strong values and character building can\r\n\r\nbe  taught  to  our children.  Interest  in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage would not be killed off in the process to master\r\n\r\na  higher standard of Chinese.  This can perhaps be later\r\n\r\ndeveloped  and achieved through the child taking  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject  as  an  elective perhaps  in  upper  primary  or\r\n\r\nsecondary school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of creating an emotional bond to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  hope that the Government can  continue  to\r\n\r\nplay a part in promoting family and community events that\r\n\r\nbind  all  with  a common experience.  Many  of  us  will\r\n\r\nremember outings with our family along Elizabeth Walk  in\r\n\r\nthe 1960s.  Our children will probably\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nremember  the surrounds of the Esplanade or the sound  of\r\n\r\nthe  shutters in the concert hall adjusting to  suit  the\r\n\r\nnext piece of music to be played by world-class musicians\r\n\r\nperforming  on our shores.  The experiences, the  senses,\r\n\r\nthe  images of an ever changing Singapore must find a way\r\n\r\ninto  the  hearts of our people.  This  is  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nconnection  and  engagement that my hon. colleagues  have\r\n\r\nall  talked about.  I believe this will play  a  part  in\r\n\r\ninstilling some sense of belonging in our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that the 3G Singaporeans are born after\r\n\r\n1965.   I  was born a few months before 1965 and I  would\r\n\r\nclassify  myself  as one.  Like my other  3G  Singaporean\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues here, the 3Gs are used to almost\r\n\r\ninstant  responses, like e-mails, the SMS and,  in  time,\r\n\r\nMMS.  The work environment mostly functions on a \"you are\r\n\r\nas  good as your last deal\" framework.  We can be and are\r\n\r\noften irked by some responses from Government departments\r\n\r\nto  our  questions  and,  on  occasions,  by  Ministerial\r\n\r\nresponses in this House to our questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking to many 3G and some 2G, they feel that they\r\n\r\nhave  no voice, no space to express their viewpoint,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  told that they can join the many feedback channels,\r\n\r\nthey  feel that it is hopeless and they express disbelief\r\n\r\nthat it is of any efficacy.  The Government must work  at\r\n\r\nchanging this perspective of the 3Gs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to do that is maybe through engagement and\r\n\r\nthe  participation of young Singaporeans in  the  policy-making   process.    That  way,  an  insight   into   the\r\n\r\nconstraints that policy makers are faced with,  will  let\r\n\r\nthe  3Gs understand what are the larger and other  stakes\r\n\r\nthat  are  involved  and  the concerns  that  are  to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered.   Perhaps  we can consider  forming  a  youth\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the 1Gs and some 2G Singaporeans would\r\n\r\nprobably  say that we trust the Government  to  do  their\r\n\r\nbest  as  they  have done for the last  37  years,  going\r\n\r\nforward,  I do not realistically think that the 3Gs  will\r\n\r\nfeel that same way.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that if more Singaporeans, particularly\r\n\r\nyounger  Singaporeans, or what we call the 3Gs, are  made\r\n\r\nmore acutely aware of the concerns of our country, we may\r\n\r\nhave more constructive participation and people will  not\r\n\r\nfeel  that  policies are dished out, and you just  follow\r\n\r\nthem,  because, as a matter of fact, you do not know  any\r\n\r\nbetter.   That  way, the connectivity with these  younger\r\n\r\ndrivers  of  the Singapore cause will be  enhanced.   The\r\n\r\nengagement or perhaps the social contract with them  will\r\n\r\nthus be stronger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is interesting that my hon.\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Chandra Mohan, mentioned that our Ministers\r\n\r\nand top civil servants went overseas to study and had  to\r\n\r\nfulfil  their bond and come home.  I was not good  enough\r\n\r\nto  have  that  Government scholarship.  I went  overseas\r\n\r\ntoo, and I came home and my bond was with Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few of us students got together to put on a\r\n\r\nSingapore  Night for our foreign students.   By  default,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  skin  tone, I played the  role  of  Raffles.\r\n\r\nThere was a Mr Farquhar, and we found three gentlemen   - two  of them very tall with very pronounced foreheads   - to  play SM Lee and Dr Goh Keng Swee.  And the other,  we\r\n\r\nfound a person with very thick-rimmed glasses to play  Dr\r\n\r\nToh Chin Chye.  What happened was that the fire played by\r\n\r\nthese  three  characters made our American friends  very,\r\n\r\nvery  interested  and  impressed.  Back  stage,  I  asked\r\n\r\nmyself,  \"After this play, what's my role for Singapore?\"\r\n\r\nMy bond was to come home and to be engaged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the journey and the task before us\r\n\r\nare  long and arduous, but not insurmountable as long  as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have a heart to commit their time and  their\r\n\r\npassion for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support\r\n\r\nof  the motion proposed by my hon. colleague, Mr Gan  Kim\r\n\r\nYong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to pose four questions to Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House  and,  in essence, to all Singaporeans.   The\r\n\r\nfour questions are the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Who are we? Do we have a sense of identity?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What do we stand for, or what are our ideals?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What do we owe Singapore? Or do we have a sense of\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gratitude?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What role do we play in Singapore? And this is a\r\n\r\nquestion  which perhaps is especially so for the younger,\r\n\r\n3G Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the first question - identity.\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Singaporeans are a 37-year  old  fluke  of\r\n\r\nhistory and geography.  In the eyes of some people,  this\r\n\r\nis  a  joke.   Are we just the southern tip of  Malaysia?\r\n\r\nAre we just another island in the Riau Archipelago?  Look\r\n\r\naround  this House, were all of us born here?  Do we  all\r\n\r\nspeak the same languages?  We do not even believe in  the\r\n\r\nsame God.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and our identity only exist because of an\r\n\r\nact  of  will.   Singapore citizenship is  not  based  on\r\n\r\ngenetics, history or geography.  Singapore citizenship is\r\n\r\nbased  entirely upon allegiance to a set of ideals, which\r\n\r\nbrings me to the next question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are our ideals, and what do we believe in?\r\n\r\nBecause,  if  we cannot answer that, then  we  cannot  be\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   The issue is do we have a set  of  ideals\r\n\r\nthat  we believe in? These are ideals which, in a  sense,\r\n\r\nhave  been  encapsulated  in the  Pledge  written  by  Mr\r\n\r\nRajaratnam  and our Senior Minister Lee  Kuan  Yew.   The\r\n\r\nideals   of   a  Singaporean  Singapore,  a  multi-racial\r\n\r\ndemocratic  society, meritocracy, justice  and  equality.\r\n\r\nAnd  all these in search of happiness first  -  for those\r\n\r\nof  you  who are worried about us being too materialistic\r\n\r\n-  happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation.  It\r\n\r\nis this set of ideals which defines Singaporeans.  And it\r\n\r\nis  the belief and allegiance to this set of ideals which\r\n\r\nhas created a unique way of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlife and a common destiny for us, fellow Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this debate, a lot has been said about\r\n\r\nemigration.  Let me give Members a personal take  on  it.\r\n\r\nEvery Sunday, I see buses choked, full of people, foreign\r\n\r\nworkers, on their way out to enjoy their only day off  in\r\n\r\na  hard  week.   I remind my children when I  pass  these\r\n\r\nbuses,  or  when  I  pass certain parks  where  they  are\r\n\r\ncongregated,  that we are entirely of  the  same  genetic\r\n\r\nstock as these foreign workers.  The only reason some  of\r\n\r\nus   will   have   the  privilege  of  migrating   as   a\r\n\r\nprofessional,  not  as a maid or as a  labourer,  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause  of any inherent superiority in ourselves  or  in\r\n\r\nour  genes.  It is due entirely to the fact that we  were\r\n\r\nblessed to be born in this place called Singapore and  to\r\n\r\nhave  enjoyed  the environment which has shaped  us,  for\r\n\r\nbetter or for worse.  And in our case, certainly, for the\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that I am and all that I have are due\r\n\r\nentirely  to  the  Singapore system, and  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  exists.  So, for those who have considered  or\r\n\r\nare  considering leaving, all I am asking is, leave  with\r\n\r\nsome gratitude in their hearts and we wish them well, and\r\n\r\nwe will continue to hope to be connected with them.  But,\r\n\r\nas  my good friend, Ahmad Khalis, said yesterday, do  not\r\n\r\nuse  emigration as a threat to us.  And,  as  Mr  Chandra\r\n\r\nMohan  says, if indeed all the people who are considering\r\n\r\nleaving  Singapore  are doing so because  of  unhappiness\r\n\r\nwith the PAP and the Government, and if indeed these  are\r\n\r\nthe same people who would be likely to vote against us at\r\n\r\nthe  next election, then if we were to be purely partisan\r\n\r\nabout it, we should say, \"That's fine.  That improves  my\r\n\r\nvotes at the next election.\"  But Members know that  this\r\n\r\nis not a game that we are playing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the issue is not how many people go, or\r\n\r\nwho  goes, or to get the details for their exact  reasons\r\n\r\nthat anybody makes such a heart-wrenching decision.   The\r\n\r\ncrux  of  the  issue for us, as a country,  is  how  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will willingly exercise  their  freedom  of\r\n\r\nchoice\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  decide to commit themselves to their families,  their\r\n\r\nfriends  and fellow Singaporeans.  If we do  not  have  a\r\n\r\ncritical  mass of local committed Singaporeans, then  who\r\n\r\nwill be responsible for our collective destiny?  Who will\r\n\r\nbe  responsible for Singaporeans who do not even have  an\r\n\r\noption  to migrate?  In fact, it is this unique  role  of\r\n\r\nlocal  committed Singaporeans who cannot be  replaced  by\r\n\r\nexpatriates.   The survival of Singapore depends  on  the\r\n\r\nquality   and   quantity   of   these   hardcore    local\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on to the fourth question. What is the\r\n\r\nrole,  especially of younger Singaporeans  in  all  this?\r\n\r\nThere  is  one key difference between the first  and  the\r\n\r\nthird  generation of Singaporeans.  The first  generation\r\n\r\nhad to fight for independence.   They then had to unite a\r\n\r\npotentially  explosive mix of disparate ethnic  enclaves.\r\n\r\nThey  had  to build an economy and they had to  create  a\r\n\r\nfirst-world  country.  These are really big hairy  goals,\r\n\r\nworth several lifetimes of effort.  These challenges  and\r\n\r\nthe very real prospect of failure and the consequences of\r\n\r\nfailure  enhance that sense of participation,  obligation\r\n\r\nand,  ultimately, bonding in that pioneering  generation.\r\n\r\nNow, we fast forward to today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that many young Singaporeans ask\r\n\r\nthemselves  is:  Do we collectively have any  big  worthy\r\n\r\ngoals  to  achieve  for ourselves and  for  our  country?\r\n\r\nBecause  if younger Singaporeans feel that they  have  no\r\n\r\nrole  to  play  in going after those big  goals  for  the\r\n\r\nsociety,  then  the  only  thing  left  is  to  focus  on\r\n\r\nthemselves and look after number one.  So, I feel that in\r\n\r\norder  to sharpen this sense of obligation in this  group\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans, we also need to enhance  our  sense  of\r\n\r\nownership,  belonging and participation.  Because  if  we\r\n\r\nallow   younger  Singaporeans  to  feel  alienated   from\r\n\r\nsociety, then they will lose that sense of obligation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if we can show young Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  needed and that there  are  avenues  for\r\n\r\nparticipation,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthen  that natural deep-seated imperative to do something\r\n\r\nworthwhile with their lives will surface.  And I think we\r\n\r\ncan  count  on them to continue this process  of  nation-building  and not let the past and the future generations\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we accept that there is a role, we then have to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  this  role is in any  way  going  to  be\r\n\r\ndifferent  in the future.  And that perhaps  is  as  good\r\n\r\nenough  an  excuse to discuss superficially some  of  the\r\n\r\naspects  of Remaking Singapore.  This is not the time  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss the whole laundry list.  But I want to say a  few\r\n\r\nthings.   It  is  a  process.  As Ms Irene  Ng  yesterday\r\n\r\nasked,   \"Why  aren't  there  instant  answers,   instant\r\n\r\nresponses, from the Government?\"  It is not so easy.   We\r\n\r\nare  not  just deciding that we shall raise your  tax  on\r\n\r\nloyalty by 3%.  It does not work that way.  It is  not  a\r\n\r\npanacea  for all ills.  In any case, there are very  many\r\n\r\ndifferent  perspectives, and some of  these  perspectives\r\n\r\nare contradictory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reassure Mr Chandra Mohan that we have\r\n\r\nconsulted  very, very widely, if you look and  count  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of people we have met, if you look at the  number\r\n\r\nof  emails, letters and telephone calls, which all of  us\r\n\r\nand  the sub-committee members have been involved in.   I\r\n\r\nhave  stopped counting a long time ago, because it is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  a question of quantity.  We have consulted  local\r\n\r\nvoices.  The overseas Singaporeans have contributed  both\r\n\r\nto the Economic Restructuring Committee as well as to us.\r\n\r\nThere is no question of lack of commitment.  It is not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  geography.  It is not even  a  question  of\r\n\r\npartisanship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, what are some of the signs or\r\n\r\nsignals  that have been transmitted to us?   Firstly,  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  a  loud  reaffirmation of  one  of  the  key\r\n\r\ntaglines  from S21 that \"Every Singaporean matters\".   Mr\r\n\r\nGan Kim Yong yesterday said this was not a doctor-patient\r\n\r\nrelationship.    Nor   is   this   even   a    commercial\r\n\r\nrelationship.   He  said,  we are  a  family.   Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot  be  a  corporation that just  recruits  the  best\r\n\r\nmembers and retrenches everybody else.  Even if you  were\r\n\r\nto take a business analogy, this is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamily-owned business.  Yes, we have said repeatedly that\r\n\r\nthere  is no free lunch.  Nobody owes Singapore a living.\r\n\r\nBut I would like to remind all of you that regardless  of\r\n\r\nyour  station in life, all Singaporeans have a  place  at\r\n\r\nthe   family   dinner  table.   This  is  something   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not forgotten.  Mr Low Thia  Khiang,  Mr\r\n\r\nSteve Chia and some of the other Members have accused the\r\n\r\nGovernment   of   being  materialistic,   single-mindedly\r\n\r\nobsessed  with money.  You know, my mother used  to  tell\r\n\r\nus,  \"You  can't live on love and fresh  air.\"   We  need\r\n\r\nmoney  to  buy food to keep body and soul together.   But\r\n\r\nyou  buy food for your family not for the sake of  buying\r\n\r\nfood  but because of love, and because you want  to  keep\r\n\r\nthe family intact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we are very careful with our economy. Yes, we\r\n\r\nwant  to  make a living.  We want to make a good  living.\r\n\r\nBut it is not an end in itself.  It is a means to an end.\r\n\r\nAnd I would like to remind all Singaporeans that when the\r\n\r\nGovernment  says, \"I need to ensure a reasonable  surplus\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of  the year\", it is not for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nkeeping score.  We run a system in which the economy  has\r\n\r\nto  work.   The  Government budget has to be  reasonable.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  need a surplus because without that surplus,  we\r\n\r\ncannot look after the people who may fall behind in  this\r\n\r\nrace  of life.  So, yes, it is a hard-headed approach  to\r\n\r\nlife  and  in  making a living, but it is  one  based  on\r\n\r\nheart,  compassion and love.  I think the  sooner  people\r\n\r\nstop  treating the Government as a separate  agency,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government's surplus is  somehow  money  which\r\n\r\notherwise  would belong to them, the better.  Because  we\r\n\r\nare  all  on the same side.  We are all part of the  same\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another recurrent theme we have heard is - enlarge\r\n\r\nspace  for  individuals.  I hear that, and  I  sympathise\r\n\r\nwith  that.  Yes, we have to stop micromanaging  choices.\r\n\r\nWhat  do  I  mean  by that?  We have this  temptation  to\r\n\r\nmanage, say, manpower planning, that we can look  in  the\r\n\r\ncrystal  ball  and tell you exactly how  many  engineers,\r\n\r\ndoctors and lawyers we need.  You and I know it is not so\r\n\r\nstraightforward.  In the name of distributing talent,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  even  have quotas on ensuring that not too  many  top\r\n\r\npeople enter one or two disciplines.  But, again, in  the\r\n\r\nname of doing that, we affect people's freedom of choice.\r\n\r\nWe  affect,  in  their eyes, the whole  concept  of  free\r\n\r\ncompetition.  Even yesterday, we talked about  the  quota\r\n\r\non women entering medical school.  Let me tell you that I\r\n\r\nam  sympathetic to it, not because I am a  feminist,  but\r\n\r\nbecause of the more important message behind that,  which\r\n\r\nis that at an individual level, we are all of equal worth\r\n\r\nand  that we will compete fairly and squarely for limited\r\n\r\nresources and limited places which are available.  It  is\r\n\r\nabout  reaffirming the primacy of free  choice  and  free\r\n\r\ncompetition in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corollary of increasing space for the individual\r\n\r\nand giving more free choice is that you cannot expect the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to guarantee success for you and say,  \"Look!\r\n\r\nYou  told me to do this course.  And now that I have done\r\n\r\nthis course, you make sure I get a good job, and it is  a\r\n\r\ngood  living.\"   It is like the young student  who  says,\r\n\r\n\"Look!  Since you say art and music is now important, you\r\n\r\nmust  guarantee that when I graduate from the university,\r\n\r\nI  will have a job as a musician or an artist, and I will\r\n\r\nmake  as  much as my engineer colleague.\"  This is  still\r\n\r\nold thinking.  Young Singaporeans need to wake themselves\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no guarantee for success. The role of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  to  give  you as  many  opportunities  as\r\n\r\npossible  to  maximise your interest and  potential,  and\r\n\r\nthen  you take your chances in the game of life,  and  we\r\n\r\nwish  you  all  the best.  There will be  a  safety  net.\r\n\r\nNobody  in Singapore is going to starve, to be without  a\r\n\r\nroof,  to be denied healthcare, or to be deprived of  any\r\n\r\neducational opportunities for his children.   But  beyond\r\n\r\nthat basic, everything else, you have to make a go for it\r\n\r\nyourself.  If you want to dance on a bar-top, some of  us\r\n\r\nwill  fall off that bar-top.  Some people will die  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of liberalising bar-top dancing, not just because\r\n\r\nthey  have  fallen  off the bar-top.  Because  usually  a\r\n\r\nyoung girl, with a short skirt, dancing on a bar-top, may\r\n\r\nattract  some  insults  from  some  other  men,  and  the\r\n\r\nboyfriend starts fighting.  Some people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  die.   Blood  will  be shed for  liberalising  this\r\n\r\npolicy.   While  I  support  the  liberalisation  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy, I also want all of us to be aware that there is a\r\n\r\nprice  to be paid for liberty.  If we are convinced  that\r\n\r\nour society is ready to pay that price, or that price  is\r\n\r\na  necessity, then let us go in, but go in with our  eyes\r\n\r\nwide open.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, Dr Ng Eng Hen, has expounded on the\r\n\r\neducational  issues.   I do not want  to  go  into  that,\r\n\r\nexcept  to  remind Members that the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nis  providing  more  choices.  There  will  be  a  sports\r\n\r\nschool.   There will be greater opportunities for  people\r\n\r\nin art, music and so on.  We will look for your strengths\r\n\r\nrather than your weaknesses, and we will try our best  to\r\n\r\ngive  you marketable, employable skills.  But, again,  do\r\n\r\nnot expect the Ministry to wave away competition.  Do not\r\n\r\nexpect  the Ministry to give equal pay and equal results,\r\n\r\nregardless of talent, regardless of input.  If  you  want\r\n\r\nsuch  a  system, it died a long time ago when the  Berlin\r\n\r\nWall came down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another theme we have heard - re-engage Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  public  life,  give greater franchise.   I  think  Mr\r\n\r\nChandra  Mohan just spoke about that as well.  Mr  Arthur\r\n\r\nFong  talked about a Youth Parliament.  We are not  going\r\n\r\nto  have  a  Youth Parliament, but we are  considering  a\r\n\r\nNational  Youth  Forum  where  there  will  be  a  formal\r\n\r\nplatform for youths to engage themselves and their  minds\r\n\r\non  national  issues, provide them enough information  to\r\n\r\nthink  it through and work out solutions.  Regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhether  their solutions turn out to be superior or  not,\r\n\r\nthat is not the point.  The fact that they are engaged in\r\n\r\nthe process of dealing with national problems and finding\r\n\r\nsolutions, I think, will awaken them and remind them that\r\n\r\nthey  have  an  essential  role to  play  in  Singapore's\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much said about the Government's need\r\n\r\nto   review   its  regulatory  approach  towards   public\r\n\r\nexpression.  Yes, I agree that we need to have  a  system\r\n\r\nwhich   allows   expression  of  diverse   views.    Yes,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have a right to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nheard.   Singaporeans need to develop that  capacity  for\r\n\r\ndialogue to disagree and yet ultimately to agree to  move\r\n\r\nalong  as  a united whole.  We need all this in order  to\r\n\r\nachieve our goals of a creative, entrepreneurial society.\r\n\r\nYes,  all  that is correct.  But let me put in  a  caveat\r\n\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say you want less shackling by OB markers, if\r\n\r\nyou  want  a  less  prescriptive pre-censorship  type  of\r\n\r\nregime,  if you want to be able to say what you  want  to\r\n\r\nsay,  act  out  the  plays you want  to  act,  engage  in\r\n\r\nperforming art that you want to perform, and you  do  not\r\n\r\nwant   us  to  censor  it  beforehand  or  to  tell   you\r\n\r\nbeforehand,  then  you must also be prepared  to  have  a\r\n\r\nsystem in which there are heavy penalties which will kick\r\n\r\nin  if you engage in activities which are inimical to the\r\n\r\nsafety  and  stability of society.  Freedom of expression\r\n\r\nmust  come  with  responsibility.  And  you  cannot  say,\r\n\r\n\"Let's  take  away  defamation laws\", and  suddenly,  the\r\n\r\ndebate  will  be  wonderful and  all  great  truths  will\r\n\r\nemerge.   That is not the way life works.  You want  more\r\n\r\nfreedom,  yes,  there  will  be  more  freedom,  but  the\r\n\r\npenalties must remain in place.  Because, at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe day, the system and Singapore must still continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, in fact, I was pleasantly\r\n\r\nsurprised that there have been moves in some areas.   Let\r\n\r\nme  give you an example.  Since January this year, and  I\r\n\r\nsuspect  most  of us are unaware of it, the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nSocieties  (ROS)  has  implemented  a  pilot  project  to\r\n\r\nregister  certain categories of societies on a fast-track\r\n\r\nbasis.   Under  this  pilot scheme,  societies,  such  as\r\n\r\nalumni  associations, performing arts groups and  reading\r\n\r\nclubs, would only need to fill in a registration form and\r\n\r\nthey  are deemed to be given in-principle approval.  They\r\n\r\ncan proceed to conduct their activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registry of Societies is currently refining this\r\n\r\nfast-track process to make it easier for other  types  of\r\n\r\nsocieties  which pose minimal security considerations  to\r\n\r\nalso register on this fast-track basis.  So for those  of\r\n\r\nyou  who  said you want more freedom to be able  to  form\r\n\r\nyour  own societies, get on with it.  We have.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthis avenue has been there since January\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  year.   However,  in the light  of  the  heightened\r\n\r\nsecurity situation which we are in, I would also have  to\r\n\r\ntell  you  categorically that, if  you  want  to  form  a\r\n\r\nsociety that is of a religious or an ethnic nature, it is\r\n\r\nstill safer that we continue with the normal registration\r\n\r\nprocess  for the time being and I think all of you  would\r\n\r\nagree with me on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give you another example, public entertainment.\r\n\r\nSince  March  2000,  the Police have applied,  what  they\r\n\r\ncall,  a  \"class exemption\" approach to licensing  public\r\n\r\nentertainment.   Under this approach,  certain  types  of\r\n\r\nactivities are exempted from having to apply for a Public\r\n\r\nEntertainment  Licence.   For  instance,  organisers   of\r\n\r\nChinese  opera  or getai no longer need to  apply  for  a\r\n\r\nPublic  Entertainment Licence provided that  they  comply\r\n\r\nwith  certain conditions.  For those of us who have  been\r\n\r\nattending  the Seventh Moon Festival, we will know.   You\r\n\r\nhave  got to pipe down at 10.30 pm.  As long as they stay\r\n\r\nwithin  these guidelines and rules, we exempt  them  from\r\n\r\nhaving  to apply for a Public Entertainment Licence.   So\r\n\r\nyou  can  see that we have made moves.  But we will  make\r\n\r\nmoves cautiously, deliberately in full cognizance of  the\r\n\r\npotential  consequences  and in full  cognizance  of  the\r\n\r\npotential benefits.  That should be our approach in  this\r\n\r\narea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example we heard is, increase the\r\n\r\nstakeholding  of  Singaporeans.   If  you  think  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  Councils, Residents'  Committees,\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Committees  and  Residents'  Associations,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a whole plethora of committees which  we  have\r\n\r\ncreated,  which we keep begging people to  join,  \"Please\r\n\r\nhelp out.  We want to devolve responsibility and decision\r\n\r\nmaking.\"  For those of you who are involved in this  they\r\n\r\nknow  that  it  is  not so easy.  But  we  have  provided\r\n\r\navenues for people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to end with emotional rootedness because, at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the  day,  it is one thing  to  talk  about\r\n\r\nidentity  and ideals.  But we also need to remember  that\r\n\r\nit  is  a  matter of the heart.  As Mr Gan Kim Yong  said\r\n\r\nyesterday,  yes, we have to look for avenues  to  provide\r\n\r\nfor more family time,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamily  opportunities, more avenues for alumni and  other\r\n\r\nsocial  groups  to  get together to support  each  other.\r\n\r\nYes,  we want to have a familiar environment, and I agree\r\n\r\nwith   Mr  Chiam  yesterday.   Yes,  we  must  have  some\r\n\r\nlandmarks which will remind us of our past.  That is  why\r\n\r\nwe  have  set  up things, like the Conservation  Advisory\r\n\r\nPanel,  that  is  why  we engage in  conserving  heritage\r\n\r\nbuildings  and,  last week, we inaugurated  the  Heritage\r\n\r\nTrees  Scheme.   All these are attempts to  preserve  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans emotional signposts and landmarks for us  to\r\n\r\nfall back on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, my take-home message to all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans is that this is an artificial  nation  in  a\r\n\r\nhurry,  built in a very short time.  Let us  not  be  too\r\n\r\nharsh  on  ourselves.  Let us remind ourselves,  however,\r\n\r\nthat  we  only  exist because of an effort,  a  conscious\r\n\r\nexercise  of  will.  And if our younger generation  loses\r\n\r\nthat  will, then we will perish.  So that is why  today's\r\n\r\nMotion is relevant, and that is why I support it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I am quite relieved to tell  you\r\n\r\nfrankly.  I am not 3G for sure, and I have listened  very\r\n\r\ncarefully to the definition for \"3G\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start by setting the issue in some\r\n\r\nperspectives.  Firstly, on the one hand, it has been said\r\n\r\nand  acknowledged that there is a problem.  For  whatever\r\n\r\nreasons,  there  are  Singaporeans  who  have  left,  are\r\n\r\nleaving  or, at least, are thinking of leaving Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  this  has  caused concern and has caused  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to make certain remarks during his National  Day\r\n\r\nRally speech.  Indeed, his remarks have generated a great\r\n\r\ndeal   of   debate   and  some  strong   responses   from\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  especially those who are living  overseas.\r\n\r\nSome  of  these  remarks or responses can  be  considered\r\n\r\nquite emotional and whether or not they are justified  in\r\n\r\ntheir reaction is beside the point.  What is important is\r\n\r\nto understand why they feel that way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the other hand, these few weeks have\r\n\r\nreally witnessed quite a revolution in our country.   And\r\n\r\nalmost  on  a  daily  basis,  we  read  about  some   new\r\n\r\nrecommendations made by the Economic Review Committee  as\r\n\r\nwell as the Remaking Singapore Committee.  And they cover\r\n\r\njust  about  everything  and anything  ranging  from  our\r\n\r\neconomy to education, to laws and regulations as well  as\r\n\r\nsports, and so on.  And some of these recommendations are\r\n\r\nquite  radical, recognising that today's world cannot  be\r\n\r\nremodelled based on yesterday's memories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it would be fair to say that it is not as if the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not doing anything.  On the  contrary,  a\r\n\r\ngreat  number of people, as has been confirmed, had  been\r\n\r\ninvolved in trying to think of ways and means to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  quality of life in Singapore.  So as we  talk  about\r\n\r\nhow  to review thoroughly our programmes and policies,  I\r\n\r\ndo believe that process is well underway.  Perhaps, there\r\n\r\nshould  be some focus, and this has been greatly  debated\r\n\r\nupon,  on  this,  what you call, sense  of  belonging  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  Singapore and how to create  the  bonds\r\n\r\nwithin this great family about us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we should start by looking at mindsets and\r\n\r\nattitudes, I think, not only of the Government but indeed\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  ourselves.  We should re-examine  our  own\r\n\r\nattitudes  towards Government, towards our  country,  and\r\n\r\nmaybe  start  by not complaining so much.  I  think  both\r\n\r\nsides, for sure, have to come together.  Both sides  have\r\n\r\ngot to be part of the solution together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sense of belonging, or a lack of it, has two\r\n\r\naspects  - the push factors as well as the pull  factors.\r\n\r\nAnd,  invariably, these factors always come into play  as\r\n\r\none  considers or exits from a relationship, be it  one's\r\n\r\njob, family, friends, social networks or country.  One of\r\n\r\nthe  most  major  push factors must be  this  feeling  of\r\n\r\nalienation.   There is no doubt about it that  we  are  a\r\n\r\nhard-driving and yet a high-achieving nation.   There  is\r\n\r\nnothing  wrong with it.  The strategy that has helped  to\r\n\r\nproduce  this  state is correct and should be  continued.\r\n\r\nBut this strategy, this process, also produces on the one\r\n\r\nhand the high achievers whom we want because they are the\r\n\r\ndrivers  and,  on the other hand, people  or  groups  who\r\n\r\nmight   just   feel   marginalised,  disenfranchised   or\r\n\r\ndisenchanted, as had been described.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, really, our challenge is to develop policies and\r\n\r\nprogrammes which will accommodate this diverse  range  of\r\n\r\nexpectations and aspirations, ranging from high  rewards,\r\n\r\nphilosophical  expressions as well  as  just  mere  basic\r\n\r\nneeds.  We, therefore, need to create an environment  and\r\n\r\nstrive to create even a better environment which does not\r\n\r\nlabel  people and which makes everybody feel  needed  and\r\n\r\nwelcomed.  That way, we avoid that feeling of alienation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is of course the most ideal situation to\r\n\r\nachieve  and,  needless to say, we  must  always  try  to\r\n\r\nachieve   it.   Everyone  counts  and  everyone  matters,\r\n\r\nwhatever their abilities and disabilities, whatever  they\r\n\r\nhave  done or not have done.  We must welcome,  as  done,\r\n\r\nall  members  of our family, because they belong  to  our\r\n\r\nfamily.   We should also embrace those who, for  whatever\r\n\r\nreasons,  have left Singapore, and we must maintain  good\r\n\r\nrelationships and good ties with them because  we  are  a\r\n\r\nsmall  country.  This way, we enlarge our virtual family.\r\n\r\nAnd, it is an asset.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are good reasons why Singaporeans choose\r\n\r\nsometimes  to  leave  the country - because  of  personal\r\n\r\nreasons,  opportunities or survival, like in the business\r\n\r\nworld.  Businesses may take flight to low-cost regimes in\r\n\r\norder  to stay competitive.  This way, we should  applaud\r\n\r\nand  encourage them, because they have moved on,  seeking\r\n\r\nthat proverbial cheese, so to speak.  This is not to  say\r\n\r\nthat  we shall quit and seek cheese elsewhere because  we\r\n\r\nhave  got plenty of cheese in Singapore and we know  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is constantly trying  to  increase  that\r\n\r\ncheese  supply.  What I am just trying to say is that  we\r\n\r\nshould   embrace  all  Singaporeans  who  have  left   us\r\n\r\ntemporarily  or  permanently, and include  them  in  this\r\n\r\nfamily  of  ours.  And I would add that  we  should  also\r\n\r\ninclude  new members or foreign talent, because  if  they\r\n\r\nwant  to,  are  willing to and are able  to  improve  our\r\n\r\nlives, why not?  Why should we criticise them?  We should\r\n\r\nwelcome  them  because  they  are  part  of  this  global\r\n\r\nintellectual capital - this is 3G - which is  so  mobile,\r\n\r\nthey  go  to where they are wanted, they stay where  they\r\n\r\nare well treated and valued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my recent visit to the US. I am\r\n\r\nreminded of how patriotic that country is.  The Americans\r\n\r\nare  so  proud of themselves.  They loudly proclaim  they\r\n\r\nare Americans, whatever their country of origin might be.\r\n\r\nThe  minute they receive their green cards, they announce\r\n\r\nthat  they are Americans.  Why is this so?  We  all  know\r\n\r\nthat  America is a very rich and prosperous country.   It\r\n\r\nis  lauded  as the land of opportunity.  It is proclaimed\r\n\r\nas  the  champion of human rights as well  as  democracy.\r\n\r\nBut  so  is  Singapore.  Singapore is a highly successful\r\n\r\ncountry,  and there are a good number of reasons  why  we\r\n\r\nshould  also  be proud and loudly proclaim  ourselves  as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the Americans have a great symbol of\r\n\r\ntheir country which they can relate to, and this is their\r\n\r\nflag.   Americans  proudly display their  flag  on  every\r\n\r\noccasion, not only on national occasions, not only during\r\n\r\ncommunity gatherings, but also during family as  well  as\r\n\r\nbusiness  gatherings.   Many  Americans  fly  their  flag\r\n\r\nthroughout the year in their homes and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  offices, not only on Independence Day.   And  they\r\n\r\nalso  wear  their flag literally - on hats,  clothes,  T-shirts,  mini-skirts, hot pants, mugs and so on.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  disrespectful at all.  In fact, the flag is a strong\r\n\r\nsymbol of freedom, democracy, pride in their country,  as\r\n\r\nwell as loyalty to the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the strength of a country, or creed, lives\r\n\r\nvery  much in the true sense of loyalty it can arouse  in\r\n\r\nthe  hearts of its people.  And, therefore, the value  of\r\n\r\nthe  flag  is  so powerful in uniting a country  and  its\r\n\r\npeople,  making them believe in the country and  what  it\r\n\r\nstands  for, I think we should develop a great  sense  of\r\n\r\nloyalty  for  our country.  In that way, we promote  that\r\n\r\nsense of belonging to our country as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this sense of loyalty or a sense of belonging\r\n\r\nmust also be founded in the value of the family, and this\r\n\r\nhas  been  articulated  by a lot  of  hon.  Members  here\r\n\r\nbecause,  however  the world changes, the  power  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily  remains in shaping and nurturing the citizens  of\r\n\r\ntomorrow.   It  is  within this family relationship  that\r\n\r\nvalues  as diverse as love, responsibility, communication\r\n\r\nand  respect for the authority gets forged.  It is within\r\n\r\nthe family that we learn about how to live to the fullest\r\n\r\nof  our  potential,  how to do the right  things  and  do\r\n\r\nthings right as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can spend more time and more efforts in\r\n\r\ndeveloping   the  family  and  developing  policies   and\r\n\r\nprogrammes  which are much more pro-family.  Already,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  number of factors against us - the smallness  of\r\n\r\nour  family  unit,  the  growing number  of  singles  and\r\n\r\nchildless couples.  So I think it is worth our  while  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to really put in all our efforts in making  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping pro-family policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also quite a few lessons which can be\r\n\r\nlearnt - or I learned it - from Rudy Guiliani, who is the\r\n\r\nex-Mayor of New York City.  He was the keynote speaker at\r\n\r\na recent event which I attended, and he was talking about\r\n\r\nManaging  a  Crisis.   And  it was  not  just  about  the\r\n\r\nSeptember   11   crisis.   He  was  talking   about   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties he faced when he first\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecame the Mayor of New York and how difficult it was for\r\n\r\nhim to galvanise New Yorkers together.  So he carried out\r\n\r\na survey and was dismayed to find that 64% of New Yorkers\r\n\r\nwould rather quit New York, if given the chance.  That is\r\n\r\na  very  high  percentage.  New York is one of  the  most\r\n\r\nsuccessful  cities  in  the world  in  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\nsuccessful  countries in the world.  Yet, they  too  have\r\n\r\ntheir  fair share of potential quitters.  So, we are  not\r\n\r\nin this alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Guiliani changed that to a large extent. What he\r\n\r\ndid  was  to establish the reasons as to why New  Yorkers\r\n\r\nwere  unhappy.  Not surprisingly, one of the main reasons\r\n\r\nis  the  high  rate of crime in New York.  Just  imagine,\r\n\r\nthere  is an official list of tips on \"How not  to  be  a\r\n\r\nvictim  of crime\" in New York!  One of it is not to  talk\r\n\r\nto  strangers, and the other is not to have  eye  contact\r\n\r\nwith anyone.  This is much worse than our bo-chap policy;\r\n\r\nit is bo-chap policy with fear, ie, walk around with your\r\n\r\neyes closed!  What Mr Guiliani did after identifying  the\r\n\r\nproblems  was really addressing the problems  with  great\r\n\r\nvigour.   He  developed  a  strategy,  communicated   the\r\n\r\nstrategy,  fought  the  battles  with  great  focus   and\r\n\r\ncommitment  and,  as  he  said,  with  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\noptimism.  That way, he succeeded in achieving  what  was\r\n\r\nthought to be impossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we, too, can start by looking at the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  Singaporeans are unhappy, and much of it has already\r\n\r\nbeen  articulated.  I say it again: we are a country with\r\n\r\na low rate of crime.  We are a city which is clean, safe,\r\n\r\nefficient  as  well  as affluent.  We  have  great  food.\r\n\r\nPeople  are  telling us that we are fun and an  enjoyable\r\n\r\nplace to live in, and yet Singaporeans are unhappy.   Why\r\n\r\nis   this  so?   A  lot  of  reasons  have  already  been\r\n\r\narticulated by many hon. Members here, but I  would  like\r\n\r\nto dwell on three.  Is it due to our inherent complaining\r\n\r\nnature,  to start with?  Or is it due to what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said, that we are a bo-chap, couldn't-care-less\r\n\r\nsociety?  Or are we a kiasu society as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these attitudes are not desirable and, indeed,\r\n\r\nthey  should  be  reversed.  They should be  replaced  by\r\n\r\nvalues  which  will make us a much happier society.   So,\r\n\r\ninstead of being kiasu, I think we too should have a good\r\n\r\ndose  of optimism, because it is in optimism that we  see\r\n\r\nsolutions, and pessimism simply obscures solutions,  even\r\n\r\nas  they  stare us in our faces.  I think we should  also\r\n\r\nstop  complaining  and  become a much  more  self-reliant\r\n\r\nsociety.   That way, we take greater pride in  our  work.\r\n\r\nThat  way, we become much more entrepreneurial  as  well.\r\n\r\nAs  for bo-chap, I think that is terrible.  We must chap.\r\n\r\nWe  must care.  That way, we will have a more caring  and\r\n\r\nmore  gracious  society, not only for ourselves  but  for\r\n\r\neverybody  else as well, because democracy  is  not  just\r\n\r\nabout rights, it is also about respect and responsibility\r\n\r\nfor others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I would like to conclude by saying\r\n\r\nthat  I  do  believe that as we remake  Singapore,  these\r\n\r\nvalues    -    of    inclusiveness,   loyalty,    family,\r\n\r\nresponsibility and optimism - get woven into our policies\r\n\r\nand programmes.\r\n\r\n<br>3.28 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I set the\r\n\r\ndebate in context by sketching out the major issues which\r\n\r\nare behind this debate about stayers and quitters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are really talking about two distinct but related\r\n\r\nissues  here.   One, rooting Singaporeans emotionally  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,   in  other  words,  developing   a   national\r\n\r\nidentity,  patriotism, a sense of belonging, a  sense  of\r\n\r\npride  in being a Singaporean.  Two, getting Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  stay  physically in Singapore rather than emigrating,\r\n\r\nworking or living overseas.  The first is a crucial long-term issue; the second is an important medium-term one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rooting citizens is a critical but very difficult\r\n\r\ntask  for many new countries, especially those which have\r\n\r\nnot  been born as nations to start off with.  A Professor\r\n\r\nof Government in Harvard, Rupert Emerson,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngave  a definition of a nation which is relevant to this,\r\n\r\nand I quote him:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A single people, traditionally fixed on a well-defined territory, speaking the same language and\r\n\r\npreferably   a   language  all  its  own,  possessing   a\r\n\r\ndistinctive culture, and shaped to a common mould by many\r\n\r\ngenerations of shared historical experience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are many ingredients - a single people,\r\n\r\nwell-defined  territory, same language and  preferably  a\r\n\r\nlanguage  of  its own, possessing a distinctive  culture,\r\n\r\nand  shaped  to  a  common mould by many  generations  of\r\n\r\nshared  historical experience.  This definition by  Prof.\r\n\r\nRupert Emerson and was quoted by Prof. Robert Tilman from\r\n\r\nthe  University of North Carolina who wrote a book  about\r\n\r\n\"South  East  Asia  and  the  Enemy  Beyond\"  which   was\r\n\r\npublished in 1987.  Prof. Tilman also pointed out that by\r\n\r\nthis  definition, Thailand is the only country  in  South\r\n\r\nEast  Asia which is a nation, and even then, only if  the\r\n\r\nThai Muslims in the South are excluded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All new countries which are not born nations have\r\n\r\nthis  problem.   Myanmar, with its  two  dozen  different\r\n\r\ntribes;  Indonesia,  with its many  different  races  and\r\n\r\nlanguages, spread over 10,000 or more islands;  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwith  Malays, Indians, Chinese and others.   If  we  look\r\n\r\nbeyond  South  East  Asia, India has the  same  issue  of\r\n\r\nidentity, because India was never one country before  the\r\n\r\nRaj.  And their separate local identities which had to be\r\n\r\nblended  together and harmonised as one Indian  identity.\r\n\r\nOn  top of which, they had their religious divide between\r\n\r\nthe  Hindus  and the Muslims, because India has  a  large\r\n\r\nIslamic minority - 100 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or take Pakistan. All Muslims, but West Pakistan\r\n\r\nwas  different from East Pakistan.  The Punjabis, Sindhis\r\n\r\nand  others  in  West  Pakistan are  different  from  the\r\n\r\nBengalis  in  the East, and there was a civil  war  after\r\n\r\nwhich  Bangladesh was born, and Pakistan was  split  into\r\n\r\r\ntwo.   So many countries have this problem, and Singapore\r\n\r\ntoo.   If you examine the definition, we did not get born\r\n\r\nas a nation either.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, how do you root people to the country?\r\n\r\nThat is the challenge.  What\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  this  Government done to do that?  We have  built  a\r\n\r\nmeritocratic, multi-racial society.  We have given  every\r\n\r\ncitizen  a  stake  in Singapore. Through home  ownership,\r\n\r\nthrough HDB, 90% of Singaporeans now own their homes.  We\r\n\r\nhave  generated economic growth and prosperity, and given\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean  a share in Singapore's  success.   We\r\n\r\nemphasise  education  in national schools,  to  inculcate\r\n\r\nvalues, to imbue students with knowledge of their  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  and also to equip them with skills so  that  they\r\n\r\ncan  make  a  living  for themselves.   Therefore,  today\r\n\r\nSingapore is a success, and we have a much stronger sense\r\n\r\nof  nationhood today than we did in 1965.  So when Mr Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang made a rousing speech in Chinese saying that\r\n\r\nit  is all the Government's fault, it sounds good but  it\r\n\r\nis not so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, which is not rooting\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, but the question of getting Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nphysically  stay  and  work here, is slightly  different.\r\n\r\nThere  was  no  issue  of  Singaporeans  leaving  in  the\r\n\r\nprevious generation. The question never arose because for\r\n\r\nthat  generation, which country to belong to  was  not  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of choice. Either they were born in Singapore  or\r\n\r\nthey  had come here out of economic necessity.   Many  of\r\n\r\nthem  did  not speak English and could not easily  uproot\r\n\r\nthemselves  and their families and go off to  some  other\r\n\r\ncountry.   And even if they could have gone,  they  would\r\n\r\nhave  felt  out of place, uncomfortable and yearning  for\r\n\r\nsomething more like home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, it is different. Today, Singa-poreans\r\n\r\nhave  many opportunities. There is globalisation.   Other\r\n\r\neconomies  have opened up.  There is a global market  for\r\n\r\ntalent.  Many  countries now emphasise  talent  and  open\r\n\r\ntheir doors to welcome people who have skills and talent.\r\n\r\nBecause   we   have   given   them   education,   because\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  speak  English,  because  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nprosperous,  so  if they want to move, many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill be welcomed in many places. So there is a choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pattern of emigration has changed. In the 70s\r\n\r\nand  80s,  we used to worry about people who would  leave\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  mature adults in their 30s and 40s.  They have  grown\r\n\r\nup,  they  have started working, they have a  family  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  bought a house.  Now, they  are  thinking  of\r\n\r\nselling   their   house,  cashing  out,  bringing   their\r\n\r\nfamilies, and moving away to Canada or somewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are worrying about students going\r\n\r\noverseas, studying overseas and not returning.  They have\r\n\r\nfound  a  job overseas. They are staying on.   It  is  so\r\n\r\nexciting and they put off coming back till another  time.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  real  problem.  We had  a  group  of  overseas\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  came  to  brief  the  Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  a  few months ago from Hong Kong, Stanford  in\r\n\r\nSan  Francisco, and Harvard and MIT in Boston.  They told\r\n\r\nus  that  they had done an informal survey of  themselves\r\n\r\nand  their  predecessors  over the  last  10  years,  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean students who had attended Stanford,  Harvard,\r\n\r\nand  MIT.  What had happened to them?  How many had  come\r\n\r\nback?  They said that, up to today, only about half  have\r\n\r\ncome  back, and that would have included the students  on\r\n\r\nscholarship.   So many students are going overseas,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are going overseas, and  we  have  to  ask:\r\n\r\nwill we have a problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acknowledge that not all Singaporeans will stay\r\n\r\nhere in a globalised world. Just as we welcome foreigners\r\n\r\nto  come  to  Singapore,  so too other  countries  invite\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  and some will go. Apart from  that,  there\r\n\r\nwould be reasons why Singaporeans need to go overseas  to\r\n\r\nwork,  to learn, to be posted, to do a job.  In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nwould encourage Singaporeans who have this opportunity to\r\n\r\ngo  abroad,  to  take it up, to learn  about  the  world,\r\n\r\nexpand your horizons.  But, at the same time, I hope that\r\n\r\nwhen  Singaporeans are overseas, they will maintain their\r\n\r\nlinks  back home and after spending their time  overseas,\r\n\r\nand after some time, come back to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot afford to lose too many people overseas,\r\n\r\nwhether  they are emotionally quitting or not.  It  could\r\n\r\nbe, as one of the MPs said yesterday, \"sheng zai si\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfang,  xin  huai zu guo\".  If everybody is  north,  east,\r\n\r\nsouth  and west of Singapore and there is nobody  in  the\r\n\r\ncentre, then the centre is going to have a problem, which\r\n\r\nis  like  Ireland which, for centuries, sent millions  of\r\n\r\npeople  overseas to the English-speaking world - America,\r\n\r\nBritain,  Australia,  New Zealand, Canada.   Because  the\r\n\r\nhome  country  was poor, and there were no opportunities,\r\n\r\nthey  left.  There  are far bigger communities  of  Irish\r\n\r\nprospering  overseas  than  there  are  Irish  living  in\r\n\r\nIreland.   The  home  country stayed poor,  the  daughter\r\n\r\ncommunities abroad prospered.  It is only in the last  20\r\n\r\nyears, as Ireland, in the EU and benefiting from EU  aid,\r\n\r\nstarted  taking  off, that now Irish are  returning,  and\r\n\r\nIreland has net immigration for the first time in a  very\r\n\r\nlong  time  in  its  history.  And  that  can  happen  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PRC is in a different position. They have 1.2\r\n\r\nbillion  people, many, many talented ones, and they  have\r\n\r\nbeen sending students overseas in big numbers - 20,000  a\r\n\r\nyear, and an estimated 380,000 since they opened up about\r\n\r\n20 years ago.  So far, only one-third have returned.  But\r\n\r\nthey  are  still  allowing students to go abroad  because\r\n\r\nthey  need the students to go to learn, and some to  come\r\n\r\nback and bring back the technology, the knowledge of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  that  instinct and feel for how modern  economies\r\n\r\nand modern societies work, to modernise China and take it\r\n\r\nforward.  Not only are they allowing the students to  go,\r\n\r\nthey  are facilitating the students to go. Because to  go\r\n\r\nto  America to study, you need a bank guarantee to get  a\r\n\r\nstudent  visa.  And a Chinese student from  China  cannot\r\n\r\nget  a  US$  bank  guarantee.   But  the  Government  has\r\n\r\ninstructed the banks in China to give US$ bank guarantees\r\n\r\nto Chinese students to go overseas, to America, to study.\r\n\r\nOnly  one-third will come back, and they are prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept  that.   But if that happens to Singapore,  if  we\r\n\r\nsend 20,000 a year overseas and only one-third come back,\r\n\r\nwe will not be Singapore.  Therefore, we cannot afford to\r\n\r\nlose too many. We must keep a hard core in Singapore  who\r\n\r\nwill  make  Singapore  work, as  Dr  Vivian  Balakrishnan\r\n\r\npointed out just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we acknowledge that the Singapore\r\n\r\ndiaspora  overseas is growing.  I do not know  how  many,\r\n\r\nmaybe  100,000 overseas now. We have to keep  links  with\r\n\r\nthis growing diaspora and make the most of them, tap them\r\n\r\nfor  what they know of the world, of the countries  which\r\n\r\nthey  are in, tap them for their networks, make  them  be\r\n\r\npart  of  the Singapore family spread abroad. Of  course,\r\n\r\nwhile  we  keep in touch with those who are overseas,  we\r\n\r\nmust look after those who have not left.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more should the Government do to root\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  here?  The MPs have given many constructive\r\n\r\nideas  on  how to improve policies and how to  strengthen\r\n\r\nour  sense of belonging. The Government will consider all\r\n\r\nof them, and in wherever they are workable and practical.\r\n\r\nMr  Hawazi  and  Dr  Ng  Eng Hen have  responded  on  the\r\n\r\neducation  issues, on how we have a good system,  but  we\r\n\r\ncan  improve it.  And particularly, I think  we  have  to\r\n\r\ndeal with the specific difficulties which caused this  to\r\n\r\nbe   one   of   the  push  factors,  which  caused   some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to leave the country.  We also have to think\r\n\r\nabout  our  overall  approach to  engaging  citizens  and\r\n\r\ninvolving  those  who  want to be part  of  the  national\r\n\r\ndebate.   For  that,  we  have  the  Remaking   Singapore\r\n\r\nCommittee which Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has been  chairing\r\n\r\nand which he told you about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to engage the energies of our citizens.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  say  they are not quite  satisfied  because\r\n\r\nthey do not have enough say in what goes on in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  think  we  can create more say but, most important  of\r\n\r\nall, we will have to be realistic about it.  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncan  have  more say here in Singapore than they can  have\r\n\r\nanywhere else.  If you go to China and you want to change\r\n\r\nthe  system,  it  will take you several generations,  and\r\n\r\nyour  great-grandson may succeed.  If you go  to  America\r\n\r\nand you want to change the system, it is not so easy.  It\r\n\r\nis   a  very  complicated  and  large  society.   But  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, if you have an idea, a dream, something  which\r\n\r\nyou want to achieve, you can make a difference.  It is  3\r\n\r\nmillion  people.   However modest  your  intentions,  you\r\n\r\ncannot hide your light under a bushel,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit  will be seen and if it makes sense, it will be  taken\r\n\r\nup and implemented.  So in Singapore, we can do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One idea which we have developed, arising out of the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review Committee's experience with the students\r\n\r\nand the Singaporeans overseas, is to set up what we would\r\n\r\nlike to call the \"Majulah Connection\".  Our exercise with\r\n\r\nthe  students  in  America  and  Hong  Kong  involved,  I\r\n\r\nsuppose,  a  few dozen enthusiastic Singaporeans  working\r\n\r\noverseas,   activating  their  friends  and   colleagues,\r\n\r\nmeeting late at night, discussing over the Internet. They\r\n\r\ncalled themselves the Singapore Overseas Network (SON).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we find that it is working, we would like\r\n\r\nto  institutionalise  this and  set  up  what  they  have\r\n\r\ndecided to call the \"Majulah Connection\".  The vision  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  \"Majulah  Connection\" to be a  global  business\r\n\r\nnetwork  of overseas Singaporeans.  It will also  include\r\n\r\nthe  friends  of  Singapore, which means expatriates  who\r\n\r\nused  to  work  here  and  foreign  businessmen  who  are\r\n\r\nfriendly  to and want to help Singapore.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwill also participate as a member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are likely to start it off in seven cities where\r\n\r\nthere  are  many Singaporeans working - in Beijing,  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  London,  New  York,  San Francisco,  Shanghai  and\r\n\r\nSydney.   We  will leverage and build upon  the  existing\r\n\r\nSingapore   Clubs.  Our  idea  will  be   to   facilitate\r\n\r\nnetworking and interactions among the members.   We  will\r\n\r\norganise  events  and  activities,  including  an  annual\r\n\r\nhomecoming event here.  Through the network, we  hope  we\r\n\r\nwill  generate  business opportunities, share  ideas  and\r\n\r\nknowledge    and    help    Singapore    companies     to\r\n\r\ninternationalise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effort was a spontaneous one. Mr Khaw Boon Wan\r\n\r\nsuggested trying it, and I agreed.  It was a success.  It\r\n\r\ndemonstrated that it is both feasible and also worthwhile\r\n\r\nand    valuable   to   maintain   links   with   overseas\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   It  also  shows that  for  many  overseas\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, their hearts are still with Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at the same time, I would like to sound a note\r\n\r\nof caution or realism.  There\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  a limit to how far modifying policies will solve  our\r\n\r\nproblem of rootedness, for several reasons.  First,  when\r\n\r\nwe  modify policies, there are trade-offs.  For  example,\r\n\r\nin  education, even from the debate, you will  know  that\r\n\r\nthere  were  those  MPs who wanted  more  things  in  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  such  as National Education, Moral  Education\r\n\r\nand  Civics, and there are those who want less things  in\r\n\r\nthe   curriculum,  including  less  mother  tongue,  less\r\n\r\nstress.   And we have to make a choice. There are  trade-offs  to make in the balance.  So, we cannot satisfy  all\r\n\r\nrequests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we cannot view all policies from the angle\r\n\r\nof how they will affect Singaporeans' commitment; will it\r\n\r\ncause  some  people to be unhappy; and if  they  are  not\r\n\r\nhappy, will they leave?  In other words, humour me, or  I\r\n\r\nquit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Khalis, yesterday, gave two vivid examples\r\n\r\nof  meet-the-people session cases, constituents  who  had\r\n\r\npersonal  problems,  and  because  they  could  not   get\r\n\r\nsatisfaction from their MP, threatened to go.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  how he dealt with them.  He must be a very  skilful\r\n\r\nand  diplomatic MP by now.  But those are just  the  most\r\n\r\nextreme examples of this problem.  There are many  issues\r\n\r\nwhich we have to deal with.  We have to discuss them.  We\r\n\r\nhave to consult.  We have to involve people.  We have  to\r\n\r\ntake  views.   At the end of which we have to decide what\r\n\r\nwe have to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens then? Ideally, most people will agree\r\n\r\nwith the decision.  But if some do not, then if you are a\r\n\r\nSingaporean,  you  should stay on and fight,  argue  your\r\n\r\ncase and persuade more people to believe you, and one day\r\n\r\nchange  the  policy, not opt out and leave.   Because  no\r\n\r\npolicy  is  set  in  stone forever,  no  consensus  lasts\r\n\r\npermanently.  And if you think the Government  is  wrong,\r\n\r\nargue it, pursue it, persuade others of it, take it up in\r\n\r\nelections.  That is what a good Singaporean will do, even\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Members.  Even Mr J  B  Jeyaretnam  will\r\n\r\ncontinue doing that, even though I think, in many  cases,\r\n\r\nhe is doing the wrong thing, but he believes in it and he\r\n\r\nwill fight for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of rootedness is much deeper than having\r\n\r\nfavourable policies.  I point out one observation by Chen\r\n\r\nHwai  Liang in the Lianhe Zaobao this morning.   In  this\r\n\r\ndebate, there has been a clear difference in the views of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  educated MPs and the English educated  MPs.\r\n\r\nBoth made the same analysis of the problem of rootedness.\r\n\r\nBut  both came to diametrically opposite recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese  educated MPs wanted more  moral  education,\r\n\r\nConfucian  values  and  such  approaches.   The   English\r\n\r\neducated MPs wanted more freedom of choice.  Therein lies\r\n\r\na  profound truth about Singapore society.  And the  fact\r\n\r\nthat this was noted by a Chinese journalist in the Zaobao\r\n\r\nis  a  further  confirmation that that is  how  Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety is.  So it is not an issue of policies.  It is an\r\n\r\nissue of rootedness, of identification, of deep values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do people want to stay in a country or in\r\n\r\nSingapore, whether he is emotionally committed or whether\r\n\r\nhe  is  physically  here?  I think  there  are  different\r\n\r\nlevels  to  this.  One level is rational  reasons.   They\r\n\r\nmake  a  cost benefit calculation, it comes out positive.\r\n\r\nWe  can look for the rational reasons why it makes  sense\r\n\r\nto  be  here, and then we can say, well, there is a  good\r\n\r\nliving,  I  have a chance, my children have a chance.   I\r\n\r\ncan  afford  a car or I cannot afford a car.   Check  the\r\n\r\nbottom  line, and it all adds up.  And, indeed,  rational\r\n\r\nreasons  are relevant, because if conditions  are  really\r\n\r\nhard and life is miserable, if the family is starving and\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  future in the country,  then  people  will\r\n\r\nleave, ideals, loyalty or patriotism notwithstanding. But\r\n\r\nrational  calculations alone can only make  fair  weather\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is: do we have a moral obligation\r\n\r\nto  others?  We cannot leave.  Why?  Because we  grew  up\r\n\r\nhere.   We drew sustenance from this society.  We  gained\r\n\r\nthe  opportunities to advance ourselves, and to have  the\r\n\r\neducation and skills and the marketability to move and to\r\n\r\nopt out.  Had we been born in almost any other country in\r\n\r\nAsia,  we  would not have enjoyed the same  opportunities\r\n\r\nand  our lives would have been quite different.  You  can\r\n\r\nbe  very talented.  If you are in some inner province  in\r\n\r\nChina or somewhere\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeep  in  Indochina, or elsewhere in South East  Asia,  I\r\n\r\nthink you would not have the opportunities that you  have\r\n\r\nhad.   You have made it.  This society has made you  what\r\n\r\nyou are.   It has given you what you have.  Therefore, we\r\n\r\nhave  an  obligation to the country and to the system  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  back  to  the society,  and  to  help  others\r\n\r\nsucceed as we have done.  It is a rational argument in  a\r\n\r\nway,  but  it is an altruistic argument.  It is  also  an\r\n\r\nabstract argument, which every individual has to consider\r\n\r\nhow it applies to himself.  Do I or do I not feel that  I\r\n\r\nowe  Singapore this?  Or can I say, \"Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nNow, I am off.  Good luck to you.\"  I think we would like\r\n\r\nto  bring  up Singaporeans who feel some moral  sense  of\r\n\r\npride when they look at themselves in the morning in  the\r\n\r\nmirror and say, \"Yes, I have not let others down.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the third and deepest level of motivation for\r\n\r\nstaying  are  the  emotional  ties   -  the  family,  the\r\n\r\nfriends, the places where you grew up, the memories, both\r\n\r\nindividual  and shared, of things you have  done,  things\r\n\r\nwhich  your  society has experienced  together,  or  even\r\n\r\nthings  which  earlier generations of your  society  have\r\n\r\nexperienced together.  This is the fundamental glue which\r\n\r\nbinds  a people together  -  a deep emotional commitment.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  is  the  fundamental  problem  for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  our  short history and also because  of  our\r\n\r\nethnic diversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare Singapore with other societies with long\r\n\r\nhistories  and strong senses of commitment and belonging.\r\n\r\nTake  a  Japanese  -   maybe 3,000 years  since  the  sun\r\n\r\ngoddess  -  Amaterasu.  He is a Japanese wherever he goes\r\n\r\nin  the world, the way he speaks, dresses, his attitudes,\r\n\r\nhe bears a life-long permanent imprint.  And if he leaves\r\n\r\nJapan  permanently, he will feel deep  pain  cutting  his\r\n\r\nties  with all that it means to be Japanese, and all  the\r\n\r\nthings which he holds dear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look at the Jews in Israel and all over the\r\n\r\nworld  with their powerful sense of shared history and  a\r\n\r\ncommon  future, going back to Moses and the  Exodus,  the\r\n\r\nBooks of the Torah, the Holocaust.  If you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  a Jew, you will never forget it.  And if there is  a\r\n\r\nproblem with another Jew somewhere else in the world, you\r\n\r\nfeel a sense of obligation and you will be there to help,\r\n\r\nif  necessary,  with your life.  So, when  they  have  an\r\n\r\nemergency   and  they  press  the  button  to   mount   a\r\n\r\nmobilisation, Israelis from all over the world go back to\r\n\r\nIsrael in order to fight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have mobilisation exercises, but that is a test.\r\n\r\nIf the mobilisation is for real, if we ever go to war and\r\n\r\npress  the button, will people come back, or will  people\r\n\r\nleave?   But they have the Torah.  They have 5,000 years.\r\n\r\nThey  have  Masada.   When they dedicate  their  national\r\n\r\nservicemen,  they bring their tank corps recruits  up  to\r\n\r\nMasada and they hold a night-time ceremony with lamps and\r\n\r\npresent   rifles,  and  you  remember  Masada   and   the\r\n\r\nsacrifices.  When we have national servicemen  dedication\r\n\r\nceremonies, we hold it in our camps.  We spread a blanket\r\n\r\nover  the  table,  we put out some lamps.   What  is  the\r\n\r\nresonance?   It is what we can do.  But it is  not  5,000\r\n\r\nyears old.  So, it is different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or you take the Palestinian Arabs - refugee camps\r\n\r\nscattered  all  over  the  Middle  East,  Jordan,  Syria,\r\n\r\nLebanon and the Gulf  -  scattered more than a generation\r\n\r\nbut  determined to go back to Palestine  - not  the  West\r\n\r\nBank of today, but the Palestine as they remembered it in\r\n\r\n1947  before they were chased out when Israel was  formed\r\n\r\nin  the  first Arab-Israeli war  -  to villages which  no\r\n\r\nlonger   exist.   But  that  ideal,  that   drive,   that\r\n\r\ndetermination, that hatred for their enemies, that  holds\r\n\r\nthem together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are all of 37 years old.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  our loyalty has to be based  not  on  race,\r\n\r\nlanguage   or  religion,  which  are  the  most  powerful\r\n\r\nloyalties, but on shared ideals and shared history.  That\r\n\r\ntakes  time.   We have history before independence,  yes.\r\n\r\nBut  they were separate histories before independence   - multiple   histories.    The   Malays   identified   with\r\n\r\nnationalist  movements in Indonesia and  Malaya.   Before\r\n\r\nthe  war, and even after the war before independence,  it\r\n\r\nwas not uncommon to see pictures of Sukarno and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHatta  -  Sukarno was the first Indonesian President  and\r\n\r\nHatta  was another freedom fighter  -   hung on the  wall\r\n\r\nof  honour in the homes of those who originated from  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  islands.  They may be Javanese,  Boyanese  or\r\n\r\nSumatran,  but  they would have pictures of  Sukarno  and\r\n\r\nHatta.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi told me this. He lived in a pondok in\r\n\r\nCrawford area.  And even as he was growing up in the 50s,\r\n\r\nin the hall of honour, there were pictures of Sukarno and\r\n\r\nHatta.  They looked upon the brave Indonesians as  heroes\r\n\r\nand  freedom fighters and idolised them.  Even the  Malay\r\n\r\nintelligentsia who had no roots in the Indonesian islands\r\n\r\nlooked upon them as leaders who should be emulated.   And\r\n\r\nit is not surprising, because these were freedom fighters\r\n\r\nputting  themselves  on the line as anti-colonialists  to\r\n\r\nfight the Dutch and gain independence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Malayan side too, we were really one society.\r\n\r\nThe Jawi version of Utusan Melayu was first published not\r\n\r\nin  the peninsula but in Singapore in 1939 by Ambo Sooloh\r\n\r\nand Yusof Ishak.  They were members of Kesatuan Melayu, a\r\n\r\nquasi  political party for the Malays  -  not  Malays  in\r\n\r\nSingapore but Malays in Malaya including Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indians looked to India. Therefore, in 1942,\r\n\r\nafter the Japanese had come, the Indian National Army was\r\n\r\nformed  in  Singapore to support the Indian  independence\r\n\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

They either sided\r\n\r\nwith the Kuomintang or the CCP in China.  So, Sun Yat Sen\r\n\r\nvisited Singapore and Penang to raise funds for his  tong\r\n\r\nmeng  hui, for his revolutionary activities.  And so when\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese  took  over  and captured  Singapore,  they\r\n\r\nmassacred  the Chinese, not because of what  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ndid here, but because they saw these Singapore Chinese as\r\n\r\nhelping  the Chinese in China fight them, as indeed  they\r\n\r\ndid.   We  had  Mr  Tan Lark Sye, as Mr Low  Thia  Khiang\r\n\r\npointed  out,  but  Mr Tan Lark Sye  was  a  champion  of\r\n\r\nChinese culture and language, and he was motivated by the\r\n\r\nsuccess of Communist China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the different communities all had different\r\n\r\nobjectives  and loyalties, but none strove  for  or  were\r\n\r\nloyal  to  an  independent multi-racial,  multi-religious\r\n\r\nRepublic  of  Singapore.  In fact, such an idea  did  not\r\n\r\nexist and would have been dismissed as being ludicrous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have closed these chapters, more or less.\r\n\r\nThose loyalties and struggles have all become part of our\r\n\r\nhistory.   Yusof  Ishak became our first  President.   We\r\n\r\nhave an Indian National Army Memorial at Connaught Drive.\r\n\r\nThe  Sun  Yat Sen Villa has been restored by the  Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce and Industry.  And in  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nTechnological  University,  there  is  a  Tan  Lark   Sye\r\n\r\nProfessorship.   So, it is a phase of  our  history,  but\r\n\r\nthat was not Singapore yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you go back beyond that, then we inherit from the\r\n\r\ngreat Asian civilisations - the Chinese, the Indians, and\r\n\r\nthe  Malay civilisations - valuable and essential for us,\r\n\r\npart  of  our being, but not a complete basis for nation-building.   For example, Mr Gan Kim Yong cited the  story\r\n\r\nof  Yue  Fei  and Qin Hui.  I knew exactly  what  he  was\r\n\r\ntalking about.  He asked:  Is it still taught in schools?\r\n\r\nI  checked with my children.  Yes, it is still taught  in\r\n\r\nschools,  and to my relief, yes, they do know  about  the\r\n\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThese  are events 900 years ago in China, a dynasty  long\r\n\r\ngone  and  extinct, but still a powerful  impact  on  all\r\n\r\nChinese-educated  Chinese everywhere -  in  PRC,  Taiwan,\r\n\r\nHong Kong, Singapore, even, I am sure, in the West.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, I visited China. I had some MPs with me.\r\n\r\nAnd  we visited Hangzhou.  Hangzhou was the Southern Song\r\n\r\ncapital.  At that time, they called it Lin An.  And  that\r\n\r\nis  where  Yue Fei was murdered, and that was  where  his\r\n\r\ntemple is.  We visited his temple.  I wanted to visit it.\r\n\r\nOutside his temple, there are two statues of Qin Hui  and\r\n\r\nhis   wife,   kneeling,  asking   for   atonement.    And\r\n\r\ngenerations of Chinese have gone there to spit  on  these\r\n\r\ntwo  statues  out of utter contempt.  And  they  put  out\r\n\r\nsigns  there saying, \"Chinese Government says, `You shall\r\n\r\nnot  spit  down here anymore.'\", to no effect whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam  was  with  me, and he will  remember.   I  had\r\n\r\nChinese-educated members in my delegation and, I can tell\r\n\r\nyou,  I could see the powerful influence it had on  them.\r\n\r\nIt  was  an  emotional moment.  In fact, it was  a  noble\r\n\r\nideal  which  makes Chinese-educated Singaporeans  better\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, when I was small, I used to have at home\r\n\r\na  statue  of Yue Fei, having the words \"Jing  Zhong  Bao\r\n\r\nGuo\"  carved on his back by his mother.  It was given  to\r\n\r\nthe   Senior  Minister  by  an  admirer  on  one  of  his\r\n\r\nconstituency tours, and we had it at home for many years.\r\n\r\nI  studied  in Chinese school, and we memorised  all  the\r\n\r\npoems.  We  know the history, we know the story,  and  we\r\n\r\nidentify  with them.  We all did.  Liu Thai Ker, recently\r\n\r\nreporting on arts, on behalf of the ERC, quoted \"Ba  Qian\r\n\r\nLi  Lu,  Yun  He Yue\" - it comes back to the  same  root.\r\n\r\nBut,  unfortunately,  this is not  a  history  shared  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of  other races, or even by  most  English-educated Chinese.  So, it is valuable, but it does not go\r\n\r\nfar  enough.  Furthermore, regrettably, its impact on the\r\n\r\nyounger  generation will be less.  Yes, we  teach  it  in\r\n\r\nschool.  Yes, they know it.  I asked my children what did\r\n\r\nthey  know about it.  They said, \"Well, the mother carved\r\n\r\nsome  words on his back.\"  What does it all mean?   Where\r\n\r\ndoes it fit in?  Into what world view?  That is not the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsame.   I discussed this with George Yeo.  George Yeo  is\r\n\r\nmore  optimistic.   He says, \"Let them  learn  the  story\r\n\r\nfirst.   Maybe the significance will sink in  later.\"   I\r\n\r\nhope  so,  but I think that the generations are changing,\r\n\r\nand  we  have to move. Inherit this, but we have to  move\r\n\r\nforward and develop our own heroes over many, many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made English our common language. That is a\r\n\r\nmixed  blessing.  On the one hand, we bring the different\r\n\r\ncommunities  together; on the other hand, we  merge  into\r\n\r\nthe greater globalised world, the Internet world, and  we\r\n\r\nlose  our moorings unless we have some knowledge  of  our\r\n\r\nmother  tongues  and our roots.  It is  different.   Hong\r\n\r\nKong wants to keep Cantonese.  The Taiwanese want to keep\r\n\r\nMin  Nan Wei, not Guo Yu (the standard Mandarin),  to  be\r\n\r\ndifferent from the mainland, to have a separate Hong Kong\r\n\r\nand  separate  Taiwanese  identity.   We  sometimes  half\r\n\r\nseriously  ask  ourselves,  should  we  learn  to   speak\r\n\r\nSinglish?   But if we did, where is our future?   So,  we\r\n\r\nare back to English, and back to this dilemma.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our society is still evolving, still\r\n\r\nprogressing.  We are building something rare and precious\r\n\r\nhere.   It  is  a secure, stable society in an  uncertain\r\n\r\nworld.   It  is a harmonious, multi-racial society  in  a\r\n\r\nglobal environment where race and religion are rising and\r\n\r\ndisruptive forces.  It is an honest, clean and  efficient\r\n\r\nGovernment in a continent where corruption is an  endemic\r\n\r\nproblem.  It is a system based on equal opportunities and\r\n\r\nopen competition, and one which has delivered a high  and\r\n\r\nrising  standard  of  living for 3 million  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nSo,  I  think  it  is  precious and it offers  individual\r\n\r\nSingaporeans something special.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this environment, each one of us has the maximum\r\n\r\nopportunity to develop ourselves to the fullest,  and  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  difference to society, much more  than  anywhere\r\n\r\nelse  in the world.  At the lower end, Singaporeans enjoy\r\n\r\na  standard  of  living  better  than  nearly  any  other\r\n\r\ncountry, certainly better than China and India with their\r\n\r\nbillions, probably even better than the US with the  many\r\n\r\nhomeless\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  destitute.  In Singapore, you can be poor,  but  the\r\n\r\nchances  are  you have a roof over your head,  and  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  help available.  For all Singaporeans, rich  or\r\n\r\npoor,  there are exceptional opportunities - through  the\r\n\r\neducation  system,  through  the  scholarships  we  give,\r\n\r\nthrough  working with companies, big and  small,  through\r\n\r\npublic service, to develop ourselves and to be exposed to\r\n\r\nwhat is going on in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our small talent pool, we go to great\r\n\r\nlengths  to develop our people.  So, when we go overseas,\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  our people is not in doubt.   Many  top\r\n\r\nuniversities  in  the US and the UK have disproportionate\r\n\r\nnumbers of Singaporeans.  In fact, Stanford University in\r\n\r\ntheir  intake, of all the high schools in the world,  the\r\n\r\none  which sends the most students to Stanford every year\r\n\r\nis  Raffles Junior College (RJC).  So, our standards  are\r\n\r\nhigh,  and the opportunities are there.  It is  not  just\r\n\r\nfor  the few.  Recently, A*STAR gave a scholarship  to  a\r\n\r\nyoung  girl to do a PhD in the life sciences.  Her father\r\n\r\nis  a butcher.  In Singapore, if you have talent, in  one\r\n\r\ngeneration, you can make the leap, and \"Li Yu  Tiao  Long\r\n\r\nMen\", become a dragon!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think this is a cause well worthwhile fighting\r\n\r\nfor.   We  are beginning to develop a national  identity,\r\n\r\nbut this is far from complete.  But you see the signs  of\r\n\r\nit, sometimes in crisis, sometimes in moments that you do\r\n\r\nnot  notice.  When Michael Fay happened, Singaporeans  in\r\n\r\nthe  US were stout hearted.  They stood up, and they were\r\n\r\nnot  ashamed of themselves.  They were not afraid to say,\r\n\r\n\"I  am  a  Singaporean.  We are doing the  right  thing.\"\r\n\r\nWhen  we  send  SAF and Police officers overseas,  on  UN\r\n\r\nmissions,  peacekeeping operations,  they  do  us  proud.\r\n\r\nThey  are  multi-racial contingents.  They all  wear  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  flag  with pride, and they serve  with  pride.\r\n\r\nAnd  people know that, when you have Singaporeans in  the\r\n\r\ncontingent,  they do real work!  When East  Timor  became\r\n\r\nindependent,  one of the soldiers lowering  the  UN  flag\r\n\r\nbefore midnight, the man in front, blue beret,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nblue  uniform, but red and white Singapore  flag  on  his\r\n\r\nshoulder  patch.  Our hearts go with them, and they  mean\r\n\r\nsomething to all of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think we have a long journey. If you look up,\r\n\r\nit  is  far and steep.  If you look back, we have come  a\r\n\r\nlong way.  So, let us work together, year by year, and as\r\n\r\nwe  do so, we will strengthen our sense of nationhood and\r\n\r\nshared destiny.
