To attract\r\n\r\nforeign investment and to accelerate the pace  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  the Employment  Act  and  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Act of 1968  were  enacted.\r\n\r\nRapid   industrialisation  and  economic   growth\r\n\r\nensued  accompanied by a drastic fall in man-days\r\n\r\nlost  through unnecessary work stoppages. Whereas\r\n\r\nin  1967  a  total of 41,322 man-days  were  lost\r\n\r\nthrough  industrial strife, in  1968  a  loss  of\r\n\r\n11,447 man-days was recorded. In 1969, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfigure  fell  to  8,512 and,  in  1970,  it  fell\r\n\r\nfurther to 2,514.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the incidence of industrial\r\n\r\naccidents  exhibited  an  opposite  trend.  Fatal\r\n\r\naccidents rose annually from 68 in 1967 to 159 in\r\n\r\n1970,  while  permanent  disablement  cases  rose\r\n\r\npersistently  from 598 to 886  between  1967  and\r\n\r\n1970. Over the same period, man-days lost through\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents rose appreciably from 99,539\r\n\r\nin 1967 to 302,800 in 1970, an increase of around\r\n\r\n300  per  cent.  In our essentially materialistic\r\n\r\nsociety, some employers still think of industrial\r\n\r\naccidents only in terms of dollars and  cents.  I\r\n\r\nwould  remind  these  employers  that  there  are\r\n\r\neconomic  costs  to  industrial  accidents  which\r\n\r\nwould  include  loss  of output  of  the  victim,\r\n\r\nmonetary compensation, cost of damaged equipment,\r\n\r\nbottle-necks    in   production   and    training\r\n\r\nexpenditure  dissipated  through  accidents.  The\r\n\r\nmost  painful  aspect  of  industrial  accidents,\r\n\r\nhowever,  is  the  human suffering,  anguish  and\r\n\r\nmisery  caused  by loss of life and  health.  The\r\n\r\nloss  of  a  father, a husband, a loved  one  can\r\n\r\nnever  be compensated. To think otherwise  is  to\r\n\r\nbrutalise our conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of industrial safety and health has\r\n\r\nto  be tackled on many fronts. On the legislative\r\n\r\nfront,  the  existing Factories  Act  enacted  14\r\n\r\nyears   ago,   when   there   was   hardly    any\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industry of note, is  increasingly\r\n\r\nadequate  for  our present changed circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill seeks to revise and improve  upon  the\r\n\r\nFactories Act. Some relevant provisions  of  more\r\n\r\nadvanced  industrialised countries,  notably  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, the United States and Australia,\r\n\r\nhave been adopted with Xuitab1e modifications  to\r\n\r\nfit  our  local  environment. Both the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEmployers'  Federation and  the  National  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress were consulted, and some of their\r\n\r\nsuggestions have been incorporated in  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nAltogether, there are 42 amendments and additions\r\n\r\nto  the Factories Act. Consequently, it is neater\r\n\r\nto  present  a new Bill rather than amending  the\r\n\r\npresent  one.  As there are extensive  amendments\r\n\r\nand  in  view  of  the Bill's importance,  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommit   the   Bill  to  a  Select  Committee   of\r\n\r\nParliament so that views of all interested parties\r\n\r\ncan be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact with\r\n\r\namendments the Factories Act (Cap. 123 of the 1970\r\n\r\nRevised Edition) with a view to (a) improving  the\r\n\r\nhealth   and  safety  measures  anti  the  welfare\r\n\r\nfacilities  of persons employed in factories;  and\r\n\r\n(b)  ensuring a more stringent observance  of  the\r\n\r\nsafety  provisions  so as to reduce  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents. The main provisions of  this\r\n\r\nBill are detailed in the Explanatory Statement  to\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, however, to draw attention to some\r\n\r\nof  the  more important changes. Clause 94 of  the\r\n\r\nBill  empowers the Minister to appoint an Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil for Industrial Heath and Safety. Hitherto,\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  institutional arrangement  through\r\n\r\nwhich advice could be sought on matters pertaining\r\n\r\nto  industrial  health  and safety.  The  proposed\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Council  will have representatives  from\r\n\r\nmanagement,  trade unions and professional  bodies\r\n\r\nand   will,   therefore,  be  in  a  position   to\r\n\r\ncollectively  advise  the  Minister   on   matters\r\n\r\naffecting  safety,  health  and  welfare   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important innovation introduced by the Bill is the\r\n\r\nappointment of safety officers. Clause 64  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  requires certain factories to appoint safety\r\n\r\nofficers  solely  for  the purpose  of  exercising\r\n\r\ngeneral  safety supervision and for promoting  the\r\n\r\nsafe conduct of work. With the rapid growth of the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  factories in Singapore,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nphysically impossible for the Factory Inspectorate\r\n\r\nto  make regular and periodic inspections  on  all\r\n\r\nthese  factories. It would therefore be  necessary\r\n\r\nto   insist  that  management  police  their   own\r\n\r\nfactories  and  ensure  that  they  are  safe.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  factories employing 50 or more  persons\r\n\r\nwill  be  required to set up safety committees  to\r\n\r\npromote  health,  safety  and  welfare  in   their\r\n\r\nestablishments.   The   rationale   behind    this\r\n\r\nrequirement, which is set out in clause 65 of  the\r\n\r\nBill,  is  that both management and  labour  which\r\n\r\nwill be represented on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsafety   committee  can  jointly  contribute   and\r\n\r\nparticipate in the promotion of industrial safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the Government's anti-pollution\r\n\r\nprogramme,  the  occupier of  a  factory  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired   to  take  special  preventive  measures\r\n\r\nagainst the emission of harmful substances in  the\r\n\r\natmosphere.  He  will  also be  asked  to  provide\r\n\r\nappropriate  protection for employees  engaged  in\r\n\r\nhazardous processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 59 of the Bill will require the occupier\r\n\r\nto  substitute,  wherever possible,  less  harmful\r\n\r\nsubstances, processes or techniques for their more\r\n\r\nharmful  counterparts. \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also pays greater attention to workers engaged in occupations\r\n\r\ninvolving special risks to health. Under clause 62\r\n\r\nof  the Bill, the Minister can make regulations to\r\n\r\nrequire  medical  supervision and  examination  of\r\n\r\npersons  employed in work involving special  risks\r\n\r\nwhich  are set out in the Seventh Schedule of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  It has been established that nearly 65  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the  accidents have been caused  by  the\r\n\r\nnegligence or refusal on the part of the worker to\r\n\r\nuse  safety  appliances provided and  observe  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  stipulated. Clause 73 of the Bill  makes\r\n\r\nit   mandatory   for  employed  persons   to   use\r\n\r\nappliances   provided  and  the  safety   measures\r\n\r\ninstituted.   In  order,  therefore,   that   this\r\n\r\nprovision  is  strictly observed, it is  necessary\r\n\r\nthat the culprits are brought to book quickly  and\r\n\r\ndealt  with  effectively. Clause 81 of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  provides  that any  authorised  police\r\n\r\nofficer  or  Inspector  of  Factories  may  arrest\r\n\r\nwithout  any warrant any employed person  who  has\r\n\r\ncontravened clause 73 of the Bill and produce  him\r\n\r\nbefore  a  Magistrate's Court. Alternatively,  the\r\n\r\npolice officer or Inspector can straightaway issue\r\n\r\na  notice requiring the offender to attend at  the\r\n\r\nMagistrate Court to answer the charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill provides for an increase in the\r\n\r\nquantum  of fines or term of imprisonment  imposed\r\n\r\nfor  all  infringements of the Bill. For instance,\r\n\r\nunder  the  old  Factories Act,  the  penalty  for\r\n\r\noperating an unregistered factory was a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding $1.000 or a term\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  imprisonment not exceeding three months. Under\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, both the fine and term of imprisonment\r\n\r\nhave  been  increased  to $5,000  and  six  months\r\n\r\nrespectively. Similarly, under the Factories  Act,\r\n\r\nthe   penalty   for  an  employed   person   found\r\n\r\ninfringing the provisions of the Act is a fine not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $500  or  a  term of  imprisonment  not\r\n\r\nexceeding   three  months.  This  Bill   has   now\r\n\r\nincreased  the fine payable to a sum not exceeding\r\n\r\n$2,000.  Such  stiffening  of  the  penalties  for\r\n\r\ninfringements  of  the law is  clearly  needed  if\r\n\r\nemployers and workers are to be made to understand\r\n\r\nand  appreciate that Government means business  in\r\n\r\nits  efforts to reduce the high rate of industrial\r\n\r\naccidents occurring today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I rise in support of the Bill, in principle.\r\n\r\nThe  recent disaster at Jurong, resulting  in  the\r\n\r\ndeath  of  five workers and injuring a  number  of\r\n\r\nother workers, clearly underlines the need for the\r\n\r\nFactories  Bill which is now before the House.  It\r\n\r\nis pointed out in the Explanatory Statement to the\r\n\r\nBill   that   changes   made   to   the   existing\r\n\r\nlegislation,  which  are now incorporated  in  the\r\n\r\npresent Bill, are for the purpose of (a) improving\r\n\r\nthe  health  and safety measures and  the  welfare\r\n\r\nfacilities in the interest of persons employed  in\r\n\r\nfactories;  and  (h)  ensuring  a  more  stringent\r\n\r\nobservance  of  the  safety provisions  so  as  to\r\n\r\nreduce the rate of industrial accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I should like to inform the House\r\n\r\nthat  the  NTUC had been given the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nmake  representations to the  Ministry  of  Labour\r\n\r\nregarding the proposed amendments to the  existing\r\n\r\nFactories Act, which are incorporated in the  Bill\r\n\r\nbefore   the  House,  even  though  most  of   its\r\n\r\nrepresentations had been rejected by the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be readily apparent to Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  certain provisions of  the  Bill  are\r\n\r\nhighly technical and beyond the competence of  any\r\n\r\nlayman to comment upon without the benefit of  any\r\n\r\nprofessional advice or guidance. As I  have  said,\r\n\r\nthe Bill deals with topics on which it may not  be\r\n\r\npossible  for  any layman to make any intelligible\r\n\r\ncomment   on   them  without  the   necessary   or\r\n\r\nspecialised  knowledge and experience  or  without\r\n\r\nthe  help  of  a  person with such  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nexperience.  Even  though  the  NTUC   have   been\r\n\r\nhandicapped   to   a   certain   extent   by   not\r\n\r\nunderstanding   the  full  implications   of   the\r\n\r\nproposed Act, they have made a determined  attempt\r\n\r\nto  suggest  certain measures which, although  not\r\n\r\nincorporated in this Bill, may nevertheless confer\r\n\r\nadditional   protection   on   the   workers.   I,\r\n\r\ntherefore, welcome the decision of the Minister to\r\n\r\ncommit the Bill to a Select Committee. I would not\r\n\r\ngo beyond that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of this excellent Bill before this  House.\r\n\r\nStudents  of economic history are well aware  that\r\n\r\nindustrial  revolutions in the advanced  countries\r\n\r\nin  Britain, Europe, and elsewhere have  all  been\r\n\r\nachieved on the basis of the exploitation of cheap\r\n\r\nlabour  with  little or no consideration  for  the\r\n\r\nhuman factor - the worker, his work and his living\r\n\r\nenvironment.  As  a late corner in  the  field  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, we can, and rightly too,  learn\r\n\r\nfrom the mistakes of others. Had Karl Marx been an\r\n\r\nobserver in Singapore today, instead of in Britain\r\n\r\nin  the 19th century, he would not have found  the\r\n\r\nmaterial  to write his Das Kapital, and  we  might\r\n\r\nnot  see  the Communist regimes that  we  do  find\r\n\r\naround  us  today. A free enterprise  capitalistic\r\n\r\nsystem can work in economic terms, but it can work\r\n\r\nin  humane  terms  only if there is  a  government\r\n\r\nwhich  is  socialistic in outlook and which  cares\r\n\r\nfor   the   distribution  of   income,   for   the\r\n\r\nenvironment in which the people have to live,  and\r\n\r\nfor the health, safety and welfare of the workers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have such a government. I\r\n\r\nhope  the  people of Singapore fully realise  this\r\n\r\nfact,  and  continue to support such a government.\r\n\r\nBecause  in our context, with the leeway  that  we\r\n\r\nare  giving  to free enterprise to an  essentially\r\n\r\ncapitalistic economy, a government which does  not\r\n\r\nhave a socialistic outlook will mean a society  in\r\n\r\nwhich  there  is a lot of injustice and  a  highly\r\n\r\nskewed income distribution, a society with all the\r\n\r\nelements  of  instability and  all  the  seeds  of\r\n\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  have only one small point to raise which I hope\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken into consideration by  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. This concerns the question of  training\r\n\r\ngiven   to  inexperienced  workers.  In  a  recent\r\n\r\nstatement  to the House, the Minister  for  Labour\r\n\r\ndid  say that one of the major causes of accidents\r\n\r\nis  the  lack of proper training given to workers.\r\n\r\nBut I am rather surprised to see that clause 28 of\r\n\r\nthe   Bill,  which  is  the  particular  provision\r\n\r\ndealing with training of inexperienced workers, is\r\n\r\nnot  made  more  explicit so as to  enable  easier\r\n\r\nenforcement.   It  merely  says  that   sufficient\r\n\r\ntraining  should be given. To what degree  is  the\r\n\r\ntraining \"sufficient\"? I think it is going to give\r\n\r\nrise  to  lots of arguments. I should have thought\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  be  easier to  impose  a  minimum\r\n\r\ntraining  period or, if that is not  possible,  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  provision whereby the Minister  would  be\r\n\r\nable  to  prescribe from time to  time  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  in  this regard. A  useful  guideline\r\n\r\ncould  be that more hazardous processes should  be\r\n\r\nsubjected to a certain minimum period of training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Factories Bill be committed to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and\r\n\r\nthe following Members:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Abdul Aziz Karim, Member for Kallang,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chua Sian Chin, Minister for Health,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Guan Onn, Member for River Valley,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Yong Nguan, Member for Crawford,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Pang Boon, Minister for Labour,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seah Mui Kok, Member for Bukit Ho.
