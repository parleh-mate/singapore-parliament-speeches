Member to two facts  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  which the particular  problem  he  has\r\n\r\nraised should be viewed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that the Singapore Government is\r\n\r\nonly  one  of  the  shareholders of  the  Malaysia-Singapore Airlines.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that the Company is run on a\r\n\r\nstrictly  commercial basis and that recruitment  of\r\n\r\nstaff should have relevance to the requirements and\r\n\r\nefficiency  of  the  enterprise.  In  the   airline\r\n\r\nbusiness,  the  company and its employees  have  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  firms  and  passengers  not  only  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  but from all over the world. The  medium\r\n\r\nof communication has to be one of the international\r\n\r\nlanguages - in our particular case, English - if  the\r\n\r\nM.S.A. is   to  hold  its  own  in  an  extremely\r\n\r\ncompetitive  business.  Therefore,  there   is   no\r\n\r\nquestion   of   discrimination  between   different\r\n\r\nlanguage  groups in the matter of recruitment.  The\r\n\r\ncriteria  is whether the candidate has the specific\r\n\r\nqualifications demanded by the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the information of the hon.

Conversely,\r\n\r\na  number  of English-educated staff know  Chinese,\r\n\r\nMalay  or Tamil as well. Since it is essential,  in\r\n\r\nthe  very  nature  of  the  airline  business,  for\r\n\r\ncandidates  to know English from whatever  language\r\n\r\nstream   they  may  come,  they  should   have   no\r\n\r\ndifficulty   reading   vacancy   announcements   in\r\n\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CIVIL SERVICE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Dismissal of Divisions III and IV officers on account of indebtedness)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Parliament Elections Ordinance,  Chapter\r\n\r\n53,  to  provide for the preparation of  the  first\r\n\r\nregisters  of electors from the register maintained\r\n\r\nby the Commissioner of National Registration and to\r\n\r\ninclude  in such electoral registers the  names  of\r\n\r\nall  entitled persons who were on the first day  of\r\n\r\nJuly   1967  citizens  of  Singapore  and  to  whom\r\n\r\nidentity cards were issued.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present registers of electors were first\r\n\r\ncompiled  nine years ago in 1958. In the past,  any\r\n\r\nperson  who possessed an identity card showing  his\r\n\r\nplace of birth as Singapore, and who was ordinarily\r\n\r\nresident  in Singapore on the first day of February\r\n\r\nin  any year and was not less than 21 years of  age\r\n\r\non  the  first  day  of  July  of  that  year,  was\r\n\r\nautomatically   included  in   the   registers   of\r\n\r\nelectors. In the recent re-registration of persons,\r\n\r\nit  was discovered that a number of identity  cards\r\n\r\nhad  been forged. Further, a number of persons with\r\n\r\nidentity  cards  showing their place  of  birth  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  were not given citizen's identity  cards\r\n\r\ndue to insufficient proof of Singapore citizenship.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, fresh registers of electors have\r\n\r\nto   be  compiled.  The  fresh  registers  will  be\r\n\r\ncompiled from the records of citizens maintained by\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner of National Registration and will\r\n\r\ninclude  only  those entitled persons  who  on  the\r\n\r\nfirst  day  of July 1967 were citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  to whom identity cards were issued. This would\r\n\r\nmean  that  those  persons  whose  names  had  been\r\n\r\nexpunged  from the registers since 1959  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  relating  to compulsory  voting,  other\r\n\r\nthan  those  who  are now dead  or  have  left  the\r\n\r\ncountry, will have their names restored in the  new\r\n\r\nregisters,  as  they will be in possession  of  new\r\n\r\ncitizen's identity cards. It is hoped that with the\r\n\r\nrestoration  of  their names to  the  registers  of\r\n\r\nvoters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout penalty, these citizens will exercise their\r\n\r\ncivic duty of voting in the elections in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the provision remains in the Ordinance\r\n\r\nto  expunge the names of electors who fail to  vote\r\n\r\nat  any election, and to restore their names to the\r\n\r\nregisters of electors only after payment of a  fine\r\n\r\nof   $5.   If   this  measure  proves   inadequate,\r\n\r\nGovernment   will   consider  amendments   to   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance   to   remove   certain   privileges   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  For example, it may be provided  that\r\n\r\nanybody  seeking  a Housing Board  flat  or  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  relief  or  a place in  school  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren, may in future have to show that they have\r\n\r\nperformed  their  civic  duty  of  voting  in   the\r\n\r\nelections  and  keeping their names  alive  in  the\r\n\r\nelectoral registers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the revision of the\r\n\r\nregisters in each year following the year  1967  to\r\n\r\nbe  completed  before the 31st day of  December  in\r\n\r\nthat  year.  Past  experience has  shown  that  the\r\n\r\ndeadline  of  15th September for the completion  of\r\n\r\nthe  annual revision of the electoral registers  is\r\n\r\nimpracticable. The proposed amendment will  obviate\r\n\r\nthe  necessity  for reference to  be  made  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  each year for permission to  certify  the\r\n\r\nregisters  on or before the 31st December  of  that\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will also make it an offence for any\r\n\r\nperson  to  dissuade electors from  voting  between\r\n\r\nNomination Day and Polling Day at any elections. At\r\n\r\npresent  such dissuasion is an offence only  if  it\r\n\r\ntakes  place on Polling Day. The amendment provides\r\n\r\nthe  same  penalty for the offence as that provided\r\n\r\nin the Singapore Parliament Elections Ordinance for\r\n\r\ncanvassing on Polling Day. Power is given to police\r\n\r\nofficers to enter and search any premises or  place\r\n\r\nin  which  they believe that the offence  is  being\r\n\r\ncommitted, and to arrest without warrant any person\r\n\r\ncommitting the offence in their presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the Bukit Merah by-election in January 1966, members of a certain\r\n\r\npolitical  Party went from house to  house  in  the\r\n\r\nconstituency between Nomination Day and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolling  Day attempting to persuade the  electorate\r\n\r\nto  cast  blank  or spoilt votes.

It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, necessary that provision should be  made\r\n\r\nto   ensure   that  every  citizen  is  given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  casting his vote without  fear  or\r\n\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the repeal of the Registration of Persons\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1955,  and  its  substitution  by   the\r\n\r\nNational Registration Act, 1965, the Bill seeks  to\r\n\r\namend  all  references in the Singapore  Parliament\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance relating to the Registration of\r\n\r\nPersons  Ordinance, 1955, to that of  the  National\r\n\r\nRegistration   Act,  1965,  and  to  make   certain\r\n\r\namendments connected with the identity cards issued\r\n\r\nunder the National Registration Act of 1965.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to revise some of\r\n\r\nthe  forms in, and to make certain other amendments\r\n\r\nto,  the  Singapore Parliament Elections  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwith  a  view  to  achieving  greater  clarity  and\r\n\r\nexplicitness  in  the  expressions  used   in   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance    and   thus   providing   for    better\r\n\r\nadministration of the provisions of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I fully support  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nParliament Elections (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, undoubtedly the introduction of this Bill at\r\n\r\nthe previous sitting has been most timely.

Due to major housing developments and  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal and large population shifts, the population\r\n\r\nratios  in the 51 constituencies have become  quite\r\n\r\ndisproportionate, and to ensure that there is  more\r\n\r\nequal  representation throughout all constituencies\r\n\r\nin  the  Republic,  the 10 largest  constituencies,\r\n\r\nwith  an  electorate of more than  18,000  electors\r\n\r\neach,  have  been  subdivided,  resulting  in   the\r\n\r\ncreation of 8 new constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding to merge Southern Islands with the\r\n\r\nmainland  electoral  divisions  of  Jurong,   Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang  and Telok Blangah, the Government  had  in\r\n\r\nmind  the  desirability of eliminating the tendency\r\n\r\nfor   the  Islands  to  develop  into  an  isolated\r\n\r\nconstituency.  This  division  has   a   very   low\r\n\r\nelectorate, namely, 4,273 electors, and this number\r\n\r\nis  likely to dwindle when more people shift to the\r\n\r\ncity.  These Islands would have a better chance  of\r\n\r\nachieving  a  quicker  rate  of  development  after\r\n\r\nmerger  with  the more developed constituencies  of\r\n\r\nJurong, Pasir Panjang and Telok Blangah, as in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of the islands of Pulau Tekong and Pulau Ubin\r\n\r\nin the constituency of Changi.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of electoral divisions will be\r\n\r\nincreased  from the present 51 to 58. The Singapore\r\n\r\nParliament  Elections Ordinance (Cap. 53)  provides\r\n\r\nthat  each  electoral  division  shall  return  one\r\n\r\nMember to serve in Parliament. The Constitution  of\r\n\r\nSingapore stipulates a Parliamentary membership  of\r\n\r\n51   until   other  provision  is  made   by   law.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,  it  is necessary for  a  Bill  to  be\r\n\r\npassed to provide for an increase in the number  of\r\n\r\nelected Members to Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Membership Bill provides that so much of clause (1) of Article 23 of the Constitution of Singapore as prescribes a limit of 51 on the number of elected Members shall cease to have effect, and that as from the time of the election of Members to serve in Parliament at the\r\n\r\nnext  general  election, and hereafter  until  such\r\n\r\ntime  as other provision is made by law, Parliament\r\n\r\nshall consist of 58 elected Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also provides that, for the purposes of\r\n\r\nthe  next general election, power is given for  all\r\n\r\nthings  to  be done under the Singapore  Parliament\r\n\r\nElections   Ordinance  as  if  Parliament   already\r\n\r\nconsisted of 58 elected Members. This would  enable\r\n\r\nvarious  matters to be carried out for the purposes\r\n\r\nof  the  next  general elections; for example,  the\r\n\r\nnaming   and  delineation  of  the  boundaries   of\r\n\r\nelectoral divisions by notification in the  Gazette\r\n\r\nunder   section  8  of  the  Singapore   Parliament\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance, and the exhibition of the 1967\r\n\r\nregisters  of electors for public inspection  under\r\n\r\nsection 10 of the same Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in my opinion, the White\r\n\r\nPaper  which  was introduced in this Parliament  on\r\n\r\n31st  October last is very fitting in  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Singapore. Although Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nsmall   country,  the  number  of  inhabitants   is\r\n\r\nproportionately large, consisting of various  races\r\n\r\nand religions. I feel that the demarcation of every\r\n\r\nconstituency should not be based on the size of the\r\n\r\narea but on the number of inhabitants.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore has become the centre of attention\r\n\r\nof  many  countries, it can be said that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  be likened to a beautiful woman who has caused\r\n\r\nothers  to  be  mad about her and people  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries  have  left  their  homes  to  stay  here\r\n\r\nforever.  One  of  the  responsibilities   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   of   Singapore  is  to   give   social\r\n\r\nassistance,  and as such constituencies  should  be\r\n\r\nchanged to increase the Parliamentary membership in\r\n\r\norder to balance the number of inhabitants with the\r\n\r\nconstituencies from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Member of Parliament does not only\r\n\r\nrepresent his constituency but also the inhabitants\r\n\r\nof  that  constituency. Also, he has not  only  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  attend  sittings  of Parliament  but  also  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to help solve whatever  difficulties\r\n\r\nhis constituents are faced with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain political Parties which use\r\n\r\nconstituencies as a stepping stone to obtain  seats\r\n\r\nfor  their candidates in Parliament where they  can\r\n\r\nboast  and behave like heroes but meantime ignoring\r\n\r\nthe  fate  of their constituents. This had happened\r\n\r\nbefore the P.A.P. came to power, especially in  the\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai  constituency. I  believe  that  the\r\n\r\ncandidates of these political parties who were  not\r\n\r\nelected  to  Parliament in the last  elections  are\r\n\r\nrather anxious about their future because of  these\r\n\r\nchanges.  They  know  that they  do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the people and therefore their  future\r\n\r\nmight be worse off than what they were in the  last\r\n\r\nelections.  That  is why all this while  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  saying  all sorts of things  to  confuse  the\r\n\r\nminds   of  the  people,  particularly  after   the\r\n\r\nannouncement  of this White Paper on  31st  October\r\n\r\nlast.  The tactics which they have carried out  are\r\n\r\nthe  same  as those of the Malayan Communist  Party\r\n\r\nduring  the Emergency, and it is possible  that  we\r\n\r\nhere would also be anxious if the Malayan Communist\r\n\r\nParty were also present in Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the good of the people, we should be\r\n\r\nfirm in facing this situation. Considering the ever-\r\n\r\nincreasing  number of our population, the  increase\r\n\r\nof  Parliamentary constituencies is also necessary.\r\n\r\nThis   is  to  improve  the  work  of  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament   in  their  respective  constituencies.\r\n\r\nConstituencies  in  Singapore  are  different  from\r\n\r\nthose in Malaysia which consist of jungle areas and\r\n\r\ninhabited  by  wild animals, with  very  few  human\r\n\r\nbeings living there. But in Singapore the situation\r\n\r\nis different because our constituencies are full of\r\n\r\nhousing estates accommodating all races. This is  a\r\n\r\nbig  problem for Singapore and should be  borne  in\r\n\r\nmind  by the people and the political Parties. They\r\n\r\nshould  not  work  for personal gain  but  for  the\r\n\r\nprosperity and safety of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the recent changes in Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe increase in population as time goes by, I\r\n\r\nsupport this White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in the past few years because of  the\r\n\r\nincrease in industrial development and the  renewal\r\n\r\nof  the urban areas, there has been an increase  or\r\n\r\nshift  in population in our country. In some places\r\n\r\nthere  are  less people because they have  gone  to\r\n\r\nother  housing estates, and in some areas,  because\r\n\r\nof  the former demarcation of constituencies, there\r\n\r\nis  some inequality. Now we are going to divide the\r\n\r\nState  into 58 constituencies. It is proper  to  do\r\n\r\nso.  The division into 58 constituencies will  make\r\n\r\nour  work as Members of Parliament easier and  more\r\n\r\neffective.  We must know that Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nare  elected  not  just  for politics.  Their  main\r\n\r\npurpose  is  to  serve  the people.  Otherwise  the\r\n\r\npeople    will   not   support   them.   So    more\r\n\r\nconstituencies will mean that we have more  Members\r\n\r\nof  Parliament to serve the people better.  Someone\r\n\r\nhas  asked, why is it necessary to divide the State\r\n\r\ninto   58   constituencies?  Is  it  for  political\r\n\r\ninterests?  Or for what interest? What  we  say  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  division  into 58 constituencies  is  to\r\n\r\nenable  the Members of Parliament serve the  people\r\n\r\nbetter.  For  the  past few years the  standard  of\r\n\r\npolitical  consciousness of  the  people  has  been\r\n\r\nraised under the present Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone has said that having more constituencies\r\n\r\nwill   mean   more  expenditure.  Our  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  get the lowest allowance in the  world.\r\n\r\nTherefore, an increase of seven Members will mean a\r\n\r\nvery  little extra expenditure. Therefore,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat,    in    addition   to   the   increase    in\r\n\r\nconstituencies, the number of Ministers should also\r\n\r\nincrease so that they will serve the people  better\r\n\r\nand more efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I fully\r\n\r\nsupport the Parliamentary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembership   Bill.  The  history  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy in our country is not long. It is only 12\r\n\r\nyears.  Since 1955 there have been only  local  and\r\n\r\npartial  elections. But judging  from  the  healthy\r\n\r\nmanifestation  of  progress  of  our  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, we are not less democratic compared with\r\n\r\nany other country. The success of our parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is due to two basic factors. First,  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  have a rather high standard of  political\r\n\r\nconsciousness and they understand the true  meaning\r\n\r\nof democracy. Second, in recent years, the Party to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  belong  has  made great  achievements  in\r\n\r\nnation-building and in various other spheres. As  a\r\n\r\nresult, the voters have more faith in democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the increase in\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  I feel that it  is  very  apt  and\r\n\r\nproper. As I have just pointed out, there has  been\r\n\r\na great increase in our population, and accordingly\r\n\r\nthere  are  more  voters. Judging  by  our  present\r\n\r\nachievements  in  housing  and  other   fields   of\r\n\r\nactivity,  we  have  made great changes  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears.  At  the moment, we have quite a  number  of\r\n\r\nsatellite  towns,  such  as  Queenstown,  Aljunied,\r\n\r\nKallang,  and  Toa Payoh. Hence, the population  in\r\n\r\ncertain  areas  has  increased.  So  if  today  our\r\n\r\nconstituencies have the same boundaries, will  that\r\n\r\nbe  in keeping with our present changes? In certain\r\n\r\nconstituencies  there  will  be  more  voters.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, in Queenstown at present there  are  more\r\n\r\nthan 100,000 residents, but the number of voters in\r\n\r\nthe last elections was 40,000. In Mountbatten there\r\n\r\nwere  28,000  voters. In Delta  there  were  26,000\r\n\r\nvoters.  Because  of the shift in population,  some\r\n\r\nconstituencies  will  have  more  voters,   whereas\r\n\r\nothers  will  have less. For instance, in  Geylang,\r\n\r\nCrawford  and Havelock, the population  is  crowded\r\n\r\nthere.  If  we do not make any adjustments  in  the\r\n\r\nboundaries  of the constituencies, we  may  not  be\r\n\r\nable to serve the people better.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ours is a non-Communist democratic country.\r\n\r\nWe  have  an enlightened policy of equal  treatment\r\n\r\nfor  all  streams of education and all races.  This\r\n\r\npolicy  has  welded our races together and  is  the\r\n\r\nbasic factor in our nation-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  believe we will soon set a very good example  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East   Asia  as  a  democratic,  multi-racial\r\n\r\ncountry. We will also set a leading example to  all\r\n\r\nthe multi-racial countries in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now consider certain views expressed\r\n\r\nby  some  of the Opposition Parties. I think  their\r\n\r\nviews  are not constructive. For instance, U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nhave  said that the Government has not allowed them\r\n\r\nany  time  to express their opinions. This  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue, because in a democratic country everybody has\r\n\r\nthe  right  of  free speech. Whether or  not  their\r\n\r\nviews  will  be  accepted by  the  Government  will\r\n\r\ndepend on whether they are constructive and whether\r\n\r\nthey  meet  the wishes of the people. For instance,\r\n\r\ncertain  political parties want us to do away  with\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. They do not  want  general\r\n\r\nelections. Does it mean that we are bound to accept\r\n\r\ntheir  anti-national policy or views? I  would  ask\r\n\r\nthem  whether they have the interest of the  people\r\n\r\nat  heart,  or whether they are just making  noises\r\n\r\nbefore   the  general  elections,  and   when   the\r\n\r\nelections  are over they will take to their  heels.\r\n\r\nThey  will close up their party offices. Our people\r\n\r\nknow these adventurers very well.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Chinese Party has suggested five\r\n\r\npoints,  one of which is to ask when the Government\r\n\r\nwill  hold general elections and also to give  them\r\n\r\nsufficient  time to prepare themselves. This  would\r\n\r\nset the people guessing as to their true intention.\r\n\r\nBut  these people should not forget their past evil\r\n\r\nrecords which are well known. The people know  they\r\n\r\nare  adventurers. They cannot fool all  the  people\r\n\r\nall the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Alliance Party, this is a Party\r\n\r\nthat  was  discarded by the electorate in the  1959\r\n\r\nand 1963 elections. So their policy is not new. One\r\n\r\nof  their  requests is to prolong  the  period  for\r\n\r\ncampaigning  in the general elections.  They  think\r\n\r\nthat  by  this they can get more people to  support\r\n\r\nthem.  I  would say that they are day-dreaming.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that the support which a political party  can\r\n\r\nget from the voters depends on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  they have served the people well and  have\r\n\r\nan  efficient  democratic system. In  other  words,\r\n\r\nbasically  the question is whether they  have  come\r\n\r\nclose  to the people and have helped them to  solve\r\n\r\ntheir problems and difficulties. If they have  done\r\n\r\nso, then when the general elections come along, the\r\n\r\npeople  will  vote for them on the basis  of  their\r\n\r\nrecord. If certain political parties normally close\r\n\r\nup their offices for the most part of the year, and\r\n\r\nin  their branches not anyone of their members  can\r\n\r\nbe  found, how can they expect anybody to vote  for\r\n\r\nthem? Naturally the masses will cast their votes in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  way as to wipe off such political  rubbish\r\n\r\nfrom  the political scene, such as the Lim Yew Hock\r\n\r\nregime and the anti-national elements -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This  is  something  that  should  not  be\r\n\r\ndelayed.  As  a  responsible  Government,  we  must\r\n\r\nintroduce  this  Bill at the present  juncture.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  allow  the  present situation  to  continue\r\n\r\nbecause it will lead to chaos. If we are not  doing\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are now doing, then it will mean that  we\r\n\r\nare  negligent. So any criticism of the  change  in\r\n\r\nthe  constituencies is baseless and  malicious.  On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, I think this action on the part  of\r\n\r\nthe Government is most judicious and farsighted.

Of course, Mr Speaker, I have  been\r\n\r\nworking  hard  for  the  last  four  years  in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency, i.e. Southern Islands, and I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  next elections, I will  be  returned\r\n\r\nunopposed. Even if there is opposition, I believe I\r\n\r\ncan  beat  my  opponent with a majority  vote.  But\r\n\r\nbecause  this constituency has been deleted,  I  am\r\n\r\nobliged  to reiterate my stand that I fully support\r\n\r\nthe Bill which has been tabled by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member of Parliament will feel ashamed if he\r\n\r\nrepresents  only 4,000 voters while other  Members,\r\n\r\nlike  the Member for Queenstown, may represent more\r\n\r\nthan  40,000  voters.

Hitherto, the  inhabitants\r\n\r\nwho  occupy 22 islands of the Southern Islands have\r\n\r\nbeen looked after by only one Member of Parliament,\r\n\r\nbut  in  future they will be looked after by  three\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament. When I bring up the problems\r\n\r\nof  the Southern Islanders, I find it difficult  at\r\n\r\ntimes to gain support for\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  reason  that  I  am  the only  representative.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  future, if one Member  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nputs  forward his proposals, he is sure to get  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the other two Members of Parliament  who\r\n\r\nrepresent the Southern Islands. Therefore,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  it  is more to the advantage of the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslanders  to  be represented by three  Members  of Parliament  instead of one member of Parliament  as at  present. Although I may not be representing the Southern Islands in future, these three Members  of Parliament  will have to look after the 22  islands which  are  inhabited by a small number of  voters.\r\n\r\nThe  expenses  are  high for  only  one  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament  to  look after the Southern  Islanders,\r\n\r\nbut  it will be to their greater advantage if  they\r\n\r\nare looked after by three Members of Parliament.  I\r\n\r\nam  of the opinion that if the Southern Islands are\r\n\r\nnot  merged  with the mainland constituencies,  the\r\n\r\nresidents  will  be neglected especially  if  their\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament does not have good financial\r\n\r\nmeans.  The  reason  is  that  he  will  incur   an\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  about  $30  for  a  visit  to  the\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands, and hon. Members can estimate how\r\n\r\nmuch  expenses will have to be incurred by a Member\r\n\r\nof Parliament who pays visits 7 or 8 times a month.\r\n\r\nIf  a Member of Parliament who gets an allowance of\r\n\r\n$500  a  month  were to incur expenditure  for  the\r\n\r\npurchase of petrol and an outboard motor and  other\r\n\r\nincidental  expenses, it would mean that  he  would\r\n\r\nnot be able to visit his constituents regularly, as\r\n\r\nevidenced  by the fact that my two predecessors  in\r\n\r\nthe  Southern Islands had failed to discharge their\r\n\r\nduties. For that reason, people have been asking me\r\n\r\nabout  my  stand. Once again, I reiterate  my  full\r\n\r\nsupport  for the White Paper in the hope  that  the\r\n\r\nresidents  of the Southern Islands will  be  better\r\n\r\nlooked after after the next elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, we will not compromise  in  our\r\n\r\nstruggle.

However,   that    particular\r\n\r\nconstituency  has been deleted.

Although  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  has been tabled and we  will  approve\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, I feel that Kampong Ubi is not a proper\r\n\r\nname in our progressive world and that it should be\r\n\r\nrenamed,  for  instance, Geylang Bahru  or  Geylang\r\n\r\nMaju, because it is not our intension to recall the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increase in the number of Members of\r\n\r\nParliament  to  58  poses a  question.  First,  the\r\n\r\npeople   will  think  that  there  are  eight   new\r\n\r\nconstituencies  to be won by political  leaders  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I would like to express my view that the\r\n\r\nprogress  achieved in our Republic has necessitated\r\n\r\nan increase in the membership of Parliament. We are\r\n\r\nwell  aware  that we will have to face  trials  and\r\n\r\ntribulations  not  only from political  Parties  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   but   also  from   outside   political\r\n\r\nideologies, in order to fulfil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of  our  people.

This is required because of the repeal of\r\n\r\nthe  combined  income provisions  which  previously\r\n\r\noperated  between  Singapore  and  the  States   of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 limits the right of election to adopt\r\n\r\nthe  written  down value of plant and machinery  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  controlled companies to cases  where\r\n\r\nboth the buyer and seller are chargeable under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  in  Singapore.  Otherwise,  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndanger  of excessive depreciation where one of  the\r\n\r\nparties  is  not  within the  tax  jurisdiction  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.

The intent is to make it\r\n\r\nmore  attractive for non-residents to invest monies\r\n\r\nin Singapore banks.

W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill now before the House seeks to amend\r\n\r\nsection  21  of  the Minor Offences Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\namendment has been rendered necessary by reason  of\r\n\r\nthe  inadequacy of the present penalties  contained\r\n\r\nin  the  Minor Offences Ordinance for such offences\r\n\r\nas riotous, disorderly or indecent behaviour within\r\n\r\nthe  precincts of a court house. Hon. Members  will\r\n\r\nremember that a few months ago section 368  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal   Procedure  Code  was  amended  enhancing\r\n\r\npenalties  which  may be imposed  for  contempt  of\r\n\r\ncourt where such contempt is committed in the  face\r\n\r\nof  the  court.  The  very same  reasons  that  had\r\n\r\nrendered necessary the amendment of section 368  of\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal Procedure Code also made it necessary\r\n\r\nfor  Government to seek an amendment to section  21\r\n\r\nof  the Minor Offences Ordinance. This section,  as\r\n\r\nit  now stands, would make it an offence punishable\r\n\r\nwith  a  mere $20 at the most in the first instance\r\n\r\nfor  such  riotous behaviour in court that  is  not\r\n\r\ncommitted in the presence of a magistrate and would\r\n\r\naccordingly escape the provisions of section 368 of\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal Procedure Code. Technically speaking,\r\n\r\ntherefore, as the law now stands, riotous behaviour\r\n\r\neven  in court before the magistrate comes  on  the\r\n\r\nBench can only be punished under section 2] of  the\r\n\r\nMinor  Offences Ordinance which carries a fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding $20. This, as hon. Members will agree, is\r\n\r\nwholly out of proportion to the seriousness of such\r\n\r\nan  offence. Indeed, the inadequacy of the  penalty\r\n\r\nin this respect has been somewhat underlined in the\r\n\r\nrecent  disturbances  in  the  magistrates'  courts\r\n\r\nwhere  the  accused  and their  friends  and  their\r\n\r\nsupporters   have  caused  riotous  and  disorderly\r\n\r\nbehaviour  within the compound of  the  courts.  In\r\n\r\norder that a sufficient\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeterrent may be imposed for such transgressions of\r\n\r\nthe law, it has been thought appropriate that there\r\n\r\nshould  be corresponding increases in the penalties\r\n\r\nthat  may be imposed for such offences as for those\r\n\r\nwhere  the misbehaviour is in the face of the court\r\n\r\nitself.  Accordingly, therefore, it is now provided\r\n\r\nin this Bill to increase the penalties, in the case\r\n\r\nof  a  first conviction for riotous, disorderly  or\r\n\r\nindecent behaviour in the places specified  in  the\r\n\r\nBill, to a fine not exceeding $250. The alternative\r\n\r\npunishment   of   imprisonment   has   also    been\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly  enhanced to a term  not  exceeding\r\n\r\none  month,  and  in  the  case  of  a  second   or\r\n\r\nsubsequent   conviction,  the   maximum   fine   is\r\n\r\nincreased   to  a  sum  not  exceeding   $500   and\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21 as it now stands combines the offence\r\n\r\nof drunkenness and disorderly behaviour as a result\r\n\r\nof  inebriety  with  disorderly behaviour  that  is\r\n\r\nintentional   and   calculated   to   bring   about\r\n\r\ndisrespect  and contempt for the administration  of\r\n\r\nthe  law.  And the amendment that is to be  brought\r\n\r\nabout  to  the  law accordingly seeks  to  separate\r\n\r\nthese acts from the remainder of the provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  present  section  21  of  the  Minor  Offences\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and  it  is  only  where  the  riotous,\r\n\r\ndisorderly  and indecent behaviour takes  place  in\r\n\r\nany public road or in any public place or place  of\r\n\r\npublic  amusement  or resort, or in  the  immediate\r\n\r\nvicinity  of  or  in  any court or  public  office,\r\n\r\npolice  station  or  place  of  worship,  that  the\r\n\r\noffence  would  attract  such  enhanced  punishment\r\n\r\ncontemplated by this Bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill can be said to go hand in hand\r\n\r\nwith  the  amendment to section 368 of the Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code in increasing penalties  for  those\r\n\r\nconvicted  of  offences  committed  with  the  sole\r\n\r\npurpose of expressing their contempt and disrespect\r\n\r\nfor the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\njust  want to ask the Minister to clarify clause  3\r\n\r\nwith regard to the new section 2lB. \"Any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson  ...\".

If he is handling the case  in  court,\r\n\r\nthen, of course, it is up to the magistrate to deal\r\n\r\nwith  him  if  he misbehaves, under the  powers  of\r\n\r\ncontempt  of  court for contempt committed  in  the\r\n\r\nface of the court, which powers the magistrate has.\r\n\r\nEven   before  the  recent  amendments   to   these\r\n\r\nOrdinances,  any lawyer misbehaving in court  could\r\n\r\nbe   convicted  for  contempt  of  court   by   the\r\n\r\nmagistrate or the judge hearing the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A DATE TO BE FIXED</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn to a\r\n\r\ndate to be fixed.\" -[Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Thirteen minutes past Five o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19671114/19671114-HA-0260401.pdf\"\">APPENDIX TO ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION NO.9 (Cols. 372-4) (Cols 0401-0402) </a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
